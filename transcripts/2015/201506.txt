201506	0	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Good afternoon, everyone.	5	5
201506	1	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	I would like to, again, welcome First Vice Presidents Holcomb and Prichard, who are representing Dallas and Philadelphia.	5	5
201506	2	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	My understanding is that Patrick Harker will take office as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on July 1.	5	5
201506	3	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	So this is likely to be Blake’s last meeting, and I want to thank you very much for representing Philadelphia today and at the most recent two meetings.	5	5
201506	4	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	I’d also like to welcome back Brian Madigan, who has been selected through notation vote to serve as Secretary of the FOMC for a term that began on June 4.	5	5
201506	5	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	As I mentioned at the previous meeting, Brian will have oversight responsibility for the FOMC Secretariat and will be playing a key role in the production of minutes and transcripts of the FOMC meetings.	5	5
201506	6	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	These are duties that Brian has ably performed in the past and is uniquely qualified to fulfill.	5	5
201506	7	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	And, obviously, Brian is no stranger to this room.	5	5
201506	8	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, I’d like to also welcome Michael Strine to his first FOMC meeting.	5	5
201506	9	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Michael, who currently serves as an executive vice president and head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Corporate Group, will become the first vice president of the New York Fed on July 1 and will also become an alternate voter of this Committee at that point.	5	5
201506	10	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	So, Brian and Michael, welcome, and we look forward to working with both of you.	5	5
201506	11	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s turn now to our agenda, and the first item is going to be the Desk report.	5	5
201506	12	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	But before we do that, we’re going to be considering this first topic in a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board, as usual.	5	5
201506	13	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	So I need a motion to close the Board meeting.	5	5
201506	14	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	5	5
201506	15	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	5	5
201506	16	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	5	5
201506	17	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	And now, let me call on Simon to deliver the Desk report.	61	6
201506	18	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201506	19	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period, the 10-year Treasury yield increased 39 basis points, moving in tandem with a more pronounced 67 basis point rise in the 10-year German yield.	61	6
201506	20	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The moves were concentrated in longer-dated forwards and occurred after German interest rates had reached historically low levels, as shown in the top-left panel of your first exhibit.	61	6
201506	21	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	This rise in nominal forward rates largely retraced the declines that began after last year’s Jackson Hole speech by ECB President Draghi and continued through the start of QE in the euro area earlier this year.	61	6
201506	22	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The size and speed of the moves in long rates were similar to the so-called taper tantrum in 2013.	61	6
201506	23	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	However, as I’ll discuss in a bit, these moves had more limited knock-on effects across financial markets.	61	6
201506	24	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Recent US data releases suggested to contacts that disappointing Q1 economic growth may have been largely due to transitory factors, but the data generally were not seen as sufficiently strong to prompt the Committee to start the normalization process at the June or July meetings.	61	6
201506	25	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	On average, buy-side and primary dealer respondents to the Desk’s June surveys assigned a near-zero probability to liftoff occurring at this meeting and reduced the odds assigned to the July meeting, as shown in the top-right panel.	61	6
201506	26	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The average probability assigned to liftoff in September or later increased for both groups.	61	6
201506	27	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The vast majority of respondents to our surveys put the probability of a liftoff in September somewhere between 30 and 70 percent.	61	6
201506	28	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Beyond liftoff, survey respondents’ modal and mean expectations for the level of the federal funds rate over the next several years were little changed.	61	6
201506	29	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The market-implied path of the federal funds rate in the very near term was also little changed over the period, though the path two to three years ahead shifted up slightly, as shown in the middle-left panel.	61	6
201506	30	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The path remains far lower and flatter than at the end of 2013 and is substantially below the median of the March SEP federal funds rate projections for 2016 and 2017.	61	6
201506	31	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Desk survey respondents expect the means of the rate projections to decline in the June SEP; they also expect the dispersion of projections across FOMC participants to narrow.	61	6
201506	32	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The upward shift in the market-implied path, alongside relatively steady survey expectations, suggests that the rise in market rates over the period was due to an increase in near-dated term premiums.	61	6
201506	33	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Indeed, the difference between the end-2017 market-implied rate and the mean PDF-implied federal funds rate expectation obtained from the Desk surveys—a measure of the term premium at this horizon— became less negative over the intermeeting period for both buy- and sell-side respondents, as shown in the middle-right panel.	61	6
201506	34	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The increase in these near-dated term premiums may stem from reduced concerns over negative shocks and from higher interest rates abroad.	61	6
201506	35	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The Desk surveys suggest that the rise in longer-dated US Treasury yields was also due to increased term premiums, as shown in the bottom-left panel.	61	6
201506	36	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	In particular, when asked to decompose the 36 basis point change in the 10-year rate between April 28 and June 3, survey respondents on average ascribed 23 basis points, or 63 percent of the move, to a rise in the term premium, which, in their qualitative comments, was linked to spillover from European markets.	61	6
201506	37	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	On average, respondents attributed 9 basis points, or one-quarter of the move, to higher expected average real policy rates.	61	6
201506	38	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	There was only a minimal attribution given to a higher expected average inflation rate.	61	6
201506	39	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The staff’s term-structure models also attribute most of the move to movements in term premiums.	61	6
201506	40	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the left half of the bottom-right panel, nearly all of the 42 basis point rise in US forward nominal rates over the period came from higher real yields, with forward measures of domestic inflation compensation relatively little changed.	61	6
201506	41	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The right half of the panel shows that real rates also accounted for most of the move in the euro-area rates.	61	6
201506	42	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Inflation compensation accounted for a slightly larger portion of the European rate moves in comparison to the United States, as recent higher euro-area realized core inflation reportedly reduced the odds some assigned to very low longer-run inflation outcomes in the region.	61	6
201506	43	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Market participants attributed the rise in euro-area real rates largely to higher term premiums.	61	6
201506	44	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Market participants highlighted a number of technical factors that likely exacerbated the rise in euro-area yields.	61	6
201506	45	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Many noted a reduction or reversal of extended long positions by momentum-driven leveraged investors, whose assets under management have grown substantially over recent years.	61	6
201506	46	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	In addition, higher euro-area interest rate volatility may have caused investors who rely on value-at-risk models to pare back their holdings.	61	6
201506	47	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The top-left panel of your next exhibit shows this volatility using the 30-day average intraday trading range on the 10-year bund yield, which rose to its highest levels in three years.	61	6
201506	48	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Over the period, Draghi noted that market participants “should get used to periods of higher volatility,” and contacts reported that this stated comfort with recent moves contributed to further upward pressure on rates.	61	6
201506	49	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	During the sharp rate moves and since the onset of the ECB’s asset purchases, anecdotal reports from Desk counterparties indicate that liquidity conditions in the euro-area fixed-income markets have deteriorated, though this is not borne out in liquidity metrics we typically monitor.	61	6
201506	50	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	However, the rise in interest rates has decreased the amount of European securities trading with negative yields and alleviated some associated challenges for investors.	61	6
201506	51	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Indeed, there are a greater number of positive-yielding securities available for reinvestment from SOMA’s maturing euro-denominated bond holdings.	61	6
201506	52	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The sharp rise in longer-term rates over the period has drawn comparisons with the taper tantrum of 2013, with some even labeling the selloff in euro-area rates as the “bund tantrum.”	61	6
201506	53	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	However, the deterioration in risk sentiment evidenced across a multitude of global risk assets has been much less acute, as shown in the top-right panel.	61	6
201506	54	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The disparate reaction of risk assets may be a result of a more limited shift in US monetary policy expectations, a smaller increase in US interest rates, and the backdrop of ECB and BOJ asset purchases continuing well into 2016.	61	6
201506	55	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	In addition, valuations and positioning were reportedly not as extended across credit and emerging market assets as we know, albeit ex post, they were in 2013, which may account for some of the differences.	61	6
201506	56	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Although the most severe risks to emerging market asset prices associated with a sharp increase in US term premiums—risks discussed in the recent QS report—have thus far not materialized, vulnerabilities remain, especially if macroeconomic fundamentals in troubled emerging markets weaken further.	61	6
201506	57	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Emerging market currencies depreciated against the dollar over the period, also shown in the middle-left panel, but to a lesser extent than following the taper tantrum.	61	6
201506	58	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	On net, the DXY dollar index was little changed, though there were significant movements in some major currency pairs.	61	6
201506	59	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The foreign exchange value of the euro continued to display very little reaction to the precarious situation in Greece, and spillover to other euro-area assets remained limited.	61	6
201506	60	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	For example, as shown in the middle-right panel, Italian spreads to German rates remained relatively stable amidst Greek bank deposit outflows, although this and other peripheral-country spreads have widened over the most recent few trading sessions.	61	6
201506	61	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Greek deposit outflows have been offset by increases in Eurosystem emergency liquidity assistance.	61	6
201506	62	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Greece’s inability to reach an agreement on a new program with its creditors could lead it not to deliver payments to the IMF at the end of the month and payments to the ECB over the following two months.	61	6
201506	63	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	A payment delay or default could, in turn, lead the ECB to cut off or severely limit ELA to Greek banks, resulting in bank holidays, capital controls, and the potential for an exit from the euro area.	61	6
201506	64	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	However, most market participants still expect Greece and its creditors to reach a resolution that would allow it to remain in the euro area.	61	6
201506	65	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Beth Anne will discuss the Greek situation further in her briefing.	61	6
201506	66	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	I should note that last Wednesday, the ECB saw a small bid at its seven-day US dollar liquidity auction, the first since mid-September 2014.	61	6
201506	67	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Outside Greece, another possible risk in markets relates to the dramatic rise in Chinese equity prices, which, despite the country’s slowing growth, increased 13 percent over the period and are nearly 150 percent higher over the past year.	61	6
201506	68	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Market participants frequently cite expectations for continued accommodative policies by the People’s Bank of China as the dominant driver of the rise in Chinese shares.	61	6
201506	69	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The timing of recent monetary policy easing actions is indicated by the yellow diamonds in the panel in the bottom-left.	61	6
201506	70	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The rally over the second quarter of this year has also overlapped with a significant drop in Chinese money market interest rates, which reduced the cost of leverage via equity margin financing, providing a tailwind to the equity market.	61	6
201506	71	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Margin trading is widely used by Chinese retail investors, and there has been a substantial increase in margin financing activity as a percent of the substantially higher market capitalization, as shown in the bottom-right panel.	61	6
201506	72	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Market participants have cited the use of margin financing as a contributor to the equity rally, which has led to a rapid expansion of earnings multiples.	61	6
201506	73	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Higher valuations and increased retail equity market leverage may increase risks associated with any future sharp—and possibly disorderly—equity market correction, especially reflecting wealth and confidence effects.	61	6
201506	74	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	That said, many have noted that the effect of any potential correction in mainland equity markets may be limited outside greater China.	61	6
201506	75	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Your next two exhibits focus on money markets and Desk operations.	61	6
201506	76	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The Desk’s ON RRP operations continued to provide a soft floor under both secured and unsecured short-term interest rates, as shown in the top-left panel of the third exhibit.	61	6
201506	77	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Relative to the prior intermeeting period, secured rates, on average, printed only modestly lower, while unsecured rates, such as the federal funds, were little changed.	61	6
201506	78	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Overall take-up in ON RRP operations was similar to previous periods and is shown in the top-right panel.	61	6
201506	79	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Reverse repos conducted with foreign official institutions—known as the “foreign RP pool”—remained around $150 billion over the intermeeting period.	61	6
201506	80	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The foreign RP pool is one possible destination for the runoff in nonoperational deposits held by foreign central banks, as discussed in a box in the Tealbook, Book B.	61	6
201506	81	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The Board of Governors continued its periodic testing of the TDF with a 14-day operation on May 21 and a 7-day operation on May 28.	61	6
201506	82	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The results were in line with the staff’s expectations, and market participants did not report any price action resulting from the testing.	61	6
201506	83	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The Desk’s announcement on May 20 of term RRP operations spanning the June quarter-end did not garner significant market attention.	61	6
201506	84	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Market participants generally suggested that, similar to the March quarter-end, the provision of “at least $200 billion” in term RRPs should leave sufficient headroom in the ON RRP over the quarter-end date.	61	6
201506	85	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	As noted in the Desk’s statement, additional details regarding the amount offered and the maximum offering rates will be announced on June 22.	61	6
201506	86	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	These proposed details are summarized in your middle-left panel, under the assumption that the Committee does not increase the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.	61	6
201506	87	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Unlike the $75 billion and $125 billion offerings in March, for the June quarter-end, the $200 billion available will be equally split across the two operations.	61	6
201506	88	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Based on our experience with the term RRPs over the March quarter-end, we feel this change could better balance demand across the two operations.	61	6
201506	89	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Further, the staff proposes setting the max offering rate at a smaller spread of 3 basis points to the prevailing ON RRP rate.	61	6
201506	90	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	This should help inform whether demand is driven more by the interest rate spread or the certainty of quarter-end supply.	61	6
201506	91	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Also, these operations will include our first test of a two-day term operation, which should give us information on how close a substitute a two-day term is to overnight operations.	61	6
201506	92	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Operationally, the staff is ready to implement ON RRPs and, if necessary, term RRPs and TDFs to support the IOER rate for liftoff at any time deemed appropriate by the Committee.	61	6
201506	93	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	As part of the planning process for the start of the normalization of policy, we would also like to update you on plans for the post-liftoff daily briefing process.	61	6
201506	94	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	These plans are designed to ensure the Committee receives timely updates on market conditions and is provided the opportunity to make adjustments to its policy tools, if necessary.	61	6
201506	95	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	As detailed in the memo circulated prior to the meeting and summarized in your middle-right panel, the staff proposes holding daily briefings from 2:00 to 3:00 pm for a period following liftoff.	61	6
201506	96	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	If a change to the parameters of the policy tools is needed, or if the Committee would like to hold a discussion on the configuration of the various policy tools, the daily briefing will be converted to an FOMC meeting upon notification by the FOMC Secretariat.	61	6
201506	97	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	If changes were made to the configuration of policy tools, a public announcement would be made at 4:30 pm on the day of any such decision.	61	6
201506	98	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Thomas will discuss the format of announcements about normalization tools in his briefing.	61	6
201506	99	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	As described in another memo to the Committee ahead of this meeting, the Desk also plans to extend the duration of our daily morning operations briefing to allow for broader coverage and discussion of Desk operations and related market developments.	61	6
201506	100	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	These extended morning briefings would likely continue for longer than the daily staff briefings to the Committee.	61	6
201506	101	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	I would like to highlight a couple of developments that could affect the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.	61	6
201506	102	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	On May 6, the Treasury—as part of its quarterly refunding announcement—indicated it would institute a minimum cash balance of roughly $150 billion in order to cover, on average, one week of outflows from the Treasury General Account, known as the TGA.	61	6
201506	103	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-left panel, this would represent a material increase in the TGA balance relative to historical levels.	61	6
201506	104	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Recall that an increase in the TGA reduces reserves in the banking system dollar for dollar.	61	6
201506	105	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The Treasury did not specify how it would fund this increase, though most observers believe it will occur through higher bill issuance.	61	6
201506	106	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Increases in net bill supply have been inversely correlated with take-up in the ON RRP facility, so a higher TGA could be associated with lower ON RRP usage.	61	6
201506	107	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	However, if the Treasury exhausts its extraordinary measures to remain below the debt ceiling in the future, it will likely need to limit net new bill issuance and reduce its cash balance below the $150 billion minimum.	61	6
201506	108	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	A factor with the potential to have a significant effect on the asset side of the Fed’s balance sheet is the maturity of Treasury securities starting in early 2016, summarized in the bottom-right panel.	61	6
201506	109	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Treasury reinvestments have not been of material size for some time, in view of the maturity profile of the Treasury portfolio resulting from the MEP.	61	6
201506	110	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	This issue has become somewhat more prominent in market discussions as the expected timing of normalization has shifted out, leaving open the possibility that sizable Treasury maturities could occur while the current reinvestment policy is still in place.	61	6
201506	111	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Maturities of Treasury securities in the first quarter of 2016 will total $62 billion.	61	6
201506	112	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	In accordance with the Committee’s current reinvestment policy, the Desk would reinvest maturing Treasuries in new securities issued via auctions that settle on the day the maturing funds are received.	61	6
201506	113	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Specifically, as summarized in the top-left panel of your final exhibit, according to this policy, the principal amount received from maturing securities is reinvested on a noncompetitive basis and allocated in proportion to the issue sizes of all qualifying new securities.	61	6
201506	114	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	With regard to agency securities, the Desk continues to reinvest principal payments on holdings of agency debt and MBS into agency MBS through secondary market purchases, which continue to go smoothly.	61	6
201506	115	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Finally, we’d like to update you on the proposed changes to the calculation of the effective federal funds rate.	61	6
201506	116	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The Desk is proposing to change the calculation methodology to a volume-weighted median concurrent with the data-source cutover to the FR 2420 in the first part of 2016.	61	6
201506	117	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The same calculation methodology would be used for the new overnight bank funding rate.	61	6
201506	118	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Recall, at the most recent meeting, we discussed the advantages of moving to a volume-weighted median—namely, the improvement in the representativeness and robustness of the effective rate.	61	6
201506	119	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The detailed case for making these changes was summarized in both a memo to the Committee and a technical memo to research directors.	61	6
201506	120	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	As noted in a memo sent to the FOMC last week, if the Committee is comfortable with the change to a volume-weighted median, our proposed plan to communicate these changes, outlined in your top-right panel, would be to include a summary of the proposed change and the associated discussion in the June meeting minutes as well as to release a Desk statement and a technical note with data and analysis supporting the change on the New York Fed website shortly thereafter.	61	6
201506	121	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	This would serve to enhance the public’s understanding of the rationale for transitioning to the FR 2420 data collection and changing the calculation methodology.	61	6
201506	122	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	We will plan to return to the Committee later this year to outline specific implementation features, such as a detailed timeline, a list of additional disclosures, and an overview of practices to align with IOSCO principles for financial benchmarks.	61	6
201506	123	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201506	124	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	That concludes my prepared remarks.	61	6
201506	125	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, Simon.	61	6
201506	126	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for Simon?	62	6
201506	127	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	62	6
201506	128	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Your chart 18 on the SOMA Treasury security maturities is interesting.	62	6
201506	129	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	And so, your philosophy on duration as more and more of these securities are coming due—what is the conscious decision for the duration we’re aiming at for the overall SOMA portfolio?	62	6
201506	130	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Is there a target that we’re hitting?	62	6
201506	131	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	We haven’t had much of a discussion of the duration of our portfolio, and I’m wondering whether at some point it might be worthwhile discussing.	62	6
201506	132	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	When we do rollovers, it really depends on Treasury issuance.	62	6
201506	133	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	We roll over into everything they issue except bills.	62	6
201506	134	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	So we would be adding securities to the portfolio of between 60 and 70 months, depending on what Treasury does.	62	6
201506	135	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	They might move up above 70, depending on how they assess their split between bills and notes and other issues that they have.	62	6
201506	136	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	But at the point when we’re reinvesting, we are not actively targeting any duration limit from the Desk.	62	6
201506	137	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	We’re basically just accepting what the Treasury puts out in terms of its duration.	62	6
201506	138	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	So the debt management strategy of the Treasury is determining the duration of our portfolio going forward?	62	6
201506	139	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	No, it’s determining the duration of what we reinvest in.	62	6
201506	140	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Because we have a very large amount of Treasuries right now, it won’t have a material effect on the duration of the portfolio in 2016, if we continue doing reinvestments.	62	6
201506	141	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Remember that what we are reinvesting has also got zero duration at that point.	62	6
201506	142	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	So reinvestment will then move up the duration in a mechanical sense, but it’s not as if that’s going to affect the previous thought that we had of holding long-duration assets.	62	6
201506	143	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	That is still there.	62	6
201506	144	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	62	6
201506	145	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions for Simon?	62	6
201506	146	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Dudley.	62	6
201506	147	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I just want to clarify.	62	6
201506	148	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	On panel 17, the Treasury increases its cash balance and that increases the supply of risk-free assets and reduces the demand for overnight RRP.	62	6
201506	149	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	If the debt limit becomes binding, then Treasury would draw down its cash balance.	62	6
201506	150	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	And so the demand for our overnight RRP could go up at that point in time.	62	6
201506	151	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Is that a reasonable inference?	62	6
201506	152	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	I think there is definitely that direct effect.	62	6
201506	153	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	And we know that, if this was happening in 2016, there are lots of other changes in money markets.	62	6
201506	154	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	There’s another issue that we haven’t really faced yet.	62	6
201506	155	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Treasury bills are viewed as very safe assets, and there’s only one exception to that:  when Congress and the Treasury can’t really agree on whether to raise the debt limit.	62	6
201506	156	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	And then you could see other events happen.	62	6
201506	157	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	We saw this in 2013—a little bit of aversion to Treasury bills that would mature in the so-called red zone.	62	6
201506	158	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	And the overnight RRP might be more attractive.	62	6
201506	159	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	It’s possible.	62	6
201506	160	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Again, if you look at the holders of Treasury bills, a large amount of the holders are foreign central banks.	62	6
201506	161	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	So it would depend on their behavior.	62	6
201506	162	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	They also have the foreign pool as another option at that point.	62	6
201506	163	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	What I’m trying to drive at is, it seems like it creates a little bit more uncertainty about what the demand for the overnight RRP would be as you go through this period.	62	6
201506	164	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	There is definitely uncertainty on the operations side for us, always, when the debt limit comes up.	62	6
201506	165	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	I think the larger uncertainty is going through the debt limit again and what that does for views of US policymaking and the Treasury market in general.	62	6
201506	166	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Sure, okay.	62	6
201506	167	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	62	6
201506	168	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions for Simon?	62	6
201506	169	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62	6
201506	170	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, let me just mention that Simon has offered a plan for moving to a calculation of the federal funds rate from the new FR 2420 data collection and simultaneously implementing this new volume-weighted median to calculate the federal funds rate.	62	6
201506	171	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	I just want to ask around the room whether people are comfortable with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York moving ahead with this plan.	62	6
201506	172	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Do you want us to raise our hands?	62	6
201506	173	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	62	6
201506	174	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Raise your hands if you’re comfortable.	62	6
201506	175	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, great.	62	6
201506	176	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Anybody uncomfortable for any reason and want to comment?	62	6
201506	177	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62	6
201506	178	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, very good.	62	6
201506	179	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	For our next topic, let me call on Susan McLaughlin, who is going to discuss the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s counterparty framework review.	96	9
201506	180	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201506	181	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	I’ll be referring to the exhibit titled “Desk Counterparty Framework.”	96	9
201506	182	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	Over the past year and a half, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Board staff members have been engaged in a review of the Desk’s counterparty framework across all of the Desk’s operations in US and foreign financial markets.	96	9
201506	183	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	In the past, such reviews tended to occur separately for domestic and foreign operations.	96	9
201506	184	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	This is the first time the staff have reviewed the frameworks on a comprehensive basis rather than an operation-specific one.	96	9
201506	185	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	The staff’s recommendation is that such a review be conducted every three years from now on, in order to think less reactively and more strategically about how to manage Desk counterparties.	96	9
201506	186	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	The staff would consult with the Committee after each of these reviews.	96	9
201506	187	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	As noted in the memo that you received, a key theme of the review was that financial markets are evolving in response to technological and regulatory developments, and that the structure of the markets in which the Desk operates could change in ways that may benefit from a larger and/or more diverse set of counterparties in the longer term.	96	9
201506	188	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	It is too early at this point to forecast how the structure of these markets will evolve or what changes to the Desk’s counterparty framework will be required to adapt to these changes.	96	9
201506	189	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	But the staff’s review also suggested a number of enhancements that could be made in the near term to strengthen and harmonize the management of counterparties across all of the Desk’s operations.	96	9
201506	190	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	Many of the recommendations concern ways to harmonize and refine internal administration of counterparty relationships across all Desk operations and are already under way.	96	9
201506	191	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	These changes are listed in the third paragraph of exhibit 1.	96	9
201506	192	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	Additionally, the staff’s review raised two policy questions that represent near- term opportunities for additional changes to the Desk’s counterparty practices.	96	9
201506	193	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	These questions are shown in the fourth paragraph of exhibit 1.	96	9
201506	194	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	One question is whether to consider publishing lists of counterparties for FX and/or foreign reserves management operations, as is done currently for domestic OMO counterparties.	96	9
201506	195	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	As you can see in panel 2 of exhibit 2, there are currently some inconsistencies in the practices across counterparty types.	96	9
201506	196	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	While most central banks do not make information about their FX or foreign reserves management counterparties public, the Federal Reserve already discloses some of this information through the quarterly post-trade disclosures under Dodd- Frank, just as is done for OMO counterparties.	96	9
201506	197	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	However, while the lists of primary dealers and expanded reverse repo counterparties are public, the Desk does not currently publish a list of FX or foreign reserves management counterparties.	96	9
201506	198	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	Publishing counterparty lists for foreign operations would increase transparency by informing the public of all of the firms eligible for these operations and not just those firms the Desk has dealt with in a given quarter.	96	9
201506	199	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	However, publishing a list could also create the perception of a Federal Reserve imprimatur with regard to the firms listed, as seems to have occurred in the case of primary dealers.	96	9
201506	200	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	This imprimatur carries costs as well as benefits in managing these relationships.	96	9
201506	201	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	For open market operations, the benefit of publication clearly outweighs the cost.	96	9
201506	202	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	The Desk relies on primary dealers for a variety of services beyond trade execution in support of its mandate, such as FR 2004 reporting, TMPG best practice adherence, and survey responses about policy expectations before each meeting.	96	9
201506	203	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	Primary dealers are willing to serve these needs because they value the status they obtain from being listed as a primary dealer.	96	9
201506	204	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	However, the Federal Reserve plays a more limited role in the foreign financial markets in which the Desk operates and does not require the same range of services from its counterparties in those markets.	96	9
201506	205	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	So the case for providing the same type of public recognition to these counterparties through publication of a list may not exist or may be stronger, perhaps, for policy operations like FX intervention than for portfolio maintenance activities such as reinvestment of Eurobond proceeds.	96	9
201506	206	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	A second question is whether there is value to be gained by revising the eligibility requirements for primary dealers to allow for a modest expansion of the list.	96	9
201506	207	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	As is shown in panel 3 of exhibit 2, the number of primary dealers has risen modestly since the recent financial crisis but is still near the low end of the historical range.	96	9
201506	208	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	The staff believes that modifying the eligibility requirements to allow a wider range of broker- dealers and banks that make markets in government securities to be considered for primary dealer status is worthwhile, as it can potentially increase operational coverage and enhance trade execution.	96	9
201506	209	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	It will also increase coverage for Treasury auctions.	96	9
201506	210	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	Additionally, the staff views a modest expansion of the primary dealer list as an informative and low-cost initial step toward the broader counterparty framework that might be required in the future as a result of changes in market structure.	96	9
201506	211	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	It would allow the staff to build on the learning to date from the Treasury and MBS pilots the Desk has recently conducted with very small firms and could be accomplished within the scope of the existing technology infrastructure.	96	9
201506	212	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	The staff would like to pursue further work on these two questions and develop proposals to bring to the Committee later this year, along with drafts of the revised counterparty policies that would reflect the proposed changes.	96	9
201506	213	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	A tentative plan would be to publish revised counterparty policies in tandem with the announcement of the conclusion of the mortgage operations pilot shortly after year-end.	96	9
201506	214	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	The staff would greatly appreciate any feedback you may have, either now or in the coming weeks, on the questions outlined at the bottom of exhibit 1.	96	9
201506	215	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	In particular, do you agree that the staff should develop recommendations on these two issues for the Committee’s consideration later this year?	96	9
201506	216	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	Do you have reactions to the questions we have laid out?	96	9
201506	217	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	Are there other issues that you would like the staff to consider?	96	9
201506	218	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	Are you comfortable with the general timeline and approach laid out for communicating to the public in the event that the staff’s recommendations are adopted?	96	9
201506	219	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201506	220	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	That concludes my prepared remarks.	96	9
201506	221	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201506	222	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Questions or comments?	96	9
201506	223	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	96	9
201506	224	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	If we broadened the eligibility requirements, there is a presumption that there would be more primary dealers.	96	9
201506	225	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	But that implies that someone actually would want to take advantage of it.	96	9
201506	226	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So what do we know about that?	96	9
201506	227	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	That’s true.	96	9
201506	228	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	We’ve actually just gotten some data in the past couple of days from the SEC on broker-dealers that we are going to be looking at to try to identify which broker-dealers are actually participants in the Treasury market.	96	9
201506	229	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	We probably can’t predict who wants to step forward, and we know that some firms in the past who were eligible did not.	96	9
201506	230	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	But we’ll at least be able to dimension a bit more what a given reduction in the capital requirement, for example, might entail in terms of potential additional counterparties.	96	9
201506	231	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions or comments?	96	9
201506	232	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	96	9
201506	233	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Susan, when you say that there may be an evolution in Treasury market structure in a direction that would suggest we need more primary dealers, what are you really thinking about there?	96	9
201506	234	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	There could be a number of ways that the markets could evolve.	96	9
201506	235	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	One could be that large firms are paring back their market-making activity, and smaller firms come in and pick up some of that activity.	96	9
201506	236	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	It could be that different types of firms beyond the traditional bank and broker-dealer realm we deal with come into the market and do more market making.	96	9
201506	237	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	I think there are a range of potential outcomes that we could see, and depending on the way that the market could evolve, that would have implications for what we might need to do to adapt our counterparty framework.	96	9
201506	238	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	I think one way of trying to think about this is that we’ve been very reactive in the past.	96	9
201506	239	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	And because of the way trading happens and the end-to-end processing we would like to put in place, we need to plan more in advance for changes and have more flexibility.	96	9
201506	240	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	96	9
201506	241	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	I have two questions.	96	9
201506	242	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Where did the $150 million dollar capital requirement come from?	96	9
201506	243	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	And just how does that relate to our exposure to them?	96	9
201506	244	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	How well is it grounded in what we actually need by way of assurance for the transaction?	96	9
201506	245	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	The $150 million requirement that we currently have was put in place in early 2010.	96	9
201506	246	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	And I think it was, to be frank, a result of negotiation and experience with the existing set of firms that we were dealing with.	96	9
201506	247	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	We don’t really view that necessarily as a credit-risk mitigant for counterparties, it’s really more a sign of the development of a firm and the capabilities that it has to operate internal compliance, risk management, et cetera.	96	9
201506	248	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	So I think the exposures that we can have to dealers on a given day are very large relative to that capital.	96	9
201506	249	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	That’s true.	96	9
201506	250	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	I think that, if I remember correctly, it was looking at the 30-year Treasury, which has the most price variation in it.	96	9
201506	251	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	And, really, there’s a replacement cost in the operations, and we’ve been thinking through what that would mean for us.	96	9
201506	252	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	I think if you look at the history of the primary dealers, there’s always been a feeling that we want some level of capital, and that links into market presence and their ability to execute well for us.	96	9
201506	253	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	I think one of the things we’d like to do is come back and have more detail about some of the risk tolerance there.	96	9
201506	254	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	And I think, back in 2010—this might not have been prominent in people’s minds, but—the risk tolerance really belongs to the people around this table.	96	9
201506	255	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	So giving me some clarity as to what we’re willing to accept would be helpful.	96	9
201506	256	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	This connects to this issue you alluded to in the memo in which there’s this sort of imprimatur, but we’re not explicitly examining for the type of maturity and risk- management capabilities you’re talking about.	96	9
201506	257	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	And there was a time—I think it was in the ’90s, the memo said—when a dealer failed, and we said, “Well, no, it’s not our responsibility to check on their safety and soundness.”	96	9
201506	258	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	But what you’re telling me is, we really do care.	96	9
201506	259	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	We do care.	96	9
201506	260	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	But we don’t want to look as if we’re responsible and we’re actually doing due diligence.	96	9
201506	261	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	That seems like a really uncomfortable spot.	96	9
201506	262	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	We either need to be in or out on this, it seems to me.	96	9
201506	263	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	I think we will be coming back to you to try and hone that down.	96	9
201506	264	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	There is some tension between the role of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as a direct counterparty and what you might want the risk tolerance to be.	96	9
201506	265	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	But any way we can make clear that we’re not there in a supervisory role or a safety-and-soundness role would be great.	96	9
201506	266	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Again, if you look at the history that we produced, this has been a constant tension, because the mere fact that we’re the counterparty and we have to do some due diligence because these are counterparties in a business relationship, but at the same time we’re a central bank with supervisory policies—it’s very hard to separate that, both in the mind of the public and in the mind of the firms that we deal with.	96	9
201506	267	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	What do you mean?	96	9
201506	268	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	What do we need to separate?	96	9
201506	269	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Safety and soundness is analogous to counterparty risk evaluation.	96	9
201506	270	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	It’s a similar activity.	96	9
201506	271	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Why do we have to separate that?	96	9
201506	272	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Can you explain that a little bit more?	96	9
201506	273	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Well, they’re the same things.	96	9
201506	274	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	We’re checking on their capability in managing risk.	96	9
201506	275	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	So I don’t see why we have to separate them.	96	9
201506	276	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	I think we’re on the same page here.	96	9
201506	277	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	We need to really evaluate what we need to do, and if we need to do the due diligence, then maybe you should evaluate what that would involve.	96	9
201506	278	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	96	9
201506	279	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	But, just to be clear, the Desk does not check the safety and soundness of our counterparties in the way a supervisor would.	96	9
201506	280	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	We’re looking at them as a business counterparty, which is a very different thing.	96	9
201506	281	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	I think safety and soundness is what we expect the supervisors to do.	96	9
201506	282	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	We want our counterparties to deliver on the operations that we have with them in an efficient way.	96	9
201506	283	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	And that’s it.	96	9
201506	284	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	96	9
201506	285	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	But that’s a certain level of due diligence.	96	9
201506	286	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	It is, but it’s a business due diligence, just as any private counterparty would do.	96	9
201506	287	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	I have another question, Madam Chair.	96	9
201506	288	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	When you’re a primary dealer, you agree to participate pro rata in Treasury auctions.	96	9
201506	289	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	Yes.	96	9
201506	290	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Does it seem attractive to give thought in this process to separating the qualifications for being a counterparty to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the SOMA from being a Treasury counterparty—because that requirement could be an impediment, conceivably, to broadening the pool.	96	9
201506	291	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	And I’ll just generally say, I think broadening the pool of participants makes sense.	96	9
201506	292	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	I think it would help push back against this unfortunate notion out there that we have a cozy club of counterparties.	96	9
201506	293	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	But what would it be like to separate that out and say, “All right, for us, you don’t need this pro rata thing, but to be a Treasury auction participant, you need this pro rata thing, and that’s a separate category”?	96	9
201506	294	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	I think that’s actually an issue that we talked a lot about early in the review.	96	9
201506	295	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	Why should this role as fiscal agent bind?	96	9
201506	296	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	I think in the past they’ve worked together because the firms that were particularly desirable for the Treasury as auction participants were also particularly desirable for us.	96	9
201506	297	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	As you say, that could diverge a bit in the future depending on what happens with respect to market structure.	96	9
201506	298	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	I think, though, we have this role as fiscal agent.	96	9
201506	299	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	We’ve got a very clear indication from the Treasury that they would like us to continue to play this role for them.	96	9
201506	300	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	We have a lot of expertise on capital markets, we have these relationships with primary dealers, and we have a well-developed infrastructure that’s been built up over a long time that I think would be very costly for them to replicate.	96	9
201506	301	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	And I think that’s just probably one of many reasons why they have indicated strongly to us that they like to have us continue to play this role.	96	9
201506	302	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	I wasn’t envisioning that we would change that.	96	9
201506	303	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	It’s just that the primary dealers are this group, and then there’s some special subset—we don’t make all of our primary dealers do pro rata bids in the Treasury auction.	96	9
201506	304	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	Yes.	96	9
201506	305	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	We did actually discuss some of these ideas early in the review—for instance, could you have different tiers of membership?	96	9
201506	306	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	That might be possible in the future.	96	9
201506	307	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	We didn’t feel that this was the right time to go there, but I think it’s something that we do want to—	96	9
201506	308	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Why?	96	9
201506	309	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	Well, just because we don’t feel yet that we need to branch out well beyond the broker-dealer and bank community that we already deal with.	96	9
201506	310	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	I think there’s more scope first to bring more of those firms in.	96	9
201506	311	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	We ran two pilots with smaller firms, and we looked at the performance of those smaller firms.	96	9
201506	312	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Based on the performance, we would have to scale up with thousands of firms—the systems cost and the people cost is really high.	96	9
201506	313	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	I think Susan tried to make clear in the memo that we have to look at the marginal cost of adding counterparties versus the marginal benefit, and what we found is that these large market makers are really efficient for some of the things that we need to do.	96	9
201506	314	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	We found that in the case of MBS.	96	9
201506	315	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	There’s a footnote on the ECB, which has 2,000 counterparties, of which 350 are regulars in their temporary open market operations.	96	9
201506	316	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	They’re basically utilizing 60, but really only 20 to do their permanent open market operations right now.	96	9
201506	317	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	So we’re learning.	96	9
201506	318	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	What I think is—and this goes to Governor Powell’s question—there is a lot of change in the industry right now, and we just need to be flexible, which is why in 2017 we’ll be revisiting some of these issues.	96	9
201506	319	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	And we’re happy to give you more information on what we thought about the tiering as well.	96	9
201506	320	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	96	9
201506	321	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	You don’t see an obvious impediment to that, other than maybe the Treasury’s objection?	96	9
201506	322	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	There are many systems and technology and cost impediments relative to the marginal benefit.	96	9
201506	323	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Oh, no, I’m not talking about broadening the pool, per se.	96	9
201506	324	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	I’m talking about the two tiers.	96	9
201506	325	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Again, we should be careful.	96	9
201506	326	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	We have a pretty important public interest in the Treasury market of the United States, and we wouldn’t like to undermine the ability of the Treasury to issue debt at the lowest cost to US taxpayers.	96	9
201506	327	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	96	9
201506	328	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201506	329	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The staff asked for reactions to some of the questions they posed.	96	9
201506	330	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would think it would be useful to have further conversation and discussion about both of these topics.	96	9
201506	331	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of the first issue about revising eligibility requirements, I welcome what some refer to as trying to be more strategic about the deliberation: What exactly are the risks, and what are we trying to achieve through the program?	96	9
201506	332	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The more we can elevate it to that level, I think the more helpful our discussion within the Committee will be, so I encourage the staff to do what they can to help the Committee to get to that level.	96	9
201506	333	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The same on the transparency front.	96	9
201506	334	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Madam Chair, both you and your predecessor have fostered transparency within this Committee.	96	9
201506	335	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So an immediate reaction from somebody who participates in these meetings is that, well, we should be transparent.	96	9
201506	336	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So, again, I think trying to think about the costs and the benefits—how those changes fit into a more overarching strategic framework, into what we’re trying to accomplish—would be useful.	96	9
201506	337	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But it would certainly be useful to have further conversation and discussion about these issues.	96	9
201506	338	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	96	9
201506	339	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201506	340	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	96	9
201506	341	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	I just wanted to add that I support continuing to look at this, including the longer-run issues around these counterparties.	96	9
201506	342	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Disclosing the FX counterparties by name, I think, is one step, but I assume you’ve also thought about talking about our procedures for how we select them—so it would be similar to how we treat domestic operations when we describe the selection procedures.	96	9
201506	343	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Just listing the names could reinforce this idea that we only deal with a narrow set of players, as opposed to describing the process and procedure more.	96	9
201506	344	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	One thing that we didn’t dwell on as much in the memo, another element of transparency, is that we do have counterparty policies on the website for all of our OMO counterparties and also currently for FX.	96	9
201506	345	2015-06-17	meeting	McLAUGHLIN	We’re updating that, and we’re also planning to publish one for the foreign reserves management counterparties as well.	96	9
201506	346	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	I think that would be important.	96	9
201506	347	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	96	9
201506	348	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	96	9
201506	349	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I want to also support the proposal on transparency.	96	9
201506	350	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I don’t see, actually, the costs, and I think the benefits are innumerable.	96	9
201506	351	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	So, if I gave you the names of these FX counterparties, they’d line up pretty well with a legal action that the Board and the US Department of Justice just took, so there is some—	96	9
201506	352	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I understand that.	96	9
201506	353	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	But the flip side of that is, they are our counterparties currently.	96	9
201506	354	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	That’s right.	96	9
201506	355	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	So we’re not actually changing our interactions with them.	96	9
201506	356	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Yes, exactly.	96	9
201506	357	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	All we’re doing is disclosing to the public the reality, which seems wise to me.	96	9
201506	358	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Other comments?	96	9
201506	359	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	96	9
201506	360	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201506	361	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	96	9
201506	362	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Before we move to the economic go-round, I need a motion to ratify domestic open market operations since our April meeting.	63	6
201506	363	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So moved.	63	6
201506	364	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	63	6
201506	365	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	And let me say that our Board meeting has now concluded.	63	6
201506	366	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, let’s go to the economic briefings now.	11	1
201506	367	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Glenn Follette is going to start us off on the chart show.	11	1
201506	368	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11	1
201506	369	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	As you know, the recent spending data have been disappointing, on the whole.	11	1
201506	370	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Indeed, as shown on line 1 of panel 1, after taking on board the indicators that became available after we closed the Tealbook projection last week, we now estimate that real GDP contracted at an annual rate of ¼ percent in the first quarter, with net exports, line 5, subtracting 1¾ percentage points off growth.	11	1
201506	371	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Private domestic final purchases, displayed on line 3, also softened noticeably, with weaker readings for both consumption and business investment.	11	1
201506	372	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	As outlined in panel 2, a key challenge has been to assess how much of the first- quarter weakness should be carried forward.	11	1
201506	373	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	As discussed in a Tealbook box, we now judge that some of the softness reflects residual seasonality—the magnitude of which is subject to considerable uncertainty—where we expect the low reading in the first quarter will be offset by strong readings in subsequent quarters, primarily the second quarter.	11	1
201506	374	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	In addition, we suspect similar transitory effects from the harsh winter weather and the disruption of supply chains from the labor disputes at West Coast ports.	11	1
201506	375	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	But some of the weakness in Q1 appears to reflect more persistent factors.	11	1
201506	376	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	The appreciation of the dollar has imposed a substantial drag on net exports over the first half of the year, and we expect more of the same through next year.	11	1
201506	377	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	In addition, the negative effects of the drop in oil prices on drilling have left a deep imprint on investment during the first half of the year.	11	1
201506	378	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	The black line in panel 3 indicates that business fixed investment fell in the first quarter, reflecting a plunge in drilling and mining investment, shown by the blue portion of the bars—and another enormous drop in drilling appears to be underway this quarter.	11	1
201506	379	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	As shown in panel 4, the combined effects of the strong dollar and the slump in oil prices resulted in declines in manufacturing output, the red line, and total industrial production, the black line, in the first quarter, and the data in hand indicate further weakness in the current quarter.	11	1
201506	380	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Finally, disappointing readings on personal consumption, despite the boost to purchasing power from the low oil prices, have led us to assume less momentum in consumption over the remainder of the year.	11	1
201506	381	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	So we see a wide range of evidence that there has been some deceleration in demand, but there are also indicators that the GDP data exaggerate the magnitude of that deceleration.	11	1
201506	382	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	For one, payroll employment growth, shown in panel 5, has been well maintained, albeit at a slower pace than during 2014.	11	1
201506	383	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	In addition, gross domestic income increased at a moderate rate in the first quarter, and surveys of manufacturing and nonmanufacturing purchasing managers are more upbeat than would be consistent with the GDP data.	11	1
201506	384	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Putting all of this together, we see a somewhat weaker trajectory for real GDP growth in 2015 than we had written down in the March Tealbook.	11	1
201506	385	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	For the current quarter, we estimate that real GDP will increase 2¾ percent and then ease a bit to a 1¾ percent gain in the third quarter.	11	1
201506	386	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	As shown on line 1 in panel 6, the Blue Chip forecasters seem to assess the Q1 weakness much as we do:  Since March, they have downgraded their estimate for the first quarter, but they continue to anticipate above-trend growth in the second quarter and see average growth over the first half as likely to be considerably weaker than they were expecting three months ago.	11	1
201506	387	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	As shown on line 5, the median nowcast across the Federal Reserve System also falls in this middle ground—better than in the first quarter, but not recovering the ground that was lost then.	11	1
201506	388	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Your next exhibit reviews our medium-term outlook.	11	1
201506	389	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	As indicated by the black line in panel 1, we project real GDP to increase at a moderate rate throughout the medium term, a pace that is little changed relative to the most recent couple of Tealbooks.	11	1
201506	390	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	The red line provides a comparison over a longer time period—namely, one year ago—and as you can see, the June 2014 Tealbook forecast for GDP growth was visibly stronger than the current projection.	11	1
201506	391	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	As noted in panel 2, the downward revision since last year is largely the result of the surprising appreciation of the dollar as well as a somewhat softer foreign outlook, topics which will be explored by Beth Anne.	11	1
201506	392	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	The drag generated by these two factors has been offset to a small extent by the effects of lower paths for interest rates, shown in panel 3, and the drop in oil prices.	11	1
201506	393	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Compared with outside forecasters, the Tealbook has a lower path for real GDP than either the Blue Chip consensus or the Survey of Professional Forecasters, owing to more drag coming from net exports in our projection.	11	1
201506	394	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Panel 4 examines the sources of growth of aggregate demand in the staff projection.	11	1
201506	395	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	The left bar displays the average contribution to GDP growth by sector over the past five years.	11	1
201506	396	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	For example, the blue portion of the bar indicates that rising consumption contributed about 1¾ percentage points to aggregate demand growth, on average, and business investment, the red portion of the bar, contributed nearly ¾ percentage point per year.	11	1
201506	397	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	In 2015, business investment is expected to be quite weak, owing to the plunge in drilling and mining.	11	1
201506	398	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	The orange portion of the bars displays the substantial drag arising from net exports that we anticipate this year and next, owing to the appreciation of the dollar and lackluster foreign growth.	11	1
201506	399	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Personal consumption is the main driver of aggregate demand this year; by comparing the height of the blue bars to the black line, you can see that consumption accounts for more than all of GDP growth this year and substantial portions in 2016 and 2017.	11	1
201506	400	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	The robust increases in consumption reflect strong gains in real income, owing in part to the drop in oil prices, as well as the boost to spending from the elevated wealth-to-income ratio displayed in panel 5.	11	1
201506	401	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	One implication of the dissonance between recent data on aggregate demand and the more upbeat labor market data noted earlier is a decline in business-sector productivity, shown by the black line in panel 6.	11	1
201506	402	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	After debating whether to nudge down our estimate of the trend, the green line, we perhaps let hope triumph over experience and decided to leave it alone for now.	11	1
201506	403	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Accordingly, we assume that productivity growth will step up over the medium term.	11	1
201506	404	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	This is one factor behind the projected slowing in the pace of job growth and the flatter trajectory for the unemployment rate over the medium term.	11	1
201506	405	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Your next exhibit provides more information on the labor market.	11	1
201506	406	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	The black line in panel 1 indicates that we expect the unemployment rate to average 5.5 percent in the second quarter, one tenth below the first-quarter average, and continue to edge down one tenth per quarter over the remainder of the year and then flatten out over the medium term.	11	1
201506	407	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	The red line displays the June 2014 projection.	11	1
201506	408	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	While the unemployment rate has fallen faster than we had anticipated a year ago, the flat contour over the medium term results in a somewhat higher rate in 2016 and 2017 than we showed last June.	11	1
201506	409	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	As noted in the bullets in panel 2, the upward revision to the unemployment rate in 2016 reflects the lower path for GDP in the current projection, while the lower starting point is consistent with the disappointing news on productivity we have received.	11	1
201506	410	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Outside forecasters generally project a somewhat steeper decline in the unemployment rate over the medium term.	11	1
201506	411	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	For example, the Blue Chip consensus forecast puts the unemployment rate at 4¾ percent by the end of 2016, and the Survey of Professional Forecasters has a similar outlook.	11	1
201506	412	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Their lower unemployment rates than those in the staff projection are consistent with their stronger outlooks for real GDP growth.	11	1
201506	413	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Besides the falling unemployment rate and solid gains in payroll employment, most other labor market indicators also continue to improve.	11	1
201506	414	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	For example, the labor force participation rate, shown by the black line in panel 3, has held steady for a year, and the gap between the actual rate and its estimated underlying trend, the green line, has narrowed, reducing an important element of labor market slack.	11	1
201506	415	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	In addition, as shown by the black line in the panel 4, job openings as measured by JOLTS are now above pre-crisis levels, and the quits rate, the blue line, has moved up over the past year, suggesting workers have increasing confidence in their ability to find better job matches.	11	1
201506	416	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Moreover, labor compensation seems to be accelerating, though in view of the noise in the relevant series, it is hard to know for sure.	11	1
201506	417	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	The black line in panel 5 shows that the employment cost index rose 2¾ percent over the 12 months ending in March, compared with the 2 percent rate observed over most of the recovery.	11	1
201506	418	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Evidence from two other measures that we monitor—compensation per hour, the purple line, and average hourly earnings, the red line—is mixed.	11	1
201506	419	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Panel 6 provides some results from a recent inquiry conducted by the Reserve Banks.	11	1
201506	420	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	One of the questions we asked business contacts was whether they plan to change prices in response to changing compensation costs.	11	1
201506	421	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	As shown in the table, 10 percent replied that they would fully pass on changes in costs, while 23 percent responded that they would partially pass through the changes, and nearly half reported that they would not change prices in response to their changing compensation costs.	11	1
201506	422	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	These responses are also consistent with work by the staff that indicates that the linkage between nominal wage growth and price inflation is loose.	11	1
201506	423	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Your next exhibit reviews inflation.	11	1
201506	424	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	As shown on line 1 in panel 1, after falling 2 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, total PCE prices are expected to increase at a 2 percent rate in the current quarter and 1½ percent in the third.	11	1
201506	425	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Much of this fluctuation reflects movements in energy prices, line 3.	11	1
201506	426	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	But core PCE price inflation, line 5, is also projected to move up in the current quarter from its low first- quarter reading.	11	1
201506	427	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	As shown by the red line in panel 2, core prices rose at an annual rate of 1½ percent over the three months ending in April, and we expect similar readings for the next few months.	11	1
201506	428	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Nonetheless, core inflation was only 1¼ percent over the prior 12 months, the black line.	11	1
201506	429	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Falling core import prices, shown in panel 3, have been holding down core inflation over the past couple of quarters and are expected to continue to weigh on inflation over the near term.	11	1
201506	430	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	But as these effects wane and slack continues to be taken up, core inflation should pick up.	11	1
201506	431	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Our projection of the four-quarter change in core inflation is shown in panel 4.	11	1
201506	432	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Core inflation is projected to be only 1¼ percent this year and then to rise to 1½ percent in 2016 and 1¾ percent in 2017.	11	1
201506	433	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	As shown by the red line, this projection is just a touch lower than a year ago.	11	1
201506	434	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Total inflation, the black line in panel 5, is projected to be similar to core inflation after the direct effects of last winter’s drop in energy prices dissipate, and our projection over the medium term is unchanged from a year ago.	11	1
201506	435	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	As noted in the bottom-right box, the lower path for core inflation in 2015 and 2016 reflects the indirect effects of lower oil and import prices on core.	11	1
201506	436	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Our forecast for inflation is a bit lower than that of outside forecasters.	11	1
201506	437	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	According to the Survey of Professional Forecasters, inflation will move up a bit more quickly, nearing 2 percent in 2016.	11	1
201506	438	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Similarly, the Blue Chip consensus has CPI inflation at 2¼ percent in 2016.	11	1
201506	439	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Beth Anne will continue the presentation.	11	1
201506	440	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Thank you, Glenn.	11	1
201506	441	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	When I queried colleagues about what they would most like in a chart show, they said “brevity,” which, unfortunately, will preclude me from delivering my stirring rendition of “American Pie: The Quarter Net Exports Died.”	11	1
201506	442	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	[Laughter]	11	1
201506	443	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	That said, I will begin with a riff on trade.	11	1
201506	444	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	As discussed by Glenn, net exports (line 1 in the table) subtracted almost 2 percentage points from first-quarter GDP growth.	11	1
201506	445	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Some of this drag reflects temporary factors— importantly, port disruptions and residual seasonality.	11	1
201506	446	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Data on shipping containers processed at West Coast ports (panel 2) indicate that disruptions to inbound containers (the red line) in January and February were made up in March, leaving little net imprint on first-quarter imports.	11	1
201506	447	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	But the recovery of outbound containers (the blue line) looks incomplete, leaving Q1 exports low, on average, and likely boosting this quarter’s figure.	11	1
201506	448	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	We have also found evidence of residual seasonality in exports for Q1 but not for imports, which further supports a payback in the current quarter.	11	1
201506	449	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Thereafter, we have growth in exports and imports largely returning to our models, which see a net exports contributing a drag on GDP growth of roughly ¾ percentage point in the second half of this year and next year, similar to that in the April Tealbook.	11	1
201506	450	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	More generally, since last year, net exports have become a major headwind to the US recovery, as can be seen by comparing the red and black lines in panel 3.	11	1
201506	451	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	This primarily reflects the unexpected strength of the broad real dollar (panel 4)—which, in contrast to the steady depreciation we had projected last June, has risen 10 percent, reflecting the relative strength of the US economy and expectations that we will be normalizing monetary policy before other major central banks.	11	1
201506	452	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Consequently, we have the dollar climbing a bit further this year, under the assumption that we are the liftoff leaders, before resuming a trajectory of slight depreciation.	11	1
201506	453	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	The effect of the dollar’s appreciation on the contribution of net exports to GDP growth is shown in panel 5.	11	1
201506	454	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	As the contour of the black line reveals, we now think the dollar’s appreciation since last summer began to depress net exports strongly last quarter, and we see the effect intensifying throughout this year before waning only slowly over the course of the next two years.	11	1
201506	455	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	The dollar is not the only factor weighing on net exports.	11	1
201506	456	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Looking at panel 6, the contribution of net exports to output growth has been lessened by a downshift in our path for foreign growth since this time last year, which I discuss in your next exhibit.	11	1
201506	457	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	The black line in panel 1 presents our current path for foreign growth, measured on a four-quarter basis to smooth out those pesky first-quarter dips.	11	1
201506	458	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	After slowing over the past year, foreign growth is expected to achieve a 3 percent pace by the middle of next year, noticeably weaker than what we had projected last year.	11	1
201506	459	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	This revision primarily reflects a step-down in our projection for the emerging market economies—panel 2—in which, instead of rising by late last year, growth fell further.	11	1
201506	460	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Undaunted, we have EME growth climbing to nearly 4 percent by the end of 2016, but this is almost ½ percentage point below what we had last June.	11	1
201506	461	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	I would note that, although we have taken down our projections for China and emerging Asia some, this revision is really a story about Latin America “losing its mojo.”	11	1
201506	462	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Falling commodity prices have laid bare structural and political weaknesses in a number of economies—importantly, Brazil—and reduced the payoff to energy reforms in Mexico.	11	1
201506	463	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	We also weakened growth in the advanced foreign economies—panel 3—in which the bounceback from Japan’s consumption tax has underwhelmed and falling oil prices have sapped Canada’s strength.	11	1
201506	464	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	But the AFE forecast is little altered beyond the near term.	11	1
201506	465	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	In general, highly accommodative monetary policy, healing credit markets, and—for some countries—lower oil prices and depreciated currencies are all supportive of growth.	11	1
201506	466	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	In particular, the euro area has been an uncharacteristic source of strength.	11	1
201506	467	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	We have growth continuing to firm and, as indicated in panel 4, we take comfort from the return to credit growth (the bars) and the steady decline in the unemployment rate (the black line).	11	1
201506	468	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	That said, as discussed in panel 5, one threat to our forecast comes from current euro-area member, Greece.	11	1
201506	469	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	As Simon discussed, Greece and its official-sector creditors are once again dancing perilously close to a default cliff, as negotiations to unlock financing to get Greece through the summer broke down over the weekend.	11	1
201506	470	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	If an agreement is not cobbled together soon, there is a significant risk that on June 30 Greece will be unable to make its payment to the IMF and its current EU aid program will expire.	11	1
201506	471	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	In this event, conditions could deteriorate quickly, with deposit flight and possibly reduced ECB liquidity provision forcing capital controls, bank holidays, and the potential for Greek exit.	11	1
201506	472	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Knowing what will happen is probably best left to oracles.	11	1
201506	473	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	For our part, we do not rule out a significant worsening in the situation but assume that the fallout is limited by the lack of financial market exposure and by euro-area firewalls.	11	1
201506	474	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Consequently, though we have built in a small drag to euro-area growth stemming from Greece, our baseline is one in which Greek developments do not derail the euro area or the global recovery.	11	1
201506	475	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	We are not naïve, however, to the significant risks that attend this forecast.	11	1
201506	476	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	I have two additional observations.	11	1
201506	477	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	First, as evidenced by panel 6, market response, though negative, is still well below what we have seen in earlier high-drama Greek moments.	11	1
201506	478	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	What is critically different now is that the establishment of the ECB bond-buying programs, EU financial backstops, and progress on banking union have helped to delink fears of Greek exit from that of full euro-area breakup and, thus, better positioned Europe and the global economy to endure a “Greek tragedy.”	11	1
201506	479	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Ironically, however, by reducing the sense of urgency concerning a Greek exit, these institutional improvements may have actually increased the risk of it happening.	11	1
201506	480	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Second, although all attention is now focused on a short-term agreement to get Greece through the summer, this will not solve the underlying problems.	11	1
201506	481	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	To put Greece on a sustainable path while remaining within the euro area, the Greek government will have to deliver a fundamental reform of their economy and other euro-area members will have to deliver significant further funding.	11	1
201506	482	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Shaking off Greece blues and turning to exhibit 7, our projection of foreign growth settling in at a moderate, near-potential pace by the end of our forecast period is associated with a return to modest inflation (panel 1) in both the AFEs and EMEs, as oil and nonfuel commodity prices (panel 2) stabilize at low levels.	11	1
201506	483	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Against this background, we assume monetary policy remains quite accommodative, as policy rates (panel 3) remain low and central bank balance sheets (panel 4) are still elevated.	11	1
201506	484	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	I should note that, as seen in panel 5, the jump in long-term yields witnessed over the intermeeting period, although sharp, still leaves 10-year rates at very low levels.	11	1
201506	485	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	A key question going forward, and one at the heart of the secular stagnation debate, is whether the current depressed level of interest rates is indicative of a permanent downshift in rates or whether, as growth firms, interest rates will rise closer to pre-crises levels.	11	1
201506	486	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Turning to exhibit 8, to look at this question for the AFEs, I examine one important determinant of the level of interest rates:  the equilibrium interest rate, or the short-term real interest rate consistent with output at potential and stable inflation.	11	1
201506	487	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Here, I present estimates of the equilibrium rate in the AFE economies using two approaches, outlined in panel 1 and discussed in more detail in a box by Andrea Raffo in the international section of Tealbook, Book A.	11	1
201506	488	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	The first approach focuses on identifying cyclical movements of the short-run equilibrium rate around its steady- state value, which is assumed to be constant over time.	11	1
201506	489	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	It uses an estimated dynamic stochastic general equilibrium, or DSGE, model consisting of a Phillips curve equation, an IS equation, and a Taylor rule.	11	1
201506	490	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Panel 2 shows the evolution of the AFE cyclical aggregate equilibrium interest rate based on this approach.	11	1
201506	491	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	According to the model, the AFE equilibrium real interest rate plunged in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and currently stands in negative territory, about 3½ percentage points below its steady-state value of nearly 2 percent.	11	1
201506	492	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Moreover, the effects of the recession are very persistent:  Absent additional shocks, the AFE aggregate equilibrium interest rate by 2020 is projected to still be more than ½ percentage point below steady state.	11	1
201506	493	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Thus, viewed within this framework, the current low level of interest rates does not necessarily imply a lower long-run level of the equilibrium rate; the current level could rather be consistent with slow adjustment of rates to the steady state.	11	1
201506	494	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Other evidence, however, including that based on the framework in Laubach and Williams (2003), suggests that the long-run value of the equilibrium interest rate in the United States may drift over time.	11	1
201506	495	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Their approach starts from an empirical framework that includes an IS equation and a Phillips curve equation and focuses on estimating the link between slow-moving changes in the equilibrium interest rate and in trend growth of output.	11	1
201506	496	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Should you have any questions on this approach, you should feel free to bring it up with them directly.	11	1
201506	497	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Their machinery generates this result that, indeed, the long-run equilibrium rate in the United States, shown by the black line in panel 3, has declined significantly over the past decade.	11	1
201506	498	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Applying a similar methodology to data for the AFEs, we find that the average AFE equilibrium rate (the red line) has also fallen steadily and is currently negative.	11	1
201506	499	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	This result suggests that AFE policy rates may remain much lower than in the early 2000s for structural, rather than cyclical, reasons.	11	1
201506	500	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Should this be the case, AFE policymakers may find it more difficult to face future recessions using only conventional tools.	11	1
201506	501	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	However, one should be cautious about inferring that the equilibrium interest rate is permanently lower.	11	1
201506	502	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	These estimates are very imprecise, and the underlying determinants of the equilibrium rate can change over time.	11	1
201506	503	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Some factors that have been cited as likely pushing down the equilibrium rate, such as declining working-age population, seem hard to change, but other factors, particularly relevant to open economies, may give cause for hope.	11	1
201506	504	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	For example, some of the decline in equilibrium rates has been attributed to the global savings glut—the phenomenon that, before the global financial crisis, especially in the mid-2000s, countries with large current account surpluses (the red bars in panel 4) were exporting their savings to advanced economies, particularly the United States, which ran current account deficits.	11	1
201506	505	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	For the period ahead, we anticipate that the negative pressure on rates stemming from these flows will ease from its peak, as the current account surpluses of the oil exporters narrow and the Asian economies rebalance some toward domestic demand.	11	1
201506	506	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Finally, in an open economy setting, equilibrium interest rates in the advanced economies—importantly, the United States—may be affected not just by domestic potential output growth, but also by equilibrium interest rates and potential growth in the rest of the world.	11	1
201506	507	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	In contrast to the United States and the AFEs, world potential growth (the black line in panel 5) has been stable, as the share of world GDP represented by the faster-growing EMEs is rising over time, which may argue for a higher steady-state value of the equilibrium rate than if only domestic potential growth mattered.	11	1
201506	508	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Thank you.	11	1
201506	509	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	I will be referring to the packet labeled “Materials for Briefing on the Summary of Economic Projections.”	11	1
201506	510	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	Exhibit 1 shows the trajectories of your economic projections conditional on your individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.	11	1
201506	511	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	As illustrated by the top panel, most of you project that real GDP growth this year will average somewhat less than its longer-run pace.	11	1
201506	512	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	All of you see GDP accelerating appreciably in the second half of 2015, and project that growth will exceed its longer-run pace in 2016.	11	1
201506	513	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	For 2017, nearly all of you see real GDP either growing at, or decelerating toward, its longer-run rate.	11	1
201506	514	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	All of you project some further reduction in the unemployment rate by the end of next year; indeed, a sizable majority of you see the unemployment rate within 0.2 percentage point of its longer- run normal value in late 2016.	11	1
201506	515	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	In addition, about half of you project that at the end of 2017, the unemployment rate will be below your estimate of its longer-run normal rate.	11	1
201506	516	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	As shown in the third panel, headline PCE inflation is expected to come in at or below 1 percent this year, but to climb to 1½ percent or more in 2016.	11	1
201506	517	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	Even so, nearly half of you anticipate that headline inflation next year will run more than ¼ percentage point below your longer-run objective.	11	1
201506	518	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	In contrast, a sizable majority of you project that headline inflation will be within 0.1 percentage point of the Committee’s goal in 2017.	11	1
201506	519	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	The final panel shows that you project only a slight decline in core PCE inflation this year and that you expect a gradual rise over the remainder of the forecast.	11	1
201506	520	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	Exhibit 2 compares your current projections with those in the March Summary of Economic Projections and with the June Tealbook.	11	1
201506	521	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	As indicated in the top panel, you responded to the evidence of weak economic activity early in the year by marking down significantly your forecasts of real GDP growth in 2015; however, most of you ascribed the first-half weakness in activity largely to transitory factors, and so your medium- and longer-term projections differ only a little from what you wrote down in March.	11	1
201506	522	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	As shown in the second panel, the central tendency of your forecasts for the unemployment rate edged up 0.1 percentage point or so in 2015, with a number of you attributing the revision to the weaker-than-expected first-half data.	11	1
201506	523	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	According to several of you, the scant differences between your March and June projections of GDP growth and the unemployment rate in 2016 and 2017, despite recent indications of a weaker near-term trajectory for expenditures, is due in part to the monetary policy response to that weakness that you incorporated in your forecasts.	11	1
201506	524	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	As the bottom panels indicate, your projections of both headline and core PCE inflation for all three years were very similar to what you wrote down in March.	11	1
201506	525	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	The revisions you made to your forecasts for real GDP growth in 2015—which reduce the midpoint of the central tendency by 0.6 percentage point—were a bit larger than the change in the staff outlook.	11	1
201506	526	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	As a consequence, the Tealbook forecast for economic growth in 2015 remains below your central tendency, but by a smaller margin than was the case in March.	11	1
201506	527	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	Otherwise, the Tealbook forecasts for economic growth and inflation continue to run near the bottom of your central tendencies over the projection period, and the staff’s projections of the unemployment rate remain at about the upper end of your central tendencies.	11	1
201506	528	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	Exhibit 3 summarizes your assessments of the quarter in which you judge that the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate, along with the economic conditions you anticipate at that time.	11	1
201506	529	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	As shown in the top panel, a majority of you currently view the third quarter of 2015 as likely to be the appropriate time to commence tightening.	11	1
201506	530	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	Since March, nine of you pushed back your prescribed date of departure from the effective lower bound by one quarter.	11	1
201506	531	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	As indicated by the panels at the bottom, your current projections of the unemployment rate and for core inflation at the time of initial tightening show a bit more dispersion in this forecast than in March; however, the medians of the unemployment rate, at 5.3 percent, and of core inflation, at 1.2 percent, are unchanged from before.	11	1
201506	532	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	All but four of you project that the unemployment rate at the time of the first increase in the federal funds rate will still be above its longer-run normal level, and all but one of you project that core inflation will be well below the Committee’s longer-run objective for headline inflation of 2 percent.	11	1
201506	533	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	Nonetheless, all of you project further progress toward the Committee’s objectives after departure from the effective lower bound.	11	1
201506	534	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	Exhibit 4 provides an overview of your assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate at the end of each year of the forecast period and over the longer run.	11	1
201506	535	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	Most of you now consider a lower federal funds rate than you had projected in March to be appropriate over some part of the projection period; how you implemented this view varied from person to person.	11	1
201506	536	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	Nine of you now judge that the outlook warrants a somewhat later date of initial tightening, although not all of the 9 see this as justifying a lower federal funds rate at the end of this year.	11	1
201506	537	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	All told, 10 participants thought that the current outlook warranted a lower federal funds rate at the end of 2015, of which 8 thought this easier stance of policy should continue at least until the end of 2016.	11	1
201506	538	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	Two of you indicated that modestly lower estimates of the longer-run level of the real interest rate also played a role in reducing the path for the nominal federal funds rate.	11	1
201506	539	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	On the numbers, your mean federal funds rate projection for 2015 has come down 19 basis points to 0.58 percent, although the median federal funds rate projection for that date is unchanged from March at 0.63 percent.	11	1
201506	540	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	The median projections for the ends of 2016 and 2017 are 1.63 and 2.88 percent, respectively; both are down 25 basis points from what they were in March.	11	1
201506	541	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	Exhibit 5 shows your assessments of the uncertainty and risks surrounding your economic projections.	11	1
201506	542	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	As shown in the figures to the left, your views regarding uncertainty have not changed in a material way.	11	1
201506	543	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	A sizable majority of you judge the level of uncertainty about your individual projections of GDP growth and the unemployment rate to be broadly similar to the average level over the past 20 years, with only slightly less agreement on headline and core inflation.	11	1
201506	544	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	The panels to the right indicate that a large majority also continues to see the risks to real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly balanced.	11	1
201506	545	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	As reported in the third and fourth panels to the right, 11 of you now see risks to headline and core inflation as balanced—3 more than was the case in March.	11	1
201506	546	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	A few of you have indicated that your confidence in the likelihood has increased of inflation moving toward the policy objective of a 2 percent rate.	11	1
201506	547	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	Finally, exhibit 6 takes a closer look at recent assessments you have made of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.	11	1
201506	548	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	Unlike in exhibit 4, the blue dots in the top panel of this exhibit show your projections for the federal funds rate for the end of a single year—2016—but for different forecast vintages, from September 2013, the first SEP in which you supplied a forecast for 2016, to this meeting.	11	1
201506	549	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	The blue line connects the median values of your federal funds rate projections for these eight forecasts.	11	1
201506	550	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	As you can see, the median of your views with regard to the appropriate federal funds rate has varied over time.	11	1
201506	551	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	In particular, from the low level recorded in the December 2013 SEP, the median climbed more than 100 basis points by September 2014, but then more than retraced that increase to reach its nadir with this projection.	11	1
201506	552	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	Building on some analysis that was presented to you at the March meeting, I look at your policy prescriptions through the lens of a policy rule—in particular, the noninertial Taylor (1999) rule, shown in the middle panel.	11	1
201506	553	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	As in the staff’s SEP briefing in March, I use your individual SEP submissions for 2016 as the right-hand- side variables in the Taylor rule equation, while also employing your estimates of the longer-run normal level of the unemployment rate and the longer-run real federal funds rate.	11	1
201506	554	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	The median of those 17 estimates at each forecast date is plotted as the solid red line back in the panel at the top.	11	1
201506	555	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	Three points emerge from this exercise.	11	1
201506	556	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	First, the median Taylor-rule-implied policy rates for 2016 have been persistently higher—averaging around 1½ percentage points higher— than the median of the rates you viewed as appropriate.	11	1
201506	557	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	Second, the median of your federal funds rate prescriptions has varied more than the median of the Taylor-rule-implied rates.	11	1
201506	558	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	This suggests that the variables that appear on the right-hand side of the rule formula, including those longer-run levels for the unemployment rate and the real federal funds rate, do not encompass the factors that influence your forecasts—or at least they do not do so consistently.	11	1
201506	559	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	Third, over the most recent three projections, the gap between the median Taylor-rule-implied rates and the median of your projections has widened somewhat.	11	1
201506	560	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	Finally, before leaving this top panel of this exhibit, let me note the black dashed line.	11	1
201506	561	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	It shows the Taylor-rule-implied federal funds rate computed by taking the medians of your projected values of the rule’s right-hand-side variables to obtain a single federal funds rate reading per vintage—as opposed to taking the median of 17 projections of the federal funds rate, a method we followed in constructing the red line.	11	1
201506	562	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	As you can see, the policy prescriptions calculated using these two methods are quite similar; this is noteworthy because the calculation underlying the black dashed line can be performed with the information you currently provide to the public, whereas the calculation behind the red line requires knowledge of your individual projections.	11	1
201506	563	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	The bottom panel of the exhibit is devoted to this discrepancy between participants’ federal funds rate projections and your Taylor-rule-implied rates, with the individual residual values shown by the green open circles.	11	1
201506	564	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	There are some noteworthy outliers among these residuals, but the bulk of the values are reasonably well clustered.	11	1
201506	565	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	The two lines in the panel are medians, analogous to the red and black lines in the upper panel.	11	1
201506	566	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	In particular, the green solid line connects the median values of these residuals, while the black dashed line shows deviations of the median federal funds rate projections from the median Taylor-rule-implied rate by forecast.	11	1
201506	567	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	Note the close correlation of these two lines—the black dashed line, especially—with the blue line in the top panel.	11	1
201506	568	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	This pattern highlights the fact that much of the time variation in your federal funds rate forecasts stems not from changes in the projected variables that appear on the right-hand side of the rule equation—unemployment and inflation—but rather from other, unspecified factors.	11	1
201506	569	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	How to interpret these residuals is an open question.	11	1
201506	570	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	We can infer that whatever explains them has been persistent and is expected to continue.	11	1
201506	571	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	One interpretation is that they represent your practicing “risk management” in the face of the effective lower bound problem and other asymmetric risks in the current economic environment; another is that they represent your perception of a temporary, if persistent, decline in the equilibrium real interest rate.	11	1
201506	572	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	Either interpretation could serve as justification for “keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.”	11	1
201506	573	2015-06-17	meeting	TETLOW	That concludes my remarks.	11	1
201506	574	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	11	1
201506	575	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for any of our presenters?	12	1
201506	576	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	The floor is open.	12	1
201506	577	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	12	1
201506	578	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201506	579	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought this was a very rich presentation.	12	1
201506	580	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thank the staff for all the elements of it.	12	1
201506	581	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I had two quick questions.	12	1
201506	582	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One is on figure 5 in exhibit 2 of the “Economic and Financial Situation” presentation.	12	1
201506	583	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s the exhibit labeled “Medium Term Outlook” on page 2 of 8, and figure 5 is a wealth-to-income ratio picture.	12	1
201506	584	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Have you looked at doing that using medians—using the Survey of Consumer Finances, or something like that, to get a median for a wealth-to-income picture?	12	1
201506	585	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	To look at how the distribution of wealth-to-income is moving?	12	1
201506	586	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	12	1
201506	587	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	To give a little context to my question, I hear persistent and consistent reports from our directors that they’re observing signs of a two-track recovery.	12	1
201506	588	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And if that’s what’s going on—if we see growth in inequality that’s large during this recovery period—we might want to be looking at other moments of the distribution of wealth besides simply the mean.	12	1
201506	589	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Right.	12	1
201506	590	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	It is possible to get some breakdown of wealth by groups—for example, if we use the data from the Survey of Consumer Finances.	12	1
201506	591	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	The question is whether that wealth distribution is becoming much more concentrated over this time period and whether the MPCs are very different across groups.	12	1
201506	592	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	And I’m not sure of the answer to either of those questions.	12	1
201506	593	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it would be informative to look at something like the median wealth-to-income ratio or maybe even the median net-worth-to-income ratio to see if we see the same kind of recovery in that as this seems to depict.	12	1
201506	594	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My other question actually goes all the way to something Simon said, which is about the kind of reversals we’ve seen in German bund yields and the effect of that on broader economic conditions in Europe.	12	1
201506	595	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	At least for me, the rise of bund yields was very outsized compared with what I would have expected, even in light of the improvement that we’ve seen in the European economy.	12	1
201506	596	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Given that, I would think that that might lead to a drag on European economic performance.	12	1
201506	597	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Are we seeing anything like that?	12	1
201506	598	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Is that likely to happen?	12	1
201506	599	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	We have it built in.	12	1
201506	600	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	We don’t have anything currently, since it just happened, but we have built in a slight drag to our euro-area forecast coming from the tightening of financial conditions.	12	1
201506	601	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	When we looked at the underlying factors that might explain the large downward movement in bund prices, we could not explain much of the downward movement with these underlying factors.	12	1
201506	602	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	So, on the move down, we didn’t completely incorporate that into our forecast.	12	1
201506	603	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	We moved slightly in that direction, and now we’ve moved slightly the other way.	12	1
201506	604	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks.	12	1
201506	605	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Additional questions?	12	1
201506	606	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	12	1
201506	607	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I have a question about the staff’s view on productivity growth.	12	1
201506	608	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	We’ve had these very bad draws on productivity growth, and you’ve talked about how you expect it to return to its trend rate.	12	1
201506	609	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	What’s the staff’s underlying story about what we’re seeing?	12	1
201506	610	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Is it mismeasured GDP?	12	1
201506	611	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Is it less capital deepening?	12	1
201506	612	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Is it that we just don’t understand it?	12	1
201506	613	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Are there competing theories about why we’re seeing such lousy productivity numbers?	12	1
201506	614	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	And how does that influence how we should think about the outlook?	12	1
201506	615	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Which weight do you put on that?	12	1
201506	616	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Just as a little background to that, over the forecast period—2015 to 2017—we’ve got productivity growth, in terms of the trend, of around 1.6 percent, which is similar to the pre-1995 experience.	12	1
201506	617	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	What we don’t have is it going back to the experience that we had from 1995 to 2007.	12	1
201506	618	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	Over the course of this recovery so far—as you know—from around 2010 to 2014, we’ve had around 1 percent productivity growth.	12	1
201506	619	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	So there will be a decent step-up from that.	12	1
201506	620	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	A portion of that step-up is because there’s more capital deepening in the forecast period than we had before that, and a portion of it probably reflects the idea that some of the scarring of the economy from the financial crisis fades over time.	12	1
201506	621	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	But most of the forecast step-up reflects the fact that we don’t really understand the slowdown from 2010 to 2014, and we expect some of that to unwind.	12	1
201506	622	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	I think there is a strong view among people that there is mismeasurement of productivity growth and that some of that has gotten a little bit larger over time as it has become more difficult to measure some of the effects of technological advances on product quality.	12	1
201506	623	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	But, are we, all of a sudden, then going to measure it better?	12	1
201506	624	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s what you’re implying.	12	1
201506	625	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess I’m focused more on just the last year.	12	1
201506	626	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	We’ve had really poor productivity growth over the last four quarters, and—	12	1
201506	627	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	It’s not that much worse than the prior—	12	1
201506	628	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s 0.3 percent.	12	1
201506	629	2015-06-17	meeting	FOLLETTE	We’ve had a bad five years.	12	1
201506	630	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	And the reason why I think it’s so germane is because it’s really relevant to the forecast in terms of how growth translates to labor market improvement.	12	1
201506	631	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	And so it seems to me you have to have a view on what productivity growth is going to do to understand how growth is going to translate into employment.	12	1
201506	632	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	It doesn’t sound like we really have a good theory of what we are seeing right now.	12	1
201506	633	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Is that unfair?	12	1
201506	634	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I mean, I don’t have a good theory either.	12	1
201506	635	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	We have a view that performance is not likely to recuperate by going back to its pre-crisis trend rate of increase.	12	1
201506	636	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	We think it’s not going to remain as bad as it’s been.	12	1
201506	637	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	All of the surprises on trend productivity growth have been to the south of our expectations since the crisis.	12	1
201506	638	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	We’ve attributed quite a bit of that to multifactor productivity growth.	12	1
201506	639	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	Some of it has been due to a lack of capital deepening.	12	1
201506	640	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	Our models are not all that surprised by the amount of investment that’s going on at the moment.	12	1
201506	641	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	We don’t perceive a great big deficit in investment, and some work by Stacey Tevlin and Eugenio Pinto suggests that while the capital stock is growing quite slowly, you can understand that on the basis of two factors.	12	1
201506	642	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	One is that the overall recovery is itself pretty tepid, and so the standard accelerator mechanism suggests that tepid business investment is warranted.	12	1
201506	643	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	And the other is that the growth of the labor force has slowed a lot.	12	1
201506	644	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	If you rescale the capital stock on a per capita basis, you find that growth of the capital stock is pretty well within its historical norm.	12	1
201506	645	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	We think there are some very tentative signs that are encouraging about the growth of multifactor productivity.	12	1
201506	646	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	But we were pretty close this time around to downgrading our assumptions about structural productivity once again.	12	1
201506	647	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	This would be the nth in a long string of downgradings.	12	1
201506	648	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	And I don’t think it’s going to take much to cause us to get the plane out and take another few shaves off the slope of that trajectory that Glenn showed in panel 6.	12	1
201506	649	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	12	1
201506	650	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	12	1
201506	651	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	12	1
201506	652	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have a comment regarding Beth Anne’s equilibrium interest rates.	12	1
201506	653	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I wanted to go into some of the econometric technicalities there.	12	1
201506	654	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	If you look at panel 2 in exhibit 8—and this is what you said, but I’d just like to highlight it for everybody else—that dashed line from the DSGE model for the AFEs is a forecast built into the model.	12	1
201506	655	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The model has shocks that will fade over time, by assumption, and that’s why it goes back very slowly, as you pointed out, to 2 percent.	12	1
201506	656	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	But if you notice, in the actual estimates, none of that has yet occurred.	12	1
201506	657	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, my colleague, Vasco Cúrdia, looked at a couple of DSGE models—one similar to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s model, another one developed in the Federal Reserve.	12	1
201506	658	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And for the United States alone, they show the very same pattern:  a drop for the United States of r* in the DSGE model to basically negative 3 or 4 percent, something like that, and r* remains still at that very low level.	12	1
201506	659	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, even though these models tells you we are going to go back to normal by assumption, it is striking that even in the first quarter of 2015, there is absolutely no evidence of a return of r* back to a normal level.	12	1
201506	660	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	So whatever headwinds are holding this down—and in these models, it’s a combination of supply and demand shocks—they are as strong today as they were three to five years ago in the US models.	12	1
201506	661	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And this gets me back to Laubach-Williams in panel 3.	12	1
201506	662	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, in that model—and apparently in your analysis using the AFE version of the model—there is absolutely no sign, even through 2015:Q1, of any waning of these headwinds.	12	1
201506	663	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I know it’s not popular to push the secular-stagnation theory, and I’m not really trying to do that—perhaps the lawyer here will question that.	12	1
201506	664	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I think it’s worth reminding ourselves that we still haven’t seen—at least based on DSGE models, the models that the Board uses, the models that we use elsewhere—we haven’t seen any sign of a waning of headwinds yet, based on this method, at least.	12	1
201506	665	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	Hear, hear.	12	1
201506	666	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Oh, don’t you agree I needed a question?	12	1
201506	667	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	Well, not entirely.	12	1
201506	668	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	[Laughter]	12	1
201506	669	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	I’m not sure that there is a convenient exhibit here.	12	1
201506	670	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	But, in Claudia Sahm’s Board briefing yesterday, there was a nice exhibit that showed the GDP gap over recent history and the future.	12	1
201506	671	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	What that GDP gap shows is that we have made a lot of progress—by our estimate, anyway—toward closing resource utilization slack.	12	1
201506	672	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	And—while I would hesitate to “preach L-W to W”—a sort of mechanical interpretation is that what that suggests is that you have succeeded—by at least one definition of r*—in getting r below r*, on our projection now at the end of 2018, anyway.	12	1
201506	673	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	So this is conditional on our projection.	12	1
201506	674	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	We have the GDP gap a little bit positive, which is to say, actual output is above potential output.	12	1
201506	675	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	Now, you could come back and say, “Well, that’s fine.	12	1
201506	676	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	That’s all a matter of projection.”	12	1
201506	677	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	But we’ve made a lot of progress over the past several years, and the Tealbook-consistent estimate of r* is something like minus three-tenths at the moment.	12	1
201506	678	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	We’ve got an actual r that’s considerably less than that at the moment.	12	1
201506	679	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	So, I’d hark more to Beth Anne’s admonition that there is a lot of uncertainty that surrounds these estimates.	12	1
201506	680	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	It’s not apparent to me that we’re operating with an r* that is quite as bleak as what’s shown here.	12	1
201506	681	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	I think you’re making progress with the current policy setting toward getting resource utilization back up to its sustainable level.	12	1
201506	682	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	But one doesn’t rule out the other.	12	1
201506	683	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	12	1
201506	684	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	They’re not inconsistent.	12	1
201506	685	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The real interest rates are quite negative.	12	1
201506	686	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	12	1
201506	687	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	Remember that what’s shown here—again, it is a little ironic, but what’s shown here is the long-run equilibrium r*.	12	1
201506	688	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	So your view would have to be that it’s going to remain permanently that bleak.	12	1
201506	689	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Well, that’s the debate, right?	12	1
201506	690	2015-06-17	meeting	WILCOX	Yes.	12	1
201506	691	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The one side is that the headwinds will abate, they’ll wane, and we’ll move back to 2 percent or whatever.	12	1
201506	692	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the other is that, for reasons that we don’t fully understand, a number like negative 0.3, like you mentioned, may be around for the next 5 to 10 years.	12	1
201506	693	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I don’t think we have any evidence, at least so far, that distinguishes between those two hypotheses.	12	1
201506	694	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s all I’m saying.	12	1
201506	695	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m talking about flat priors.	12	1
201506	696	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I just wanted to make the point that because those dashed lines, which are always shown, can somehow indicate that we’re seeing it come back.	12	1
201506	697	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And that’s—what did you say?	12	1
201506	698	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s “hope ahead of experience.”	12	1
201506	699	2015-06-17	meeting		[Laughter]	12	1
201506	700	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	One thing I would note is, one aspect of your approach is that you can decompose the equilibrium rate into the component that’s linked to potential output growth and the component that’s linked to a residual.	12	1
201506	701	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	And what we’ve seen when we’ve done that is that the part that’s linked to a residual accounts for a large part of the decline.	12	1
201506	702	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	That is, the decline is not explained by the behavior of potential growth, and that does suggest, I think, greater odds that the decline will be reversed.	12	1
201506	703	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	There are reasons to think potential output growth could recover, but the residual could also encompass a number of factors—headwinds, a global savings glut, changes in preferences, risk aversion, and deleveraging—that we think may go away.	12	1
201506	704	2015-06-17	meeting	KAMIN	It might be also worth noting—returning to panel 2, looking at the cyclical version—that the calculation for AFEs actually bounces back a lot right after the global financial crisis reaches its height in 2008 and 2009.	12	1
201506	705	2015-06-17	meeting	KAMIN	It then goes back down again, probably largely reflecting the euro crisis and its effects on our AFE aggregate combined, a little bit later, with the effect of the consumption tax increase on Japan.	12	1
201506	706	2015-06-17	meeting	KAMIN	So both the euro area and Japan have experienced these secondary reverberations that do, to some extent, reflect the initial crisis but could be thought of as additional shocks that maybe the US economy was not subject to.	12	1
201506	707	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I would just repeat the point that the US-based model’s r* is still very negative and isn’t subject to that right now.	12	1
201506	708	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	And if you looked at this for Canada, for example, you would see it going back much faster.	12	1
201506	709	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	We had two two-handers, President Mester and then President Kocherlakota.	12	1
201506	710	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Can you remind me of what the error bands around this estimate were?	12	1
201506	711	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Huge.	12	1
201506	712	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	[Laughter]	12	1
201506	713	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	In Laubach-Williams, they say, for various versions of their model, 0.9 to 2.8 percentage points.	12	1
201506	714	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	So, huge.	12	1
201506	715	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But those error bands are symmetric, right?	12	1
201506	716	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	They go on the downside as well as the upside?	12	1
201506	717	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	Right.	12	1
201506	718	2015-06-17	meeting	WILSON	So that creates a big, wide band.	12	1
201506	719	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that questioning has exhausted what I wanted to say, Madam Chair.	12	1
201506	720	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks.	12	1
201506	721	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12	1
201506	722	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Other comments or questions?	12	1
201506	723	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	12	1
201506	724	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, why don’t we begin our go-round on the economy.	13	1
201506	725	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll start with President Williams.	13	1
201506	726	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I won’t talk about r*.	13	1
201506	727	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	728	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I view the very weak reading on first-quarter real GDP growth as mostly anomalous, with essentially no signal about the underlying pace of growth for the rest of this year or next year.	13	1
201506	729	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s clear—and I think the Board analysis and the Tealbook did a very nice job on this—that a variety of transitory special factors were at work, although the precise quantification and when they will be offset in later quarters is still open to quite some debate.	13	1
201506	730	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Like others, my staff has examined this issue and found that imperfect measurement of seasonal patterns played a large role in depressing reported Q1 numbers.	13	1
201506	731	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Most of this residual seasonality appears to be caused by the BEA’s bottom-up methodology that seasonally adjusts the individual subcomponents of GDP but not the aggregate number directly.	13	1
201506	732	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the BEA uses this procedure to create the national income accounts.	13	1
201506	733	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	They are logically consistent at every level of disaggregation, and that makes perfect sense for their purposes, but for monetary policy purposes, it’s more useful to have the most accurate top-line measure of the broad economy.	13	1
201506	734	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	That is, it’s best to focus on eliminating seasonality in the aggregate GDP series and not worry so much about how the subcomponents should be adjusted.	13	1
201506	735	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	To provide such a top-line correction to the data, my staff conducted their own second- round seasonal adjustment of the published data on three measures of aggregate growth:  GDP; GDI; and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s GDPplus measure, which is a smoothed combination of GDP and GDI.	13	1
201506	736	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	After this correction, GDP is estimated to have grown about 1½ percent in Q1, GDI about 3 percent, and GDPplus about 2¾ percent.	13	1
201506	737	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Based on these corrected numbers and relative to a trend growth rate of 2 percent or even lower, I am hard- pressed to describe the first-quarter growth really as weak or lackluster or disappointing.	13	1
201506	738	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	In addition, the second round of seasonal adjustment informs about when the residual seasonality that acts to understate Q1 will be balanced by overstated growth later this year.	13	1
201506	739	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	While the Tealbook assumes the unwinding of special factors will result in stronger Q2 growth, my staff’s estimates push most of the overstatement of growth into the third quarter.	13	1
201506	740	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	What does that mean?	13	1
201506	741	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	It means we shouldn’t be looking for a Q2 spike in growth.	13	1
201506	742	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Instead, most of the seasonal effect will likely show up in an elevated Q3 growth rate.	13	1
201506	743	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, looking at the more recent data since Q1, recent spending indicators have generally been moving in the right direction and are pointing to, I think, a solid trajectory for growth and good momentum.	13	1
201506	744	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	We got some very important, positive news on the economy on Sunday night.	13	1
201506	745	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	That is, of course, the Warriors game.	13	1
201506	746	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13	1
201506	747	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	For anyone who has experienced this with me before, you can imagine there’s nothing more dangerous than a Federal Reserve Bank president with a calculator, Haver database, and Wikipedia.	13	1
201506	748	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I have the data here, and the Warriors and the Cavaliers are in the NBA championship.	13	1
201506	749	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The Warriors have actually played in three previous championships and won three previous championships, and I’ve collected the data on what happens to GDP growth in the year following a Warriors championship.	13	1
201506	750	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	By the way, Blake, two of those were in Philadelphia.	13	1
201506	751	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Average real GDP growth in the year following a Warriors championship is 3.9 percent.	13	1
201506	752	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I did look into the database to see what would happen following a Cavaliers championship, but, of course, there is a lack of data.	13	1
201506	753	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13	1
201506	754	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, I think we all bring our parochial interests to the table around our sports teams, but we can all agree—for the good of the economy and to reduce the uncertainty regarding a Cavaliers victory—we should all be supporting the Warriors tonight in what I expect to be the final game of the series.	13	1
201506	755	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	All in all, with solid underlying momentum in fundamentals, I expect growth to average about 2¾ percent over the next several quarters or perhaps even higher, then slow to a more sustainable pace.	13	1
201506	756	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I see consumer spending as a primary driver of growth, supported by elevated household wealth and solid income gains owing to rising employment and higher wages.	13	1
201506	757	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	In that regard, I am encouraged by the signs of a pickup in compensation growth, with private-sector ECI up about 2¾ percent over the past year.	13	1
201506	758	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And employer costs for employee compensation are up about 5½ percent over the last year, suggesting solid growth and higher-paying jobs.	13	1
201506	759	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	This rise in income seems to have buoyed the spirits of households as well, and we saw the pickup or the rise in expected income growth reported recently in the Michigan survey.	13	1
201506	760	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced.	13	1
201506	761	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Many have mentioned the unsettling crosscurrents coming from abroad.	13	1
201506	762	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	We heard about the situation in Greece, but obviously I hear a lot also about Asia and China.	13	1
201506	763	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	With regard to Asia, I was largely reassured during my recent trip to Singapore, then Hong Kong, then Beijing, where I was joined by Governor Powell.	13	1
201506	764	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Our discussions with Asian policymakers suggested that emerging market economies are acutely focused on a US monetary policy liftoff.	13	1
201506	765	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Rest assured everyone asked about that.	13	1
201506	766	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And there was some concern about a “tightening tantrum,” in which there is fallout from spikes in market volatility and capital flows.	13	1
201506	767	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	But the general assessment was that US policy normalization has been well telegraphed.	13	1
201506	768	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	In addition, the taper tantrum of 2013 has served as a warning to leaders in the region, and they appear to be prepared to cope with any resulting effects on capital flows.	13	1
201506	769	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	We also found policymakers in China ready and willing to do whatever it takes to ensure strong growth in that country.	13	1
201506	770	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	For example, the indications that their growth projection might slip from 7.1 percent to 7.0 percent fostered consideration of additional stimulatory policy initiatives.	13	1
201506	771	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, the central Chinese government recently reversed a policy intended to add discipline to local government borrowing when it became concerned that this would damp infrastructure spending and growth.	13	1
201506	772	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	With regard to the US labor market, I expect the unemployment rate to fall below my 5.2 percent estimate of the natural rate by the end of the year.	13	1
201506	773	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The standard U-3 measure of unemployment is aligned with other measures of slack as well, such as the broader U-4 and U-5 measures of labor market underutilization, which include people not actively searching for a job but available and interested in work.	13	1
201506	774	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s actually interesting to see that, unlike earlier points in the recession and the recovery, U-4 and U-5 are no longer indicating greater slack than does U-3.	13	1
201506	775	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, using all the available data back to 1994, the current levels of U-4 and U-5 are identical to their historical averages for all months when the unemployment rate was at its current level of 5½ percent.	13	1
201506	776	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	In contrast, the broadest U-6 measure of labor underutilization, which includes involuntary part-time workers, is about 1 percentage point higher than its average during months where U-3 was 5½ percent.	13	1
201506	777	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	My staff has examined the factors behind the elevated level of involuntary part-time jobs using state-level data.	13	1
201506	778	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	They find that much of the earlier increase in involuntary part-time jobs was explained by cyclical factors.	13	1
201506	779	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, they also uncovered some evidence of an important role for changes in the compositional features of the labor market, most notably the industry job shares and workforce demographics, that help explain the elevated level of involuntary part-time jobs today.	13	1
201506	780	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, these more persistent compositional factors account for much of the currently elevated number of involuntary part-timers beyond what one would expect on the basis of the 5½ percent unemployment rate.	13	1
201506	781	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Based on these findings, I conclude that the signal about slack given by U-6 is roughly in line with the evidence from the other measures of unemployment.	13	1
201506	782	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Further supporting evidence for there being a relatively modest degree of slack in the labor market is provided by the pickup in several measures of employee compensation, as mentioned earlier.	13	1
201506	783	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The historical pattern is that nominal wage growth doesn’t really shift up until late in the recovery when the economy is approaching full employment.	13	1
201506	784	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And we’re, I think, getting to that stage now, and I think the compensation data are following the usual script in that regard.	13	1
201506	785	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	To sum up, my view is that numerous indicators point to some slack still being out there in the labor market, but likely no more than implied by the U-3 unemployment measure.	13	1
201506	786	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	With regard to inflation, I continue to anticipate that we will achieve our 2 percent inflation objective by the end of next year.	13	1
201506	787	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Certainly the stars are aligned for such a return, with oil prices edging higher, the dollar edging lower, and, importantly, full employment in sight.	13	1
201506	788	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Still, there is no question that we are in a global environment of very low inflation, and the actual data—inflation data—have yet to provide a clear signal that we are on track.	13	1
201506	789	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, for me, the key outstanding issue for policy is obtaining more confidence that inflation will make a timely return to 2 percent, and for that we will just need to see more data.	13	1
201506	790	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13	1
201506	791	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201506	792	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	13	1
201506	793	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	794	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	My forecast does not have a “Golden State” adjustment factor, so it’s not quite as optimistic as President Williams’s.	13	1
201506	795	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	My SEP submission does not differ significantly from the Tealbook forecast and has not changed much from the March meeting, although I assume in this submission that the first tightening will be in the fourth quarter, not in September.	13	1
201506	796	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	The biggest change from my previous submission is the marking down of 2015 real GDP growth to reflect the weak data we received for the first half of this year.	13	1
201506	797	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	The data bearing on second-quarter real GDP growth have been surprisingly weak after allowing for the fact that the bounceback from the array of first-quarter special factors is likely artificially elevating reported growth for the current quarter.	13	1
201506	798	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	If the Tealbook adjustment to transitory factors is accurate, second-quarter growth adjusted for these factors may fall short of potential growth.	13	1
201506	799	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Put differently, the weather and other transitory factors only partly explain the weakness in the first half of the year, since data both before and after the winter storms have remained relatively weak.	13	1
201506	800	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Although the May retail sales numbers and revisions to earlier months provide some comfort that consumption will not be particularly weak this quarter, it remains slower than I would expect on the basis of its strong fundamental drivers.	13	1
201506	801	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	The apparent desire of consumers to save rather than spend the windfall generated by lower oil prices puts at risk the consumer-led recovery that I and many others foresaw at the time of the March SEP submission.	13	1
201506	802	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	The May payroll employment report provides further evidence of healing labor markets.	13	1
201506	803	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, I am cautious about the labor market outlook for several reasons.	13	1
201506	804	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	The unemployment rate has, at least for the moment, leveled off at 5½ percent—basically unchanged since February.	13	1
201506	805	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Under my projection of only moderate growth in the second half of this year, we will likely return only gradually to my 5 percent estimate of the full-employment unemployment rate.	13	1
201506	806	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is notable that the labor market conditions index shown in the Tealbook indicates only modest growth in the first quarter and is negative for the average of the first two months of this quarter.	13	1
201506	807	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Although I would not take too literally the magnitude of the change in labor market conditions implied by the LMCI, I would interpret the index as indicating some slowdown in labor market conditions relative to last year.	13	1
201506	808	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	And, of course, the labor market conditions would likely slow further if we do not see the expected pickup in growth in the second half of this year.	13	1
201506	809	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Progress on returning inflation to its 2 percent target over the forecast horizon remains disappointing.	13	1
201506	810	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Core PCE inflation over the past year is currently at 1.2 percent, well below what many of us were forecasting at the beginning of this year.	13	1
201506	811	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Sifting through the various indicators of price pressures provides little evidence that prices have yet begun trending toward 2 percent.	13	1
201506	812	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is still possible that transitory factors, such as exchange rate and energy pass-through, are playing a noticeable role, and that once these factors fade, progress toward our inflation goal will occur.	13	1
201506	813	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, I place some weight on the possibility that the current low inflation readings reflect an anchoring of inflation expectations below our 2 percent target.	13	1
201506	814	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Another possibility is that the equilibrium unemployment rate is running below my estimate of 5 percent.	13	1
201506	815	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	In light of the uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook, policy guidance should not just rely, as it does now, on being “reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its forecasts that indicate such a return is in train.	13	1
201506	816	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	In a sense, that is why we have moved to data dependence in our policy decisions.	13	1
201506	817	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	To be specific, becoming reasonably confident that we will trend toward 2 percent inflation requires evidence that core PCE inflation is closer to the 1½ percent growth that we had been expecting earlier this year, that real growth is growing faster than we have seen so far in the first half of this year, and that the growth is sufficiently high to produce a further tightening in labor markets.	13	1
201506	818	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	There have been significant benefits to being as patient as we have been to date.	13	1
201506	819	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Broader measures of unemployment have continued to improve, though they still remain elevated.	13	1
201506	820	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Tighter labor markets are beginning to provide modest evidence of a gradual increase in nominal wages and compensation.	13	1
201506	821	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	And we have not tightened financial conditions at a time when Europe is going through a particularly difficult time.	13	1
201506	822	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	823	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201506	824	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13	1
201506	825	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	826	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	My base-case economic and policy outlook has growth resuming in the second quarter and accelerating to around 3 percent in the third and fourth quarters.	13	1
201506	827	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	My base case has job gains continuing at a healthy rate in excess of 200,000 per month and other labor market data indicating that tightening continues.	13	1
201506	828	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	The base case has household spending picking up in the second quarter, coincident with an acceleration of wage and income growth.	13	1
201506	829	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	And, finally, my base case has core inflation at least stable, near-term inflation data showing slight firming, and inflation expectations remaining stable.	13	1
201506	830	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I have been processing both anecdotal inputs and incoming data using this simple test: Does the information, on balance, support my outlook or cast doubt on it?	13	1
201506	831	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Although there are some encouraging signs, not quite enough conclusive evidence has yet accumulated to give me adequate comfort that my outlook is achievable.	13	1
201506	832	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	So let me survey quickly some of the information I have put through this test.	13	1
201506	833	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Our contacts with the business community in my District over the intermeeting period pointed to a somewhat slow, but not unsatisfactory, second quarter.	13	1
201506	834	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Sentiment about the pace of business activity in the second half remains positive, with a hint of caution.	13	1
201506	835	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	The St Louis and Atlanta Bank boards met together last week.	13	1
201506	836	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	And President Bullard may have different “takeaways,” but I noted that most directors in attendance indicated they believe the first-quarter weakness was an anomaly, but most—or a majority—would not entirely dismiss the possibility of a prolonged period of weak growth.	13	1
201506	837	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Those contacts in my District exposed to overseas demand and the dollar exchange value continue to report negative effects.	13	1
201506	838	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Our port contacts reported a sharp drop-off in export traffic.	13	1
201506	839	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Because of the importance of strong consumer spending to my forecast, I have been especially attentive in this recent cycle to reports on the consumer.	13	1
201506	840	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Last week’s positive retail spending report was a step in the right direction.	13	1
201506	841	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Contacts tied to the new car market continue to report exceptionally brisk sales, along with strong production activity.	13	1
201506	842	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	But soft-goods retailers continue to see lackluster sales growth, and many expressed disappointment that this year’s lower gasoline prices have yet to translate into a stronger appetite for nondurables.	13	1
201506	843	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	At the same time, we heard a belief on the part of casual dining and tourism contacts that lower fuel prices are contributing to some strengthening in their sectors.	13	1
201506	844	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	The picture that comes through is one of a discriminating consumer who is spending very selectively.	13	1
201506	845	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Perhaps the most significant change of sentiment since the previous meeting relates to labor markets.	13	1
201506	846	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	The assessment of our District contacts of labor market conditions moved this cycle strongly toward a general description of labor markets as “tight.”	13	1
201506	847	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	This view was broad based.	13	1
201506	848	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard more mentions than in the recent past of firms having to boost starting wages to attract new hires, make counteroffers to retain employees, and compete with more liberal benefits and bonus incentives.	13	1
201506	849	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Those not yet experiencing these broad pressures noted the inevitability of rising wages.	13	1
201506	850	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Overall, I interpret the weight of recent anecdotal inputs from my District contacts as supporting my base case.	13	1
201506	851	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I won’t belabor the evidence of all of the recent incoming data, but I’ll mention those that have most influenced my reading of the economy.	13	1
201506	852	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Early in this quarter, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow tracking model was showing second-quarter GDP growth more consistent with the weak first quarter than the hoped-for bounceback.	13	1
201506	853	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	With the recent trade, jobs, and retail sales reports, our tracker rose markedly and now has second-quarter growth just short of 2 percent.	13	1
201506	854	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	This rise is encouraging, but we still have second-quarter growth in our forecast at this point at around a 2 percent annual pace—well below what I was looking for.	13	1
201506	855	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	The first half still looks weak.	13	1
201506	856	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	A wage growth measure recently constructed by my staff that builds on the methods of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco indicates that nominal wage growth is picking up.	13	1
201506	857	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	We conclude that the improved ECI numbers posted in the first quarter will likely move even higher this quarter.	13	1
201506	858	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	These indications of wage growth, combined with our latest anecdotal feedback on the subject, form the main reason I believe my base case remains on track.	13	1
201506	859	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Employing a dashboard approach to inflation, I’ve been somewhat encouraged by indications that shorter-horizon PCE and CPI measures have been firming from their 12-month readings.	13	1
201506	860	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I’ve noted that the recent pickup in the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ trimmed mean PCE measure and the market-based core PCE number.	13	1
201506	861	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I take the recent data in general as encouraging.	13	1
201506	862	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	As regards my official forecast for this meeting, I lowered my 2015 growth estimate to account for the soft first-quarter number but otherwise haven’t materially changed the projection from that I submitted in March.	13	1
201506	863	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	My growth projection is ½ percentage point above the revised Tealbook outlook for the year and about 25 basis points higher in 2016 and 2017.	13	1
201506	864	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I have inflation running about 25 basis points above the Tealbook over the forecast horizon.	13	1
201506	865	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I have the risks to my outlook as balanced for inflation but to the downside for growth, reflecting in part the global economy.	13	1
201506	866	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	867	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201506	868	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	First Vice President Prichard.	13	1
201506	869	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	870	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Economic activity in the Third District continues to grow modestly.	13	1
201506	871	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Our latest Business Outlook Survey, which will be published on Thursday morning of this week, indicates that manufacturing conditions improved in June.	13	1
201506	872	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Roughly twice as many respondents reported an increase in activity as indicated a decline in activity.	13	1
201506	873	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	The current employment index edged down a bit for both May and June but remains positive.	13	1
201506	874	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	The indexes for current prices paid and received turned positive in June after several months of negative readings that were largely due to the decline in energy prices and the strong dollar.	13	1
201506	875	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Contacts continue to be optimistic regarding the near term, as reflected in the index of future general activity.	13	1
201506	876	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Fully half of our participants expect an increase in the level of business activity in the next six months, with relatively few forecasting any decline.	13	1
201506	877	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Conditions in the District’s labor markets continue to improve.	13	1
201506	878	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Employment growth edged up 1.8 percent in April and labor force participation rose as well, leaving the unemployment rate roughly unchanged.	13	1
201506	879	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Another bright spot in the region is our service sector: The Nonmanufacturing Business Outlook Survey index for current conditions increased substantially in May and remains elevated.	13	1
201506	880	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Respondents also continue to be optimistic about all future activities.	13	1
201506	881	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Anecdotal evidence from our contacts also correctly anticipated the strong retail sales report for May.	13	1
201506	882	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	The multifamily sector led a modest rebound in the housing market in April, with a healthy 3.5 percent increase in the value of residential construction.	13	1
201506	883	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	However, the overall housing market remains quite depressed.	13	1
201506	884	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Single-family permits declined further in April and have been, at best, flat for about the past two years.	13	1
201506	885	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	With the exception of Philadelphia itself, April existing home sales are reported to have slowed in most of the urban areas in our District.	13	1
201506	886	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Contacts report that homebuilding activity was subdued in May.	13	1
201506	887	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	House prices appreciated moderately in April, definitely behind the pace of the nation as a whole.	13	1
201506	888	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Turning to the nation as a whole, we agree with many of President Williams’s observations, especially concerning the seasonal adjustments to GDP—not so much the forecast for the NBA.	13	1
201506	889	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	But we view the decline in GDP in the first quarter as mainly reflecting temporary factors and problems with seasonal adjustment, which I reported at the previous meeting and, again, President Williams expanded on today.	13	1
201506	890	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	So I remain optimistic that the economy will rebound in the second quarter and the second half of the year.	13	1
201506	891	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Indeed, the data on retail and vehicle sales for May suggest the rebound in consumer spending may already be under way.	13	1
201506	892	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	After marking down real GDP growth for the first half of the year, I see real GDP growth picking up in the second half and growing at 2 percent for the year as a whole.	13	1
201506	893	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	I foresee growth in 2016 slightly above trend at 2.7 percent and then gradually returning to longer-run GDP growth of 2.4 percent in 2017.	13	1
201506	894	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	I expect the unemployment rate to decline to my estimate of the natural rate of about 5.2 percent by the end of this year and to fall slightly further in 2016 and 2017.	13	1
201506	895	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Inflation gradually returns to the FOMC’s target over my forecast, although headline inflation runs at only 0.8 percent through 2015 after being flat in the first half due to the fall in energy prices.	13	1
201506	896	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	In 2016, inflation accelerates to 1.8 percent and settles at 2 percent at the end of 2017.	13	1
201506	897	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	My view of appropriate monetary policy now envisions a start to normalization in September of this year, with a gradual tightening of policy throughout the forecast horizon.	13	1
201506	898	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	I anticipate a federal funds rate of 0.63 percent by the end of this year, 2.1 percent by the end of 2016, and 3.63 percent in 2017, which is close to my long-run value of the federal funds rate of 3.75 percent.	13	1
201506	899	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	900	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201506	901	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	First Vice President Holcomb.	13	1
201506	902	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	903	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Like the staff, I may be viewed as letting hope triumph in assessing the Eleventh District economy, but there is more positive news about the Eleventh District than there was at the time of the previous meeting, and we are heartened by the strength of the Texas economy as we face multiple challenges.	13	1
201506	904	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Texas employment expanded in April after having declined in March.	13	1
201506	905	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Year to date, this puts us at an annualized growth rate of just under 1 percent.	13	1
201506	906	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	This compares with 2014 growth of 3.6 percent and long-run average growth of 2.1 percent.	13	1
201506	907	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Initial jobless claims fell for the second straight month after big increases in the late fall and early winter, and the unemployment rate has held steady at an expansion-low 4.2 percent.	13	1
201506	908	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Our Texas Leading Index was up in April, too, after seven straight months of declines.	13	1
201506	909	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Of course, employment is still falling in areas like Houston that are closely tied to the energy industry.	13	1
201506	910	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	We believe conditions in those regions will get worse before they get better.	13	1
201506	911	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	And the May jobs number, when it comes, may show a negative effect from the rain and flooding that we’ve had in our region.	13	1
201506	912	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	According to one Texas retailer, wet weather reduced sales by 12 percent through May.	13	1
201506	913	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	On the other hand, in a nice example of how every dark cloud has a silver lining, an auto dealer told us sales are up because of the many cars that were damaged by hail and flooding.	13	1
201506	914	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	And the Texas drought is officially over, which will benefit agriculture and beef production and is also good news for oyster lovers.	13	1
201506	915	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	As one of our directors reported, the oyster harvest suffers when salt levels are too high, as has been the case along the Texas coast because of low rainfall.	13	1
201506	916	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	The heavy rains this spring will boost oyster production over the next two to three years.	13	1
201506	917	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Seventy percent of oysters consumed in the United States come from the Gulf Coast.	13	1
201506	918	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	The current conditions of our Manufacturing and Service Sector Outlook Surveys deteriorated in May.	13	1
201506	919	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	At 13.5, the manufacturing production index is now at the lowest level in six years.	13	1
201506	920	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	The service sector revenue index remains in positive territory but moved sharply lower.	13	1
201506	921	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Aided by somewhat higher oil prices and a decline in energy price uncertainty, indexes measuring expected future business conditions generally improved.	13	1
201506	922	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	The future-oriented survey questions asked about conditions six months from now, but respondents typically see only two to three months ahead.	13	1
201506	923	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Hence, respondents appear to expect improvement by late summer.	13	1
201506	924	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	In the meantime, it’s definitely the service sector that is keeping our regional economy afloat.	13	1
201506	925	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Employment in private-sector producing industries in Texas has grown 2.2 percent year to date, while the goods sector has contracted over 5 percent.	13	1
201506	926	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	All eyes not scanning the heavens for signs of still more rain are focused on trends in the oil and gas industry.	13	1
201506	927	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	The general feeling is that while there may be further declines in drilling in the near term, the worst will soon be over.	13	1
201506	928	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	The Texas rig count is falling at a much reduced pace, and rig counts in neighboring states have bottomed out.	13	1
201506	929	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	US oil production has continued to expand despite the smaller number of rigs in operation.	13	1
201506	930	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Indeed, the Energy Information Administration has increased its 2015 production growth estimate from 6.4 percent to 8.3 percent since our most recent meeting.	13	1
201506	931	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	In the words of one of our directors, “Our guns are still blazing.”	13	1
201506	932	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Contacts suggest two explanations.	13	1
201506	933	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	First, drilling costs are down sharply—20 to 30 percent since the beginning of the year—reflecting a buyer’s market for oilfield equipment and services and strong efficiency gains.	13	1
201506	934	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Completion times have fallen from 30 days to 2 weeks or less, in some cases to as little as 4 days.	13	1
201506	935	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Second, responding to increases in the spot price of oil and the flattening of the futures price path, firms have begun drawing down the so-called fracklog of drilled but uncompleted wells, bringing them into production.	13	1
201506	936	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	According to a Dallas- based consultant, these drawdowns could add another 375,000 barrels per day to US oil output over the next six months—about 4 percent of total US production.	13	1
201506	937	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Continued high domestic oil production coupled with increases in production overseas raises the prospect of a world supply overhang.	13	1
201506	938	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Our contacts see downside risks for energy prices in the near term but increases to about $70 per barrel in mid-2016.	13	1
201506	939	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	The EIA is less optimistic from a producer perspective and has revised its own 2016 WTI price forecast downward from $70 to $62.	13	1
201506	940	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Market measures of oil price uncertainty have diminished, but implied confidence bands remain wide.	13	1
201506	941	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Our projections of GDP growth, unemployment, and core inflation, prepared by macroeconomists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, are within the central tendency of the latest SEP projections for every year between 2015 and 2017, and in the longer run.	13	1
201506	942	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	They are more optimistic than the Tealbook baseline forecasts.	13	1
201506	943	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	It’s our belief that accommodative financial conditions will drive the unemployment rate past the natural rate late this year to reach 2 percent and low and shrinking labor market slack, trimmed mean PCE inflation rises to 1¾ percent by early 2016 and averages 2 percent for the year as a whole.	13	1
201506	944	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Our inflation forecasting approach has done well over the course of the recovery.	13	1
201506	945	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	In particular, it has not systematically overpredicted inflation as one would expect if longer-term inflation expectations had slipped below 2 percent or if the unemployment rate had been understating slack.	13	1
201506	946	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	With the unemployment rate falling faster and further than in the Tealbook and inflation rising faster and further, it should come as no surprise that we see the data as warranting a relatively steep trajectory for the federal funds rate, as will be discussed tomorrow.	13	1
201506	947	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Thank you.	13	1
201506	948	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201506	949	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13	1
201506	950	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	951	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	I hope I don’t give anybody the wrong impression, but I really did enjoy Helen’s forecast on Gulf oysters just now.	13	1
201506	952	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	13	1
201506	953	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	And since President Williams has continued his tradition of cherry-picking sports championship data, I just wanted to point out that last night Chicago won the Stanley Cup, and—wait for it—yes, Madam Chair, there are Hawks in Chicago.	13	1
201506	954	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	13	1
201506	955	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	I’d like to commend the staff for some really terrific analyses in the most recent Tealbook and the presentation today.	13	1
201506	956	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	I got a lot out of your clear discussion of the equilibrium real interest rate today and in the memos.	13	1
201506	957	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	The reports from my directors and other business contacts were pretty similar to those from last time.	13	1
201506	958	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Most continue to expect a pickup in growth in the second half of the year, but their degree of conviction does not seem particularly high, and their spending plans seem to reflect this wariness.	13	1
201506	959	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	For example, the CEO of United Airlines reported that business travel was weak at all the major carriers.	13	1
201506	960	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	And I also heard a number of comments that, taking into account the slow growth in demand, CEOs in general currently do not foresee much need, over the next 6 to 12 months, for ramping up capital investment or hiring.	13	1
201506	961	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	But the moods seem more like continued caution than actual anxiety regarding any slowing.	13	1
201506	962	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, I did hear a few relatively optimistic reports.	13	1
201506	963	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	One came from Caterpillar, who said some of their oilfield equipment customers had become more positive about their ability to operate profitably now that the price of oil seems to be stabilizing at around $60 per barrel.	13	1
201506	964	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	And the auto sector is pretty upbeat.	13	1
201506	965	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Demand has been strong, causing Ford and some others to push up their light vehicle sales forecast for the year to around 17 million units, which is a bit above the Tealbook forecast.	13	1
201506	966	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	But if we are looking for boosts to consumer spending over the next few years, it probably won’t be coming from autos.	13	1
201506	967	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	The sector already has contributed very strongly to this recovery.	13	1
201506	968	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	It’s running at a high level, and at 17 million units, it’s hard to imagine that there can be much upside vehicle demand that’s going to add to GDP growth.	13	1
201506	969	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	With regard to inflation, I didn’t hear any meaningful new reports of wage or price pressures from my contacts.	13	1
201506	970	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, steel and other commodity prices remained low, which could present some downside risk to the inflation outlook.	13	1
201506	971	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	My own forecast is pretty similar to what I’ve been hearing from my business contacts.	13	1
201506	972	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	I’m cautiously optimistic about better growth and continued labor market improvements in the quarters ahead.	13	1
201506	973	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Of course, Federal Reserve forecasting credibility has taken a beating throughout this recovery, as our optimism in January has given way to much more subdued actual growth outcomes, although I’m looking forward to the public pronouncement of President Williams’s seasonal adjustment on the first-quarter GDP data—maybe that will change things.	13	1
201506	974	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	This forecasting reality is another reason to temper our more enthusiastic projections.	13	1
201506	975	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	And on inflation, I’m not optimistic at all.	13	1
201506	976	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	I don’t see inflation rising to target in anything like a reasonable time frame.	13	1
201506	977	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Turning to the specifics, our projection of GDP has growth running between 2½ and 2¾ percent over the remainder of this year and next.	13	1
201506	978	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Our assumptions regarding potential output growth are somewhat stronger than the Tealbook’s, so this GDP path translates into a similar reduction in resource gaps.	13	1
201506	979	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	And by the end of 2016, we have the unemployment rate down to around 5 percent, which is my current assessment of the natural rate.	13	1
201506	980	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	On the inflation front, the apparent stabilization of the dollar and oil prices have been favorable developments, as have been the recent increases in TIPS breakevens, although I would note that breakevens still remain well below their normal and year-ago levels.	13	1
201506	981	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	However, I’ve become less sanguine about the message from survey measures of long- term inflation expectations.	13	1
201506	982	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	For sure, the SPF 10-year outlook for PCE inflation has been remarkably stable despite many years of low actual inflation.	13	1
201506	983	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	One interpretation is that these professionals simply write down our announced 2 percent target for 10 years out.	13	1
201506	984	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	But there is another inflation measure that the SPF regularly reports—namely, the 10-year CPI forecast—and this tells a different story.	13	1
201506	985	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	This 10-year CPI forecast has become more volatile since the crisis, but generally it has trended down.	13	1
201506	986	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	And on net over the past three years, it’s fallen more than 30 basis points and is now about 2.1 percent.	13	1
201506	987	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Given the usual 35 to 40 basis point wedge between PCE and CPI, the two SPF 10-year forecasts seem at odds, and that is troubling.	13	1
201506	988	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	What’s more, this downward drift in the SPF long-run CPI outlook has an important influence on the inflation forecast produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago’s DSGE model.	13	1
201506	989	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Our model includes a time-varying unobserved inflation benchmark.	13	1
201506	990	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	This benchmark acts as a long-run attractor for the path of inflation.	13	1
201506	991	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	As I understand it, the Tealbook inflation forecast is informed by a similar type of stochastic trend.	13	1
201506	992	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	The 10-year SPF CPI forecast is an important factor informing the Chicago model’s inflation benchmark.	13	1
201506	993	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	However, there are many shocks that can cause the benchmark to deviate from the SPF.	13	1
201506	994	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	In other words, there’s plenty of scope in the model for the downward drift in the SPF CPI expectations to be explained by shocks that do not affect benchmark inflation and, hence, would not show through in the model’s longer-run inflation forecast.	13	1
201506	995	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	However, that does not turn out to be the case right now.	13	1
201506	996	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	The model currently interprets the SPF 10-year CPIs and other incoming data as a string of mostly negative shocks to the inflation benchmark that have pulled this measure down almost 25 basis points over the past couple of years.	13	1
201506	997	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	These shocks have long-lasting effects in the model.	13	1
201506	998	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	As a result, the model’s PCE inflation forecast is significantly below our 2 percent target for many years to come.	13	1
201506	999	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	According to this analysis, the low inflation we’ve experienced the past several years has already fed through into public perceptions, which is making it more difficult for us to achieve our inflation objective.	13	1
201506	1000	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	On the basis of this DSGE work, projections from other models that we’ve run, and commentary from my business contacts, I’m having a hard time writing down a forecast that gets inflation returning to target within a reasonable time frame.	13	1
201506	1001	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	My projection has PCE inflation getting back to just 1.7 percent by the end of 2017, and I can see important downside risks to this forecast.	13	1
201506	1002	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	1003	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201506	1004	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	13	1
201506	1005	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	1006	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	My esteemed colleague from the Twelfth District has argued that you should root for the Golden State Warriors because in the year after a Warriors championship, GDP growth tends to be high.	13	1
201506	1007	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	But I want to let you know that it’s perfectly fine for you to root for the Cleveland Cavaliers, and I would encourage you to do so, because any good central banker knows that correlation does not imply causation.	13	1
201506	1008	2015-06-17	meeting		[Laughter]	13	1
201506	1009	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	So let me talk about the Fourth District.	13	1
201506	1010	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	The Fourth District economy is recovering from the first-quarter pause in economic activity.	13	1
201506	1011	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Contacts outside energy, development, and extraction as well as their suppliers generally report a pickup in activity in the second quarter.	13	1
201506	1012	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Commercial construction contacts were particularly upbeat, reporting a broad-based recovery.	13	1
201506	1013	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	The auto sector is also one of the very bright spots, and bankers noted that demand for business and consumer credit continued to increase.	13	1
201506	1014	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	One of our directors, who runs a community bank, says his customers see the economy as back to normal, with one likening it to riding a bicycle without any hills:  boring, but pretty comfortable.	13	1
201506	1015	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Our survey of District business contacts across all sectors yielded a diffusion index of contacts reporting better versus worse conditions that improved substantially in June to 36 percent from the near 20 percent level seen in March and April.	13	1
201506	1016	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Conditions in the District’s labor markets continue to improve.	13	1
201506	1017	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	For the year ending in April, District payrolls grew at 1.3 percent.	13	1
201506	1018	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	This pace has been edging up since the start of 2014.	13	1
201506	1019	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	The growth rate is slower than the 2.2 percent seen in the nation, but that’s typical.	13	1
201506	1020	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Regional employment growth has been slower than the US average in recovery since the 1980s.	13	1
201506	1021	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Over the first four months of the year, the Fourth District unemployment rate has been stable at around 5.2 percent, lower than the national rate of 5.5 percent.	13	1
201506	1022	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	The responses from nearly 100 firms that the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland staff contacted as part of the Federal Reserve special survey on hiring plans and compensation indicate that demand for workers remains solid—63 percent of our respondents expect to increase employment over the next 12 months.	13	1
201506	1023	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	This is the highest share from the five comparable surveys conducted since January 2012.	13	1
201506	1024	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Only 8 percent of respondents said they expected to decrease employment over the coming year.	13	1
201506	1025	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Across five broad sectors, real estate and construction, retail, and business services showed the strongest hiring plans, while banking and industrial producers showed somewhat less strength.	13	1
201506	1026	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	In terms of compensation, 66 percent of contacts who reported increasing starting wages are doing so only in selected occupations, including engineering and IT.	13	1
201506	1027	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Anecdotal reports from our business contacts indicate that, in some cases, these wage increases have been significant.	13	1
201506	1028	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Somewhat more than one-half of the contacts reported that over the past 12 months, their ability to retain employees has remained unchanged, but over one-third said it has become harder.	13	1
201506	1029	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Some firms are raising prices to pass on some of their cost increases, but, in general, price pressures remain stable.	13	1
201506	1030	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	For the national economy, my read of the incoming data since our most recent meeting is that the data are consistent with the first-quarter weakness having been largely due to temporary factors, including the severe winter weather, the West Coast port strike, and seasonal adjustment issues.	13	1
201506	1031	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	And I want to compliment the staff on the box in the Tealbook, which I found quite useful in disentangling some of the special factors that contributed to the first-quarter pause.	13	1
201506	1032	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	The effect of other factors—like the earlier sharp drop in oil prices, which has caused the energy and mining sector to cut back activity, and the appreciation of the dollar, which has affected manufacturing and trade—are not likely to reverse quickly.	13	1
201506	1033	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	But over the last few months, energy prices have stabilized and the appreciation of the dollar has slowed, and this should help lessen the drags on these sectors.	13	1
201506	1034	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Our nowcast has second-quarter GDP growth rebounding, as a number of monthly indicators have improved.	13	1
201506	1035	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	One area that has been a concern is the extent to which the weakness in first-quarter consumption would linger, but May light vehicle sales and retail sales point to strengthening consumer spending.	13	1
201506	1036	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Activity in residential investment is also accelerating.	13	1
201506	1037	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Labor markets continue to improve.	13	1
201506	1038	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	The two employment reports we’ve received since our most recent meeting show solid growth of nonfarm payrolls and further reductions in labor underutilization.	13	1
201506	1039	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Initial claims for unemployment insurance are quite low, and the JOLTS job openings rate reached a new cyclical high in April.	13	1
201506	1040	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	In addition, by a number of measures, nominal wages and labor compensation are beginning to pick up.	13	1
201506	1041	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	In my view, we are near our goal of maximum employment.	13	1
201506	1042	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Despite the first-quarter slowdown, the fundamentals supporting the expansion remain sound.	13	1
201506	1043	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	These include improving household balance sheets, strengthening labor markets, and highly accommodative monetary policy.	13	1
201506	1044	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Being a data-dependent central banker and in light of the weakness in the first quarter, I’ve reduced the growth rate for 2015 in my baseline projections.	13	1
201506	1045	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	But I continue to see growth picking up over the remainder of the year to about 3 percent late this year and next before slowing to my estimate of trend growth in 2017.	13	1
201506	1046	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	I expect consumer spending to pick up, supported by gains in employment and income.	13	1
201506	1047	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Although we haven’t seen much of a response yet, I continue to expect lower energy prices to help buoy consumer spending.	13	1
201506	1048	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland staff shows that across a range of statistical models, large reductions in oil and gasoline prices should give a sizable boost to consumer spending, although the timing of such a response varies depending on the model.	13	1
201506	1049	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	With above-trend growth later this year and next, I expect further improvements in labor markets, with the unemployment rate falling to 5.2 percent by the end of this year.	13	1
201506	1050	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	This is below my estimate of its longer-run level, which I put at 5½ percent.	13	1
201506	1051	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	This means the economy will no longer be underutilizing labor resources.	13	1
201506	1052	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	I note that this view is consistent with a number of slack measures provided by the Board staff on page 20 of Tealbook, Book A.	13	1
201506	1053	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	It’s also consistent with research by my staff that estimated the longer-run normal level of unemployment using five different conceptual approaches and found that the degree of underutilization of labor resources has been significantly reduced.	13	1
201506	1054	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	The news on inflation over the intermeeting period was positive.	13	1
201506	1055	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Inflation measures are moving higher in the second quarter, as oil prices have stabilized and some of the transitory factors weighing on core inflation have waned.	13	1
201506	1056	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s inflation nowcast has headline PCE inflation rebounding from a minus 2 percent annual rate in the first quarter to 1.9 percent in the second quarter, and core PCE inflation moving up from 0.8 percent to 1.4 percent.	13	1
201506	1057	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s median CPI rate has remained near 2.2 percent for the past seven months despite sharp movements in headline inflation rates and some softening in core inflation.	13	1
201506	1058	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	After dipping earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s 10-year inflation expectations edged up further in May to the levels seen last year, and survey measures of long-run inflation expectations have remained essentially unchanged.	13	1
201506	1059	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	The combination of stable inflation expectations, stabilizing oil prices, my forecast of above-trend growth, and further improvement in labor markets makes me reasonably confident that inflation will gradually return to our 2 percent target over the medium run by late 2016 or early 2017.	13	1
201506	1060	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	As I have discussed at earlier meetings, there is considerable uncertainty associated with any inflation forecast, including my own.	13	1
201506	1061	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	But based on Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland staff work, I do not see that uncertainty as being exceptionally elevated.	13	1
201506	1062	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	This is also consistent with the Board staff’s view, as indicated in Tealbook, Book A, on page 67.	13	1
201506	1063	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	My projection depends on appropriate policy.	13	1
201506	1064	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	In my view, we are very near or already at full employment, and I am reasonably confident that inflation will gradually return to our goal of 2 percent over the medium run.	13	1
201506	1065	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	So an economic case can be made for increasing the federal funds rate from essentially zero at this meeting.	13	1
201506	1066	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	But, as we haven’t prepared the markets and the public for that, I wouldn’t view it as appropriate policy.	13	1
201506	1067	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Instead, my projection incorporates liftoff in the third quarter and a gradual rise in interest rates thereafter throughout the forecast horizon.	13	1
201506	1068	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Of course, there are risks associated with my forecast—and with any forecast.	13	1
201506	1069	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Consumer and business spending may fail to pick up.	13	1
201506	1070	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	The positive developments in economic activity in Europe and Japan may not be sustained.	13	1
201506	1071	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	The Greek fiscal situation is still very uncertain.	13	1
201506	1072	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	In addition, we have recently seen some relatively large moves in the benchmark bond yields, with various explanations being offered.	13	1
201506	1073	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	As the economy gets closer to meeting the conditions we’ve set out for liftoff, I believe we should expect increased volatility in financial markets.	13	1
201506	1074	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Markets are becoming increasingly sensitive to our policy communications.	13	1
201506	1075	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	And as Governor Fischer has said, central bank communications can be a tricky business.	13	1
201506	1076	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	I’m glad that we’re focusing attention on this important issue, I appreciate the staff memo on communication at and after liftoff, and I will have more to say about this in the policy go-round.	13	1
201506	1077	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	1078	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201506	1079	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13	1
201506	1080	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	1081	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	In the midst of what looks like a weak first half for the US economy, we think that the data have, on balance, surprised to the upside over the last several weeks.	13	1
201506	1082	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	This gives us confidence that the economy will bounce back in the coming quarters in terms of GDP growth.	13	1
201506	1083	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	We think that measured GDP growth will average about 3 percent over the last three quarters of 2015, and that the unemployment rate will fall below 5 percent.	13	1
201506	1084	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	We continue to view the staff forecast for unemployment as not credible.	13	1
201506	1085	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	It calls for an unemployment rate at the end of 2017, two and a half years from today, just three-tenths lower than what it is today.	13	1
201506	1086	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	That’s more pessimistic on this dimension than the Blue Chip.	13	1
201506	1087	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	We think a more reasonable forecast calls for further cyclical improvement in unemployment and, indeed, in the associated labor market conditions index as well.	13	1
201506	1088	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	In the two expansions in the 1990s and 2000s, unemployment reached much lower levels.	13	1
201506	1089	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	Those expansions arguably featured much less monetary policy accommodation than we have in train today.	13	1
201506	1090	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	Anecdotal reports from around the Eighth District suggest that businesses remain generally optimistic for the remainder of this year.	13	1
201506	1091	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	A major hotel chain reported that the outlook for the travel and tourism industry is upbeat.	13	1
201506	1092	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	The furniture industry in northern Mississippi is expanding.	13	1
201506	1093	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	In the Louisville zone of the Eighth District, wages have increased 3½ percent from one year ago.	13	1
201506	1094	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	The District’s hiring plan survey indicates that two-thirds of businesses looking for new employees are raising starting salaries compared with a year ago.	13	1
201506	1095	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	These and other anecdotal reports, including those at the joint St Louis–Atlanta board meeting, give us confidence that the underlying growth in the US economy is relatively satisfactory, and that residual seasonality or other measurement error accounts for much of the apparent weakness in real GDP growth during the first half of 2015.	13	1
201506	1096	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	This view is consistent with the relatively strong labor market reports we have received so far this year.	13	1
201506	1097	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	Despite my relatively optimistic view of the US economy, the Committee has emphasized the data dependency of policy, and therefore I think it has been entirely appropriate for financial market participants and this Committee to push back the likely date of liftoff in response.	13	1
201506	1098	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	My only comment in this regard is that this effect should appropriately work in the reverse direction as well.	13	1
201506	1099	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	In particular, data that surprise us in a positive sense compared with the relatively dour staff forecast might be expected to pull forward the date of liftoff in order to maintain the appropriate level of policy accommodation.	13	1
201506	1100	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	Indeed, we expect even modestly strong economic data to cause just such a reaction in financial markets, and we think the Committee should be prepared to move in such a circumstance.	13	1
201506	1101	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	The remainder of my comments focus on r*.	13	1
201506	1102	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	I began arguing last year that relatively small unemployment and inflation gaps suggest that the US economy is close to normal in terms of our target variables.	13	1
201506	1103	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	In particular, unemployment at 5.5 percent is not too far from estimates of a reasonable long-run level—certainly much closer than it has been over the past five years.	13	1
201506	1104	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	Similarly, an appropriately smoothed measure of inflation, like the year-over-year Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas trimmed mean, shows a value of about 1.6 percent, just four- tenths below the Committee’s stated target.	13	1
201506	1105	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	Both of these gaps are likely to become even smaller in the quarters ahead.	13	1
201506	1106	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	I have calculated that, in terms of how close we are to our goals using a quadratic objective function, we are closer in recent quarters than we have been about 90 percent of the time during the postwar era.	13	1
201506	1107	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	By this measure, we are doing very well indeed with respect to our target variables.	13	1
201506	1108	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	If we put these relatively small gaps into standard Taylor-type rules, recommended policy rates tend to be much higher than today’s policy setting, as shown on page 2 of Tealbook, Book B.	13	1
201506	1109	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	These rules have served as a description of relatively good monetary policy in the past, so why deviate today?	13	1
201506	1110	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	One idea is that the intercept term in a Taylor-type rule, r*, is not constant but is instead time varying, and that today’s value is particularly low.	13	1
201506	1111	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	This might justify a low policy rate even in the face of relatively small unemployment and inflation gaps.	13	1
201506	1112	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	I want to make two points on this.	13	1
201506	1113	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	Number one, is this the argument we want to make?	13	1
201506	1114	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	Number two, how should we measure r*?	13	1
201506	1115	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	On the first question, whether this is the argument we want to make, I interpret the nature of the argument to be that today’s zero policy rate is not providing as much accommodation as one might otherwise think, because r* is, in fact, time-varying and happens to be low today.	13	1
201506	1116	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	Yet, in other portions of the Committee rhetoric, we have argued that a zero interest rate policy, combined with a large balance sheet, is in fact providing a large and appropriate amount of accommodation to combat perceived headwinds inhibiting US macroeconomic progress.	13	1
201506	1117	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	From that perspective, I see it as a bit of a cross-purpose to suggest that, in fact, our policy is not as powerful as it would appear according to standard calculations.	13	1
201506	1118	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	On the second question of how to measure r*, a few of you noted the recent Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis Fed blog post by Bill Dupor.	13	1
201506	1119	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	The idea of the post was to calculate r* using various ideas in standard theory on benchmark real interest rates and compare them to the Laubach-Williams calculation.	13	1
201506	1120	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	The alternative calculations tend to suggest that, while r* may be lower today than it has been historically, it is not so low as to suggest that the Committee is not being accommodative with its current policy setting.	13	1
201506	1121	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	This may be one way to reconcile the compelling idea that r* should be time varying with the idea that the ZIRP is likely very accommodative by conventional metrics.	13	1
201506	1122	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	1123	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201506	1124	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’re doing pretty well timewise, and I’d like to suggest that we take a break for 20 minutes.	13	1
201506	1125	2015-06-17	meeting		[Coffee break]	13	1
201506	1126	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Let us resume.	13	1
201506	1127	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13	1
201506	1128	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	1129	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Our Fifth District surveys indicate that economic activity is expanding at a faster pace in the service sector this month and that the manufacturing sector is no longer weakening.	13	1
201506	1130	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	According to preliminary figures from our June survey—due out June 23 and confidential until then—our manufacturing diffusion index, which declined late last year, rose to a small positive reading, largely due to a pickup in new orders.	13	1
201506	1131	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Our services index rose from plus 13 in May to plus 22 in June.	13	1
201506	1132	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Reports from our directors and business roundtables were very positive this month, consistent with these survey results.	13	1
201506	1133	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	The divergence in performance between the southern and northern parts of the Fifth District continues.	13	1
201506	1134	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	The Carolinas are positively booming, whereas the reports from the rest of the District are more varied, but even in the north, the tenor of the reports has been improving of late.	13	1
201506	1135	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	District labor markets also continue to improve.	13	1
201506	1136	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Our special hiring survey indicates that half of all respondents are now planning to increase employment, a 10 percentage point increase relative to earlier in the year.	13	1
201506	1137	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Our surveys also indicate that a continuation of broad-based wage increases in the service sector is in train, and a reversal of the recent weakening of wage growth in manufacturing is visible as well.	13	1
201506	1138	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	We’ve seen more frequent reports as well of employers offering higher wages to attract new employees or raising wages across the board for all existing employees.	13	1
201506	1139	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	The national level of the reports we’ve received since our April meeting have provided more evidence that the first-quarter pothole in real GDP growth was transitory and not as deep as first thought.	13	1
201506	1140	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	The Tealbook now attributes 1½ percentage points of the decline in first quarter GDP to special factors, such as residual seasonality; weather; labor dispute at West Coast ports; measurement error; upward revisions to Q1 trade and retail sales data, among others; and the release of the QSS, implying more strength in the first-quarter than otherwise.	13	1
201506	1141	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	In addition, the May employment report was strong and included significant upward revisions for March and April.	13	1
201506	1142	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	The outlook for consumer spending is pivotal, in my view, and here the picture is quite positive.	13	1
201506	1143	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Sure, we’ve had some flat months this winter, but even so, the staff now estimates that personal consumption grew at a 2¼ percent annual rate in the first quarter.	13	1
201506	1144	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	To put that in context, we saw exceptionally strong growth in the second half of 2014, and as of April, consumption was up 2.7 percent year over year, well above the average growth rate for this expansion.	13	1
201506	1145	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	The May retail sales report suggests healthy spending growth will continue in this quarter.	13	1
201506	1146	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Moreover, even though the Tealbook is showing that the consumer spending forecast was marked down for the remainder of this year, it is still projecting over 3 percent for this quarter and the second half, which is quite strong compared with earlier in this expansion, when consumption was averaging 2¼ percent.	13	1
201506	1147	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	This sustained increase in consumer spending growth no doubt has something to do with improved balance sheets, but my sense is that the improvement in labor markets over the past year has been very important as well.	13	1
201506	1148	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	That improvement has been evident in traditional labor market indicators.	13	1
201506	1149	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Payroll employment growth over the past year has averaged 255,000 per month.	13	1
201506	1150	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	In contrast, as of a year ago, 12-month payroll employment growth had never averaged more than 215,000 in this recovery.	13	1
201506	1151	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	The JOLTS data tell a similar story.	13	1
201506	1152	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Job openings have increased 22 percent year over year, including a 5 percent jump in May alone.	13	1
201506	1153	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	The unemployment rate has declined close to 1 percentage point over the past year, and at 5.5 percent the unemployment rate is now so close to estimates of the natural rate that I seriously doubt any of the differences are statistically significant.	13	1
201506	1154	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	In addition to anecdotal evidence on wage pressures, we’ve recently seen significant wage increases in the national data.	13	1
201506	1155	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Over the past year, 12-month ECI nominal wage growth has increased from about 2 percent to close to 3 percent, and even the average hourly earnings figure has ticked up in recent months.	13	1
201506	1156	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	I expect this broad and sustained improvement in labor market conditions to continue to support strong spending growth going forward.	13	1
201506	1157	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	On the inflation front, despite a substantial swing in headline inflation over the past year, inflation expectations have remained stable and core inflation has rebounded to about 1½ percent—the average over the past three months for core PCE inflation, I might add.	13	1
201506	1158	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	I think that the evidence is conclusive now that the dip in inflation is behind us.	13	1
201506	1159	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	In the absence of sizable changes in oil prices and the value of the dollar, I’m reasonably confident that headline and core inflation will return to target.	13	1
201506	1160	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	To summarize, we’ve seen strong evidence that first quarter weakness was transitory.	13	1
201506	1161	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	It is now apparent that we are in the midst of the longest sustained improvement in household spending growth we’ve seen in this recovery, and inflation is likely to move toward 2 percent.	13	1
201506	1162	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	I’d like to close with a comment on what seems to be the latent variable du jour— namely, the equilibrium real rate.	13	1
201506	1163	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Maybe it’s the latent variable of the year, I don’t know.	13	1
201506	1164	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Several participants last time urged more research on r*, and there’s been a lot of commentary on r* today.	13	1
201506	1165	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	It’s hard to object to more research, but I’m not sure we should get our hopes up.	13	1
201506	1166	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	I’ll point out that, by itself, saying the federal funds rate is low because the equilibrium real rate is low is sort of empty.	13	1
201506	1167	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Robert Tetlow presented pictures in which our federal funds rate’s deviations from a Taylor rule prescription were attributed to the residual.	13	1
201506	1168	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Anything you attribute to a residual in a Taylor rule can be handed off to the constant term, the r* term, so an equivalent interpretation is our own individual r* efforts.	13	1
201506	1169	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Presumably, we set the funds rate to what we believe it should be, and, presumably, we all now think that it should be below where you’d expect it to be, on the basis of current values of inflation and output gaps, and historical correlations between real rates and inflation and output gaps.	13	1
201506	1170	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	But virtually any setting for the funds rate can be rationalized by assuming a shift in the intercept term for the correlations between the real funds rate and output–inflation gaps.	13	1
201506	1171	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	So, by itself, it doesn’t have much content, in the absence of independent information brought to bear about what the equilibrium funds rate is.	13	1
201506	1172	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	That requires using identifying assumptions, either by applying a statistical model or applying some economic theory.	13	1
201506	1173	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Now, those estimates are going to be model dependent, the point President Williams made.	13	1
201506	1174	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	There are only a few of these out there right now, but, personally, I’d be surprised if the procedures yielded estimates of the equilibrium real rate that were very closely aligned.	13	1
201506	1175	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	In fact, President Williams’s comment was essentially pointing out the discrepancy between the Laubach-Williams model estimate and the staff’s estimate.	13	1
201506	1176	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Some statistical methods for parameterizing the real rate process imply that the long-term real trend rate has drifted down—that is, the level has drifted down permanently.	13	1
201506	1177	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	But there are other parameterizations that are equally plausible and that imply that the long-run trend rate hasn’t fallen much over the last couple of decades, and what we’re in the midst of is a transition dynamic back to the long-run trend.	13	1
201506	1178	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	I think this exactly describes, to some extent, the difference between President Williams and the staff.	13	1
201506	1179	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Now, this isn’t to say that such exercises are going to be useless.	13	1
201506	1180	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	It just says that they’re not going to be terribly enlightening unless we are exceptionally clear about the nature of the underlying identification assumptions that drive the difference in results.	13	1
201506	1181	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	One last observation.	13	1
201506	1182	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	This is a personal peeve—I think this terminology is terrible.	13	1
201506	1183	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	The notion of “equilibrium” used here corresponds to the idea of a system at rest, as in Newtonian physics, essentially, and within economics that usage has been outmoded for four or five decades now.	13	1
201506	1184	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	1185	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201506	1186	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13	1
201506	1187	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think I swore not to talk about r* anymore, but can I have one moment?	13	1
201506	1188	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I actually did not imply in my earlier comment that there was a disparity between the different r* estimates.	13	1
201506	1189	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The model that Thomas and I developed was really looking at a medium or lower frequency object—the permanent component of r*, if you will.	13	1
201506	1190	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The DSGE models were looking at a higher-frequency, quarter-by-quarter view of what the equilibrium real interest rate is—I think that’s true of what we did in San Francisco and I think that’s true of what the Board staff did.	13	1
201506	1191	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	These are describing different aspects of the same phenomenon—that is, the neutral real interest rate defined in different ways, estimated in different ways, tells you the same thing.	13	1
201506	1192	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s very depressed relative to historical averages—it’s been depressed for many years.	13	1
201506	1193	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	These are different objects that they’re looking at.	13	1
201506	1194	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I actually see the results as being consistent because the fact that one number was minus three and the other number was zero was a somewhat different constant.	13	1
201506	1195	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I actually don’t see that as inconsistent.	13	1
201506	1196	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that’s enough.	13	1
201506	1197	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair?	13	1
201506	1198	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13	1
201506	1199	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	To some extent you’ve illustrated the point I made about the importance of different conceptual approaches to this.	13	1
201506	1200	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	But let me ask you a question about Laubach- Williams.	13	1
201506	1201	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	If you took your data set and, instead, over the last eight years the funds rate had been 3 percent, would it deliver a low real rate estimate?	13	1
201506	1202	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	What do you mean, if the funds rate had been 3 percent over the last eight years?	13	1
201506	1203	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Take your data set.	13	1
201506	1204	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes.	13	1
201506	1205	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Take out the funds rate.	13	1
201506	1206	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Put in 3 percent instead of 0.	13	1
201506	1207	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Assuming that everything else was the same?	13	1
201506	1208	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	13	1
201506	1209	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Right?	13	1
201506	1210	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Everything else wouldn’t be the same.	13	1
201506	1211	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	No, of course it wouldn’t, but the point is that your estimate is basically saying the real rate has been low lately, which we all know.	13	1
201506	1212	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	No, it isn’t, but maybe—I think that Thomas is planning a future event focused on r*.	13	1
201506	1213	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Perhaps you can illuminate us in the future.	13	1
201506	1214	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The plan is that we will come back to the Committee in October with a broad discussion.	13	1
201506	1215	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Good idea.	13	1
201506	1216	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	With input from around the System.	13	1
201506	1217	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Very good.	13	1
201506	1218	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13	1
201506	1219	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	1220	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	You’ll be relieved to know I have nothing to add to that discussion.	13	1
201506	1221	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	[Laughter]	13	1
201506	1222	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	The Tenth District economy continues to expand even as low oil prices and weaker farm incomes weigh on several states.	13	1
201506	1223	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Unemployment remains very low, averaging 4.3 percent for the seven-state region as a whole.	13	1
201506	1224	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Employment in the energy sector, however, continues to fall, and some District oil and gas firms are at risk of default.	13	1
201506	1225	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	However, the recent rise in oil to $60 per barrel, along with better-than-expected availability of financing, has allowed firms to refrain from making deeper capital spending cuts, and the pace of layoffs has slowed.	13	1
201506	1226	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Some firms even expect a moderate rise in drilling activity in the second half of 2015, although prices need to rise a bit further for activity to be sustainable.	13	1
201506	1227	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Anecdotes from around the District suggest that some workers laid off in the energy sector have been able to readily find new employment in other sectors, such as trucking and construction.	13	1
201506	1228	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	The strong dollar continues to weigh on regional factory activity, but overall services activity and hiring plans remain solid.	13	1
201506	1229	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Realized and projected farm incomes have declined further as low crop prices persist.	13	1
201506	1230	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	As a result, demand for farm loans rose.	13	1
201506	1231	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Loan repayment rates softened notably, and crop land values declined in crop-intensive states.	13	1
201506	1232	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	On the positive side, rainfall in many parts of the District improved drought conditions dramatically, boosting the outlook for 2015 crop yields.	13	1
201506	1233	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	For the national economy, my growth outlook for the medium term is little changed, although I did revise my 2015 forecast to reflect a weaker-than-expected first half.	13	1
201506	1234	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	As others have noted, the slowdown appears to be somewhat overstated by the GDP figures.	13	1
201506	1235	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Growth in private domestic final demand remains positive and, based on analysis by my staff, is far less prone to having issues with seasonal adjustment than headline GDP.	13	1
201506	1236	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	This measure has increased 3.4 percent over the past four quarters, its fastest pace since 2010, and, importantly, we do not see a significant slowdown in other timely indicators.	13	1
201506	1237	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	For example, daily inflows of withheld income and employment taxes did not show any slowing or unusual patterns during the first quarter.	13	1
201506	1238	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Consumer spending appears poised to grow.	13	1
201506	1239	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Vehicle sales surged in May to their highest level in close to a decade, and after revisions, core retail sales over the last three months now look much better than before.	13	1
201506	1240	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Furthermore, I see upside risk to consumption growth, as stronger nominal wage growth, rising consumer confidence, and savings from lower gasoline prices could boost consumer demand in the second half of this year.	13	1
201506	1241	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, households’ expected income growth over the next year, as reported in the University of Michigan survey, moved up in June to the highest level since the crisis.	13	1
201506	1242	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	The labor market continues to improve, as over 200,000 jobs have been added in 14 out of the last 15 months.	13	1
201506	1243	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s labor market conditions indicators show that the level of activity improved in May and, importantly, the momentum indicator remained at a high level, suggesting continuing improvement in coming months.	13	1
201506	1244	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	If progress continues at a pace consistent with the past six months, the index tracking the overall level of activity, which covers 24 different labor market indicators, will be back at its historical average in September.	13	1
201506	1245	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	I see additional evidence of a well-functioning labor market based on a more detailed look at worker flow data in the Current Population Survey.	13	1
201506	1246	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Based on my staff’s calculation, the fraction of workers flowing into stable employment—defined as an employment relationship lasting at least three months—is back to pre-recession levels.	13	1
201506	1247	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	If job stability reflects a quality match from the perspectives of both the employer and employee, this suggests that the labor market is producing matches of similar quality to the last business cycle peak.	13	1
201506	1248	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	My staff has also found in the CPS that employment growth has shifted toward higher skill occupations.	13	1
201506	1249	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	I view the risks surrounding my outlook as broadly balanced.	13	1
201506	1250	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Important downside risks stem primarily from abroad, such as a possible slowing in emerging markets or spillovers associated with the situation in Greece.	13	1
201506	1251	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	On the other hand, possible surprises to consumer spending, housing construction, or wages are upside risks to my growth outlook.	13	1
201506	1252	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, with regard to inflation, the rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, the decline in energy prices, and unusually soft medical prices have been pulling down inflation.	13	1
201506	1253	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	As the effects of these temporary factors wane and with the unemployment rate already close to its natural rate, I expect above-trend growth to lead to a strengthening in inflation.	13	1
201506	1254	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	13	1
201506	1255	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201506	1256	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	13	1
201506	1257	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	1258	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m going to spend my time today on the inflation outlook.	13	1
201506	1259	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Many around this table have rightly expressed the desire to guard against the risk of model misspecification in formulating inflation forecasts.	13	1
201506	1260	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So to mitigate this risk, my staff and I went through a suite of inflation forecasting models in preparation for this meeting.	13	1
201506	1261	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My summary of this survey is that the balance of risk to inflation remains very much to the downside.	13	1
201506	1262	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	More specifically, the outlook in Tealbook, Book A, is that inflation will remain below 2 percent until 2019.	13	1
201506	1263	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Survey of Professional Forecasters’ median outlook is that inflation will remain below 2 percent through its forecast horizon, which ends in 2017.	13	1
201506	1264	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	All three Federal Reserve System DSGE models predict that inflation will remain below 2 percent through their forecast horizons.	13	1
201506	1265	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	At the Minneapolis Reserve Bank, we have a purely statistical model that we use for forecasting purposes—by “purely statistical,” what I mean is, we don’t layer onto it presumptions of the credibility of our target or a Phillips curve relationship.	13	1
201506	1266	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	However, the model is allowed to detect those things in the last 30 years of data if it’s able to find them.	13	1
201506	1267	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That model’s modal projection is that inflation will never return to 2 percent.	13	1
201506	1268	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It simply is not able to find enough of the Phillips curve relationship in the data for the past 30 years or enough evidence of the credibility of our inflation target to warrant getting back to 2 percent inflation.	13	1
201506	1269	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I count that as six different model- and judgment-based inflation forecasts.	13	1
201506	1270	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, I continue to favor market-based—as opposed to model-based—inflation outlooks as the basis for policy.	13	1
201506	1271	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I won’t drag you through the details there, but, again, market-based outlooks tell a similar low-inflation story over the medium term.	13	1
201506	1272	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, this stands in contrast to the forecast that Robert went through from the Summary of Economic Projections.	13	1
201506	1273	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Nearly two-thirds of the forecasts in the Committee have inflation back to 2 percent or more at the end of 2017.	13	1
201506	1274	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Some of you probably have access to models or information that lead you to forecast a more rapid return of inflation to target.	13	1
201506	1275	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If you’re able to do so, it would be great to share those sources of information and modeling with my staff.	13	1
201506	1276	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We’d be very interested in understanding how people were getting to different conclusions about where we stand on inflation.	13	1
201506	1277	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Some of you might be seeing the Phillips curve as having more slope than we do.	13	1
201506	1278	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You might see the natural rate as being higher than we do—or Board staff do, for that matter.	13	1
201506	1279	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It would be interesting to understand why.	13	1
201506	1280	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It would be useful to share that.	13	1
201506	1281	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	At least here in Minneapolis, we would be very interested in understanding what leads others to see more inflationary pressures than we were able to find right now.	13	1
201506	1282	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, it’s often emphasized that there are standard errors associated with these point forecasts, and I agree with that.	13	1
201506	1283	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	These associated standard errors are quite large.	13	1
201506	1284	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In light of those standard errors, I think the right way to read them is as a simple summary statistic of the balance of risks for inflation over the medium term.	13	1
201506	1285	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That builds in a symmetry assumption of how those errors are affecting the outcomes of inflation.	13	1
201506	1286	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If I tell you a point forecast, we can basically see what the likelihood is of inflation being above 2 percent or below.	13	1
201506	1287	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The low point forecasts are telling us that the probability that inflation will return to 2 percent over the medium term is under 50 percent, arguably considerably so, but that depends on a little more judgment and digging deeper to see exactly what those numbers look like.	13	1
201506	1288	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, this is all about the medium term.	13	1
201506	1289	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think these medium-term forecasts do not provide the full picture of the relevant inflation risks.	13	1
201506	1290	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I see little risk of inflation being stuck at, say, 2½ percent over the next 10 years.	13	1
201506	1291	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Committee has the tools and the will to forestall this outcome.	13	1
201506	1292	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In contrast, I see considerable risk that the Committee’s actions could lead inflation to be stuck at, say, 1½ percent over the next 10 years.	13	1
201506	1293	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think this is consistent with some of the discussion that President Evans offered about the CPI forecast that we see in the Survey of Professional Forecasters.	13	1
201506	1294	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Certainly they’re not forecasting 1½ percent PCE inflation over the next 10 years, I’m not saying that, but there’s a distribution of possible outcomes.	13	1
201506	1295	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I just don’t think it’s plausible that we’re going to see 2½ percent over the next 10 years, but I think it is plausible that we could see 1½ percent over the next 10 years.	13	1
201506	1296	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I don’t sense a will or a desire to use the tools needed to forestall that latter outcome.	13	1
201506	1297	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	After all, if you look back, the FOMC’s choices have led annual PCE core inflation to run below 2 percent in every month since late 2008, with the exception of a few months in late 2011 and early 2012.	13	1
201506	1298	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Over the past two years, the Committee has continued on a course of removing accommodation.	13	1
201506	1299	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Go back to, say, May 2013.	13	1
201506	1300	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we basically have been on a path of removing accommodation pretty much in the teeth of the troubling inflation forecast that I’ve just described.	13	1
201506	1301	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	These outcome-based data suggest that the FOMC views PCE inflation under 2 percent— even over very long periods of time—as being an acceptable outcome of monetary policy decisionmaking.	13	1
201506	1302	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My assessment that the FOMC lacks the will or the tools to defend the inflation target from below seems to be shared by financial markets.	13	1
201506	1303	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The market-based five-year, five- year-forward measures of expected inflation declined sharply in the second half of last year.	13	1
201506	1304	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Some observers insisted at the time that this decline would prove temporary, and they might yet be proved right—time will tell, I guess.	13	1
201506	1305	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But the relevant metrics continue to remain low by historical standards.	13	1
201506	1306	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Even though we’ve seen very sharp reversals of nominal bond yields, the inflation breakevens remain low.	13	1
201506	1307	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So what?	13	1
201506	1308	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There’s nothing hugely scientific about an inflation target of 2 percent, right?	13	1
201506	1309	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Couldn’t we have a true inflation target of, say, 1½ percent even if we had a stated inflation target of 2 percent?	13	1
201506	1310	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think there’s a couple of answers one could give.	13	1
201506	1311	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One is that, as a publicly accountable institution, presumably the outcomes we’re trying to achieve should match up with our stated goals, but let’s leave that aside.	13	1
201506	1312	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let’s talk just about economics.	13	1
201506	1313	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The problem is that a lower inflation target will lead to worse real outcomes.	13	1
201506	1314	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If inflation breakevens are 1½ percent rather than 2 percent, then nominal yields would be 50 basis points lower on average.	13	1
201506	1315	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That means it will take a smaller shock to the natural real interest rate to hit the zero lower bound.	13	1
201506	1316	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Our tools in those circumstances are costly, especially with the size of the balance sheet that we’re currently maintaining.	13	1
201506	1317	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So our stays at the zero lower bound will lead to employment shortfalls, and those are why we should care—I think that’s easy for us all to see.	13	1
201506	1318	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we want to meet our employment mandate in a more systematic fashion over the next decade, we should be doing more to buttress the credibility of our inflation target.	13	1
201506	1319	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll have more to say about how to best do so tomorrow, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	1320	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	13	1
201506	1321	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201506	1322	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13	1
201506	1323	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	1324	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	My views can be characterized quite succinctly:  somewhat less confidence on growth and the further improvement in the labor market, and somewhat more confidence that inflation will return to our 2 percent objective over the medium term, assuming that the labor market continues to show further improvement.	13	1
201506	1325	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	On the growth side, I think I share the opinions of everyone else that the results have been somewhat disappointing, with growth in the first half now likely to come in at about a little bit over 1 percentage point.	13	1
201506	1326	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, some of this can be attributed to special factors:  the unseasonably cold, snowy winter; residual seasonal adjustment problems; transitory factors such as the sharp decline in oil and gas investment.	13	1
201506	1327	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	But all that said, it is disappointing, especially the weaker-than-expected trajectory of consumer spending.	13	1
201506	1328	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	However, last Thursday’s retail sales report for May was strong and there was a sizable upward revision in sales for March, so maybe some of the shortfall in consumer spending relative to expectations is already resolving itself.	13	1
201506	1329	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The consequences of the weakness in economic growth for the labor market had been much milder than one would expect—the circle squared by extraordinarily weak productivity growth—but I don’t believe that productivity growth is going to continue to be so poor.	13	1
201506	1330	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I suspect that payroll growth will slow markedly unless we get a meaningful pickup in the economic growth rate.	13	1
201506	1331	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, the good news is, I do expect the growth rate to pick up as some of the transitory negative influences on growth fade.	13	1
201506	1332	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I also take some cheer from the most recent set of employment reports because, with both hours worked being up sharply and wages rising more quickly, that implies we’ll see faster real disposable income growth, which should help sustain consumer spending.	13	1
201506	1333	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	However, I am nervous that if productivity growth returns to a more normal performance, the growth pickup could still not be strong enough to sustain the solid payroll gains that we’ve seen over the past year.	13	1
201506	1334	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So that’s the reason I’ve become slightly less confident that we’ll see further improvement in the labor market over the remainder of the year.	13	1
201506	1335	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, with respect to the poor productivity figures that we’ve seen recently—the 0 percent rise in non-farm business productivity over the last four quarters and the sharp decline in the fourth quarter and the first quarter—I asked this question of the staff, but I don’t have a good explanation either.	13	1
201506	1336	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	While it’s true that weak capital spending implies less capital deepening and this is having a negative consequence for productivity growth, that, I think, can only explain a portion of the slowdown over the past year.	13	1
201506	1337	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the collapse of the past two quarters, I think this is even harder to explain.	13	1
201506	1338	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Even if innovations cease completely, and there’s certainly no evidence of that, productivity growth should keep expanding for quite some time, as earlier innovations diffuse throughout the economy.	13	1
201506	1339	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Perhaps real GDP growth rates will be revised up, or perhaps the poor performance is a temporary artifact that stems from businesses becoming more confident, hiring more workers, and then this translating into a particularly poor measure of productivity during this transitional period.	13	1
201506	1340	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	But whatever the source, I view this as a conundrum that does increase my uncertainty about the labor market outlook.	13	1
201506	1341	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to inflation, I am becoming more confident, subject to the labor market continuing to improve, that inflation will return toward our 2 percent objective over the medium term, and that this reflects three things.	13	1
201506	1342	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	First, we’re seeing further tightening of the labor market, and this seems to be translating to somewhat greater upward pressure on wages.	13	1
201506	1343	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, some of the transitory influences holding down inflation—namely, the earlier decline in oil and gas prices and the effect of the stronger dollar on nonpetroleum import prices—seems likely to dissipate.	13	1
201506	1344	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Evidence of a cyclical recovery in Europe and Japan has led to greater stability in the dollar, for example.	13	1
201506	1345	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Third, measures of inflation compensation have increased since earlier in the year, with the Board’s five-year, five-year-forward measure of inflation compensation rising by about 25 basis points from its low point in January.	13	1
201506	1346	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So what does this imply for monetary policy?	13	1
201506	1347	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, I’ll talk mostly about this tomorrow, but I still think we’re on track for liftoff in September.	13	1
201506	1348	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I haven’t changed my SEP federal funds rate path from what I submitted at the March meeting:  two rate hikes of 25 basis points each in 2015—one in September and one in December—and I’ll have more to say on that tomorrow.	13	1
201506	1349	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, how should we think about the sharp backup we’ve seen in bond yields recently?	13	1
201506	1350	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	My own view is that it’s warranted, and better now than later.	13	1
201506	1351	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The yields have been pulled down mainly by European QE, which had depressed bond term premiums, and soft Q1 activity measures that implied a potentially later liftoff of US monetary policy.	13	1
201506	1352	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Even with the rise to a little bit below 2.4 percent, 10-year Treasury yields are not particularly high, especially if you think we’re going to start a journey back to 3½ percent or so for the nominal federal funds rate later this year.	13	1
201506	1353	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Remember, after the taper tantrum we were at about 3 percent.	13	1
201506	1354	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The current yield curve implies a 10-year Treasury note yield in five years’ time of only about 3 percent.	13	1
201506	1355	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So even with this backup, we’re not really discounting a big rise in 10-year rates going forward.	13	1
201506	1356	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	To me, it’s better to have this occur in steps and away from the date of liftoff rather than one big jump around or following liftoff.	13	1
201506	1357	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So with the backup in the yields now, we have a yield curve that is quite a bit steeper than normal.	13	1
201506	1358	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Considerable tightening is already discounted in its shape, so I think that reduces the chance that we’ll see a really sharp rise in yields when we actually do lift off.	13	1
201506	1359	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	At least that’s my hope at this point.	13	1
201506	1360	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	1361	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201506	1362	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13	1
201506	1363	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	1364	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	In April, I—and I believe most of us around this table—were concerned that the underlying performance of the economy might be slowing more persistently than it had in the first quarter of 2014.	13	1
201506	1365	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	We were concerned in particular about slowing job gains, declining industrial output, and weakness in several spending categories.	13	1
201506	1366	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Most seriously, I was worried that the underlying, strongly positive thrust of economic activity— especially in the labor market, in which monthly increases in employment had averaged more than 260,000 in 2014—could be slowing.	13	1
201506	1367	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	And that fear was supported by the March increase in employment of only about 120,000.	13	1
201506	1368	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	It is worth emphasizing that the labor market has, for some time, been much stronger than the GDP data.	13	1
201506	1369	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Since early last year, the unemployment rate has declined more than 1 percentage point.	13	1
201506	1370	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	The difference in the behavior of output and employment has been puzzling since the start of the recovery, and it was particularly stark in the first quarters of 2014 and 2015, when GDP declined and, except in March 2015, hiring remained strong.	13	1
201506	1371	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	The staff generally takes the view that when the employment and GDP data appear inconsistent, the employment data are more likely to be accurate than the output data, which is to say that we should be putting more weight on the behavior of the employment data than on that implied by the GDP data if there is some error in the data, which is entirely possible.	13	1
201506	1372	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	The data coming in since our April meeting have reinforced the view that the weakness we saw in the first quarter was likely mostly transitory and should reassure us that the underlying strength of the labor market continues despite the March weakness.	13	1
201506	1373	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Consider the recent data.	13	1
201506	1374	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Real core retail sales have risen at an annual rate of 3½ percent so far this year, and auto sales have been extremely strong.	13	1
201506	1375	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Services data for the first quarter were also strong.	13	1
201506	1376	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Housing investment growth has stepped up considerably since the second half of last year.	13	1
201506	1377	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Specifically, residential investment is estimated to be rising at a 9 percent annual pace in the first half of this year, and that takes into account today’s data, which is up from a 3.5 percent gain in the second half of last year.	13	1
201506	1378	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	And we are finally beginning to see a pickup in compensation.	13	1
201506	1379	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	The 12-month change in the employment cost index has moved appreciably higher, which is in turn consistent with the ongoing improvements in the labor market.	13	1
201506	1380	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	The employment-to-population ratio has continued to rise this year, the participation rate has leveled out, the share of workers working part time for economic reasons has diminished further, and job openings have jumped.	13	1
201506	1381	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Anecdotal evidence reinforces these data.	13	1
201506	1382	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	In the Beige Book, most Districts reported improvements in the housing sector, with some describing the market as “very active” or “strong.”	13	1
201506	1383	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	And as noted in the summary of Districts’ hiring plans sent to us by Board staff members Glenn Follette and John Stevens, the number of respondents expecting to increase employment over the coming 12 months was as strong as it was in December and higher than it was in the preceding four annual inquiries.	13	1
201506	1384	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	I’ve also been gathering my own anecdotes, mainly from the newspapers, which means I am far from keeping up with the presidents on this front.	13	1
201506	1385	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	I’ve long been wishing to have an interlocutor, and I found one in an e-mail.	13	1
201506	1386	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Somebody wrote to me and said that his cousins in Hannibal, Missouri, which is in Jim Bullard’s District, had recently switched from riding in the rodeo to driving trucks for the local paint factory, which had boosted pay to attract workers.	13	1
201506	1387	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	My interlocutor remarked to his cousins that with their being drawn back into the workforce with higher wages, we must be at or close to NAIRU.	13	1
201506	1388	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	One of the cousins responded that he was not sure who or where “NAIRU” is, but if they’re hiring, they’d certainly look into it.	13	1
201506	1389	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	13	1
201506	1390	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	All in all, we should be encouraged by the continuing signs of progress in the labor market.	13	1
201506	1391	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	We’re now getting close to the natural rate of unemployment, as defined by participants in the SEP.	13	1
201506	1392	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	When exactly we will reach it is hard to say, because the Committee’s views on the natural rate can change, and because there are some margins of slack remaining that aren’t adequately captured by the difference between U-3 and the estimated natural rate of U-3.	13	1
201506	1393	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	But the unemployment rate is already very close to the natural rate.	13	1
201506	1394	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	As for inflation, I remain reasonably confident that we will see inflation beginning to move back toward our 2 percent target before too long.	13	1
201506	1395	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Core inflation through May was 1.2 percent, a figure that was partly held down by the pass-through of lower oil prices and also by the recent declines in core import prices.	13	1
201506	1396	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	The price of oil now seems to be in a new range, from which it is as likely to move up as to move down.	13	1
201506	1397	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	And the Board staff forecast that core import prices will resume increasing early next year, which will help support core inflation going forward.	13	1
201506	1398	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	As the influence of declining oil, energy, gas prices, and import prices starts to wane, we will begin to see the core inflation rate moving up.	13	1
201506	1399	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	And for the same reason—the relative stabilization of oil prices and the stabilization and possible increase of import prices—we are likely to see total inflation rising as well.	13	1
201506	1400	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	This might not start to happen by September or even this year, but I believe it will happen before long, by which I mean within a year.	13	1
201506	1401	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	And those will be the inflation rates relevant to any changes in monetary policy we put in place in the next few months.	13	1
201506	1402	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	I’m reassured that inflation expectations have remained pretty steady, despite the very low levels of headline inflation.	13	1
201506	1403	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	But, overall, it’s not the inflation numbers today that persuade me that we’ll see inflation rising over our projection horizon; rather, it’s my conviction that economic slack has been diminishing and continues to diminish, and that the Phillips curve will reassert itself as the incoming evidence is beginning to suggest.	13	1
201506	1404	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	I also put weight on the fact that the SEP results show unanimity on the point that inflation will converge to 2 percent—a unanimity that reflects the view that, over the course of time and—noting what President Kocherlakota said—we can and will attain the target inflation rate.	13	1
201506	1405	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t doubt that the Committee will follow a policy that is aimed at that goal.	13	1
201506	1406	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Now, needless to say, I also have concerns about the outlook.	13	1
201506	1407	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	In particular, consumer spending has been disappointing, particularly when we consider how real incomes have been boosted by lower gasoline prices, and industrial production data have also been disappointing of late.	13	1
201506	1408	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	In addition, we all continue to be aware of the significant downside risks associated with developments in Greece.	13	1
201506	1409	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	On the upside, it’s also possible, of course, that the weakness in the first quarter will prove as transitory as last year’s weakness, and that growth in labor market performance in the remainder of this year could turn out to be more robust than is now forecast.	13	1
201506	1410	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	1411	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201506	1412	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13	1
201506	1413	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	1414	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	Well, obviously, as I think just about everyone has noted, the data over the course of the last couple of weeks has been very encouraging.	13	1
201506	1415	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	Stan noted that, at the April meeting, there was a lot of concern.	13	1
201506	1416	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	I think, actually, the concern lasted well into May, so I’m a little more cautious than a lot of people in declaring our uneasiness over, just because it really was the retail sales number and the jobs number— which were, again, undoubtedly good—which turned the tide of some fears that we might be backsliding significantly.	13	1
201506	1417	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	Having said that, it is hard to argue, certainly, with the jobs number, and I think there is actually a broader story here, which is that the performance of the labor market has not just been on the unemployment rate side.	13	1
201506	1418	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	As several of you have noted, the slack, which many people saw as not reflected in the unemployment rate over the last few years, did turn out to be there, and it, too, now seems to be contracting somewhat.	13	1
201506	1419	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	I take the fact that the labor participation rate has been flat for the last 18 months as actually very good news, because demographics would suggest that during this period labor participation should have been declining, and, thus, the flatness suggests that people are in fact being pulled back into the labor market.	13	1
201506	1420	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	The question of how much additional slack remains, I still think, is a salient one, and not as easy to answer as the unemployment rate itself might suggest.	13	1
201506	1421	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	So I’m slightly more cautious but join in the general view that we are in a much better position today than we might have thought we would be finding ourselves in just a few weeks ago.	13	1
201506	1422	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	Like Vice Chairman Dudley, I also think that what has happened with European sovereigns is basically a good news story.	13	1
201506	1423	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	That is, the extension of negative rates along the yield curve in Europe over the first few months of this year was obviously something that was not sustainable, and potentially its reversal could have been quite destabilizing.	13	1
201506	1424	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	So the fact that those have reversed, particularly the bund yields—in part because of good economic news in Europe and in part, I think, just because people realize that the positions they were taking were not sustainable in any case—is probably a good thing, notwithstanding the fact that it has been accompanied by a modest amount of tightening of financial conditions in the United States.	13	1
201506	1425	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	Having said that, first, I can’t come up with a wholly satisfactory explanation of why the reversal went as far as it did.	13	1
201506	1426	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	Second, I’m not sure that rates can actually go much further up without negating the benefits of QE in Europe, so we may still have the potential for some dollar strengthening, particularly once we’ve raised rates here.	13	1
201506	1427	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	And, third, if there are significant problems in Greece, I think all bets are off with respect to what happens to sovereign yields throughout Europe, and certainly with regard to a potential spillover effect on the dollar.	13	1
201506	1428	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	The observations about sovereign yields reminds us that a number of questions are lurking just off the path of this prolonged recovery, many of which pertain to the issue of whether developments that predated the crisis have been accelerated or at least become more manifest since then.	13	1
201506	1429	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	In recent work by economists throughout the System, there have been three suggestions along these lines, and I will briefly mention them.	13	1
201506	1430	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	First, President Williams has already alluded to the paper by Rob Valletta and Catherine van der List of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, who use a cross-state study to find that some portion of the unusually elevated number of workers who are part time for economic reasons may be due to structural factors, such as industry and age composition.	13	1
201506	1431	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	Noting that the ratio of PTER to unemployed persons has been rising since 2002, they suggest that some of these factors may be persistent, in which case the part-time-for-economic-reasons ratio may not return all the way to its pre-crisis level.	13	1
201506	1432	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	Second, Andrew Figura and David Ratner of the Board staff have looked behind the outward shift in the Beveridge curve and argue that the secular decline in the labor share of income from roughly 70 percent to 63 percent since 2000 has been driven by forces that have also increased the incentives for firms to post more jobs.	13	1
201506	1433	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	So, for example, if diminished worker bargaining power is behind the decline in the labor share, then the return to posting vacancies will be higher for employers.	13	1
201506	1434	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	Andrew and David find empirical support for their argument in the fact that industries and states in which the labor share has fallen more have seen higher increases in job postings.	13	1
201506	1435	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	The implication of this research is that even if the long-awaited shift of the Beveridge curve back to its pre-crisis position does not occur, the permanent rightwards movement may not itself reflect an increase in structural unemployment.	13	1
201506	1436	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	And if the curve were eventually to shift back toward its pre-crisis position, the implication would be that the natural rate is even lower than some expect.	13	1
201506	1437	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	On the other hand, if the labor share of income were to reverse its decline while the curve stays shifted to the right, that would imply a higher natural rate, although I should note that Andrew and David place a substantially lesser likelihood on that third outcome than the first two.	13	1
201506	1438	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	The third paper is one by Ekaterina Peneva and Jeremy Rudd of the Board staff that models the relationship of labor cost to price inflation in recent years, finding little evidence that a change in the former has a material effect on the latter.	13	1
201506	1439	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	This is the latest in a line of research that many of us have referred to during these meetings over the last couple of years, suggesting that the past few decades have seen a break in the previous relationship between labor costs and broad price measures.	13	1
201506	1440	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	The authors cast doubt on explanations such as downward nominal wage rigidity for explaining the phenomena that we’ve seen over the past couple of years.	13	1
201506	1441	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	Now, not surprisingly, each of these three interesting pieces of research leaves some questions unanswered.	13	1
201506	1442	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	The work on PTER focuses on a pretty short and, in macroeconomic terms, pretty unusual time period.	13	1
201506	1443	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	In addition, some of the factors identified by the authors as structural, such as industry and age composition, tend themselves to move with the business cycle, so it may be a little bit difficult to disentangle what is structural from what is cyclical.	13	1
201506	1444	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	The Figura-Ratner work does not directly measure the loss of bargaining power, but instead shows the relationship that’s theoretically consistent with such a shift.	13	1
201506	1445	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	And, of course, the Peneva–Rudd paper itself notes that its undermining of labor costs as a key explanatory factor driving inflation leaves unanswered the question of the most important dynamics that are determining price inflation today.	13	1
201506	1446	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	But these three recent lines of research are yet another reminder that relationships observed and established in the pre-crisis period may actually have been changing in ways that the Great Recession has made more palpable.	13	1
201506	1447	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	And I mention them today not simply to advertise the interesting work being done around the System, although that’s probably a worthwhile thing to do, but also because I think they’re trying to help inform the monetary policy decisions that we’re going to have to make over the next several meetings.	13	1
201506	1448	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	In particular, the Peneva-Rudd paper, adding itself to that line of research to which I alluded earlier, does for me, at least, put into sharp relief the question of when one can be reasonably confident that inflation will return to the 2 percent target.	13	1
201506	1449	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	1450	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201506	1451	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13	1
201506	1452	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	1453	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	I will begin, as others have, with the questions that hung in the air at the time of the April meeting.	13	1
201506	1454	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Specifically, was the first quarter really as bad as it seemed?	13	1
201506	1455	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	And, second, how much signal should we take for the path forward?	13	1
201506	1456	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	I would agree with many voices around the table that incoming data since the April meeting tentatively offer encouraging answers on both questions.	13	1
201506	1457	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	The discussion in Tealbook, Book A, on special factors in the first quarter, which I found very useful and thoughtful, suggests that underlying growth was in the range of 1 percent in the first quarter.	13	1
201506	1458	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Some other outside estimates see an even greater one-time effect and, thus, stronger underlying growth.	13	1
201506	1459	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	So I’m inclined to believe that there was no sharp break in the pace of underlying growth in Q1, especially with real GDI growing at 1.4 percent and monthly payroll gains of nearly 200,000.	13	1
201506	1460	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	As for the second quarter and the rest of the year, incoming data have picked up since the April meeting, particularly in those areas in which there had been the worrisome weakness.	13	1
201506	1461	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	The April and May employment reports showed job gains reaccelerating after a lull in March.	13	1
201506	1462	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	The May retail sales estimate also struck a significantly more positive note, with solid growth for May and upward revisions for March and April.	13	1
201506	1463	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	And since growth is so heavily dependent on the consumer at the moment, that news was particularly important.	13	1
201506	1464	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	The Michigan survey also provided more support for that positive spending narrative, with a significant uptick in confidence and the highest ratings for personal financial prospects and wage expectations since before the crisis.	13	1
201506	1465	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	I also found the staff memo that Glenn Follette had taken part in writing to be striking a generally positive note on labor market conditions as well.	13	1
201506	1466	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Housing starts have also strengthened, and although I don’t expect a lot out of this sector in terms of being a major engine of growth, a small positive contribution is welcome.	13	1
201506	1467	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Turning to my SEP submission, I have marked down a slightly stronger growth rate for real GDP this year than is shown in the Tealbook and about the same as the Tealbook thereafter.	13	1
201506	1468	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	On the unemployment front, I also believe that there is a significant chance that unemployment will drop faster and further than in the baseline forecast, given the payroll and productivity forecasts.	13	1
201506	1469	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Compared with the relationship we’ve seen over the course of the last couple of years, the Tealbook forecast calls for unemployment to drop significantly more slowly for a given amount of payroll growth for reasons—perfectly possible reasons—that I’ve spent many happy hours discussing with the staff, but I guess I’ll just go for now with what’s been happening for the last couple of years.	13	1
201506	1470	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	By putting a little more weight on the recent trend, I’ve got unemployment declining to around 5 percent by the end of this year and dipping below 5 percent in 2016 and 2017.	13	1
201506	1471	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	With the economy slightly tighter, I’ve got inflation getting to 2 percent by 2017.	13	1
201506	1472	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	More on that tomorrow.	13	1
201506	1473	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	These changes do happen to bring my forecast into closer alignment with the run of public forecasts I’ve seen, as I think was implicit in Glenn’s earlier presentation.	13	1
201506	1474	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Market expectations for the path of policy rates have moved up significantly since the April meeting, and appropriately so.	13	1
201506	1475	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Although Treasury rates have run up recently, we’ve seen similar or larger moves often over the last 30 years, even in the good old days before the post- crisis decline in liquidity.	13	1
201506	1476	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Although volatility in the Treasury securities market has increased in recent months, that leaves the MOVE index, which measures volatility in fixed income markets across the curve, closer to but still below typical volatility levels for the decade before the financial crisis.	13	1
201506	1477	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	And I guess the best way to make sure that we don’t trigger undue increases in volatility is to continue to avoid surprising the markets unnecessarily.	13	1
201506	1478	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	In any event, both short- and long-term rates now seem to me to be better aligned with economic fundamentals than they have been, and that gives me some cause for hope—optimism that we can avoid an episode of harmful volatility.	13	1
201506	1479	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	There’s also been much greater volatility in the euro area, particularly in German fixed income markets recently, but this seems to me to relate principally to some correction after the strong initial reaction to the ECB’s quantitative easing program.	13	1
201506	1480	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	And I would echo Governor Tarullo’s and Vice Chairman Dudley’s comments, at least that I don’t take any negative signal for our normalization process—those are my words—from what happened in Europe during the intermeeting period.	13	1
201506	1481	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	I will close with the observation that the Tealbook baseline and my SEP submission are based on the assumption that no important fallout arises from the ongoing Greek crisis.	13	1
201506	1482	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	The range of possible outcomes is wide—and of possible implications is even wider.	13	1
201506	1483	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	That situation is likely to continue to complicate the liftoff decision the Committee will face later this year.	13	1
201506	1484	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Of course, it’s also possible that the next three months will clarify the likely path of events.	13	1
201506	1485	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Time will tell.	13	1
201506	1486	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	1487	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201506	1488	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13	1
201506	1489	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Madam Chair, the mixed data since we met in April haven’t fully resolved questions about the economy’s underlying momentum.	13	1
201506	1490	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	While it’s clear that some portion of the weakness in the first quarter resulted from a combination of transitory factors— residual seasonality, bad weather, and the port strike—it also appears likely that the economy’s underlying momentum may have softened because of somewhat persistent effects from exchange rates, oil prices, and cautious consumers.	13	1
201506	1491	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	While the data in hand pertaining to the second quarter are mostly reassuring, they don’t suggest a sufficient bounceback to compensate for the first- quarter weakness and certainly are not as strong as what we saw this time last year.	13	1
201506	1492	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Even after incorporating the positive first-quarter Quarterly Services Survey and the May retail sales and housing permits data, it now looks as though real GDP will advance at a disappointing 1¼ percent annual rate over the first half of the year.	13	1
201506	1493	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The most likely explanation for the persistent component of this weakness is that the negative effects of the recent rise in the exchange rate and the reduction in oil prices on net exports and business investment have been larger than expected, likely subtracting around 1½ percentage points from growth over the first half of the year, while the positive effects, which should be reflected primarily in consumer spending, have not materialized as projected.	13	1
201506	1494	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The lackluster pace of household spending is surprising, in view of the variety of factors present that would normally be supportive.	13	1
201506	1495	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Real interest rates remain quite low by historical standards.	13	1
201506	1496	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Housing wealth and equity wealth have each increased at double-digit rates on average over the past two years.	13	1
201506	1497	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Robust job gains and falling energy prices have contributed to increases in real incomes of 3½ percent over the past year.	13	1
201506	1498	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	And households appear to understand these favorable conditions, as consumer sentiment is at relatively elevated levels.	13	1
201506	1499	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	And yet reported real consumer spending likely increased only a little over 2 percent in the first quarter, and even the four-quarter increase of around 3 percent is short of what the fundamental determinants of spending and historical correlations would suggest.	13	1
201506	1500	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Spending on new homes has also been disappointing, and starts remain far below the trend increases consistent with population growth, although the May data on single-family permits was a bright spot.	13	1
201506	1501	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s at least possible that household behavior continues to be shaped by the experience of the financial crisis and the Great Recession, with an increased perception of tail risks and concerns among many consumers that increases in income and wealth may be highly contingent and subject to reversal.	13	1
201506	1502	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	If, as a result, households are reluctant to spend out of any gains, the headwinds holding back aggregate demand may prove somewhat persistent.	13	1
201506	1503	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Developments abroad are another source of potential ongoing headwinds.	13	1
201506	1504	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Slow growth in aggregate demand abroad and its effects on the exchange rate of the dollar continue to weigh on goods production in the United States.	13	1
201506	1505	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	We learned earlier this week that manufacturing production declined in May.	13	1
201506	1506	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	That will be a reduction in manufacturing output of over 1 percent at an annual rate over the past six months after increasing at close to 5 percent in the preceding 12 months; staff models predict that recent increases in the value of the dollar will remain a significant drag on net exports for some time to come.	13	1
201506	1507	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	That projection is based on a relatively stable dollar and a pickup in foreign growth, but the risk of a messy Greek exit from the euro zone has increased of late, as has the risk of persistent weakness in aggregate demand abroad.	13	1
201506	1508	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Most immediately, negotiations between official creditors and the Greek government are at a very delicate stage, and it’s not clear a compromise solution is attainable.	13	1
201506	1509	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	At the same time, incoming data on foreign GDP growth were once again weaker than expected, with China’s growth outlook murky, and commodity producers negatively affected.	13	1
201506	1510	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Despite this, our labor market continues to improve.	13	1
201506	1511	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	May’s employment report offers a welcome reassurance on this front.	13	1
201506	1512	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Employment gains have averaged close to 220,000 in 2015, down from the pace of 2014, but as many have noted, still at a very respectable pace.	13	1
201506	1513	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The unemployment rate, which had fallen at close to one-tenth of a percentage point per month over 2013 and 2014, has declined only one-tenth percentage point over the past five months, but it appears that resource slack continues to diminish, now concentrated in other margins such as the participation rate, which is very welcome.	13	1
201506	1514	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Although aggregate measures of wage growth remain relatively low, on balance, here too we’re seeing signs of acceleration.	13	1
201506	1515	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Both the 12-month changes in the employment cost index and average hourly earnings have moved up recently, and other indicators also point upward.	13	1
201506	1516	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	These are, of course, very welcome indications, but I’ll want to see sustained momentum to be convinced this represents a broad-based, convincing step-up in wage growth.	13	1
201506	1517	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The change in average hourly earnings is not yet meaningfully different from the 2 percent average pace of the past several years, and the staff’s current estimate of the four-quarter change in the other main gauge of wage growth, business-sector compensation per hour, is only 1¾ percent in the first quarter.	13	1
201506	1518	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The continued disconnect between very robust improvement in the labor market and disappointing overall economic growth raises questions about why productivity growth has been so miserable and the extent to which this reflects headwinds from the crisis, which may be reversed, or some more sustained structural change.	13	1
201506	1519	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	This issue is so central to our assessment of the output gap, resource slack, and appropriate policy that it’s important to get a better understanding of it in our analysis as we go forward.	13	1
201506	1520	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Finally, turning to inflation, core PCE inflation has increased from the low monthly rate seen around the turn of the year, with the annualized three-month change in prices at around 1½ percent in May compared with ½ percent in January.	13	1
201506	1521	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Consumer energy prices seem likely to increase at a double-digit annualized rate this quarter and boost a change in total PCE prices to close to 2 percent.	13	1
201506	1522	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	But the support to inflation from energy price increases will also be transitory, and measures of the underlying pace of price increases, such as the 12-month change in core PCE prices or the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ 12-month trimmed mean rate, are still noticeably below our 2 percent target.	13	1
201506	1523	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	So while the downside risks to the inflation outlook have diminished, there’s still no sign of core inflation moving above the 1½ percent pace it has remained near over the course of the recovery.	13	1
201506	1524	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	So, overall, the slowing in the pace of the economic improvement since the beginning of the year is difficult for me to dismiss entirely as an anomaly based on the data we have to date.	13	1
201506	1525	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s therefore of substantial value to gather more information about the underlying momentum in economic activity in the coming months before we take action.	13	1
201506	1526	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201506	1527	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	My thanks to everyone for a very thoughtful round of observations on the economic outlook, and I’ll try to conclude the go-round, as usual, by attempting a summary of some main themes, and then I’ll add a couple of remarks of my own.	13	1
201506	1528	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Starting with the labor market, I think it’s fair to say that everyone viewed incoming data as indicating at least a modest improvement in labor market conditions.	13	1
201506	1529	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Nonfarm payroll employment rose 280,000 in May.	13	1
201506	1530	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	The March and April gains have been revised up since they were first published.	13	1
201506	1531	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Average monthly payroll gains over the last three months now stand at about 210,000, which is a solid pace, but as several of you noted, that’s down substantially from what we saw around the turn of the year.	13	1
201506	1532	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Various measures of indexes for labor market conditions also show modest improvement.	13	1
201506	1533	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	The unemployment rate in May stood at 5½ percent.	13	1
201506	1534	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	It was unchanged from the latest data at the time of our April meeting, but broader measures of labor market underutilization, such as U-6, have declined a bit.	13	1
201506	1535	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, the employment-to-population ratio has drifted up further.	13	1
201506	1536	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	On the question of whether our U-3 measure is an adequate summary of labor market slack or whether broader measures really signify that there’s more slack than U-3 indicates, we continue to discuss that issue.	13	1
201506	1537	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	I would note that President Williams described research by staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco suggesting that U-3 remains an adequate index taking into account the effect of structural changes on the differential between U-6 and U-3.	13	1
201506	1538	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Several people noted that the labor force participation profile has been essentially flat over the last year and a half, and that does represent progress, judged against Tealbook’s estimate of an underlying trend that’s declining.	13	1
201506	1539	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Several of you mentioned that the JOLTS report showed higher job openings.	13	1
201506	1540	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	In fact, that series has achieved a new high.	13	1
201506	1541	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	And President George mentioned work on the measures of the quality of job matches that also show improvement.	13	1
201506	1542	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	I would describe nominal wage growth as relatively subdued, but that said, there are certainly hints that wage growth may be picking up a bit.	13	1
201506	1543	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	You noted that average hourly earnings has ticked up a little bit to 2.3 percent in May, slightly faster than the comparable figure in March.	13	1
201506	1544	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	The ECI for March rose 2¾ percent on a year-over-year basis, and that’s up about ½ percent from the December reading.	13	1
201506	1545	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	But readings from hourly compensation—it’s a pretty erratic series—still are only coming in around 2.1 percent.	13	1
201506	1546	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you described reports from your business contacts—your interlocutors—and mentioned a variety of anecdotes indicating that they do see emerging wage pressures, and perhaps it’s no longer restricted to particular jobs and sectors.	13	1
201506	1547	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	So, overall, labor market conditions continue to improve.	13	1
201506	1548	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	I think many of you noted that you saw room for further improvement toward our objective of maximum employment.	13	1
201506	1549	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo mentioned some interesting research by Board staff looking at the outward shift of the Beveridge curve that suggests that if it eventually shifts back, that would likely signify that the full-employment unemployment rate has actually declined, possibly significantly; but several of you noted that, in your view, there remains little or no slack in the labor market.	13	1
201506	1550	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Turning to aggregate spending and production, I think most of you see the news as reasonably favorable on balance.	13	1
201506	1551	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Most of you read incoming data as suggesting the first-quarter stall that was measured in real activity was likely temporary, in line with our expectations at the time we last met, and that we are seeing a pickup in activity.	13	1
201506	1552	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	But a number of you expressed caution about just how large that pickup is going to be and your assessment that we need to see additional data to judge how strong the underlying momentum in spending is.	13	1
201506	1553	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	After folding in the latest spending data, the staff now estimate that real GDP growth was about flat in the first quarter but is likely to expand 2¾ percent at an annual rate in the current quarter.	13	1
201506	1554	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	And other data-filtering exercises that are carried out around the System also indicate a substantial pickup in output growth this quarter.	13	1
201506	1555	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	We had an interesting discussion, I think, about residual seasonality.	13	1
201506	1556	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	The Tealbook estimate is that this likely subtracted almost 1 percentage point from real GDP growth in the first quarter, and the Tealbook estimates that we will see almost an equal and opposite effect in the current quarter.	13	1
201506	1557	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	So for the first half of the year as a whole, residual seasonality shouldn’t distort the data.	13	1
201506	1558	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	However, President Williams mentioned research by his staff that suggests there was a very significant effect in the first quarter, but it won’t all be reversed in the second quarter, and a lot of it will only show up in Q3—correct me if I misunderstood that.	13	1
201506	1559	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Consumer spending in the first half of the year looks like it was more solid than we assessed at our April meeting.	13	1
201506	1560	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Retail sales in May rose somewhat faster than anticipated in Tealbook, and sales in April and March were revised up.	13	1
201506	1561	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Several of you mentioned that motor vehicle sales jumped, although likely part of that was a one-time spike that paid back for earlier weakness.	13	1
201506	1562	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Anecdotal reports and other information suggest that we’ve not seen a very strong response of spending to the boost from declining energy prices—it’s a little bit of a mystery.	13	1
201506	1563	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	An interesting Board staff briefing in our pre-FOMC meeting looked at international evidence that suggests there’s no clear evidence of a boost to consumer spending from the decline in gas prices in other countries as well.	13	1
201506	1564	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	But several of you noted anecdotal reports suggesting at least some spillover to categories like travel and restaurant sales.	13	1
201506	1565	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Several of you noted consumer confidence remains at a pretty high level, which bodes well for continued moderate growth in household spending, possibly something stronger.	13	1
201506	1566	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	And if indeed we do have rising nominal wage growth coupled with solid growth in hours, there will be a significant boost to income that should boost spending going forward.	13	1
201506	1567	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	On the business spending side, indicators of business sentiment have been less reassuring and business investment has been somewhat disappointing, with drilling activity continuing to contract sharply and orders and shipments of capital goods staying flat.	13	1
201506	1568	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	The cutback in drilling has also depressed industrial production, both directly and through downstream effects on manufacturing.	13	1
201506	1569	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	The softness in business spending has been offset to some extent of late by a stronger-than-expected pickup in residential investment, and recent data have been somewhat encouraging with respect to housing.	13	1
201506	1570	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	We did have some discussion of the implications of the recent weakness in labor productivity, which, as of the first quarter, had risen only ¼ percent on a year-over-year basis.	13	1
201506	1571	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Many of you noted this is going to be a very important factor in determining how the labor market performs in the period ahead.	13	1
201506	1572	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	If this poor performance continues, we may see continued substantial improvement in labor market conditions and upward pressure on inflation even if real GDP growth remains tepid.	13	1
201506	1573	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	But if, as the staff is projecting, productivity growth was to return to a more normal level, we would need to see and be confident that we have a meaningful pickup in output growth just to stabilize the unemployment rate near its current level.	13	1
201506	1574	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, many of you mentioned continued risks coming from abroad, obviously including the still-unsettled Greek debt situation and the possibility that a disorderly outcome could have adverse consequences for us through exchange rate effects and other channels.	13	1
201506	1575	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	And a number of you noted risks stemming from China and growth in emerging markets.	13	1
201506	1576	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	On the inflation front, incoming data came in pretty close to staff expectations.	13	1
201506	1577	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Very few of you noted any significant change in your outlook.	13	1
201506	1578	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Total PCE inflation was only 0.1 percent over the last year.	13	1
201506	1579	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Core PCE prices, which is, I think, a better indicator of the underlying trend, rose only 1.2 percent.	13	1
201506	1580	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	These were largely in line with Tealbook predictions.	13	1
201506	1581	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	However, many of you noted that crude oil prices have stabilized, and the real exchange rate is stable or up only slightly since the last FOMC meeting.	13	1
201506	1582	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	And while there will be a very long lag between the stabilization in oil prices and an upward move in headline inflation, we are not likely to see a big upward movement until close to the end of the year.	13	1
201506	1583	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Eventually, the downward pressure of those huge declines in energy prices near the end of the year will drop out, and headline inflation will move up toward core.	13	1
201506	1584	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you noted that the appreciation of the dollar is depressing import prices, and our staff estimates that that’s taking probably ¼ percentage point off core inflation this year.	13	1
201506	1585	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to the likely behavior of core inflation in the period ahead, the staff estimate that for the rest of the year it should be running close to 1½ percent, and your updated SEP projections look like they are consistent with that assessment.	13	1
201506	1586	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	So when we turn to the critical issue of whether recent developments have made you reasonably confident or increased your confidence that the level of inflation will actually move up to 2 percent over the next couple of years, a number of you noted that the fact that the dollar and oil prices have stabilized does raise your confidence that headline inflation will move up toward core.	13	1
201506	1587	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	An important question, however, with core inflation still running below 2 percent, is, what will happen to that core rate over time?	13	1
201506	1588	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you indicated that as long as the labor market continues to improve, you have confidence that the Phillips curve will assert itself.	13	1
201506	1589	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	And with stable inflation expectations, inflation will tend to move up toward 2 percent over time, although we have to be sure that growth is strong enough to get that outcome.	13	1
201506	1590	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	But several of you expressed deeper concerns about whether or not that’s a reasonable prediction.	13	1
201506	1591	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans emphasized the fact that there’s some evidence in the Survey of Professional Forecasters that CPI inflation expectations have drifted down.	13	1
201506	1592	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota expressed concern about whether inflation will move up, whether our inflation target is credible, given the Committee’s apparent lack of determination to move inflation up over time, and he also noted that it looks as though the risks around a 2 percent medium-term inflation forecast may not be symmetric—they may be weighted to the downside.	13	1
201506	1593	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	So let me stop there with those comments.	13	1
201506	1594	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Would anybody like to comment or correct anything, if I garbled what you have said?	13	1
201506	1595	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	13	1
201506	1596	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, then let me add a couple of comments of my own, and they’ll be directed toward what we have learned and what we haven’t learned since our previous meeting.	13	1
201506	1597	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Back in April, we faced a wide range of surprisingly weak readings on the labor market and real activity more broadly.	13	1
201506	1598	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	We thought this softness was largely transitory, but we couldn’t be sure it wasn’t the beginning of a more serious stalling of the expansion.	13	1
201506	1599	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	And now, it seems to me, that with payroll gains running close to 210,000 in the past three months and real GDP now apparently expanding at least at a moderate pace, that we were experiencing a temporary pause in activity.	13	1
201506	1600	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	That said, the Tealbook estimates that real GDP is going to expand at only a pretty paltry 1¼ percent annual rate in the first half of the year, even with a decent rebound in activity in the current quarter.	13	1
201506	1601	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	And the tone of some key monthly indicators has remained persistently soft.	13	1
201506	1602	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	So it’s unclear whether real GDP over the rest of the year will be strong enough to sustain further improvement in the labor market, even with the funds rate near zero.	13	1
201506	1603	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	We can’t expect any support from net exports this year, in view of the weak state of the global economy and elevated level of the dollar.	13	1
201506	1604	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Indeed, the potential for things to worsen on this front is, in my view, material.	13	1
201506	1605	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	For example, a disorderly resolution of the Greek situation could put further upward pressure on the dollar.	13	1
201506	1606	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	We can’t expect much support from government spending, in light of fiscal realities at the federal, state, and local levels.	13	1
201506	1607	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Residential investment isn’t likely to be a significant source of strength either, even with the recent uptick in permits and starts.	13	1
201506	1608	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	In part, this is simply because housing is such a small share of GDP.	13	1
201506	1609	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	But beyond that, I think it’s unlikely, as long as credit availability remains so tight, that housing construction will contribute a lot to real GDP growth anytime soon.	13	1
201506	1610	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	I mentioned that business fixed investment has been weaker—at least weaker than I expected so far.	13	1
201506	1611	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	I know a lot of it reflects the contraction in drilling, which should be temporary, especially now that oil prices have flattened out.	13	1
201506	1612	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	But the softness extends beyond this category.	13	1
201506	1613	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Maybe it is expected—and I think it is in line with staff expectations—that firms would be reluctant to engage in much capital spending in an environment of only slow growth and aggregate demand, both at home and abroad.	13	1
201506	1614	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	But, at any rate, business surveys do point to only moderate investment growth, at best, in coming months, and that leaves consumer spending.	13	1
201506	1615	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	While household spending now looks to have expanded at a solid pace during the first half of the year, growth, nonetheless, has slowed noticeably since the second half of last year.	13	1
201506	1616	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	And, as I mentioned, that occurred despite the very large boost to real income from lower energy prices.	13	1
201506	1617	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	It raises the possibility that we may have overestimated the stimulus from this windfall, both to date and over the rest of the year.	13	1
201506	1618	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	The Tealbook projects real PCE growth to pick up to 3½ percent in the second half of this year.	13	1
201506	1619	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	It also projects that the saving rate will decline appreciably.	13	1
201506	1620	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	But if the saving rate were to instead move just sideways through the end of the year, then real GDP would likely increase only 1 percent or so for the year as a whole.	13	1
201506	1621	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, even mediocre GDP growth would not necessarily be inconsistent with further improvement in labor market conditions if the pace of productivity gains remains very low.	13	1
201506	1622	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	If that were to occur, we could see employment continuing to rise steadily and the unemployment rate falling to 5 percent relatively soon.	13	1
201506	1623	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Depending on the accompanying inflation data, such an outcome would likely warrant increasing the federal funds rate even though overall economic activity was expanding quite slowly.	13	1
201506	1624	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	But a development of that type would also imply that the economy’s equilibrium real interest rate is lower than we now estimate, suggesting both the need to tighten policy less in the longer run and also a greater risk of returning to the zero lower bound—in short, a more gradual trajectory for interest rates.	13	1
201506	1625	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	On the inflation front, incoming information has similarly clarified some issues and left others unresolved.	13	1
201506	1626	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	On the positive side, the data have come in more or less as expected, and I think they convincingly demonstrate that the current very low readings on inflation are substantially the result of transitory factors—namely, oil prices and the dollar.	13	1
201506	1627	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	So I feel reasonably confident that by early next year, PCE inflation on a 12-month basis will be back to the neighborhood of 1½ percent, assuming that energy prices and the dollar do remain roughly stable.	13	1
201506	1628	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	On the other hand, I’m uncertain whether inflation will continue climbing after that point and reach our inflation objective within two to three years.	13	1
201506	1629	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	For me to be reasonably confident on this score, I’d have to see both further improvement in the labor market and evidence that GDP growth is likely to stay sufficiently strong to complete the return to full employment even as interest rates rise.	13	1
201506	1630	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	I suppose I’m in the camp that’s prepared to believe in the Phillips curve, but it’s going to take, in my mind, confidence the labor market will improve.	13	1
201506	1631	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	And without that assurance, I would worry that resource utilization might not prove to be persistently tight enough to bring inflation back to 2 percent over the medium term, even if inflation expectations remain well anchored.	13	1
201506	1632	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	To anticipate our policy discussion, I think we need more information before we can confidently say that conditions warrant raising the federal funds rate.	13	1
201506	1633	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	It’s unrealistic to expect that all doubts will be erased by our September meeting, but at that point we will have received six labor reports since we first stated the conditions necessary to initiate tightening, and that’s a solid basis for assessing whether labor market conditions have improved sufficiently to initiate tightening.	13	1
201506	1634	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	As the year progresses, we’ll also get additional readings on real activity and productivity, and I think we’ll be in a better position to judge the likelihood that growth will stay strong enough to keep the economy moving back to full employment, and, thus, for us to be reasonably confident that inflation will gradually move back to 2 percent.	13	1
201506	1635	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	So let me stop here.	13	1
201506	1636	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	What I’d like to do is to turn things over to Thomas, who’s going to give us his briefing on our policy decision.	21	2
201506	1637	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll then go to dinner, and tomorrow morning we can begin right in on our policy round.	21	2
201506	1638	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21	2
201506	1639	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	I didn’t quite muster the courage to break decisively with dress code in this room, but in appreciation of President Williams’s gift that I have here with me, I managed to slip seven mentions of “data dependence” or “data dependent” into my text.	21	2
201506	1640	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21	2
201506	1641	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	At the April meeting, the Committee decided that economic conditions had progressed to the point that the decision to begin normalizing policy could be taken at any meeting, starting with the current one.	21	2
201506	1642	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Therefore, we thought it appropriate that the alternatives include a draft postmeeting statement that announces the beginning of policy normalization and a note that communicates related operational decisions.	21	2
201506	1643	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	I will return to those later in my briefing.	21	2
201506	1644	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Under the assumption that the Committee will not choose to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, the key issue, taking as given your principle of data dependence, is how to characterize the economic outlook and related risks.	21	2
201506	1645	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The remaining three alternatives approach this issue in various ways.	21	2
201506	1646	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Before turning to these alternatives, my first exhibit reviews some evidence regarding whether market participants understand that the Committee is now on a meeting-by-meeting basis regarding the timing of liftoff, and that its decisions are data dependent.	21	2
201506	1647	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	I focus on three questions:  whether uncertainty about the economic outlook is reflected in an appropriate degree of uncertainty about the timing of the first tightening, whether interest rates are correspondingly sensitive to incoming economic information and its implications for the outlook, and whether investors appear to appreciate the data dependence of the pace of tightening beyond your first move.	21	2
201506	1648	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The upper-right panel shows the average of primary dealers’ probability distributions regarding the meeting at which you will first raise the target range of the federal funds rate.	21	2
201506	1649	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	As Simon noted, while the highest probability is on September, roughly equal probability is attached to liftoff at a later date.	21	2
201506	1650	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The probabilities are spread out across future meetings, as they ought to be in light of your message of data dependence and the inherent uncertainty of future economic developments.	21	2
201506	1651	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The middle-left panel shows that quotes on federal funds futures also imply a risk-neutral probability distribution that is consistent with data dependence.	21	2
201506	1652	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Both panels indicate that, since your April meeting, the odds of liftoff at the September meeting have increased, partly reflecting the reduced probability placed on liftoff at the current meeting in the wake of the string of soft spending data.	21	2
201506	1653	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The odds of liftoff after September are little changed, on balance, consistent with your assessment that economic weakness in the first quarter will prove to be transitory.	21	2
201506	1654	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The middle-right panel provides some evidence regarding the second question, whether interest rates are as sensitive to incoming economic news as one should expect.	21	2
201506	1655	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The panel shows indexes for the response of the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields to macroeconomic news, where the shaded region shows the period since the federal funds rate reached the lower bound.	21	2
201506	1656	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	As shown by the red line, from 2010 until the end of 2012, the sensitivity of the 2-year yield fell to almost zero as markets—correctly—anticipated that short-term rates would remain at the lower bound for at least a few years.	21	2
201506	1657	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Since then, the sensitivity has retraced much of this decline and is now closer to normal levels, as economic news now has a meaningful effect on expectations of short-term rates over the next two years.	21	2
201506	1658	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The sensitivity of the 10-year yield, by contrast, has declined from its recent peak during the taper tantrum and is now at a historically normal level.	21	2
201506	1659	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Sadly, from a macroeconomist’s perspective, macroeconomic news explains only a small fraction of overall interest rate variations.	21	2
201506	1660	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The lower-left panel shows that, more generally, uncertainty about the level of short-term interest rates one year ahead has followed a broadly similar path to the red line in the middle right, and since early 2014 it has begun to move back toward more normal levels, although it still has some way to go.	21	2
201506	1661	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The fact that uncertainty about the federal funds rate one year hence remains well below historical norms could, in turn, reflect the strength of market participants’ conviction of a very gradual pace of tightening once it begins.	21	2
201506	1662	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The panel in the lower-right shows the average probability distribution across primary dealers of the federal funds rate target increases during the first year of tightening, conditional on the federal funds rate target not returning to its current range.	21	2
201506	1663	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	These probabilities are tightly clustered around roughly 100 basis points per year, with only negligible odds on economic scenarios under which the Committee would tighten at a pace faster than what was considered “measured” in the mid-2000s, indicated by the vertical line.	21	2
201506	1664	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	It is not clear whether the high probability mass around roughly 100 basis points per year reflects a high degree of confidence that economic conditions will evolve in a manner consistent with this gradual pace, or whether it represents a lack of appreciation of the data dependence of future monetary policy.	21	2
201506	1665	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Summing up, the evidence presented on this exhibit suggests that there is a healthy dispersion of probabilities over when the economic conditions for the first tightening will have been met, and financial market prices seem reasonably responsive to economic news.	21	2
201506	1666	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Yet, financial markets may still throw a “liftoff tantrum,” either because they come to anticipate a greater likelihood of a historically more-normal pace of tightening, or because the data I am reviewing are unreliable guides to market expectations.	21	2
201506	1667	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Turning to your consideration of today’s decision and the postmeeting statement, the bullet points at the top of the second exhibit outline how the draft language in alternatives A, B, and C address the range of possible assessments that the Committee might make about economic developments over the intermeeting period and their implications for progress toward the Committee’s criteria for beginning normalization.	21	2
201506	1668	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative B would indicate that the economy is expanding moderately and would continue to characterize the labor market in terms of the pace at which underutilization is diminishing.	21	2
201506	1669	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Although the Committee would acknowledge that inflation is still running below 2 percent, it would temper that observation by noting that “earlier declines in energy prices” have been a factor in holding down inflation and report that “energy prices appear to have stabilized.”	21	2
201506	1670	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The assessment of the outlook in paragraph 2 of alternative B is basically unchanged:  The Committee continues to anticipate that, with appropriate policy accommodation, the economy will expand moderately, leading to further progress toward the Committee’s goals.	21	2
201506	1671	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	And alternative B would repeat the guidance in paragraph 3.	21	2
201506	1672	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	All told, the draft language in alternative B would communicate that some progress has been made since the last meeting on both of the Committee’s criteria for policy firming, but that the Committee, while expecting further progress, remains data dependent and will decide on the stance of policy on a meeting-by-meeting basis.	21	2
201506	1673	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	By retaining all future meetings as live options, alternative B would allow for the possibility that policy firming could begin in July or September.	21	2
201506	1674	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	At the same time, it would also leave open the possibility that data on the economy might evolve in a way that would warrant a later start.	21	2
201506	1675	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	While alternative B would not tip your hand regarding the likely timing of when the conditions for liftoff will have been met, alternatives C or A would send such a signal.	21	2
201506	1676	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	With the language in alternative C, the Committee would convey the view that it has seen appreciable progress toward meeting its criteria for beginning policy normalization and thus it would likely be read by the public as suggesting that the first increase in the target federal funds rate is close.	21	2
201506	1677	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	In contrast to alternative B, paragraphs 1 and 2 of alternative C would use language more closely tied to the Committee’s stated criteria for increasing the target range for the federal funds rate.	21	2
201506	1678	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	In paragraph 1, the Committee would indicate that it has seen “some improvement in labor market conditions,” and by omitting the reference to underutilization of labor resources, might leave the impression that such underutilization has mostly vanished.	21	2
201506	1679	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	In addition, paragraph 2 would express greater confidence in the outlook for inflation, indicating that “the risk of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished.”	21	2
201506	1680	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The views on economic activity and the outlook in alternative A would instead suggest that the Committee has seen little further progress toward meeting the criteria for the start of policy firming and would likely push out market expectations for policy tightening into the tail of the current distribution.	21	2
201506	1681	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Paragraph 2 would indicate that the risks to the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation are all to the downside.	21	2
201506	1682	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The concern about inflation would be sufficiently strong that the Committee would strengthen the criteria for policy normalization, stating in paragraphs 3 and 4 that inflation would need to be anticipated to reach 2 percent within one to two years and that the Committee is prepared to use all its tools to meet that criterion.	21	2
201506	1683	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	As I noted at the beginning of my briefing, I want to conclude with some remarks on alternative C′ and on the staff proposal for communicating details of the Committee’s operational approach to implementing policy when policy firming commences.	21	2
201506	1684	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	We would very much appreciate your comments on these during the Q&A period and the policy go-round.	21	2
201506	1685	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	As highlighted in the first set of bullet points at the bottom of the page, the most significant change that you will need to make to a postmeeting statement announcing the initial increase in the target range for the federal funds rate will be to update the forward guidance about how the Committee will approach subsequent adjustments in the target range.	21	2
201506	1686	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Following from the existing forward guidance, the proposed language in paragraph 3 of alternative C′ would, first, reiterate that the Committee’s decisions will be made in response to economic and financial developments and their implications for the economic outlook, so as to promote the mandated objectives.	21	2
201506	1687	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	In line with your current SEP responses, the draft language in C′ would explicitly note that the Committee expects that the economic outlook will warrant a gradual increase, and would retain the assessment that even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below longer-run normal levels.	21	2
201506	1688	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	However, in order to communicate that the Committee’s assessment of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate might change as economic conditions evolve, the proposed language adds that adjustments to the target range will be data driven.	21	2
201506	1689	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The final set of bullet points focuses on the staff’s proposal that the postmeeting statement be accompanied by a document providing the operational details associated with a change in the federal funds rate target.	21	2
201506	1690	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Rather than repeat the details covered in the memo that you received last week, I will just briefly highlight what we see as the advantages of this approach.	21	2
201506	1691	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The Committee’s previous communications regarding policy normalization have indicated that adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate will remain its primary means of conveying the stance of monetary policy, and that the Board’s adjustments to the IOER rate and the Committee’s instructions to the Desk regarding the operation of the ON RRP facility—and possibly other tools—are intended to be used to help maintain the federal funds rate within the target range.	21	2
201506	1692	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	We propose that the Committee’s postmeeting statement focus clearly and simply on your decision about the stance of policy and the reasons for that decision, while avoiding the possible distractions that could arise from including additional information on the use of, and possible adjustments to, supporting operational tools.	21	2
201506	1693	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	A separate document concerning implementation details may prove to be particularly useful in the event that the Committee needs to make an intermeeting adjustment to the operational tools after the commencement of policy firming to keep the federal funds rate in an unchanged target range.	21	2
201506	1694	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	In addition, the document on policy implementation would consolidate information about the use of these tools without highlighting their differences in governance.	21	2
201506	1695	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Copies of all four draft alternatives and their associated policy directives are attached to my exhibits.	21	2
201506	1696	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Note that the draft directive for alternative C′ incorporates the changes that were discussed in the June 10 memo, while the draft directive for the other alternatives offers the option of making several changes proposed in the same memo that are intended as “housekeeping” items to bring the directive up-to-date.	21	2
201506	1697	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	If you will turn to page 14 of your packet, you will see that the first change is to eliminate the reference to managing conditions in reserve markets—which is not how you are now conducting policy—and add the specific reference to the federal funds rate target range.	21	2
201506	1698	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	In the second paragraph, the rewording of the first sentence avoids the possible misinterpretation that “its policy” refers to the Desk’s rather than the Committee’s.	21	2
201506	1699	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	And, finally, the last sentence, which was added in December 2008 when emergency lending and the first LSAP were having substantial effects on the balance sheet, seems no longer necessary.	21	2
201506	1700	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	In particular, the Rules of Organization dictate that the SOMA manager is responsible for keeping the Committee informed about market conditions and transactions made for the SOMA, and these reports have become a regular feature of each meeting.	21	2
201506	1701	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	If you have thoughts on whether these changes should be made to the directive at this time, please note them in your discussion during the go-round.	21	2
201506	1702	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21	2
201506	1703	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	21	2
201506	1704	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we have a round of questions for Thomas, and then we’ll be in a position to begin tomorrow morning.	21	2
201506	1705	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Questions?	22	2
201506	1706	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	22	2
201506	1707	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Well, I just have a question on the tradeoff between data dependence and forward guidance.	22	2
201506	1708	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	When I look at the probability that you have in your top- right panel in exhibit 1, we have a roughly 45 percent probability of moving in September, and presumably, if the data comes in as forecast, that probability would improve on its own as we get into July.	22	2
201506	1709	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I guess the goal would be to get that much closer to 80 or 90 percent, since we wouldn’t be comfortable that 45 or 55 was quite enough.	22	2
201506	1710	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	And I just want to think about what the relative benefit of getting that additional increase would be as we get into September, particularly if the data surprises us in August and we end up having to backtrack.	22	2
201506	1711	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	So we’ve moved into an environment in which we’ve tried to avoid forward guidance, and we’ve really highlighted data dependence in speeches and in what we’ve put into the statement.	22	2
201506	1712	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Can you give me the relative cost and benefit of adding in language that moves away from data dependence—to tip our hat a little bit more—and how much additional benefit we would get from tipping our hat versus what happens if we tip our hat and turn out to be wrong?	22	2
201506	1713	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	So I don’t have a clear view on what should be some kind of target value for this probability.	22	2
201506	1714	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Would it be ideal if, in fact, market expectations were close to 100 percent right before the meeting?	22	2
201506	1715	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	It would seem to me that probably there is going to be some residual uncertainty simply because your assessment of economic conditions and whether they warrant liftoff or not always will involve a certain amount of judgment—that is very difficult to boil down to a simple formula.	22	2
201506	1716	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	So my sense is that you wouldn’t want to raise that probability too high, in that you would want to avoid leaving the impression that expectations are being completely piled up on liftoff at a particular meeting—that would be a serious impediment.	22	2
201506	1717	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	My thinking here is more that market participants should simply be sufficiently attuned to the fact that you may judge the data as being consistent with liftoff being warranted at that meeting, so that it is not being perceived as a breakdown in communications.	22	2
201506	1718	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	More generally speaking, my sense is that there was a time when forward guidance could be used in a fairly hard data-dependent sense, like we did with your threshold strategy, in which you could make firm commitments that before 6½ was crossed, the conversation would not even begin.	22	2
201506	1719	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	At this point, however, when you are so close to these criteria, I think it is just very difficult to lay out very precise, specific guidance of exactly which economic conditions we will see as warranting liftoff ex ante.	22	2
201506	1720	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	I’m afraid I’m not giving you a very precise answer, but I think that probabilities in this range or higher should be fine.	22	2
201506	1721	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	I could give some history, just quickly.	22	2
201506	1722	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	If we look back to September 2013, the probability of a taper, on average, was around 50 percent.	22	2
201506	1723	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	And at the time, most people thought that the Fed would taper, there was a pretty wide range of views there, and that was about that actual meeting.	22	2
201506	1724	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	I think if the average was 70 percent—and the history shows that it doesn’t really get much higher than that unless there’s been a direct telegraphing that it’s going to happen—if there’s still a big wide range of views, so some people are still at 30 and some are at 90 or something, then that’s not a great situation to be in because we don’t know who the marginal investor is.	22	2
201506	1725	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Is the marginal investor the one at 30 percent or the one at 90 percent?	22	2
201506	1726	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	But right now, the spread, which is the only thing I emphasized—nearly everyone is between 30 and 70 percent.	22	2
201506	1727	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	So they think it’s reasonable that the data could come in and you would decide to lift off in September—that’s sort of what you were trying to say on the data dependence.	22	2
201506	1728	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	But the issue of how you’re going to feel at the September meeting about these probabilities, I think, is fundamentally different.	22	2
201506	1729	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	I remember Governor Powell trying to think through that for the taper decision, whether 50–50 was reasonable enough or not.	22	2
201506	1730	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	It might be a 50–50 decision in September.	22	2
201506	1731	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	22	2
201506	1732	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I just want to add something to that.	22	2
201506	1733	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The market is going to have an SEP in front of them that they can look at, which has projections for unemployment, GDP, and inflation.	22	2
201506	1734	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So if the data evolve in a way consistent with that, they’re going to start putting the pieces together.	22	2
201506	1735	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the issue is going to be, if the data diverge significantly from that forecast, the question is then how much of a divergence do you need before you start to change your expectations.	22	2
201506	1736	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	But I think if you take the SEP as it’s written today, if things evolve pretty much in line with that, then the probability in September is likely going to harden as opposed to dissipate, particularly because the market will have this information in front of it.	22	2
201506	1737	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	I think it really depends on the messaging in July, the minutes, and any speeches that are made, as well, though, how high the probability is.	22	2
201506	1738	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Of course.	22	2
201506	1739	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s see.	22	2
201506	1740	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	I’ve got two two-handers.	22	2
201506	1741	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	First, President Bullard, then President Rosengren.	22	2
201506	1742	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	I just wanted to follow up on what Vice Chairman Dudley said.	22	2
201506	1743	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	I think as you get close to the meeting, the probabilities do tend to coalesce.	22	2
201506	1744	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	There are very few meetings at which you come in and the market is really 50–50 on what we’re going to do, because the data have come in in some way that kind of dictates.	22	2
201506	1745	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	And you can see that for this meeting, where the probability has fallen under 5 percent.	22	2
201506	1746	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	So, basically, everyone in the market decided we’re not going to do anything now.	22	2
201506	1747	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	When I look back, it’s not quite that black or white.	22	2
201506	1748	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	It is definitely true recently that you’ve had the probability close to zero, but in meetings where a big policy action is being taken, it’s not as if everyone is at 100 percent—they might get to 75 or 80.	22	2
201506	1749	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	So it’s not as black and white as the zero at this meeting, for which there’s been less discussion.	22	2
201506	1750	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	If you’re getting close to a policy change, there’s been more discussion, and that tends to push the probability up.	22	2
201506	1751	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	22	2
201506	1752	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Just a follow-up to what the Vice Chairman said, that one of the changes relative to what we used to do is that we have an SEP now.	22	2
201506	1753	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	It should convey the degree of certainty among the participants around the table with when rates are going to go up.	22	2
201506	1754	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Regarding the marginal benefit of using language to characterize what’s already embedded in the SEP, I’d just be interested whether you think the SEP adequately gives that degree of certainty or variation based on the participants’ projections for the funds rate, and whether it is actually that much of a benefit to add language from meeting to meeting on top of that.	22	2
201506	1755	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that’s a very fair point.	22	2
201506	1756	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	You have this new innovation, so you’re communicating a lot.	22	2
201506	1757	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Do you actually need something in the statement that reinforces that or not?	22	2
201506	1758	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The problem with the SEP, of course, is that no one knows who the dots are, so there’s still some residual uncertainty in the SEP.	22	2
201506	1759	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, the things that you write down in the SEP submissions don’t fully summarize everything that’s relevant to you.	22	2
201506	1760	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So, for example, the forward momentum in the economy, what was happening in terms of a debt limit, what was happening in terms of the European situation—those could be things that you can’t really factor into the SEP.	22	2
201506	1761	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I was writing some notes to myself about C′ tomorrow, and I think there is a very interesting question that we need to think about:  Do we want forward guidance once we lift off, or is the SEP sufficient to communicate our expectations?	22	2
201506	1762	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, the reason to have forward guidance initially when we take off is, we’re worried a little about a taper tantrum, right?	22	2
201506	1763	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	We want to reassure people in order to underline that, no, we don’t think we’re going to go very fast, so you shouldn’t go very fast either.	22	2
201506	1764	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	But I think it’s a legitimate issue that we need to discuss some more.	22	2
201506	1765	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	22	2
201506	1766	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Could I ask, Simon, what exactly is in this chart?	22	2
201506	1767	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Is this the—	22	2
201506	1768	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	It’s Thomas’s chart, I think.	22	2
201506	1769	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Is this the federal funds rate?	22	2
201506	1770	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Thomas, what’s in these data?	22	2
201506	1771	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Is this every individual giving a probability of what is—	22	2
201506	1772	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Which chart are you looking at?	22	2
201506	1773	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The upper right?	22	2
201506	1774	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Let’s take the one implied by federal funds futures.	22	2
201506	1775	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	That’s a more complicated thing.	22	2
201506	1776	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	So, very quickly, the upper right— the primary dealer survey asks the question two different ways.	22	2
201506	1777	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	It asks each dealer for the modal date for liftoff and it also asks for the whole probability distribution.	22	2
201506	1778	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	And this here is based on averaging over the individual respondents’ probability distributions.	22	2
201506	1779	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	So that’s what you see in the upper right.	22	2
201506	1780	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	In the middle left, this is something based on staff calculations of a so-called step path—namely, what staff is constructing is based on futures data, the probability of individual steps in the funds rate at each meeting.	22	2
201506	1781	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	So, I am not going around, saying, “I am a September guy and nothing is going to move me off that.”	22	2
201506	1782	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	I’m a guy who’s going around, saying, “Well, there’s a 70 percent probability here and a 20 percent there.”	22	2
201506	1783	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	I think that’s most directly addressed by the upper-right chart, because that is telling you that the average dealer is not all centered on one date, but that, in fact, there is a fair dispersion.	22	2
201506	1784	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The average dealer puts only a 45 percent probability on September and 45 percent distributed over other meetings.	22	2
201506	1785	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	So 45 percent doesn’t strike me as a whole lot of conviction.	22	2
201506	1786	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	There is, you know, a preponderance, but there’s also a fair probability that—	22	2
201506	1787	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Do we know where the average dealer puts his money?	22	2
201506	1788	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	We don’t, and that’s one of the issues with this chart.	22	2
201506	1789	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	And we faced this during the taper tantrum.	22	2
201506	1790	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The marginal investor could have a quite different belief from what we’re measuring, which is why we started the Survey of Market Participants—that’s the buy-side survey.	22	2
201506	1791	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	And the two surveys are lining up pretty well right now.	22	2
201506	1792	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	One of the things you might face in September is they look quite different.	22	2
201506	1793	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	And then, how would you feel about what the market reaction is going to be at that time?	22	2
201506	1794	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	All right.	22	2
201506	1795	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	So if we can take the average probability distribution at the timing of liftoff, the top-right one, let’s suppose we go along the path we expect to be on and the data are reasonable, if not absolutely decisive.	22	2
201506	1796	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	We’ll have a decision to make in September, but it won’t be totally clear to market participants what we will do.	22	2
201506	1797	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	So the probability weight will pile up a little bit on September from the left, and the question is, what happens on the right in the market?	22	2
201506	1798	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	And if some of them move off to the right—saying, for instance, the Committee is showing some reluctance to pull the trigger or something—then when we do pull the trigger, we’re going to have a lot of noise in the market, I assume.	22	2
201506	1799	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	And if it all piles up on September 16 and 17, because everybody thinks it’s obvious that’s what we are going to do, then we’ll have less noise in the market at the time of the decision.	22	2
201506	1800	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	We’ll just have the noise a few weeks before.	22	2
201506	1801	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Well, how much noise it’s going to cause is really an open question, right?	22	2
201506	1802	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	My expectation would be that, of course, if over the next three months, say, the employment reports all come in strong, the inflation data come in strong, you would see a substantial move of probabilities from the right toward the September bar.	22	2
201506	1803	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	How strong a market reaction that would cause is difficult for me to anticipate.	22	2
201506	1804	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The advantage we have over the slowing of the asset purchase programs is that we have the federal funds futures data.	22	2
201506	1805	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	So that should aggregate in a way some information about who the marginal investor is.	22	2
201506	1806	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The disadvantage we have is, they have to work out where the effective rate will trade within the range.	22	2
201506	1807	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	So we won’t be as precise on this first one to complement what’s in the upper chart.	22	2
201506	1808	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	When the decision was made to taper, the probabilities showed at that meeting were, on average, a 25 percent chance that the taper would happen.	22	2
201506	1809	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	But everyone realized in the next couple of meetings it was going to happen, and you just got over that uncertainty.	22	2
201506	1810	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	In the end, that was quite positive.	22	2
201506	1811	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	So, for example, if everyone thinks it’s really between two meetings—September and December, and that’s what we see—it might not matter as much when you actually decide to go.	22	2
201506	1812	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	But if there’s a lot of weight on 2016, then there’s probably an indication in moving of what the reaction function is at that point, which could have implications for the markets.	22	2
201506	1813	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	So why don’t we leave out the “they don’t know where it’s going to trade in the range.”	22	2
201506	1814	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Let’s simplify by just assuming that we’re going to fix a number rather than a range because the range adds a level of complication that we don’t want to deal with analytically at the same moment.	22	2
201506	1815	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	That would be great, and if we were credible that we could hit that point, that would really help.	22	2
201506	1816	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	But I don’t think at the moment we’re credible that we could hit a point target.	22	2
201506	1817	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Okay, Thomas.	22	2
201506	1818	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	I’m finished.	22	2
201506	1819	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	One other point, and I may come to regret these words, but my expectation would be that, literally, if the only thing that would shift is, say, probability mass from December toward September, that, in itself, would be my expectation, and it shouldn’t cause a very strong market reaction.	22	2
201506	1820	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	I think more interesting is what happens further out along the yield curve because, as you’ve seen from Simon’s charts, a bigger puzzle is why far forward rates are still very low.	22	2
201506	1821	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	So if this was associated with a market pull-up in forward rates further out, it could be because market participants somehow changed their views about the fundamental strength of the economy or because they changed their views about the reaction function.	22	2
201506	1822	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Then you could get a substantially larger response of longer-term rates.	22	2
201506	1823	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	22	2
201506	1824	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	22	2
201506	1825	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	22	2
201506	1826	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201506	1827	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I had a one-hander, but I’ll convert the first part of it into a two-hander to contribute to this really important conversation.	22	2
201506	1828	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that I’m more concerned about uncertainties being present in September.	22	2
201506	1829	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I listen to you speak, Madam Chair, and I listen to the Vice Chairman speak, I think that a key element that both of you stressed was the disconnect that we’ve seen between the employment data and the data on real activity.	22	2
201506	1830	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We’re going to get a lot of information about employment before our September meeting.	22	2
201506	1831	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We’re going to get considerably less, I think, about GDP and therefore won’t know how the center of the Committee resolves the potential for ongoing disconnect.	22	2
201506	1832	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I listen to the nowcast from Atlanta, 2 percent for the second quarter—that might be sort of where we’re at in terms of GDP numbers in September—but we may continue to see ongoing labor market improvement.	22	2
201506	1833	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	How that gets resolved will be very important.	22	2
201506	1834	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that messaging will be very complicated, and so I think there could well be more uncertainties going into the September meeting than we face right now at the June meeting.	22	2
201506	1835	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I had one last thing about that, which is that I think the opportunities for messaging between July and September are more limited just by the nature of the calendar.	22	2
201506	1836	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We don’t talk as much in that time frame, so I think that will, again, add to the challenge.	22	2
201506	1837	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My second comment was on the interpretation of Thomas’s charts as having to do with telling us that markets have learned to be data dependent and data sensitive in their assessments.	22	2
201506	1838	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought that was a nice try, but it was pretty heroic.	22	2
201506	1839	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One of the plausible theories about what the Committee’s forward guidance did was that it tamped down on the influence of any individual speaker’s effects on market beliefs.	22	2
201506	1840	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You are basically shutting down the noise factor that comes from having some presidents out there talking.	22	2
201506	1841	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Just presidents?	22	2
201506	1842	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	It doesn’t apply to the Chair.	22	2
201506	1843	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	No, when the Chair speaks, I think it’s much closer to being the heart of the Committee.	22	2
201506	1844	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Presidents and the Governors are speaking more for themselves.	22	2
201506	1845	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So one theory is, we’ve created more noise by getting rid of forward guidance—a lot of data- dependence, so who knows what’s going to happen?	22	2
201506	1846	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ve had the conversation with reporters: “What do you guys mean by data dependence?”	22	2
201506	1847	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And then I just show them John’s T-shirt, and they say, “Oh, that’s great.	22	2
201506	1848	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now I get it.”	22	2
201506	1849	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	22	2
201506	1850	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So all of this is about unconditional variances, and you’ve nailed it—unconditional variance has gone up.	22	2
201506	1851	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The only chart that really speaks to the conditional part is the middle one on the right, but it’s weak evidence.	22	2
201506	1852	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My final comment is that there are actually people who have suggested that we have TV cameras brought into the FOMC room to record what’s going on here and show it, probably on C-SPAN 2 or 3.	22	2
201506	1853	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we were being broadcast live, Thomas has brought forward the drinking game for our viewers, which is, every time he says “data dependence,” viewers have to take a shot.	22	2
201506	1854	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	22	2
201506	1855	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I can see more hope for this broadcast idea than I had thought before.	22	2
201506	1856	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	We notice you’re getting out before we implement all of this.	22	2
201506	1857	2015-06-17	meeting		[Laughter]	22	2
201506	1858	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	22	2
201506	1859	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have a very pedestrian question, and it’s just a question.	22	2
201506	1860	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thomas, you opened this up, but Simon has got to deal with it—it’s on page 14, this issue about the directive.	22	2
201506	1861	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m just naïve or ignorant on this.	22	2
201506	1862	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The existing sentence says, “In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.”	22	2
201506	1863	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I thought that was kind of right, and I thought that would be very right when we raise the range from 25 to 50 basis points.	22	2
201506	1864	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I thought it was exactly the right sentence, and you’re suggesting striking that out and fixing the next sentence, which is actually the problem:  “The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary.”	22	2
201506	1865	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I thought we weren’t doing open market operations and we had no plan to do open market operations for the next couple of years in order to hit the range.	22	2
201506	1866	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	My understanding of our policy strategy is, we set IOER, we use overnight reverse repo with some cap.	22	2
201506	1867	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, you can call that—	22	2
201506	1868	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Those are open market operations.	22	2
201506	1869	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I know, but that’s not the way it’s been interpreted for the decades in which this kind of statement has been made.	22	2
201506	1870	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I just find it a funny change to make at this time when we have this other statement out there that says our strategy of normalization is to use IOER, to use overnight reverse repo and other facilities, and we’re being very explicit about how these are done, and, really, there’s no active role for open market operations—when I say “active,”	22	2
201506	1871	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I mean the kind of things that we traditionally have done.	22	2
201506	1872	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I was curious.	22	2
201506	1873	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is a question.	22	2
201506	1874	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	What is wrong with just saying, “The Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with the federal funds rate trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent”?	22	2
201506	1875	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	If you say that without anything else, are you saying you would delete the next sentence?	22	2
201506	1876	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	No, I would just modify it in a way that you find appropriate.	22	2
201506	1877	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	I think when we were thinking about this, this was a “legacy” sentence.	22	2
201506	1878	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	So some changes were made to the directive a couple of years ago to modernize the first sentence in it, and in particular when you go to C′, which is on page 15, the idea is that you have the first sentence—that’s what the FOMC seeks.	22	2
201506	1879	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	And then the Committee has directed the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate, and these are the open market operations that we’d like to do.	22	2
201506	1880	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Right.	22	2
201506	1881	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	So it’s supposed to be clear to the market and the public that that’s what we’re talking about, and it still leaves open—if necessary, if it turns out that the federal funds rate is firm in some unusual way—that we have the directive that we could do the more traditional operation, which would be a repo operation.	22	2
201506	1882	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	We’re not sure how effective it would be, but that’s the thinking that we have, and it’s more just trying to clean up the language, and for me this gives a signal of being ready if it was introduced in the directive for the June minutes, because it should be pretty clear to market participants what you could slot in if you did lift off, which is this next statement.	22	2
201506	1883	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	And we’re really not trying to affect directly, each day, the amount of reserves on banks’ balance sheets to achieve that goal.	22	2
201506	1884	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	It will be through the open market operations of this type, where we’re really interacting with the repo market more to push up rates through arbitrage and other things that are going on, such as interest on excess reserves.	22	2
201506	1885	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I understand everything you said.	22	2
201506	1886	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	It just seemed to be a funny thing to be changing now because we put so much effort into this normalization plan, and it looks like there’s something happening here.	22	2
201506	1887	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t know, but that was just my question.	22	2
201506	1888	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	If the Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions—that’s conditions in reserve markets—but we’re really doing the effort through the temporary open market operations in the repo market.	22	2
201506	1889	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	That was the thinking.	22	2
201506	1890	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	But I agree with you.	22	2
201506	1891	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	You don’t have to change it.	22	2
201506	1892	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	You could just leave it in and slot in the—	22	2
201506	1893	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And then change it when we actually lift off.	22	2
201506	1894	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay.	22	2
201506	1895	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I was just asking the question of why you want to do it now, and you’ve answered.	22	2
201506	1896	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	22	2
201506	1897	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	So the one that matters is C′.	22	2
201506	1898	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	22	2
201506	1899	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	What I was confused by was why we would try to do that now.	22	2
201506	1900	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Because we’d be ready at every meeting just to slot it in.	22	2
201506	1901	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Instead of having confusion about other changes, you’re just saying this is the only thing to look at in this directive when you’ve lifted off.	22	2
201506	1902	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	That’s all.	22	2
201506	1903	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Thomas, do you want to—	22	2
201506	1904	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions?	22	2
201506	1905	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	22	2
201506	1906	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I also wonder how much benefit we get from doing a two-step as opposed to doing a one-step when we’re ready to go.	22	2
201506	1907	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The one-step would be the opportunity to say something about it in the minutes this time so that it will be very clear as to why we’re doing it next time, whereas since we didn’t discuss this in the minutes last time, there may be a little question of, is there some signal associated with this.	22	2
201506	1908	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes, that’s what I’m worried about.	22	2
201506	1909	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Do you gain much by doing a two-step?	22	2
201506	1910	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	If you don’t, maybe it’s just clearer to signal in the minutes and do the one-step approach.	22	2
201506	1911	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Just to clarify—at this time, of course, the directive would only appear in the minutes.	22	2
201506	1912	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The public doesn’t see it before.	22	2
201506	1913	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The directive comes out in the minutes.	22	2
201506	1914	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Well, they’ll see it three weeks from now.	22	2
201506	1915	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, but we would have a discussion of why we made these changes.	22	2
201506	1916	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I would’ve thought you would have the discussion in the minutes that we had this conversation, and that you would release the C′ when we actually move.	22	2
201506	1917	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	We could do that.	22	2
201506	1918	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I just don’t know whether you lose anything by doing that.	22	2
201506	1919	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m sympathetic to what President Williams is saying, but I think that changes in the directive are cheap at this stage, from a signaling point of view, because of the consideration Thomas mentioned, that they come out in the minutes.	22	2
201506	1920	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My own guess is they won’t be viewed so much as signaling—	22	2
201506	1921	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	If the implementation note is used and if you waited to make the changes, the first time you would see those changes is at 2:00 pm on the day of liftoff.	22	2
201506	1922	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If you wait to lift off, then the directive will be brought forward to two o’clock.	22	2
201506	1923	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Well, we haven’t had that discussion, but if that was to happen, that would be the case, which is, I think, behind our thinking, but I didn’t explain it as clearly.	22	2
201506	1924	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Sorry.	22	2
201506	1925	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	In the future, if you did release the directive at the same time in the implementation note, there are lots of things going on.	22	2
201506	1926	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	We’re just trying to simplify the noise by putting in changes we could make now.	22	2
201506	1927	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	But you’re still going to see C′.	22	2
201506	1928	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	You are going to see C′.	22	2
201506	1929	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Again, I don’t see the value in the interim directive change.	22	2
201506	1930	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	You still have to signal to the markets to expect C′ and the changes that are here.	22	2
201506	1931	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I think the question is, what’s the most parsimonious, clearest way of introducing the concept that C′ is coming.	22	2
201506	1932	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	And I’m not sure what this other thing does to help with that—I guess that is the question.	22	2
201506	1933	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	One way or another, there would be some discussion of this matter in the minutes—the intention to make these changes in language.	22	2
201506	1934	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	With C′.	22	2
201506	1935	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	The simplest is when people do the automated track changes when you lift off.	22	2
201506	1936	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	If you’d already done it, there are fewer track changes.	22	2
201506	1937	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	That’s the simplest.	22	2
201506	1938	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	But that you could explain.	22	2
201506	1939	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	It depends if you care about the guys who do that—	22	2
201506	1940	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	But this is a completely unimportant change here.	22	2
201506	1941	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	22	2
201506	1942	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The one they’re going to read is the—	22	2
201506	1943	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	Completely, and we would do some clean-up in the last sentence.	22	2
201506	1944	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	So you could pick and choose as well.	22	2
201506	1945	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	All right.	22	2
201506	1946	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	So where are we?	22	2
201506	1947	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re going to talk about this tomorrow.	22	2
201506	1948	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ll talk about this tomorrow.	22	2
201506	1949	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	We haven’t decided.	22	2
201506	1950	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	We’ve had preliminary thinking.	22	2
201506	1951	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	First Vice President Prichard.	22	2
201506	1952	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Thank you very much, Madam Chair.	22	2
201506	1953	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Just a question on C′ itself.	22	2
201506	1954	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	It’s on page 12.	22	2
201506	1955	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	The draft C′ statement deletes paragraph 5.	22	2
201506	1956	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	I understand why you want to delete it with the introductory clause, but why wouldn’t the essence of paragraph 5 want to be sustained so that it doesn’t appear that we’re retreating from the two principles that are embodied in paragraph 5?	22	2
201506	1957	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The spirit of that is arguably in the sentence that begins with “Going forward” because—	22	2
201506	1958	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Oh, you brought them forward.	22	2
201506	1959	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	“... the Committee will adjust its target range for the federal funds rate in response to economic and financial developments and their implications for the economic outlook, to promote maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.”	22	2
201506	1960	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Okay.	22	2
201506	1961	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Thank you.	2	2
201506	1962	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’ve had a productive day.	2	2
201506	1963	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	We can now go have dinner and a nice drink, then reconvene tomorrow at 9:00 am for our policy round.	2	2
201506	1964	2015-06-17	meeting		[Meeting recessed]	2	2
201506	1965	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	June 17 Session .	2	2
201506	1966	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	2	2
201506	1967	2015-06-17	meeting	PARTICIPANT	Good morning.	2	2
201506	1968	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Unless somebody has a matter of business, I think we are ready to begin our policy round.	23	2
201506	1969	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	And, if you would not mind, I would just like to make a couple of brief comments to start us off.	23	2
201506	1970	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	In particular, I wanted to comment very briefly on the staff’s proposed plan for communicating the details of monetary policy implementation.	23	2
201506	1971	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	My personal view is that the plan that Thomas has set out, and that was discussed in the memo, makes a lot of sense.	23	2
201506	1972	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	As Thomas noted, having an implementation note as a separate document keeps the focus of our policy statement on our choice of the federal funds target range and the rationale for that choice rather than getting into the details of implementation.	23	2
201506	1973	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	I think this approach will end up simplifying our communications regarding the stance of policy, and I think the separate note lets us accurately report matters pertaining to the different governance of the different tools and for announcing changes to those tools if they’re required.	23	2
201506	1974	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Importantly, I think an advantage of having this separate note is that it enables us to publish the domestic policy directive to the Desk at the time our policy statement is released rather than in the minutes, which has long been our practice.	23	2
201506	1975	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	And I think this is an important step forward in transparency.	23	2
201506	1976	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Now, as Thomas noted, we do have an issue to decide today in connection with the directive, and that pertains to whether we should make some of what Thomas called “housekeeping changes” at this meeting that would set us up for making fewer changes to the directive later on, at the time of liftoff.	23	2
201506	1977	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	If we do make these changes today, the minutes would make it clear that such changes don’t signal any change in policy.	23	2
201506	1978	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	But I also realize that some observers could over-interpret these changes.	23	2
201506	1979	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	So, for my part, I can go either way on this.	23	2
201506	1980	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	I don’t think this is a critical issue for us.	23	2
201506	1981	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	One way or another, I think the minutes will summarize the discussion that we have about these housekeeping issues and about the new implementation note, and I think that’s worthwhile, so that if we were to end up making the housekeeping changes and putting out the new note at the time of liftoff, the fact that it would be covered in our meeting minutes means it wouldn’t be a complete surprise to market participants.	23	2
201506	1982	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	With those comments as background, I look forward to hearing your views on these issues and, of course, your comments on policy choices we have for today.	23	2
201506	1983	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Let me start with President Rosengren.	23	2
201506	1984	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	1985	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support option B.	23	2
201506	1986	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	We certainly would not want our first tightening of monetary policy from the zero lower bound to coincide with the default of a developed country.	23	2
201506	1987	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because of the uncertainties abroad, this would not have been the appropriate time for the first tightening, even if the domestic conditions we had set out initially had been met.	23	2
201506	1988	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, in my view, both conditions have yet to be met.	23	2
201506	1989	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Core PCE over the past year, at 1.2 percent, has been falling, not rising, and the U-3 unemployment rate has leveled off rather than continuing to improve.	23	2
201506	1990	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	In a low-inflation environment at the zero lower bound, it is instructive that the most common mistakes made by major central banks to date have been premature tightenings.	23	2
201506	1991	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Japan had a liftoff of rates in August 2000 and again in July 2006, yet both were subsequently reversed, and even today Japan remains far from its inflation goal.	23	2
201506	1992	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Similarly, the ECB tightened in April 2011 before reversing course only seven months later, and Sweden raised rates in July 2010 only to reverse course.	23	2
201506	1993	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	None of the central banks that raised rates and then reversed have hit their inflation targets recently.	23	2
201506	1994	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	To say the least, their reversals of policy and their subsequent inability to hit their inflation targets have not been confidence-building exercises.	23	2
201506	1995	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	The inherent asymmetry in our ability to offset shocks when at the zero lower bound is something to be taken very seriously.	23	2
201506	1996	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	We have a limited ability to offset unexpected weakness but a nearly limitless ability to offset unexpected strength.	23	2
201506	1997	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	We should learn from the mistakes of other central banks and tighten only when we are clearly on track to achieve our dual mandate.	23	2
201506	1998	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	The markets place the likelihood of raising rates in September as roughly a coin flip.	23	2
201506	1999	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	We should do nothing to indicate higher odds.	23	2
201506	2000	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	We still need to see further improvement in economic conditions, and I currently expect those conditions to be met sometime after our September meeting.	23	2
201506	2001	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	In terms of the areas that the Chair has asked us to discuss, I agree that a separate note on operational tools absolutely makes sense, and I think we should do it.	23	2
201506	2002	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would prefer that the changes to the directive be timed at liftoff rather than at the current time.	23	2
201506	2003	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I am concerned that people will maybe over-interpret the announcement going out with the minutes of this meeting.	23	2
201506	2004	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	And, finally, just in terms of the comments regarding data dependence and the tradeoff between data dependence and providing forward guidance, my preference would be that the statement be data dependent and that, to the extent forward guidance is going to be used, it not be used in the statement.	23	2
201506	2005	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is much more flexible to do it in a speech than it is in a statement.	23	2
201506	2006	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I take President Kocherlakota’s comments that the summertime is not a wonderful time to be giving speeches, I’m sure, if need be, the Chair, the Vice Chairman, and others will have the capability to schedule in August if it seems like the probabilities that people are putting on liftoff are dramatically different than we think is appropriate.	23	2
201506	2007	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would rather not hardwire things in the statement that could turn out to be negated if data surprised us once again on the weak side.	23	2
201506	2008	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	So my preference would be to truly keep the statement data dependent and not try to have any forward guidance in the statement.	23	2
201506	2009	2015-06-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2010	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201506	2011	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	First Vice President Prichard.	23	2
201506	2012	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2013	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	I also support alternative B as appropriate in light of the mixed developments since our previous meeting.	23	2
201506	2014	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	But I also feel the economy is both gaining traction and showing what could be a sustainable strength to give me confidence for liftoff later this year, assuming continued performance this summer.	23	2
201506	2015	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Assuming continued strengthening, I feel that we need to demonstrate our confidence in the economy and not risk a delayed liftoff that might needlessly sharpen the pace of tightening once we get started.	23	2
201506	2016	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Financial markets are gearing up for a gradual liftoff but may not be prepared for a more rapid rise.	23	2
201506	2017	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	So we should not test conditions by risking a rapid transition upward.	23	2
201506	2018	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	I also support the proposal for communicating the operational details for managing liftoff.	23	2
201506	2019	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	The proposed separate release should minimize the risk that any technical adjustments are incorrectly viewed as revisions to either present or future monetary policy statements, particularly if the adjustments take place between scheduled FOMC meetings.	23	2
201506	2020	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	I would note that, for the future, the language regarding the delegated authority to the Chair should be as precise as needed regarding the boundaries of what adjustments would be considered “modest.”	23	2
201506	2021	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	I hope we will have a better feel for the kinds of intermeeting adjustments that are regularly needed by the time the Committee chooses to make this delegation, which I fully support.	23	2
201506	2022	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	And, finally, whereas this will likely be my last occasion to join the FOMC table, I want to offer three brief observations.	23	2
201506	2023	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	First, I believe the deliberations at this table are perhaps a poster child for what discourse in this fair city should be: informed discussion, honest and transparent debate, excellent staff support, and a place in which diverse and independent views are not only welcomed but sincerely considered.	23	2
201506	2024	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Second, I would note that when I drive my car on any roadway in America, I can know precisely the speed of my travel because of the sophistication and the reliability of the instrumentation in my vehicle.	23	2
201506	2025	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	I find nothing analogous to be true when thinking about the economy.	23	2
201506	2026	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Reported conditions are constantly revised in a way that should remind us that economic performance is, at best, an estimate—surely more than an educated guess but, nevertheless, not as sure as my speedometer.	23	2
201506	2027	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	People say they can’t fix history, but economists never seem to tire of trying.	23	2
201506	2028	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	My third observation is that, as challenging as it is to estimate what’s already happened, I have found it even more difficult to predict the future.	23	2
201506	2029	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	I don’t know if anybody else here feels the same.	23	2
201506	2030	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	For my part, the zero lower bound is a handcuff from which we need to find a plausible and credible set of reasons to break free.	23	2
201506	2031	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	Liftoff has a stigma that must be overcome, much like pulling that first loose tooth from a child.	23	2
201506	2032	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	I know that this Committee will continue to lead with confidence to a new soft landing in a more normalized economy.	23	2
201506	2033	2015-06-17	meeting	PRICHARD	It has been my honor to have represented the Philadelphia Reserve Bank at these meetings, and I thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2034	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23	2
201506	2035	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23	2
201506	2036	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2037	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I support alternative B as written.	23	2
201506	2038	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Much of the apparent weakness in measured first-quarter GDP growth reflected the effects of transitory factors, including residual seasonality.	23	2
201506	2039	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The recent strength of the data, including the retail sales data and employment data, reaffirm my view that we are on a solid trajectory with good momentum, and I expect we’ll reach full employment later this year across a wide variety of measures of labor market conditions.	23	2
201506	2040	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Inflation remains too low, however, and while I’m becoming more confident that inflation will resume its approach to our 2 percent target, we’ve been repeatedly disappointed in the past.	23	2
201506	2041	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	As a result, gathering more evidence that inflation is on the right trajectory seems warranted at this stage.	23	2
201506	2042	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	That said, I remain convinced that the time for liftoff is fast approaching and that waiting much longer to raise the federal funds rate risks falling behind the curve.	23	2
201506	2043	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Doing so could ultimately necessitate steeper rate increases after liftoff, which may confuse and disrupt markets here and across the globe.	23	2
201506	2044	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, I understand that our liftoff is a discrete adjustment and one that’s difficult to undertake because of the concern that our actions may prove premature.	23	2
201506	2045	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Actually, I never even thought about this as pulling a tooth.	23	2
201506	2046	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I’m probably even more worried about it now, going back to my childhood.	23	2
201506	2047	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	23	2
201506	2048	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	But as President Rosengren appropriately said, we can point to numerous cases in the past where other central banks tightened policy too quickly, leading to undesirable outcomes.	23	2
201506	2049	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	That said, it is important to remind ourselves that our economic fundamentals are much sounder and our policy stance much more accommodative than in those instances.	23	2
201506	2050	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Looking ahead to potential future policy statements and the issue of forward guidance, there are two issues of forward guidance on which we want to be clear.	23	2
201506	2051	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	President Rosengren, you were talking about the forward guidance in our statements over the next few meetings, and I completely agree with your comments.	23	2
201506	2052	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	We should not be reintroducing near- term forward guidance.	23	2
201506	2053	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I like how our statements are formulated now.	23	2
201506	2054	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think there is another issue about forward guidance that is also in this discussion, and this refers to alternative C′, thinking about future language.	23	2
201506	2055	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	In paragraph 3, it says “The Committee currently anticipates that the economy will evolve in a manner that warrants a gradual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate” and has the other language about low interest rates.	23	2
201506	2056	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think this is an interesting topic about whether we want to introduce in the future some forward guidance of that type, the “gradual increase.”	23	2
201506	2057	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that is something we are going to have to see based on what happens between now and then.	23	2
201506	2058	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I also think that there is the issue that I just mentioned, that the longer we wait to start liftoff, the less likely it is that it will be appropriate to have a gradual increase in the target range of the funds rate.	23	2
201506	2059	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I do see the choice of language in the future depending obviously on how long it is until we start liftoff.	23	2
201506	2060	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	If we do it sooner, then I think that would support a gradual increase in the target range.	23	2
201506	2061	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	If we wait significantly longer, then I think that that would not be quite appropriate.	23	2
201506	2062	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of the memo on monetary policy implementation and directives, I’m fully supportive of the approach and the language you mentioned, Madam Chair, and that is described in the memo.	23	2
201506	2063	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	It is good to distinguish clearly between monetary policy decisions and what I would call the technicalities needed to achieve those decisions.	23	2
201506	2064	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I think it’s also important that, as the memo notes, this distinction would allow for modest adjustments in implementation, if needed, without necessitating additional FOMC statements.	23	2
201506	2065	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	This ensures that we avoid sending an incorrect signal to the public that monetary policy has somehow changed when actually we’re just making a technical implementation adjustment.	23	2
201506	2066	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Regarding the directive, I agree with your comments, Madam Chair, that it could go either way, but I do tend to lean toward not wanting to put new directive language in this time just out of nervousness that we’re signaling that we’re preparing something, that it might be misinterpreted.	23	2
201506	2067	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	It seems to me that having this discussion in the minutes would be fine, but, again, that’s just my own personal perspective.	23	2
201506	2068	2015-06-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23	2
201506	2069	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201506	2070	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23	2
201506	2071	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2072	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	To start, I support the plans for separate communication regarding our policy implementation tools after liftoff.	23	2
201506	2073	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	And I am okay with the housekeeping changes, but I can go either way, just as you suggested.	23	2
201506	2074	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	For today’s decision, I support alternative B as written.	23	2
201506	2075	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	I would note, though, that the recent softer economic data and lack of improvement in core PCE have led me to push back my preferred appropriate monetary policy liftoff date to midyear 2016.	23	2
201506	2076	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	My staff’s DSGE analysis that I talked about yesterday also pushed me in that direction.	23	2
201506	2077	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	As you recall, that analysis showed how changes in the Survey of Professional Forecasters’ 10-year CPI inflation outlook and other incoming data are holding back the model’s longer-run inflation outlook.	23	2
201506	2078	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	I appreciated the extremely useful and timely Tealbook analysis of the potential downward influences on the long-run equilibrium real interest rate and the policy implications of a lower value for r*.	23	2
201506	2079	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	I think most of us are accustomed to simply having a single r* assessment in mind and not really considering the uncertainty surrounding r*, at least as we formulate the models and analytical analyses.	23	2
201506	2080	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	A fundamental underpinning for the Committee’s choice of a 2 percent inflation objective back in January 2012 was strong confidence that the long-run equilibrium real rate was 2 percent or higher.	23	2
201506	2081	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, in our January 2012 SEP submissions, 16 out of 17 of the long-run federal funds rate dots were consistent with r* being between 2 and 2½ percent.	23	2
201506	2082	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Today the Tealbook assumes r* is 1½ percent, in line with its lower assessment for productivity growth and potential output growth.	23	2
201506	2083	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	And the Committee’s June SEP submissions show broad agreement on this point, as all but three of the long-run nominal funds rate dots are consistent with an equilibrium real rate between 1¼ and 1¾ percent.	23	2
201506	2084	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Furthermore, there is substantial uncertainty over this assessment.	23	2
201506	2085	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Larry Summers and Ben Bernanke have debated whether a lower equilibrium rate reflects secular stagnation or a persistent global savings glut, but quantifying the magnitudes of these factors remains an important research objective.	23	2
201506	2086	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Personally, I think that ascribing a zero effect to these phenomena seems unlikely.	23	2
201506	2087	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	More directly, lower potential output growth also suggests a lower r*.	23	2
201506	2088	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Again, the magnitude is uncertain and depends on the longer-run path for capital deepening, the effects of demographic trends, and whether TFP growth has persistently reverted to the slow-growth era of 1975 through 1995.	23	2
201506	2089	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Yesterday President Lacker made an interesting comment when he pointed out that the interest rate policy rules that we consider have intercepts and error terms that are isomorphic.	23	2
201506	2090	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	You can’t just, by themselves, pick out the contribution because they enter in a linear fashion.	23	2
201506	2091	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	23	2
201506	2092	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	But there is more identifying information that can come from these other analyses, like this list of factors that I just mentioned, and I think that it is important to assess that additional information as opposed to just ignoring it.	23	2
201506	2093	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	We should take into account the fact that the posterior distribution of long-run r* is widely dispersed and that most of the weight in this distribution is on lower values than we were thinking back in January 2012.	23	2
201506	2094	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Perhaps the posterior mode for r* is at the Tealbook assessment of 1½ percent.	23	2
201506	2095	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	But for me, 1 percent or below also garners significant weight, and I put far less weight on r* being as high as 2 percent and negligible weights on higher values above 2 percent.	23	2
201506	2096	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	This uncertainty has profound implications for monetary policy.	23	2
201506	2097	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	If the long-run equilibrium real rate is substantially lower than 2 percent, then the historically low nominal funds rate paths that most of us have written down in our SEP submissions are not nearly as accommodative as we might have previously thought.	23	2
201506	2098	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	And, Madam Chair, you alluded to the same phenomenon when you talked about if productivity growth ends up being slower, that means r* will be lower, and, in fact, each and every point of our funds rate settings will be more restrictive.	23	2
201506	2099	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Of course, if economic fundamentals improve strongly, and inflation begins to rise more quickly, I would see that as evidence that the lowest r* values are diminishing in likelihood.	23	2
201506	2100	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	And, you know, this is another refutable implication of the viewpoint I think President Lacker associated with, which is that high r* is quite possible.	23	2
201506	2101	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	In that case, our funds rate would be more accommodative and we ought to see inflation rising much more rapidly to our inflation objective.	23	2
201506	2102	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	That ends up being a testable implication, and we can look for that.	23	2
201506	2103	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	But I suspect that won’t be the case.	23	2
201506	2104	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Most likely, the economy will continue to face many challenging headwinds.	23	2
201506	2105	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	I will look to the data in order to decide these issues, but I want to be clear that the data have already provided a lot of evidence suggesting troubling and highly persistent phenomena that should weigh importantly in our strategies concerning liftoff and the subsequent normalization of policy rates.	23	2
201506	2106	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	And just to be completely clear, I think that a full-throated endorsement of our symmetric inflation objective strategy could be a very helpful counterbalance to current and future headwinds.	23	2
201506	2107	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	I agree completely with the comments that President Kocherlakota made yesterday regarding risks to our inflation objective and how we should address them.	23	2
201506	2108	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	After all, even a 2 percent inflation target gives us uncomfortably little margin to engineer low enough real rates.	23	2
201506	2109	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	We don’t want to make things worse by creating a de facto target below 2 percent.	23	2
201506	2110	2015-06-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2111	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201506	2112	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	First Vice President Holcomb.	23	2
201506	2113	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2114	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	In reviewing the policy options in preparation for this meeting, one of our economists posited that we may find ourselves in a situation like that faced by the game warden in the movie Jurassic Park.	23	2
201506	2115	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	You may recall the scene in which the warden calmly and deliberately prepares to shoot an approaching velociraptor, only to discover too late that another raptor has snuck up on his flank.	23	2
201506	2116	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	His last words are “clever girl.”	23	2
201506	2117	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	[Laughter]	23	2
201506	2118	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	High inflation is the velociraptor that captures our attention as we watch for the right moment to deploy our weapons.	23	2
201506	2119	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	It is still quite far in the distance.	23	2
201506	2120	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Of greater or equal concern should be the raptor that may be sneaking up on our flank, the raptor that could bring this expansion to a premature or unpleasant end.	23	2
201506	2121	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	The worry is that business investment decisions, consumer durable goods purchases, and household and business borrowing commitments undertaken in an artificially favorable financial environment won’t be easily unwound when financial conditions eventually normalize.	23	2
201506	2122	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	It is difficult to achieve smooth convergence in an economy with capital and debt overhangs, and the longer artificially favorable financial conditions persist, the greater these overhangs are likely to become.	23	2
201506	2123	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	The damage to the economy from overshooting full employment is cumulative, and as it accumulates, the threat to macroeconomic stability mounts.	23	2
201506	2124	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	In other words, the price to be paid for running the economy hot is not just the risk of a period of above-target inflation.	23	2
201506	2125	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Even if inflation does not pick up, imbalances are created that are unsustainable.	23	2
201506	2126	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Consequently, the risks associated with too much and too little policy accommodation are not asymmetric as the economy approaches full employment.	23	2
201506	2127	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Too much accommodation or accommodation maintained far too long is as risky as too little accommodation, even after factoring in the zero lower bound for interest rates.	23	2
201506	2128	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	I noted yesterday that the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ staff economic forecasts are generally in the central tendency of the projections submitted in this round of the SEP exercise.	23	2
201506	2129	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	They see the economy pushing past full employment early next year, and inflation, as measured by the Dallas Fed trimmed mean PCE index, reaching 2 percent by the end of 2016.	23	2
201506	2130	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	This is a different outlook than is presented in Tealbook, Book A, and, accordingly, we take a somewhat different view of the policy rule prescriptions in simulations presented in Tealbook B.	23	2
201506	2131	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Also, for reasons just discussed, we do not see the zero bound as a compelling reason for treating policy risk as asymmetric in an economy that is closing in on full employment.	23	2
201506	2132	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Accordingly, our view is that the appropriate path for the funds rate is likely to be steeper than is currently expected by the public or is assumed in the Tealbook baseline forecast.	23	2
201506	2133	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	We assess recent developments as providing reassurance that the risk of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished.	23	2
201506	2134	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	So I lean toward alternative C.	23	2
201506	2135	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	It best describes our view of the data as the data have evolved since our April meeting, as well as the data’s implications for the outlook and appropriate policy.	23	2
201506	2136	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	However, I will support B, as it keeps our options open to respond to new data.	23	2
201506	2137	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	We have some concern, though, that B has the potential to mislead the public.	23	2
201506	2138	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	According to the SEP package, the majority of participants believes that it will be appropriate to raise the federal funds target range in September of 2015 or earlier.	23	2
201506	2139	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	This indicates substantially greater probability of liftoff by September than after September.	23	2
201506	2140	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	That is not what the private analysts think, according to the charts presented yesterday.	23	2
201506	2141	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Therefore, communications that help bring public perceptions more in line with those of the Committee will be important.	23	2
201506	2142	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	In response to the request yesterday, I have a couple of comments on alternative C′.	23	2
201506	2143	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	First, in paragraph 3, I think it is preferable not to include the statement that “the Committee currently anticipates that the economy will evolve in a manner that warrants a gradual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate,” even if it is true.	23	2
201506	2144	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	It is my understanding that the federal funds rate path prescribed by optimal control techniques and simple Taylor-style policy rules are quite sensitive to financial conditions and the economic outlook, so that the warranted policy rate path could steepen in response to completely plausible changes in circumstances.	23	2
201506	2145	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Saying that the Committee expects a gradual policy rate path without also communicating the substantial sensitivity of that expectation to changes in the outlook could give private decisionmakers a distorted view of how policy may evolve.	23	2
201506	2146	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	If the statement remains, a stronger warning about the degree to which normalization’s pace will be subject to adjustment as the economic outlook changes should also be included.	23	2
201506	2147	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Overall, we prefer to let private analysts draw their own inferences about the future path of policy from the SEP dot chart.	23	2
201506	2148	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	It also seems confusing in paragraph 4 to indicate that reinvesting principal and rolling over maturing Treasuries is designed to “help maintain accommodative financial conditions” in the same communication that conveys the Committee’s decision to reduce accommodation.	23	2
201506	2149	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	It would be better to make reference to or include the pertinent language from the Committee’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, which states that reinvestments will continue until later in the normalization process.	23	2
201506	2150	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Finally, with respect to the proposals on communicating the details for implementation at liftoff, I think the proposal presented is very sensible, and I support proceeding as described.	23	2
201506	2151	2015-06-17	meeting	HOLCOMB	Thank you.	23	2
201506	2152	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201506	2153	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23	2
201506	2154	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2155	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	In my view, the economy can support a 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate.	23	2
201506	2156	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Inflation is projected to return gradually to our goal over the medium run, and recent inflation developments bolster confidence in that projection.	23	2
201506	2157	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	The economy is at or is very near full employment.	23	2
201506	2158	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	I grant there may be some longer-run issues with underemployment, but monetary policy isn’t the tool to fix those problems.	23	2
201506	2159	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Even after the first increase, monetary policy will remain very accommodative.	23	2
201506	2160	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	I share the view of John Williams that if we wait too long to commence liftoff, we may find ourselves having to increase rates on a steeper path than we’ve anticipated and that we’ve conveyed to the markets.	23	2
201506	2161	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	But while I believe the economy could support liftoff at this time, we haven’t prepared the markets and the public for a rate increase today, so I’m not advocating it.	23	2
201506	2162	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	That leads me to the policy statement and the choice between alternatives B and C.	23	2
201506	2163	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	I understand some of the reluctance to make changes in the FOMC statement because of the risk that it could change the public’s expectations about policy, which currently incorporate liftoff later this year, but I believe there is also risk if our statements are too static.	23	2
201506	2164	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	As liftoff approaches, I believe our statements should evolve to lay the foundation for the rationale for liftoff.	23	2
201506	2165	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	I do think the SEP can reinforce that rationale, but I don’t view the SEP as a substitute for the FOMC statement.	23	2
201506	2166	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	We should convey information about how economic conditions have evolved relative to the liftoff conditions we’ve included in the statement since March—namely, further improvement in the labor market and reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over time.	23	2
201506	2167	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	If the goal today is to try to maintain the current modal expectation in the market that the economy will likely be ready for liftoff in September, then my preference would be to use some of the alternative C language today.	23	2
201506	2168	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	For example, in paragraph 1, to characterize the labor market, I would prefer to refer to “some improvement in labor market conditions,” as in alternative C, rather than to diminishing “underutilization of labor resources,” as in alternative B, because this language more closely relates to the further improvement language in our liftoff criteria.	23	2
201506	2169	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	In paragraph 2, I’d prefer to give some indication that the risk of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished because this ties directly to reasonable confidence regarding the inflation outlook, another of the liftoff criteria.	23	2
201506	2170	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	In paragraph 3, I prefer the alternative C language that modifies the liftoff criteria, adding the word “some” to characterize the improvement we need to see in the labor market.	23	2
201506	2171	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	This acknowledges the improvement in the labor market since the language was adopted in March and that we are closer to meeting the criteria for liftoff.	23	2
201506	2172	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	In addition, I continue to think that providing a longer-run perspective on economic developments than is currently done in paragraph 1 would serve the Committee better as we move toward liftoff and beyond.	23	2
201506	2173	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	I do believe we should be data dependent.	23	2
201506	2174	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Data dependence risks being interpreted as being focused on the short run and being less systematic.	23	2
201506	2175	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	I think we need to use our tools of communication to try to avoid that interpretation.	23	2
201506	2176	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	A longer-run focus, I think, would help in that respect.	23	2
201506	2177	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	My hope is that we can move to alternative C language—if not today, then in July—so we’ll have better prepared the public for liftoff in September, should the economy evolve as I anticipate.	23	2
201506	2178	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	A delay in making changes to this statement will make it harder to make data- dependent policy choices because we will not have laid the appropriate groundwork with our communication.	23	2
201506	2179	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Lack of that groundwork could cause us to feel compelled to keep delaying liftoff because of the risk of surprising the markets or, should we move, of causing increased volatility because market expectations aren’t aligned with the policy action.	23	2
201506	2180	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Neither is a particularly good place to be.	23	2
201506	2181	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	I think we can avoid both situations by appropriately evolving the statement.	23	2
201506	2182	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	I don’t have strong preferences about the directive or the housekeeping details, whether they should be included today or we should wait until liftoff.	23	2
201506	2183	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Regarding the monetary policy implementation memo, I am comfortable with the proposed approach of separating the details of implementation from the FOMC statement.	23	2
201506	2184	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	I’m not concerned about the governance aspects surrounding our policy tools.	23	2
201506	2185	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Monetary policy remains the responsibility of the FOMC, and we’ve discussed at earlier meetings regarding normalization that the Board of Governors will be setting the IOER rate to support the policy intentions of the FOMC.	23	2
201506	2186	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	But if separating the FOMC statement from the implementation details would bring less focus to the governance aspects of the tools, as suggested in the memo, that’s an added benefit of the proposal.	23	2
201506	2187	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	The only concern I have about the authorizations to the Chair of making modest intermeeting adjustments in the IOER and ON RRP rates is the timing of the resolutions, not the delegation of authority, and so let me just explain what my concern is.	23	2
201506	2188	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Suppose we haven’t had to make any intermeeting changes in the rates in the early stages of liftoff.	23	2
201506	2189	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Then if we delegate authority later in the process, will it be read as something has changed, and somehow we’ve lost control or think we’re going to lose control and have to make intermeeting changes?	23	2
201506	2190	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Will it sound like things are getting harder?	23	2
201506	2191	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	My one suggestion would be that if we do wait to adopt a resolution as proposed in the staff memo, we mention in the minutes that such delegation of authority to the Chair is expected to come at a later date once liftoff is under way.	23	2
201506	2192	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	The memo also asked for views on when we should indicate that we anticipate a temporary suspension of the aggregate cap on the RRP facility, at the time of liftoff or later.	23	2
201506	2193	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	I don’t have strong views on that.	23	2
201506	2194	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	We can convey this information before or after liftoff.	23	2
201506	2195	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	We’ve included in the minutes of the March FOMC meeting that the Committee saw some advantages to a temporary elevation or suspension of the cap.	23	2
201506	2196	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	So I think waiting until liftoff would be fine with me.	23	2
201506	2197	2015-06-17	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2198	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23	2
201506	2199	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23	2
201506	2200	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2201	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	I support option B for today.	23	2
201506	2202	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	As I said yesterday and I’ve said in the past, with regard to our goal variables, we’re about as close as we’ve ever been in the postwar era.	23	2
201506	2203	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	So I think it’s time that we look for opportunities to move our target policy rate off emergency settings.	23	2
201506	2204	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	We have a zero policy rate, and we have a very large balance sheet.	23	2
201506	2205	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	Those are the same settings that we had when we were much further from our goal variables.	23	2
201506	2206	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	Certainly, the data that come in over the summer are going to be mixed, and I think we have to have the idea that we’ll be opportunistic in our first policy move.	23	2
201506	2207	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	Also, once we make the policy move, obviously we’re still going to be very accommodative.	23	2
201506	2208	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	We’re trying to hedge our bets in the direction of the economy getting more toward normal, so we’re trying to move policy more toward normal, but we’re still going to be very accommodative.	23	2
201506	2209	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	We would like to take opportunities to make these policy moves, and I would very much like to make the first move on the back of good news about the economy.	23	2
201506	2210	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	Prescheduling September is going to work against this principle.	23	2
201506	2211	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	I mean, maybe the data will come in great right before that meeting and that will be perfect, but life often doesn’t work out perfectly.	23	2
201506	2212	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	Anything we can do to try to get to a more flexible approach in which every meeting is, ex ante, identical I think would be very helpful.	23	2
201506	2213	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t think the Committee is really ready to think in terms of moving opportunistically, but that’s how we’re going to have to move over the normalization process.	23	2
201506	2214	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	The more we can, in our own minds, get toward that kind of an attitude, and then maybe get to a method that would actually implement that, I think would be helpful.	23	2
201506	2215	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	I have two comments on the SEP.	23	2
201506	2216	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	One is about SEP paths being given according to an optimal policy assumption, and the second is about the horizon.	23	2
201506	2217	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	First, I think when we talk about the SEP, we need to clarify to people that the projections are put forward under an optimal policy assumption.	23	2
201506	2218	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	We might all be using different models.	23	2
201506	2219	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	Within those different models, policy might be somewhat different, and so the various forecasts are not all made on the same basis.	23	2
201506	2220	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	They are not unconditional forecasts the way private-sector forecasts are, where the private- sector forecaster is also trying to forecast what this Committee will do and will give you an out- and-out forecast that you would then evaluate against mean-squared criterion or something like that.	23	2
201506	2221	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	Here we’re saying, given the models we have, we’re putting something in under an optimal policy within that model.	23	2
201506	2222	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	So I’d appreciate it if we’d mention this when we talk about the SEP because I don’t think that they are the same thing as the unconditional forecasts given in the private sector.	23	2
201506	2223	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	For me, missing a rate rise means worse outcomes for the economy, according to the model that I’m using.	23	2
201506	2224	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	So if you miss the time when the model said you should have lifted off, then you’re going to get worse outcomes going forward than you otherwise could have achieved if you had raised rates earlier.	23	2
201506	2225	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	But given that you didn’t move, there’s some optimal policy going on from that point.	23	2
201506	2226	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	Over the normalization phase, I think this effect will cause federal funds rate dot paths to shift because we’re not all exactly on the same timing schedule.	23	2
201506	2227	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	So you’ve got these dot paths shifting around.	23	2
201506	2228	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	That may not be indicating a change in the sentiment of the Committee as to where we are or what we need to do but is a detail of how the SEP is put together.	23	2
201506	2229	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	So I try to emphasize this.	23	2
201506	2230	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	I know that it doesn’t go very far when I talk to people outside this Committee.	23	2
201506	2231	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	I know that we all understand it here, but the SEP is a different object from the private-sector forecasts that are often cited.	23	2
201506	2232	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	The second comment on the SEP is that the horizon shifts through the year.	23	2
201506	2233	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	That’s something that we’ve always done, but I think it is kind of odd, and it warps the interpretation of the SEP compared with what it otherwise could be.	23	2
201506	2234	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	What people really want to know is, what’s your year-ahead outlook and your two-year-ahead outlook?	23	2
201506	2235	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	We should always be giving them a year-ahead outlook and a two-year-ahead outlook in a format that they can digest and see what we’re saying.	23	2
201506	2236	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	What’s happening is, you get a bad first quarter.	23	2
201506	2237	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	Well, everyone has to mark down their forecast for the year if that was unexpected, and then we all think that the future looks worse than we previously said, but that isn’t really what’s going on.	23	2
201506	2238	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	We’re saying that that was an unexpected shock, and that the next four quarters and the four quarters beyond that might look roughly the same as they did before, and so that we have not perhaps changed our views that much on how the economy is going to evolve going forward.	23	2
201506	2239	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	So if we could get to something like that in the SEP, it might be an improvement.	23	2
201506	2240	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	I understand that that’s a little bit different from how, let’s say, the IMF would do it, or how other people would do it, but on the other hand, we’re trying to convey what our outlook is, given the data we have today, then going forward from here—four-quarter, eight-quarter horizons.	23	2
201506	2241	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	On the other questions about C′ and about the housekeeping changes, I was fine with what the staff proposed.	23	2
201506	2242	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t have any further comments on that.	23	2
201506	2243	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	I would be happy to do the housekeeping changes at this meeting if people feel like that would get that out of the way, so we didn’t have to do that at the time of the actual rate rise.	23	2
201506	2244	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2245	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201506	2246	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23	2
201506	2247	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2248	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I support the policy decision in alternative B and the statement as written.	23	2
201506	2249	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	As I see things today, I am very hopeful that conditions will gel to allow liftoff in September.	23	2
201506	2250	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Looking ahead, I am at a similar place as President Mester.	23	2
201506	2251	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I like the idea of a very soft progression from language like that in alternative B today to alternative C in July as being a sensible approach to providing some slight foreshadowing of liftoff in the July statement, if it seems appropriate.	23	2
201506	2252	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	At the July statement, if the data overall continue to reflect modest continuing improvement, then language along the lines of the changes in paragraphs 2 and 3 in today’s alternative C might provide a hint of forward guidance.	23	2
201506	2253	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I agree with the proposal to separate the rationale for the policy decision from the implementation of the policy decision at liftoff.	23	2
201506	2254	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	In considering the specifics of communication, my guiding principle is “meaningfulness to markets.”	23	2
201506	2255	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	The staff has listed several changes to the directive—the so-called housekeeping issues—that are unrelated to liftoff and can be communicated immediately if the Committee so chooses.	23	2
201506	2256	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	These details strike me as worthwhile in the interest of clarity and accuracy but not particularly meaningful to market participants.	23	2
201506	2257	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	So I favor holding off and communicating these changes when we publish the implementation note at liftoff.	23	2
201506	2258	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	In contrast, it seems to me that the question of when and how to communicate the temporary suspension, at liftoff, of the current overnight reverse repo cap is meaningful to markets.	23	2
201506	2259	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Reflecting the caution and prudence with which we are preparing operationally for liftoff, I think it would be prudent to signal this decision prior to liftoff.	23	2
201506	2260	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	This will allow market participants to plan for the liftoff period and so should help achieve a smooth liftoff.	23	2
201506	2261	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Presuming a September liftoff, the minutes of this meeting or the July meeting seem to me a good tool to communicate this decision.	23	2
201506	2262	2015-06-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2263	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201506	2264	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	23	2
201506	2265	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2266	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I am going to make the dangerous step of trying to actually respond on the fly to some of the things I have heard as opposed to sticking to my script.	23	2
201506	2267	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My research director is probably blanching as I say this.	23	2
201506	2268	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Something that President Mester said really resonated with me.	23	2
201506	2269	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	At the risk of putting words in her mouth, I worry that our approach of being data dependent is leading us to not be as sufficiently strategic in our thinking about policymaking.	23	2
201506	2270	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think one of the benefits of actually being as explicit as alternative A is—for example, about the criteria for liftoff—is that it forces us internally to also be explicit in our thinking about, what are our criteria for liftoff?	23	2
201506	2271	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I worry that data dependence is a code for “we’ll know it when we see it.”	23	2
201506	2272	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I’m not sure that is really as helpful as it could be for markets and for the public, to know what actually we are looking for in terms of making decisions for policy.	23	2
201506	2273	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Alternative B, I think, is very challenging for the public to know what actually is going to be informing our decisions about liftoff.	23	2
201506	2274	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I listen to people around the table, I try to listen for what the risk-management considerations are leading folks to the positions they’re at.	23	2
201506	2275	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One concern I have heard is that if we wait too long, we are going to have to raise rates more rapidly than is currently under consideration in the outlook.	23	2
201506	2276	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Right now, the projected increases that I see in the SEP, for example, are something on the order of 75 to 100 basis points per year.	23	2
201506	2277	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We should be raising rates at a time when the economy is robust enough to withstand that rate of increase in interest rates.	23	2
201506	2278	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s a very slow rate of increase in the interest rates, 75 to 100 basis points per year.	23	2
201506	2279	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So it is hard for me to take that risk on board, that we might have to go as fast as 150 basis points per year, or 200, and that is a material risk here.	23	2
201506	2280	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought that First Vice President Holcomb’s comments were really great.	23	2
201506	2281	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think this is a risk that is underlying a lot of discussion about the risk of actually driving employment too high, the risk of driving unemployment too low.	23	2
201506	2282	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And she spoke about it in terms of the cumulative damage to the economy being done by imbalances.	23	2
201506	2283	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Having said that, I liked her framing the risk in that way.	23	2
201506	2284	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think if that is actually something that is materially on the table, that we are worried about having employment get too high, we need to have some evidence about what exactly the damage is that we are looking at.	23	2
201506	2285	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Is this the 1990s kind of period we are going into, where we are seeing a lot of great technological development going on in Silicon Valley that will serve us well for the next 15 or 20 years?	23	2
201506	2286	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Or is it something more like the 2000s, with debt financing of unsustainable consumption?	23	2
201506	2287	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think knowing where the metrics are would help me, at least, understand a little bit better about, are we really seeing the signs of the damage?	23	2
201506	2288	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What exactly should we be looking for beyond simply saying, “We don’t want to have employment get too high”?	23	2
201506	2289	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that’s a challenging message for how to make monetary policy.	23	2
201506	2290	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You know, President Rosengren pointed to the zero lower bound risks, and I worry that we are not taking those on board sufficiently in our thinking about policy.	23	2
201506	2291	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	He cited the evidence from other countries, but I don’t think we have to look as far afield as the evidence from other countries.	23	2
201506	2292	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we should look at what has been going on in our own country in the past nine months or so, that the arc of what is going on with economic activity in the past two quarters and into the current quarter is weak if you look at the path of real GDP.	23	2
201506	2293	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If you look at inflation, I think the path of what we’re seeing on the demand side, again, looks weak.	23	2
201506	2294	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Part of this is related to increases in the dollar.	23	2
201506	2295	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Part of it is related to, I think, increases in yields.	23	2
201506	2296	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The dollar comment that we’ve all heard from all of our interlocutors is, “That sounds like something that is associated with the expectation of tighter monetary policy.”	23	2
201506	2297	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, the countervailing piece of evidence is that labor markets have been relatively strong—relative to demographics, especially.	23	2
201506	2298	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But as the Vice Chairman has emphasized—and you did, too, Madam Chair—that has resulted in very low productivity.	23	2
201506	2299	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And the real question for this Committee over the next few months and into 2016 is going to be, how is that going to get resolved?	23	2
201506	2300	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Are we creating low-demand conditions through our tight monetary policy, or is it that we’ve got some mismeasurement of some kind in GDP that will resolve in our favor?	23	2
201506	2301	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I like alternative A because it has more accommodation.	23	2
201506	2302	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I also like it because I think it forces the Committee to be a little more strategic in the way it is framing the criteria for liftoff, thinking about that more collectively, as opposed to, “We’ll wait and see what happens, and we’ll go with it if things feel right.”	23	2
201506	2303	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So let me turn to post-liftoff communication issues.	23	2
201506	2304	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I want to make two points, and the first is related to what I have already said, that I think that there is an opportunity now that we should take advantage to redraft the FOMC statement completely.	23	2
201506	2305	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think alternative C′ is overly complex, and I think this redrafting is not just a question of rhetorical elegance.	23	2
201506	2306	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It is to try to reduce the chances of miscommunication as the FOMC deals with a series of complicated policy issues.	23	2
201506	2307	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We put a lot of weight on the liftoff decision, but liftoff, as Governor Fischer has reminded us, is really the first of many complicated steps the Committee is going to be facing.	23	2
201506	2308	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We want our statement to be as tight and as effective as possible to allow us to communicate and communicate well.	23	2
201506	2309	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think there are a lot of great ideas out there.	23	2
201506	2310	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Presidents Williams and Mester have made past suggestions about how to restructure the statement.	23	2
201506	2311	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My research director, Sam Schulhofer-Wohl, has a great essay in our annual report with an explicit example of how to rewrite the statement in a more effective way.	23	2
201506	2312	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My main emphasis is, I think there is always this temptation to put this continually on the back burner.	23	2
201506	2313	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We’ll wait and wait and wait because we don’t want to frighten anybody in the markets by doing this.	23	2
201506	2314	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I don’t think we will be as effective as we need to be during this very challenging phase of monetary policy if we don’t redraft the statement in a material way, and soon.	23	2
201506	2315	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, in terms of policy implementation, I thought the idea of putting the detailed information in a separate note was a great idea.	23	2
201506	2316	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	A couple of comments on it.	23	2
201506	2317	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it needs to be clearly subordinate to the Committee’s statement of its policy stance.	23	2
201506	2318	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As drafted, it has that feel already, but I would recommend changing the name even further to subordinate it, to something like Details of Monetary Policy Implementation.	23	2
201506	2319	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I like the way it is currently written.	23	2
201506	2320	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it is important for us to strongly resist the temptation to use it as another form of communication about policy.	23	2
201506	2321	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There shouldn’t be any extra language, and it should be as close to a template as possible so that all we are doing is simply filling in relevant numbers as they are decided.	23	2
201506	2322	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	A final point is about the removal of the cap on the ON RRP facility.	23	2
201506	2323	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We need to make clear that it is a temporary measure associated with liftoff.	23	2
201506	2324	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I believe that is still the thinking of the Committee.	23	2
201506	2325	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There are good ways to use the minutes of this meeting and others closer to liftoff as being appropriate ways to accomplish that goal.	23	2
201506	2326	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I will just summarize what I am trying to say about post-liftoff communication.	23	2
201506	2327	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I really think we need to work to simplify the FOMC statement greatly as soon as possible.	23	2
201506	2328	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My staff is ready to help in that effort in any way that they can.	23	2
201506	2329	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I favor a separate note about the details of monetary policy implementation, as the staff has suggested.	23	2
201506	2330	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That should be as close to a template as we can possibly get, in which only numbers are changed.	23	2
201506	2331	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of the housekeeping changes now or later, my own perspective is I think we are less likely to run into complications with those housekeeping changes if we have them in the minutes—not front and center in terms of communication.	23	2
201506	2332	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I would suggest making them now, but I don’t feel that strongly about that.	23	2
201506	2333	2015-06-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	23	2
201506	2334	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201506	2335	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23	2
201506	2336	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2337	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	I support alternative C as being consistent with the data-dependent policy and with the statement in the previous FOMC minutes that the Committee’s decision to begin normalizing policy would appropriately be determined on a meeting-by-meeting basis.	23	2
201506	2338	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of the criteria for liftoff, the March meeting minutes noted that further improvement in the labor market, stabilization of energy prices, and a leveling out of the foreign exchange value of the dollar would all be seen as helpful in establishing confidence that inflation would turn up.	23	2
201506	2339	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Since March, we’ve seen progress around each of those criteria.	23	2
201506	2340	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Employment growth has averaged 207,000 over the past three months, and broader indicators of labor market activity have registered similar improvement.	23	2
201506	2341	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Readings on core PCE inflation have remained largely stable on a year-over-year basis since December.	23	2
201506	2342	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	And, since the April meeting, we’ve seen oil prices drift higher while the dollar has been relatively stable, which together give me confidence that transitory effects will dissipate.	23	2
201506	2343	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, our policy rules continue to point to higher rates, and the byproduct of our highly accommodative policy can be found in the incentives of searching for higher yield and the willingness to take on additional risk when interest rate expectations are flat.	23	2
201506	2344	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	With the combination of these factors, and understanding that monetary policy operates with long lags, I believe that it is time to begin the process for normalizing policy.	23	2
201506	2345	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	In light of yesterday’s discussion about the implication of alternative values of the long- run federal funds rate, I would note, as I did at the previous meeting, that measures of r* often do not move independently of measures of the output gap.	23	2
201506	2346	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	I understand the correlation may not be perfect, but I think an important scenario to consider, as others have noted, is what a lower r*, driven by lower potential output, implies for monetary policy.	23	2
201506	2347	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Productivity growth has been running far below earlier trends.	23	2
201506	2348	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	This suggests a low r* is likely to be reflective of slowing growth of potential GDP rather than persistent weak demand.	23	2
201506	2349	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	If that’s true, the implications for the output gap and liftoff do not necessarily suggest a later liftoff, so I look forward to further discussion and analysis of this aspect of our policy decisionmaking.	23	2
201506	2350	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of today’s decision, market expectations for liftoff are clearly focused on September, with a skew toward December and even into 2016.	23	2
201506	2351	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	This suggests to me that one soft data point—a soft employment report, similar to what we had in March—could easily push expectations back to December.	23	2
201506	2352	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Yet for all the hand-wringing about the slowdown in Q1, the employment numbers remained solid and growth seems to be on a relatively firm footing.	23	2
201506	2353	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Yet the strong employment report in May did little to move expectations forward.	23	2
201506	2354	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	This asymmetry is going to be hard to overcome, and it risks pushing back the date of liftoff as we wait to see a consistent streak of strong data.	23	2
201506	2355	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of the two items that we’ve highlighted, I am fine with a separate implementation note.	23	2
201506	2356	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	I think that will serve us well in keeping that separate from the statement.	23	2
201506	2357	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	And in terms of the housekeeping changes for the directive, I would be comfortable doing those today with the minutes, noting what their relevance is in terms of future decisions.	23	2
201506	2358	2015-06-17	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	23	2
201506	2359	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201506	2360	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23	2
201506	2361	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2362	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	In April I noted that more than the usual amount of data was scheduled to come in by this meeting, and that, if it came in consistent with our projections, I thought a strong case could be made to raise the funds rate target.	23	2
201506	2363	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	To me, it’s clear that the data have been pretty consistent with our April expectations.	23	2
201506	2364	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	In fact, in the Tealbook projection for the first half, real GDP growth is now one-tenth higher than it was at the previous meeting.	23	2
201506	2365	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	It is also now apparent that we’re in the midst of the longest sustained improvement in household spending growth we’ve seen in this recovery.	23	2
201506	2366	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Labor market conditions have clearly improved as well.	23	2
201506	2367	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	We’ve continued strong growth in employment and job openings, and since the April meeting, we’ve seen confirmation of the expected rebound in core inflation.	23	2
201506	2368	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	So I believe we have good reason to be confident that, barring further shocks, inflation will move back to our 2 percent target.	23	2
201506	2369	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Taking this all on board, my preference would be to raise rates at this meeting.	23	2
201506	2370	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Raising rates now would be a natural and understandable response to the economic data we have in hand, and a quarter-point increase would still leave us with a highly accommodative policy stance, a point Governor Fischer made eloquently last time.	23	2
201506	2371	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	I will not vote against keeping rates unchanged today, however.	23	2
201506	2372	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	I understand the concerns of those for whom the incoming data are not yet completely convincing, and I do not think we would be making a terribly costly mistake by waiting another meeting or two to raise rates.	23	2
201506	2373	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	It would raise the risk of getting behind the curve, but at this point, tolerably so, I think.	23	2
201506	2374	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	I do believe that the risk would rise if the data come in in line with our projections over the next several months and we don’t raise rates.	23	2
201506	2375	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	In addition, I see risk going forward of our data dependence becoming something of a one-way ratchet mechanism, as described by President George, in which the emergence of new reasons for concern, soft data points, lead us to delay expected liftoff, but the dissipation or passing of those soft data points does not lead to a commensurate offsetting movement bringing the expected liftoff backward in time.	23	2
201506	2376	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Our data dependence ought to be symmetric in this respect.	23	2
201506	2377	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	More broadly, as we go into this, we should recognize that there are always going to be concerns.	23	2
201506	2378	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Soft data points will always turn up from time to time, and the prospect of certainty just around the corner is something of a mirage.	23	2
201506	2379	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Regarding the statement, I prefer the language of alternative C to that of alternative B.	23	2
201506	2380	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	President Mester was open about this.	23	2
201506	2381	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	I think it better reflects reality right now.	23	2
201506	2382	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Any remaining underutilization of labor resources is immaterial, I believe, and I think that the risk of inflation running below 2 percent has diminished significantly.	23	2
201506	2383	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	More broadly, I support her concerns about the statement.	23	2
201506	2384	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	In particular, I’d highlight the reliance we’ve been placing lately on paragraph 1, which is a recitation of what has happened since the previous meeting, and I think that gives short shrift in the statement to the extent to which our decision is going to be driven by a longer-run perspective on what’s evolved in the economic data.	23	2
201506	2385	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	In addition, I don’t think we should view it as necessary that we send a message like statement C as a clear signal, as a prerequisite for liftoff.	23	2
201506	2386	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	So we shouldn’t wait.	23	2
201506	2387	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Liftoff should be a live option whether or not we’ve issued a statement like C.	23	2
201506	2388	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	And, commensurately, a statement like C shouldn’t make us feel compelled to lift off at the next meeting.	23	2
201506	2389	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	I think that’s consistent with the extent to which we’ve decided to make decisions on a meeting-by-meeting, data-dependent basis.	23	2
201506	2390	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Regarding alternative C′, I think we should give some very careful thought to the sentence in paragraph 3 that talks about “a gradual increase in the target range.”	23	2
201506	2391	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	I share some of the concerns that have been expressed about this.	23	2
201506	2392	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	This reintroduces forward guidance language, and it’s language that’s awfully reminiscent of the measured-pace formula that I was a party to from 2004 to 2006.	23	2
201506	2393	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	In hindsight, I’m not sure that that was a good idea, and my sense is that there are widely shared misgivings ex post about that.	23	2
201506	2394	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Maybe it didn’t absolutely lock us in to moving 25 basis points every single meeting, but it did seem to raise a bar that made it hard to do anything but 25 basis points.	23	2
201506	2395	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	And I think the word “gradual” could suffer the same fate.	23	2
201506	2396	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	It could become identified with moving at every other meeting.	23	2
201506	2397	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	And our scheduled press conference at every other meeting is going to have this gravitational pull for us that could lead people to believe, “Well, ‘gradual’ means that at every other meeting they raise rates by 25 basis points.”	23	2
201506	2398	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	In addition, when we introduce new language, I think we ought to ask ourselves, what would cause us to pull it out?	23	2
201506	2399	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Would it be easy to remove when we thought it was inappropriate, or would we be afraid of being misread by pulling it out?	23	2
201506	2400	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	I think we would be afraid that it would be over-interpreted as a very high probability for us moving very rapidly very soon, and I’m not sure that makes sense.	23	2
201506	2401	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	So I think this deserves a lot of careful thought.	23	2
201506	2402	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Another broad comment on language:  I don’t think we should be focusing on 12-month inflation numbers.	23	2
201506	2403	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	For example, if the monthly numbers came in pretty strong for a few months, I don’t think it would make sense for us to stubbornly insist on waiting for the 12-month number to shed the low numbers we saw at the end of last year.	23	2
201506	2404	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	I think we should be focusing on the monthly numbers as much as the 12-month number.	23	2
201506	2405	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	About the operational note, I think it is a great idea.	23	2
201506	2406	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	For the directive, I agree with Governor Brainard and President Williams that we should wait until liftoff to make changes.	23	2
201506	2407	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	And, in particular, I’d say if we’re going to do some housekeeping on the directive, the thing that really stands out is this sentence that reads, “The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions.”	23	2
201506	2408	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	I mean, this is an archaic vestige of a previous regime.	23	2
201506	2409	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	We don’t anticipate they’re going to need to undertake open market operations to maintain reserves markets consistent with the funds rate trading in the range—we don’t think that’s going to happen.	23	2
201506	2410	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	So it’s this confusing vestige of a previous regime.	23	2
201506	2411	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	I’d urge the staff to take a much more fundamental and far-reaching look at the directive, its structure, and what it says.	23	2
201506	2412	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	It has been this highly coded kind of semaphore to markets and to the more sophisticated Fed watchers in the markets for decades.	23	2
201506	2413	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	Maybe it’s time to start from scratch on this.	23	2
201506	2414	2015-06-17	meeting	LACKER	That concludes my remarks, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2415	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201506	2416	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23	2
201506	2417	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	I support option B, which does a well-crafted job of indicating that we have made further progress toward our goals.	23	2
201506	2418	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	We have not yet reached them, but we are very close.	23	2
201506	2419	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	As I noted yesterday, I am reasonably optimistic about near-term economic activity, particularly in the labor market, and about near- to medium-term inflation.	23	2
201506	2420	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	I am, therefore, hopeful that we will soon be able to put in place a decision reflecting language like that we have in option C′.	23	2
201506	2421	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	As Mike Kiley noted in his box in the Tealbook, and as Jim Bullard has mentioned twice, the economy is closer to our goals now than it has been at just about any time over the past 50 years.	23	2
201506	2422	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	This helps explain why Taylor rules with no inertia indicate that the federal funds rate is far too low.	23	2
201506	2423	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	But at this point, the other rules shown in Tealbook B are also in agreement that it is about time to begin normalization.	23	2
201506	2424	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	While I know it is possible to devise new rules—say, with lower equilibrium real rates, which would delay normalization further—that kind of reverse engineering strikes me as risky.	23	2
201506	2425	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Now, of course, most economic models are not going to make a big deal of a 25 basis point move, so it is hard to argue forcefully about the perfect moment to move rates.	23	2
201506	2426	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	But, to my mind, there are two additional reasons for getting things started soon.	23	2
201506	2427	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	First, I believe that if the FOMC sends a well-reasoned signal that we think the US economy is now strong enough to begin normalizing, that could be an important boost to confidence for businesses and households.	23	2
201506	2428	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Seven or eight years is a very long time to be proclaiming, by our decisions, that we are in a recession or a crisis of some sort.	23	2
201506	2429	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Such an improvement in confidence would have a positive effect on spending and job creation.	23	2
201506	2430	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Second—and this is something that I think President Williams mentioned in other language—I think that beginning normalization in the next couple of meetings, when we have met the criteria that we have set out to meet, will enhance the credibility of the Federal Reserve.	23	2
201506	2431	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Conversely, I think that if we continue to delay, market participants and Fed watchers won’t know what to make of our communications.	23	2
201506	2432	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	I would like to go on to a couple of topics raised by yesterday’s discussion.	23	2
201506	2433	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Let me mention one that I think we need to discuss at greater length shortly.	23	2
201506	2434	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	The story about other central banks that raised rates and then had to reduce them is not actually accurate.	23	2
201506	2435	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	The Swedes are very angry that we keep quoting that, and I am guilty of the same sin.	23	2
201506	2436	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	When the economy was recovering and the inflation rate was high, we raised the interest rate in Israel.	23	2
201506	2437	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	When the European crisis began, we reduced it.	23	2
201506	2438	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	They were both appropriate, so I don’t understand what the argument is about—and I assure you that there is going to be a day, whenever we raise interest rates, that we will one day reduce them, and people will say, “Ha.	23	2
201506	2439	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	You raised them too soon.”	23	2
201506	2440	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	But there is a serious discussion to take place, and we ought to do it, Madam Chair, at some point.	23	2
201506	2441	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Thomas also asked us yesterday whether the language in alternative C′, particularly paragraph 3, is acceptable.	23	2
201506	2442	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	My answer is “Yes,” because there is a lot in there about what we will change.	23	2
201506	2443	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Whether it will be gradual or not depends on how the data come in.	23	2
201506	2444	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	That is, it is consistent with data dependence.	23	2
201506	2445	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	In his notes, Thomas referred to this framework of paragraph 3 as providing forward guidance.	23	2
201506	2446	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think it is forward guidance, and I don’t think so for a reason that I can make clear in this forum.	23	2
201506	2447	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	I once heard a senior Federal Reserve official say, “We have two instruments now that we are at the zero lower bound.	23	2
201506	2448	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	One is quantitative easing, and the other is forward guidance.”	23	2
201506	2449	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	I said, “But forward guidance must be consistent with your predictions for the interest rate and for what you are going to do on quantitative easing.”	23	2
201506	2450	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	And the answer I got was, “No, it’s an extra instrument.”	23	2
201506	2451	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	It is not an extra instrument.	23	2
201506	2452	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	And I think forward guidance is not providing information about what we think we will do, based on our current knowledge and our current expectations.	23	2
201506	2453	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Rather, it is that there are things we will do in the future, which, because we announce them today, we will do despite the fact that we don’t think they are optimal from the viewpoint of the future.	23	2
201506	2454	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	That is, there are binding commitments that we have entered into in forward guidance that are inconsistent with data dependence, and that, I think, is the difference.	23	2
201506	2455	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	So I don’t think of this as forward guidance; it is not consistent with forward guidance as that term has begun to be used in the economic literature, and as it has been used in the FOMC’s past decisions.	23	2
201506	2456	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	One other point on C′.	23	2
201506	2457	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	In the past, we have discussed two strategies, “early and gradual” versus “late and steep.”	23	2
201506	2458	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	I believe we are now too late to be early, but fortunately I think we can now call what we are going to be doing “timely and probably gradual.”	23	2
201506	2459	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	With regard to the questions that were asked, a separate implementation note is preferable.	23	2
201506	2460	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	And I join those who don’t think we should make a change to the directive now and then make additional changes when we commence normalization.	23	2
201506	2461	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	So let me sum up.	23	2
201506	2462	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	The criteria for beginning normalization have nearly been met, and we should be willing to move very soon.	23	2
201506	2463	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Of course, we are data dependent.	23	2
201506	2464	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	And if the data falter again, or the economy gets hit by some significant new negative shock, we want to see how things unfold.	23	2
201506	2465	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	But I would also caution against interpreting every small weakness as a reason to push off normalization.	23	2
201506	2466	2015-06-17	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2467	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201506	2468	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23	2
201506	2469	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2470	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	I support alternative B with the language as drafted in the Tealbook.	23	2
201506	2471	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	I think that is a relatively straightforward decision for today.	23	2
201506	2472	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	Looking forward and thinking about the two criteria that we have injected into our decisionmaking for an interest rate increase, I find myself again—as you can probably tell from my remarks yesterday—focused on the apparent breakdown in some of the traditional relationships, both in thinking about labor markets and between wages and price inflation.	23	2
201506	2473	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	I think that is posing—for me, at least—a challenge in trying to make a decision about when it would be appropriate to lift off for the first time.	23	2
201506	2474	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to further improvement in labor conditions, taken quite literally, one could say that that criterion had been met almost successively since we first put it in, since there has been some improvement at each step along the way.	23	2
201506	2475	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	But, obviously, the connotation at least is that the amount of improvement that people are looking for probably depends on the gap that they think exists and how much improvement remains to be done.	23	2
201506	2476	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	And so I think some of you indicate that you think we are very close to or maybe even at the natural rate already, and, therefore, you don’t think there is much room for further improvement.	23	2
201506	2477	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	I think President Lacker said any further improvement was immaterial.	23	2
201506	2478	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	So, obviously, if you take that view, it is easier to make a decision.	23	2
201506	2479	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	But if one is somewhat sympathetic, as I am, to some of the arguments that are made in some of the papers that I cited yesterday and have cited in the past—that there may be a nontrivial amount of slack left—then the amount of improvement that I may look to is somewhat greater.	23	2
201506	2480	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to reasonable confidence about inflation, I find that to be an even more slippery criterion to try to get my arms around in terms of making a decision on liftoff.	23	2
201506	2481	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	Here I think most people are probably relying on a fairly widely shared intuition that the progressive removal of slack in the economy will at some point begin to push up inflation.	23	2
201506	2482	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	But that intuition—which may have been based on some elegant stuff that you all studied or wrote about when you were in graduate school or in the pre-crisis, pre-recession era—may have broken down to some extent, at least if the more recent literature can be believed.	23	2
201506	2483	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	And the Peneva-Rudd paper I cited yesterday was the latest in a string of research papers suggesting that that may be the case.	23	2
201506	2484	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	Now, why is that important to me?	23	2
201506	2485	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	Well, it is important because even though I think we all agree that further removal of slack in the economy—as imperfectly reflected in the tightening of labor market conditions—should translate into upward pressure on inflation at some point, the “how much” and “when” actually matter a good deal.	23	2
201506	2486	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	And if we no longer have a kind of reasonably well-understood relationship between the progression of wages and the progression of prices, then it makes it a more difficult judgment.	23	2
201506	2487	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	So if, for example, it were a longer period of time that it took for tighter labor markets and rising wages to translate into price inflation, that would mean there would be a longer period during which exogenous shocks of some sort might adversely affect the economy.	23	2
201506	2488	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	And so I might be more concerned that moving more quickly would put the economy at some risk and not be necessary, really, to stave off inflation.	23	2
201506	2489	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	Now, that can go in the other direction as well.	23	2
201506	2490	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	As I think President Williams pointed out a meeting or two ago, when you break that relationship, and you don’t have something to substitute for it, it may be that price inflation could begin to be apparent even in the absence of demonstrable growth in nominal wages.	23	2
201506	2491	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	And the reasonable confidence people may have could take root a little bit more quickly, even in the absence of higher nominal wage growth.	23	2
201506	2492	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	But I do find it a bit disconcerting to have not even a rough calibration of “when” and “how much” is necessary in order to induce that reasonable confidence.	23	2
201506	2493	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	As President Williams said yesterday, it is hard to avoid the recognition that we keep falling short on the inflation target.	23	2
201506	2494	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	I guess that has affected the way I am thinking about liftoff.	23	2
201506	2495	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	But precisely because there isn’t a nice linear relationship to fit any of this into, it doesn’t predetermine the position I will have in September, or any later meeting, for that matter.	23	2
201506	2496	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	With regard to the issues that have been raised, as I have said in the past, I hope we rely principally on paragraphs 1 and 2 to communicate future intentions.	23	2
201506	2497	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	I agree with those who think that we shouldn’t be relying simply on the recitation of the past, which is paragraph 1.	23	2
201506	2498	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	Stating where we expect the economy to go, which is what paragraph 2 is about, should provide some measure of signal and communication to markets so that they can then adjust their assessments of how soon we are likely to move.	23	2
201506	2499	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	What has always made me a bit nervous about changes in paragraph 3 is my “kitchen timer” analogy, that making a change in paragraph 3 gets people to think, okay, it’s one meeting or it’s two meetings from now.	23	2
201506	2500	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	I will say that, on that scale, the insertion of “some” to characterize the degree of labor market improvement would not be the worst offender.	23	2
201506	2501	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	There have been things proposed in the past which I think would have been worse.	23	2
201506	2502	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	But I would still tend to shy away from it a little bit.	23	2
201506	2503	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	I am sympathetic to what President Kocherlakota said about how it would be better if we had a somewhat more precise set of criteria in paragraph 3, but I fear that trying to make that change now would just result in more confusion rather than more clarity.	23	2
201506	2504	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	I am all with those who think we should be putting more emphasis on paragraph 2 and not leaving that boilerplate, but at least have a higher hurdle with respect to paragraph 3.	23	2
201506	2505	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	I join the consensus that a separate note makes sense.	23	2
201506	2506	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	And, Madam Chair, I am more than indifferent on all of the timing questions, so—[laughter]—on that one, I go with your judgment.	23	2
201506	2507	2015-06-17	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	23	2
201506	2508	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201506	2509	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23	2
201506	2510	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2511	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	I support alternative B.	23	2
201506	2512	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	I could also support some very modest changes to the statement to suggest a little more of a forward lean—for example, the word “some” in paragraph 3—but I can also support the statement as written.	23	2
201506	2513	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Any new changes I would tend to paint with an extremely light-handed brush at this point, maybe somewhat less so in July.	23	2
201506	2514	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	To me, the case for lifting off at this meeting diminished and then finally disappeared.	23	2
201506	2515	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	“Exhibit A” for that would be the significant markdown in 2015 growth since the March SEP.	23	2
201506	2516	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	And I think the market is right not to expect us to act here.	23	2
201506	2517	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	On the other hand, the more recent improvement in data makes September liftoff a plausible thing for me.	23	2
201506	2518	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	The Committee will recall that the actual taper, when it happened in December of 2013, was a non-event because it was in the market—not just in the literal sense of being predicted by the market, but, psychologically, it seemed accepted by market participants—so that no one took any inference about the Committee’s objective function.	23	2
201506	2519	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	If you look at the situation today with the first interest rate increase, the real story is the path forward.	23	2
201506	2520	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	And the market seems to have fully internalized that and accepted it, and I think we are reaching a point at which a liftoff in the latter part of this year would really raise no threat to the market’s understanding of a low path going forward.	23	2
201506	2521	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Indeed, the market’s understanding is it will be lower than the Committee says by a substantial margin, albeit a diminishing one.	23	2
201506	2522	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	So I guess I think we are reaching a point at which a 25 basis point increase wouldn’t be that important and would not have broad implications.	23	2
201506	2523	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	So my SEP path is for September liftoff with another increase in December, 25 basis points each, and then averaging 25 basis points every other meeting, although I don’t mean to imply that we should get on an escalator with equally spaced steps.	23	2
201506	2524	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Both market readings and surveys show an expectation that there is about a 40 percent chance of liftoff in September.	23	2
201506	2525	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	That feels about right to me.	23	2
201506	2526	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	I think the Committee’s two conditions for liftoff, as set forth in the statement and amplified and sketched out in more detail by the Chair, are nearly fulfilled.	23	2
201506	2527	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	There has been further improvement in the labor market.	23	2
201506	2528	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	And to address the point raised by Governor Tarullo, I have been thinking about that and talking about that as meaning a material diminution or diminishment of slack.	23	2
201506	2529	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	So, you know, a tenth here and there is really not enough.	23	2
201506	2530	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	You want to see slack coming out of the market in a material way, and I think that has been met with more than 200,000 in monthly job growth this year.	23	2
201506	2531	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	We have also had a firm participation rate for more than a year and a half now and a modest upward move in wages.	23	2
201506	2532	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	My confidence that inflation will move back to 2 percent in the medium term has been strengthened by the continuing tightening in the economy.	23	2
201506	2533	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	The two factors that we know are distorting inflation readings, the exchange value of the dollar and the price of oil, seem to have stabilized for now.	23	2
201506	2534	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Signs that wages are increasing continue to accumulate gradually but steadily.	23	2
201506	2535	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	The risk of a real weakening of inflation expectations has not materialized.	23	2
201506	2536	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Survey measures are stable.	23	2
201506	2537	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Longer-term breakevens have climbed above their lows of earlier this year as spot oil prices have increased.	23	2
201506	2538	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	I would add a couple of thoughts as well on the discussion that we had at the end of yesterday’s meeting.	23	2
201506	2539	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Obviously, it is appropriate to try to avoid surprising the market, and I would not like to see the market move in the next six or eight weeks to downgrade significantly the possibility of a September liftoff unless, of course, that is due to incoming data.	23	2
201506	2540	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	If the data come in as expected, I would really like to see the Committee be able to keep its options open for September.	23	2
201506	2541	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	But looking back at the experience over the past few years, the taper tantrum was a surprise to me, and I think generally to the Committee, the staff, and the world.	23	2
201506	2542	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	It is also surprising that it appears to have left little or no mark on the economy.	23	2
201506	2543	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	And, by the way, neither did the fiscal cliff, and neither did the government shutdown, all of which happened in 2013, with 2013 being the only year in which the economy has reached 3 percent growth since the crisis.	23	2
201506	2544	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Now, many of you are probably thinking, “Well, but it should have been a 4 percent year,” and I would just say to that, “No.	23	2
201506	2545	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	I don’t think so.	23	2
201506	2546	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	I really don’t.”	23	2
201506	2547	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	As I mentioned, we had the actual taper at a meeting in which there were low odds of a taper happening, and it did invoke a big reaction, only the sign was wrong—it was a positive reaction.	23	2
201506	2548	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Then, coming into 2014, everyone seemed to agree, and I certainly did, that rates would start to go up in 2014.	23	2
201506	2549	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	This was a no-brainer.	23	2
201506	2550	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	And then the opposite happened.	23	2
201506	2551	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	So what are the takeaways here?	23	2
201506	2552	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	First, it just is not possible to confidently predict the reaction of financial markets.	23	2
201506	2553	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	The markets will do what they will.	23	2
201506	2554	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	But, second, it is not at all clear that a little volatility or a 25 basis point or 50 basis point rate increase, even across the curve, will slow the United States economy down much.	23	2
201506	2555	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	It may be more painful for emerging market economies, but I would echo what President Williams said earlier.	23	2
201506	2556	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	There is so much focus around the world on this that one would think they are as ready as they can be.	23	2
201506	2557	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	A great CEO that I worked with for years used to always say, “Control the controllable.”	23	2
201506	2558	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	In this case, what the Committee controls is our decision, and, to a much smaller extent, our communication about that decision.	23	2
201506	2559	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	And I think we ought to make that decision on the merits and not worry excessively about the market reaction.	23	2
201506	2560	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	I wouldn’t go so far as to say ignore the bond market, as some have, but I would not let it drive the Committee’s decisions.	23	2
201506	2561	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Finally, I support the Committee’s communications plan.	23	2
201506	2562	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	I like the idea of a separate note.	23	2
201506	2563	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Frankly, I liked what the staff did on the directive.	23	2
201506	2564	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	I think there is very little chance that an amended directive with just technical amendments that is echoed in the minutes dropped three weeks after this press conference and this meeting would be mistaken for some signal about the path of policy.	23	2
201506	2565	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	On the other hand, I don’t see much in it either way.	23	2
201506	2566	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	So I would be happy to live with what the Chair decides on that.	23	2
201506	2567	2015-06-17	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2568	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201506	2569	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23	2
201506	2570	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	23	2
201506	2571	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I support alternative B.	23	2
201506	2572	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I believe there is value to watchful waiting while additional data help clarify the economy’s underlying momentum.	23	2
201506	2573	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	This value is heightened by the asymmetry of risk-management considerations.	23	2
201506	2574	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The combination of the statement and the SEP release conveys that approach nicely, I think.	23	2
201506	2575	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	As I discussed yesterday, the pace of economic improvement slowed at the beginning of the year, and it is as yet unclear how strong or persistent the forces holding back stronger growth are likely to be.	23	2
201506	2576	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The labor force participation rate and the share of employees working part time for economic reasons suggest that slack remains, although the strength of job openings, the recent reacceleration in payrolls, and some hopeful signs on wages suggest slack is diminishing at a good pace.	23	2
201506	2577	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	In contrast, although inflation has rebounded from the low levels at the turn of the year, measures of core inflation remain stubbornly below our target, and not noticeably different from the average subpar pace of inflation over the recovery.	23	2
201506	2578	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	And the puzzling disconnect between tepid aggregate growth and stronger labor market improvement complicates our task.	23	2
201506	2579	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	With remaining slack, and inflation persistently below our target, it is important that reasonably robust increases in aggregate demand be maintained going forward to promote the further improvement in labor market conditions and the movement of inflation back toward 2 percent that are our conditions for liftoff.	23	2
201506	2580	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The totality of data that we have received so far on economic activity in the first half raises some questions about the sufficiency of growth in demand and whether that growth will be maintained.	23	2
201506	2581	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	So I am not yet reasonably confident that we will soon achieve our targets.	23	2
201506	2582	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, uncertainty over Greek default is becoming more acute.	23	2
201506	2583	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	This raises the risk of market disruptions over the coming days and weeks.	23	2
201506	2584	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	That said, it is not difficult to imagine a flow of data over the next few months that would leave me reasonably confident, such that liftoff by September is appropriate.	23	2
201506	2585	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	However, if the data take longer to convince, October or December might look more compelling, while recognizing there are some special features in late December that require careful consideration, including light trading and year-end dynamics.	23	2
201506	2586	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Separately, I am comfortable with the staff recommendation to issue, upon liftoff, a policy implementation note to accompany and complement the FOMC statement, which would separate the statement of monetary policy from the operational details necessary to implement that policy.	23	2
201506	2587	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, on balance, I would prefer not to undertake housekeeping changes to the directive at this time, as I don’t see any compelling benefit.	23	2
201506	2588	2015-06-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2589	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201506	2590	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23	2
201506	2591	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2592	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B in the statement as written.	23	2
201506	2593	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	As I noted yesterday, I still think September liftoff is the most likely, and I think that’s appropriate in light of what data we’ve seen.	23	2
201506	2594	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Obviously, we’re still data driven.	23	2
201506	2595	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	In considering a September liftoff versus later, I would like to build on something that Governor Brainard brought up, a consideration that makes September more attractive to me—the fact that markets will be considerably thinner and more likely to be affected by balance sheet constraints in December compared with September.	23	2
201506	2596	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So if it is a close call, I would much prefer to move in September rather than commence liftoff in December.	23	2
201506	2597	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	In my mind, a December liftoff would likely be sloppier because trading activity would be depressed.	23	2
201506	2598	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Trading desks would be thinly staffed, and balance sheet constraints would likely exert more of an effect at year-end than at other times.	23	2
201506	2599	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Obviously, it also might be easier for us to assemble for videoconferences in late September than in late December, but I would say that’s a less important consideration.	23	2
201506	2600	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So what about an October liftoff if we’re not quite there in September?	23	2
201506	2601	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with October per se, but I think it’s really unlikely that we’re going to actually decide to lift off in a non-press-conference meeting, even though we’ve said that all meetings are live.	23	2
201506	2602	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Why do I reach that conclusion?	23	2
201506	2603	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	As I see it, the bar to lifting off at a press conference meeting is lower than at a non-press-conference meeting.	23	2
201506	2604	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	To lift off at a non-press-conference meeting, you have to get sufficient news over the interval between the two meetings to get over that higher bar.	23	2
201506	2605	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I just don’t think that’s very likely.	23	2
201506	2606	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The data are unlikely to come in so one- sided to push the motivation up sufficiently to transition from “no” at a press conference meeting to “yes” at a non-press-conference meeting six or seven weeks later.	23	2
201506	2607	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we just need to understand that it’s highly unlikely we’re going to move in October.	23	2
201506	2608	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, obviously, you could decide to announce a press conference for the October meeting and move in October, but I think this sends an awkward signal as well.	23	2
201506	2609	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Why the urgency?	23	2
201506	2610	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	What has changed that made September a no-go but October so necessary that you have to schedule a special press conference?	23	2
201506	2611	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	You want a smooth liftoff without a lot of drama.	23	2
201506	2612	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it’s better if the liftoff doesn’t seem to have a sense of urgency driving it.	23	2
201506	2613	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So the bottom line for me is, yes, we can certainly lift off in a non-press-conference meeting, but will we?	23	2
201506	2614	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I doubt it, and given that, I think the choice may come down to September or December, hence my focus on the relative attractiveness of September versus December.	23	2
201506	2615	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of C′, I have a very favorable reaction to the way it has been done, separating the monetary policy decision from the tactics of how to actually achieve it.	23	2
201506	2616	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it’s a stronger and cleaner communication.	23	2
201506	2617	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Do we want to have forward guidance in terms of the likely path of interest rates post liftoff?	23	2
201506	2618	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	This is a much tougher call for me.	23	2
201506	2619	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	It does reduce the risk of a taper tantrum somewhat by underlining the fact that we think it will be gradual.	23	2
201506	2620	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	But it is a very soft commitment.	23	2
201506	2621	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	All it says is, we “currently anticipate that,” which can already be inferred from the SEP.	23	2
201506	2622	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	And while the rate at which we raise the federal funds rate might be gradual, we might not raise it gradually, depending on how the economy or financial conditions evolve.	23	2
201506	2623	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I worry a little bit that if we put that in the statement, it could be taken as a stronger commitment than it actually is, or we could get to a meeting and say we really want to raise the federal funds rate 50 basis points but we said we were going to raise it gradually, so now we don’t want to do 50 basis points.	23	2
201506	2624	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that would be unfortunate.	23	2
201506	2625	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So the bottom line for me is that I would slightly prefer not having it in the statement.	23	2
201506	2626	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, there’s a part of the directive that I think is a little awkward in the sense that it basically says we’re going to offer overnight RRP “in amounts no greater than the available amount of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account.”	23	2
201506	2627	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, I think it would be really good to actually have a footnote or a number to refer to—it’s a really big number, so I think it’s very important for that to be clear to people.	23	2
201506	2628	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Simon.	23	2
201506	2629	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	I think the plan is that we’ll have a Desk statement at the same time, and there will be clarity there.	23	2
201506	2630	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	And the number that we’ve discussed, if you went this route, would be $2 trillion.	23	2
201506	2631	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes, I prefer that to be as explicit as possible so the public doesn’t read it and then think, “Now, what’s that number, exactly?”	23	2
201506	2632	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Because it’s effectively uncapped, subject to this very large number.	23	2
201506	2633	2015-06-17	meeting	POTTER	So the difficulty, if you chose to say it was uncapped, is that we want to make it look like it’s uncapped even though it’s capped at a finite amount.	23	2
201506	2634	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Right.	23	2
201506	2635	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I want to be as explicit as possible about the number.	23	2
201506	2636	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think we could probably write better language here.	23	2
201506	2637	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	“In amounts no greater than the available amount”—that’s two uses of “amount” in six words, so maybe we need a little more work on the drafting there, but that’s a very small point.	23	2
201506	2638	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	As far as cleaning up the directive at this meeting so there’s less going on when we actually do liftoff, I slightly favor that, but I would defer to the Chair’s judgment.	23	2
201506	2639	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	And, finally, should we communicate in the minutes that there’s going to be no cap initially?	23	2
201506	2640	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Absolutely, we should communicate that in the minutes, because you don’t want people going into the September meeting not knowing whether there will or will not be a cap.	23	2
201506	2641	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	That will actually influence their behavior going into the meeting and how they think they’re going to do their business postmeeting, if we actually do lift off, so I think that needs to be widely understood before we actually lift off.	23	2
201506	2642	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201506	2643	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, President Bullard.	23	2
201506	2644	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201506	2645	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	I want to object a little bit to Vice Chairman Dudley’s characterization of the Committee as not being able to move at various meetings.	23	2
201506	2646	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	This Committee has moved and can move at any meeting and should feel free to do so, and to tie us up in knots about one meeting out of the year as our one chance to move, I think, is a ridiculous characterization of US monetary policy.	23	2
201506	2647	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	We can move.	23	2
201506	2648	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	We have moved in the past, and if the data call for it, then we should do it.	23	2
201506	2649	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	I understand what he’s saying about considerations about this, but it’s too much.	23	2
201506	2650	2015-06-17	meeting	BULLARD	It’s like we’ve been laying on the couch too long, and we’re not used to being able to get up and run around the block.	23	2
201506	2651	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I think you’ve mischaracterized what I said, Jim.	23	2
201506	2652	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Just for the record, I think you very much mischaracterized what I said.	23	2
201506	2653	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	All I said was, these are considerations that could affect the timing of the Committee’s decisions.	23	2
201506	2654	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Obviously, the Committee can move at any meeting.	23	2
201506	2655	2015-06-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Whether they actually choose to do so is a different issue.	23	2
201506	2656	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Further comments?	23	2
201506	2657	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	23	2
201506	2658	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201506	2659	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s start with the statement for today.	238	2
201506	2660	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	I certainly did hear around the table a few people who lean in the direction of either outright preferring alternative C or who would like to import some of the language from alternative C and bring it into B.	238	2
201506	2661	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	But as I listen to most of you weigh in on the statement for today, I heard relatively limited support for making those changes and pretty broad-based support for B with the language that we have here.	238	2
201506	2662	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	And so I think what I’d like to do is propose alternative B without changes for today.	238	2
201506	2663	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to the implementation note and whether it’s a good idea to have that, I actually heard unanimous support for a separate implementation note, so that’s good.	238	2
201506	2664	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	I think we can decide that we should go ahead in that general way.	238	2
201506	2665	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Now, in terms of changing the directive today, some of you did not say whether you supported it.	238	2
201506	2666	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	238	2
201506	2667	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	I tried to count reasonably carefully how people felt, and I did count more people saying “No” than “Yes.”	238	2
201506	2668	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	A bunch of people said they could go either way.	238	2
201506	2669	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	I think my inclination in view of that would be not to make changes today.	238	2
201506	2670	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker may be taking another look at some of the wording regarding open market operations.	238	2
201506	2671	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	One way or another, I think the minutes for today will note that we discussed these matters and alert the public.	238	2
201506	2672	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	From the staff point of view, do you consider that acceptable?	238	2
201506	2673	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Because I think the Committee is pretty flexible on this.	238	2
201506	2674	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Absolutely.	238	2
201506	2675	2015-06-17	meeting	LAUBACH	I mean, the minutes can lay the groundwork.	238	2
201506	2676	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	238	2
201506	2677	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we leave the directive unchanged for today.	238	2
201506	2678	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	And that means that what I’d like to do is have Matt take the roll call for a vote on alternative B as written, and the directive, which is the top version on page 14 of Thomas’s handout.	238	2
201506	2679	2015-06-17	meeting	LUECKE	All right.	238	2
201506	2680	2015-06-17	meeting	LUECKE	Chair Yellen Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Brainard Yes President Evans Yes Governor Fischer Yes President Lacker Yes President Lockhart Yes Governor Powell Yes Governor Tarullo Yes President Williams Yes.	238	2
201506	2681	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	1	1
201506	2682	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	That concludes our work for today.	1	1
201506	2683	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	The next meeting will be on Tuesday and Wednesday, July 28 and 29.	1	1
201506	2684	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	Boxed lunches are available.	1	1
201506	2685	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	I will be holding a press conference at 2:30.	1	1
201506	2686	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	I promise you that I will do my best to convey the sense of the Committee, and certainly to leave September on the table as an option, while emphasizing data dependence.	1	1
201506	2687	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	For anybody who wants to watch the press conference, there will be a setup in the Special Library.	1	1
201506	2688	2015-06-17	meeting	YELLEN	And if there are no other questions or comments, that concludes our meeting.	1	1
