201609	0	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Good afternoon, everyone.	50.0	65.0
201609	1	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s get under way.	50.0	65.0
201609	2	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Today’s meeting, as usual, will be a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board of Governors, so I need a motion to close the Board meeting.	50.0	65.0
201609	3	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	50.0	108.0
201609	4	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	50.0	65.0
201609	5	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	50.0	65.0
201609	6	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Our first agenda item is the selection of a Committee officer.	51.0	65.0
201609	7	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	As many of you know, Michael Held, who is seated near the anteroom door, has been appointed general counsel and executive vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.	51.0	65.0
201609	8	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	I am pleased to recommend that the Committee select Michael as its deputy general counsel.	51.0	65.0
201609	9	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Consistent with the Committee’s standard practice for appointment of its officers, this selection would be effective until the Committee’s first regularly scheduled meeting in 2017.	51.0	65.0
201609	10	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Michael has been with the New York Federal Reserve for the past 18 years and is a highly experienced central banking attorney.	51.0	65.0
201609	11	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman, would you like to make a comment?	51.0	65.0
201609	12	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes.	51.0	96.0
201609	13	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	First, I’d like to second the notion of him becoming the deputy general counsel for the FOMC.	51.0	96.0
201609	14	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	He has big shoes to fill with Tom Baxter retiring from the New York Fed, but I’m sure he will do so very ably.	51.0	96.0
201609	15	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I’ve worked with him for many years, and I very much trust his knowledge and his judgment.	51.0	96.0
201609	16	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s nice to have him here at the FOMC on a more permanent basis, taking a seat next to Scott, who’s not here today, but—	51.0	96.0
201609	17	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	[laughter]—we will be seeing Michael there on a regular basis.	51.0	96.0
201609	18	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m very pleased.	51.0	96.0
201609	19	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	51.0	96.0
201609	20	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	51.0	65.0
201609	21	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Any discussion or any objections?	51.0	65.0
201609	22	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	51.0	65.0
201609	23	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, the selection is approved unanimously by the Committee.	51.0	65.0
201609	24	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	And congratulations, Michael, we are looking forward to working with you in your new role.	51.0	65.0
201609	25	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	That takes us to the second agenda item, which concerns proposed revisions of the documents governing foreign currency operations.	64.0	65.0
201609	26	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	As you know, the staff has been engaged in a long-term effort to develop proposed revisions to the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, and other related documents.	64.0	65.0
201609	27	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	You all received memos on the proposal from the staff in mid-August, and last week we sent a short additional memo from the Foreign Currency Subcommittee.	64.0	65.0
201609	28	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	This project has required a lot of careful analysis involving staff from both the New York Federal Reserve and the Board.	64.0	65.0
201609	29	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	That work was carried out under the general oversight of the Subcommittee, and I’d like to thank the staff for what seems to me to be an excellent proposal.	64.0	65.0
201609	30	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	In my view, it meets the important objectives of the project.	64.0	65.0
201609	31	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	I might note that the proposal provides that the Subcommittee, in consultation with the Committee, may give additional instructions to the Desk regarding holdings of foreign currencies.	64.0	65.0
201609	32	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	As I mentioned, the Subcommittee recently sent the Committee a short memo, which included draft instructions that the Subcommittee would plan to issue to the Desk.	64.0	65.0
201609	33	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Unless there are objections, the Subcommittee would issue these instructions within a few days following this meeting.	64.0	65.0
201609	34	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	The Committee will not be asked to vote on those instructions.	64.0	65.0
201609	35	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Let me now turn to Simon, who’s going to summarize the proposal.	64.0	65.0
201609	36	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	64.0	999.0
201609	37	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	I’d just like to say that some of the staff involved in the project are in the room today, including Paul Dozier and Mike Leahy from IF; Cindy Hull from the Desk; and Sophia Allison, who is sitting next to Lorie, from the Board’s Legal Division.	64.0	999.0
201609	38	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	I’ll be discussing important changes to the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations (the Authorization), the Foreign Currency Directive (the Directive), and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations.	64.0	999.0
201609	39	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	As discussed in the memo the Committee received in August titled “Proposed Revisions to Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and Related Organizational Documents,” the revisions are intended to meet three objectives: first, reflect the current operating environment; second, clarify guidance to the Selected Bank by updating governance for each operation; and, third, simplify the structure of the documents.	64.0	999.0
201609	40	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Proposed changes to the document structure are summarized in the top-left panel of your exhibit.	64.0	999.0
201609	41	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The proposed documents are organized to consolidate authorizations and directions into the Authorization and the Directive, respectively, and to clarify governance and guidance relating to specific operation types.	64.0	999.0
201609	42	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	All text authorizing an operation and any language regarding its purpose is in the Authorization, while specific direction to the Selected Bank to conduct each operation is in the Directive.	64.0	999.0
201609	43	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	In both documents, text for each operation type is grouped together, in contrast to the format of the current documents.	64.0	999.0
201609	44	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Also, the existing Procedural Instructions are eliminated, as language from the document is incorporated into the Authorization and Directive.	64.0	999.0
201609	45	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	This proposed two-document organization structure now aligns with the one used for domestic operations.	64.0	999.0
201609	46	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The staff also proposes to move both the definition and governance of the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, currently in the Authorization, into the Rules of Organization and Rules of Procedure, respectively.	64.0	999.0
201609	47	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The staff also proposes several substantive changes to foreign currency operation procedures and governance.	64.0	999.0
201609	48	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	These changes are designed to reflect the current operating environment and to clarify guidance to the Selected Bank.	64.0	999.0
201609	49	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	These changes remove the discretion that the Selected Bank has in the existing governance framework to determine whether to execute foreign currency operations and how to set parameters for investing the foreign currency holdings.	64.0	999.0
201609	50	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The proposed framework now authorizes the Foreign Currency Subcommittee to both determine whether to execute interventions within specified limits and provide additional instructions regarding the management of the foreign reserves.	64.0	999.0
201609	51	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The staff proposes assigning these responsibilities to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee primarily to accommodate the often time-sensitive nature of decisions that must be made regarding implementation of intervention operations as well as to facilitate coordination with the US Treasury or foreign central banks.	64.0	999.0
201609	52	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The proposed documents are organized into five operation types: interventions, warehousing, reciprocal currency arrangements, US dollar and foreign liquidity swaps, and foreign currency holdings.	64.0	999.0
201609	53	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	I will now address major changes made to the documents according to each of these operation types.	64.0	999.0
201609	54	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Additional proposed changes are listed in the appendix of your exhibit.	64.0	999.0
201609	55	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The top-right panel of your exhibit lists major changes to foreign exchange intervention operations.	64.0	999.0
201609	56	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The proposed documents remove the Selected Bank’s discretion to determine whether to execute as much as $600 million in intervention operations per intermeeting period.	64.0	999.0
201609	57	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	For some brief background, this discretion was given to the Selected Bank in 1976, when the documents were first established, a time when intervention operations were somewhat routine.	64.0	999.0
201609	58	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The Selected Bank has not used this discretion in more than 20 years.	64.0	999.0
201609	59	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	However, because intervention operations are now rarely conducted, the proposed documents eliminate this almost 40-year-old provision.	64.0	999.0
201609	60	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The proposed documents provide that all such operations require prior approval from the Committee or Subcommittee.	64.0	999.0
201609	61	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Other limits in the existing framework on the Selected Bank’s intervention discretion, including a list of authorized currencies and a $25 billion cap on the overall size of the foreign currency holdings, are also eliminated.	64.0	999.0
201609	62	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The existing documents authorize the Subcommittee to direct the Desk to execute intervention operations up to $1.5 billion per intermeeting period.	64.0	999.0
201609	63	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The proposed documents increase the limit to $5 billion; any interventions above this limit could only be approved by the Committee.	64.0	999.0
201609	64	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	As the existing $1.5 billion limit was last updated in 1993, the proposed change aligns the size of the Subcommittee’s approval authority with the more than fourfold increase in the FX market size.	64.0	999.0
201609	65	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The middle-left panel of your exhibit lists major changes to the second operation type, warehousing.	64.0	999.0
201609	66	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Warehousing is essentially a swap operation with the US Treasury in which its Exchange Stabilization Fund, the ESF, sells foreign currency to the Selected Bank for US dollars; at the outset of the transaction, the ESF agrees to repurchase the foreign currency at a set future date and exchange rate.	64.0	999.0
201609	67	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Under current practice, the Committee delegates to the Selected Bank the authority to approve Treasury requests to use the warehousing facility of up to $5 billion via the annual Desk Authorization process each January.	64.0	999.0
201609	68	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	However, the existing Authorization documents do not explicitly mention warehousing and instead provide only general authority for the Selected Bank to conduct operations with the ESF.	64.0	999.0
201609	69	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	To improve transparency, the proposed documents include a provision expressly authorizing the $5 billion warehousing arrangement with the Treasury.	64.0	999.0
201609	70	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The proposed directive now also instructs the Subcommittee to internally approve warehousing transactions before the Selected Bank can execute them with the US Treasury.	64.0	999.0
201609	71	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The middle-right panel of your exhibit summarizes major changes for reciprocal currency arrangements and standing liquidity swap lines, the third and fourth types of operations.	64.0	999.0
201609	72	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Reciprocal currency arrangements are swap arrangements with the central banks of Mexico and Canada that were established in 1994 under the North American Framework Agreement.	64.0	999.0
201609	73	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The existing documents authorize the Subcommittee to approve drawings up to certain size limits.	64.0	999.0
201609	74	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	However, because these are expected to be used only rarely, the proposed documents now require the Committee to approve all drawings under these arrangements.	64.0	999.0
201609	75	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	More familiar to the Committee are the standing liquidity swap lines.	64.0	999.0
201609	76	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	These arrangements are maintained with a network of five foreign central banks for the provision of US dollars from the Federal Reserve and the acquisition of foreign currency from the foreign central banks.	64.0	999.0
201609	77	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The swap lines are routinely used to provide dollars to some foreign central banks in the network.	64.0	999.0
201609	78	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	In the existing and proposed Authorization documents, the Committee is charged with approving new swap arrangements and the Chairman is delegated authority to approve changes to the terms of existing arrangements.	64.0	999.0
201609	79	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The Chairman is delegated authority to approve individual dollar draws on the swap lines and can also further delegate approval of such draws to the SOMA manager.	64.0	999.0
201609	80	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Under current practice, foreign central banks present calendars of proposed dollar auctions to the Federal Reserve on a monthly basis and seek assurance that the Federal Reserve intends to approve swap drawing requests associated with these calendars.	64.0	999.0
201609	81	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The Chairman reviews and typically approves the foreign central banks’ proposed dollar auction calendars.	64.0	999.0
201609	82	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The Chairman also typically delegates to the SOMA manager the authority to approve requests to draw on the swap lines to fund these scheduled operations.	64.0	999.0
201609	83	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The exception is for initial draw requests, where “initial” is understood to refer to the first drawing by a central bank since the swap arrangements changed from temporary to standing arrangements in January 2014.	64.0	999.0
201609	84	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	In that case, the Chairman retains authority to approve the drawing.	64.0	999.0
201609	85	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The proposed documents establish a governance process on the basis of whether the draw is associated with a schedule of potential drawings the Chairman has approved in advance.	64.0	999.0
201609	86	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The proposed documents authorize the Chairman to approve a schedule of potential drawings and to delegate to the SOMA manager authority to approve any draws made in accordance with that schedule.	64.0	999.0
201609	87	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	All unscheduled dollar draws must still be approved by the Chairman.	64.0	999.0
201609	88	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The existing documents also delegate to the Chairman approval authority for foreign currency draws by the Federal Reserve.	64.0	999.0
201609	89	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Because such foreign currency draws are expected to rarely occur in the current operating environment and would occur because of developments in the United States, the proposed documents now require prior approval of such draws from the Committee.	64.0	999.0
201609	90	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The bottom-left panel summarizes proposed governance changes to the final operation type, management of foreign currency holdings.	64.0	999.0
201609	91	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	With respect to management of the foreign currency holdings, the proposed documents establish a new governance framework that is intended to complement the updated investment framework presented to the Committee in April of this year.	64.0	999.0
201609	92	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	First, the proposed documents set forth three investment objectives for the Selected Bank:  The Selected Bank must manage the foreign currency holdings primarily to ensure sufficient liquidity to enable the conduct of foreign currency operations, secondarily to have a high degree of safety, and, subject to these two objectives, to achieve the highest rate of return possible in each currency.	64.0	999.0
201609	93	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Second, the Subcommittee, in consultation with the Committee, is delegated the authority to provide additional instructions to the Selected Bank regarding investments of foreign currency holdings.	64.0	999.0
201609	94	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	This new provision removes the Selected Bank’s current autonomy, such as the ability to determine the riskiness of the portfolio, the degree of portfolio liquidity, and the specific issuers and asset classes in which to invest.	64.0	999.0
201609	95	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The proposed governance structure contemplates that risk constraints will no longer appear in the Authorization documents but instead may appear in the additional instructions that the Subcommittee may provide to the Selected Bank.	64.0	999.0
201609	96	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Note that issuance of these instructions would not prevent the Committee from issuing additional direction to the Selected Bank regarding the management of the foreign currency holdings.	64.0	999.0
201609	97	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Finally, the existing average duration limit of 24 months is removed from the Authorization.	64.0	999.0
201609	98	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	If the Committee adopts the proposed governing documents, as the Chair pointed out, the Subcommittee plans to issue additional instructions to the Selected Bank shortly after the conclusion of this meeting.	64.0	999.0
201609	99	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The Subcommittee provided a draft of these instructions to the Committee last week together with the memo titled “Additional Instructions of Foreign Currency Subcommittee to Desk Regarding Holdings of Foreign Currencies.”	64.0	999.0
201609	100	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	I would like to highlight two other proposed changes relating to governance, listed in the bottom-right panel of your exhibit.	64.0	999.0
201609	101	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The first is a provision to delegate any authority of the Subcommittee to the Chairman if the Subcommittee cannot convene in the time available.	64.0	999.0
201609	102	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The second provides that in emergency circumstances, the Chairman may approve actions otherwise reserved for the Committee.	64.0	999.0
201609	103	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	These changes are intended for use only in cases of emergency.	64.0	999.0
201609	104	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Under modern communication technology, it is expected that these would be used only rarely.	64.0	999.0
201609	105	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Additional proposed changes are listed in the appendix of your exhibit.	64.0	999.0
201609	106	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Please note that if you approve the proposed documents, they will first be made public in the minutes of this meeting, and the changes will thus remain confidential until the minutes are released.	64.0	999.0
201609	107	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Before the Chair requests a vote on the foreign authorization documents, the Rules of Organization, and Rules of Procedure, we would be happy to answer any questions on the proposed changes.	64.0	999.0
201609	108	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Simon?	64.0	65.0
201609	109	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Discussion?	64.0	65.0
201609	110	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	64.0	65.0
201609	111	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	64.0	94.0
201609	112	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I think it’s a nice proposal.	64.0	94.0
201609	113	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	There’s a lot of references to “Chairman” in this, and it’s a little bit of residual language.	64.0	94.0
201609	114	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Could we perhaps switch it to “Chair” and not have “Chairman” in it?	64.0	94.0
201609	115	2016-09-21	meeting	ALLISON	Actually, “Chairman” is the term that’s used in the Act.	64.0	999.0
201609	116	2016-09-21	meeting	ALLISON	So that’s why we’ve retained it in these documents.	64.0	999.0
201609	117	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	I did feel strange saying that throughout the briefing, but it was to conform with the Federal Reserve Act.	64.0	999.0
201609	118	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	So it’s the “Chairman” writing a particular check.	64.0	999.0
201609	119	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Maybe we need to update the Federal Reserve Act after all.	64.0	96.0
201609	120	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	64.0	96.0
201609	121	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Not touching that.	64.0	65.0
201609	122	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	64.0	65.0
201609	123	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions or comments?	64.0	65.0
201609	124	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	64.0	65.0
201609	125	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	As many of you know, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond has a long tradition of raising concerns about foreign exchange intervention on the grounds that, if they’re sterilized, they’re meaningless.	64.0	81.0
201609	126	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	If they’re not sterilized, they imply a change in monetary policy stance, which would imply some compromise of our monetary policy independence from the Treasury.	64.0	81.0
201609	127	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	I realize we don’t have a vote, but, on principle, historically, the Richmond Federal Reserve has dissented on anything having to do with foreign exchange authorizations.	64.0	81.0
201609	128	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	I mention this, first, to avoid disappointing those who might have been expecting me to mention this any time a foreign exchange matter is brought up, but also to say that these new documents strike me as the right way for one to authorize foreign exchange operations, if one must.	64.0	81.0
201609	129	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	And I commend the staff on a very thorough and excellent review of these things.	64.0	81.0
201609	130	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	More broadly, though, foreign exchange operations increasingly seem to be an anachronistic tool.	64.0	81.0
201609	131	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Back in the day, in the old operating regime, if we were going to maintain an interest rate peg, we had to sterilize them, so they were kind of meaningless.	64.0	81.0
201609	132	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	If we didn’t sterilize them, they’d drive the rate down.	64.0	81.0
201609	133	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Nowadays, it’s not obvious that they should be expected to have any meaningful economic effect.	64.0	81.0
201609	134	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	It might be worthwhile in the not-too-distant future to give that more thought and maybe give some thought to the role played by ourforeign exchange operations.	64.0	81.0
201609	135	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	64.0	81.0
201609	136	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	64.0	65.0
201609	137	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Other comments or questions?	64.0	65.0
201609	138	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	64.0	65.0
201609	139	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	If there are no further questions or discussion, we’ll now vote on the proposal.	64.0	65.0
201609	140	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	This vote will be to approve all four of the revised documents in the staff proposal—namely, the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, the Committee’s Rules of Organization, and the Committee’s Rules of Procedure.	64.0	65.0
201609	141	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	These documents are included in Simon’s briefing package.	64.0	65.0
201609	142	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	With the proposed changes to these documents, the procedural instructions with respect to foreign currency operations would no longer be necessary and would be rescinded.	64.0	65.0
201609	143	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Is there a motion on this proposal?	64.0	65.0
201609	144	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So moved.	64.0	96.0
201609	145	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	64.0	65.0
201609	146	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	And a second?	64.0	65.0
201609	147	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	64.0	108.0
201609	148	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	64.0	65.0
201609	149	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Any objections?	64.0	65.0
201609	150	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	64.0	65.0
201609	151	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection, the proposal is approved.	64.0	65.0
201609	152	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	64.0	65.0
201609	153	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	We are ready to move on to our third agenda item, and Simon is going to begin with the Desk briefing.	61.0	65.0
201609	154	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201609	155	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	For much of the intermeeting period, most asset prices traded in tight ranges amid low volatility.	61.0	999.0
201609	156	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	This calm was broken in the past couple of weeks by shifts in sentiments about the future policy actions of the ECB and Bank of Japan, sparking some steepening in global sovereign yield curves.	61.0	999.0
201609	157	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	On net, changes in major asset prices were modest and had mixed implications for financial conditions, shown in the first column of the top-left panel of your first exhibit.	61.0	999.0
201609	158	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The dollar depreciated a touch and credit spreads narrowed, while Treasury yields and dollar funding rates such as LIBOR increased slightly and the S&P 500 index was down a bit.	61.0	999.0
201609	159	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Lorie will touch on the drivers and implications of this increase in LIBOR later in the briefing.	61.0	999.0
201609	160	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The survey- and market-implied paths of the target federal funds rate were little changed, as shown in the top-right panel, as market participants balanced generally softer-than-expected economic data against Federal Reserve communications that were somewhat less accommodative than expected.	61.0	999.0
201609	161	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	In the Desk’s most recent surveys, the average probability attached to a rate hike at this meeting was 15 percent and the average probability attached to a rate hike at the December meeting was about 40 percent, shown on the left side of the middle-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201609	162	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	These levels are generally consistent with the probabilities currently implied by market prices.	61.0	999.0
201609	163	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The market-implied probability for a September hike had reached as high as 30 percent over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201609	164	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	As market participants have lowered their assessment of the likelihood of an increase at this meeting, the probability of an increase this year has remained relatively steady, with the marginal probability of a December hike increasing.	61.0	999.0
201609	165	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Last year, when the FOMC did not raise rates at its September meeting, we saw an increase in the survey-implied probability for a rate hike occurring at the December meeting, from 25 percent to 40 percent immediately after, as shown in the shift from the dark to light blue bars on the right side of the middle-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201609	166	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The market-implied paths of most advanced-economy central bank policy rates are shown in the middle-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201609	167	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The Bank of England joined the ranks of advanced foreign economy central banks pursuing further monetary easing, with details of its comprehensive package shown in the bottom-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201609	168	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	And while the Bank of England decided not to take its Bank Rate into negative territory, the United States is the only economy among the G-4 with an upward-sloping policy rate curve over the next three years.	61.0	999.0
201609	169	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	And even in the case of the United States, the projected rate increases are very modest.	61.0	999.0
201609	170	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The low level of rates has produced a number of innovations in how central banks provide accommodation at the zero bound, and the intermeeting period witnessed a range of reactions in financial markets to central banks’ ongoing use of these tools, particularly large-scale asset purchases.	61.0	999.0
201609	171	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	In the initial weeks of its new purchase program, the Bank of England paid substantial premiums over prevailing market prices in several of its long-dated gilt purchase operations as a result of the reluctance of long-term investors—namely, pension funds and insurers—to part with their longer-dated gilt holdings.	61.0	999.0
201609	172	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The operations have been very effective in bringing down long-dated gilt yields, which declined by as many as 40 basis points following the program announcement and the initial rounds of purchases.	61.0	999.0
201609	173	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Investment-grade corporate bond spreads also narrowed 25 basis points in the days following the announcement.	61.0	999.0
201609	174	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Overall, the market reaction to this package has been encouraging, as it suggests no decline in the efficiency of central bank asset purchases in lowering sovereign and private yields.	61.0	999.0
201609	175	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	In July, the Bank of Japan introduced a limited set of additional easing measures and announced that it would undertake a “comprehensive assessment” of the effect of its current monetary easing programs, sparking speculation among market participants as to whether the Bank of Japan is nearing operational limits in its current policies.	61.0	999.0
201609	176	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The results of the comprehensive assessment will be announced overnight.	61.0	999.0
201609	177	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Market expectations are dispersed, with a lack of conviction on the next policy move by the Bank of Japan.	61.0	999.0
201609	178	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The ECB’s actions at its meeting earlier this month were interpreted as less accommodative than expected.	61.0	999.0
201609	179	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The ECB left its asset purchase programs unchanged and stated that it did not discuss extending the program beyond the current stated time frame of “March 2017 or beyond,” versus expectations that an explicit extension might be forthcoming.	61.0	999.0
201609	180	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	There was also speculation that the ECB would adjust the parameters of the program to address self-imposed constraints in its existing program, which it did not do, though President Draghi did say that it was investigating the issue.	61.0	999.0
201609	181	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Paul will discuss these foreign central developments further in his briefing.	61.0	999.0
201609	182	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Amid these actions and communications, the yen and euro strengthened by 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively, against the US dollar over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201609	183	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Sovereign yield curves also steepened, with 30-year Japanese bond yields higher by about 30 basis points and the German 30-year bond yields higher by around 20 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201609	184	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-right panel, long-dated sovereign yields in the United States increased roughly 20 basis points as well, with contacts primarily pointing to effects from foreign developments, especially the ECB meeting.	61.0	999.0
201609	185	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Partly as a result of this steepening in sovereign yield curves, global bank stock prices outperformed over the period, as shown in the top-left panel of your second exhibit.	61.0	999.0
201609	186	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Recall that, at the beginning of the year, bank stocks had declined notably after advanced foreign economy central banks introduced new easing measures, including negative rates from the BOJ and further rate cuts into negative territory by the ECB.	61.0	999.0
201609	187	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The outperformance of bank stocks over the period came amid perceptions that some foreign central banks are trying to address the adverse effect their easing policies may have on financial institutions’ profitability.	61.0	999.0
201609	188	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Market commentary has recently speculated that the Bank of Japan may aim to steepen the Japanese yield curve in order to reduce any adverse effect on financial institutions.	61.0	999.0
201609	189	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Meanwhile, the Bank of England introduced the Term Funding Scheme, which is similar in many ways to the ECB’s TLTROs in providing cheap term funding to banks to facilitate the pass-through of rate cuts to borrowers.	61.0	999.0
201609	190	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Market participants also highlighted the outperformance over the period of certain fixed-income assets, shown in the top-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201609	191	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The outperformance was reportedly fueled by ongoing “reach-for-yield” behavior among long-term investors, driven to a large extent by continued portfolio rebalancing induced by large asset purchase programs.	61.0	999.0
201609	192	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	As emerging markets witnessed increased investor inflows, their bond spreads to Treasury equivalents tightened, despite some recent volatility.	61.0	999.0
201609	193	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Meanwhile, high-yield credit spreads fell to their narrowest levels year-to-date, and MBS option-adjusted spreads narrowed amid reportedly strong demand from foreign investors.	61.0	999.0
201609	194	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Contacts have noted that low levels of volatility earlier in the period were especially supportive of the “reach-for-yield” behavior that led to these assets’ appreciation, on net, over the period despite the recent steepening of advanced- economy yield curves.	61.0	999.0
201609	195	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Measures of option-implied volatility across equities, rates, and currencies reached their year-to-date lows in August.	61.0	999.0
201609	196	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle- left panel, implied volatilities for equities, the blue line, and for both short- and long- term rates, the red and gray lines, were roughly one standard deviation below their long-term averages for much of the period before an increase in market volatility that followed the ECB’s decision.	61.0	999.0
201609	197	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	In the Desk’s most recent surveys, respondents were asked to rate the importance of various factors in explaining the recent low levels of implied volatility through the first week of September.	61.0	999.0
201609	198	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-right panel, the most importance, on average, was placed on advanced foreign economy central bank communication and action, followed by Federal Reserve communication and action.	61.0	999.0
201609	199	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	While the PBOC’s FX policy was generally viewed as consistent and predictable over the period, Desk survey respondents did not rate emerging market central bank actions as an important factor behind the low levels of cross-asset volatility.	61.0	999.0
201609	200	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-left panel, over the intermeeting period, the renminbi was little changed against the dollar, though on a trade-weighted basis the renminbi did depreciate roughly 1 percent, and market participants expect further depreciation.	61.0	999.0
201609	201	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The recent stability of the Chinese currency might reflect the PBOC’s desire for a smooth introduction of the renminbi into the SDR on October 1.	61.0	999.0
201609	202	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Survey respondents also did not assign much importance to reduced political uncertainty globally as contributing to low implied volatility, with a few respondents suggesting that political developments may, in fact, be adding volatility.	61.0	999.0
201609	203	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	One source of political uncertainty noted by market participants is the upcoming US election, although so far the only substantive market effect has been on the Mexican peso.	61.0	999.0
201609	204	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-right panel, three-month option-implied volatility on the peso– US dollar exchange rate increased sharply when the November US election date rolled into the option window, and more recent increases in implied volatility have been attributed in part to higher uncertainty over the US election.	61.0	999.0
201609	205	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Specifically, market participants have noted downside risk to US–Mexico trade and economic linkages related to the election outcome, including the potential for trade barriers and restrictions on remittances from the United States to Mexico.	61.0	999.0
201609	206	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Lorie will continue.	61.0	999.0
201609	207	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	In exhibits 3 and 4, I’ll cover money markets and Desk operations.	61.0	999.0
201609	208	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The major focus in money markets this period continued to be the upcoming implementation of the SEC money market mutual fund reform measures on October 14, both in terms of its effect on market conditions and potential implications for Federal Reserve operations.	61.0	999.0
201609	209	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel of your third exhibit, more than $800 billion in assets under management has left prime and tax-exempt money market funds since October of last year, reflecting conversions and closures of funds undertaken by asset managers as well as investor redemptions.	61.0	999.0
201609	210	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The vast majority of this outflow has been reallocated to government funds, leaving overall money fund AUM relatively little changed.	61.0	999.0
201609	211	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Prime fund managers remain highly uncertain about additional outflows, which have picked up recently, averaging about $46 billion per week in September versus $24 billion per week in July and August.	61.0	999.0
201609	212	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	In a Desk survey of money fund managers conducted earlier this month, the average expectation for total prime fund outflows from the end of July to mid-October was more than $500 billion, shown in the left- hand column of your top-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201609	213	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	If fully realized, this would leave prime fund AUM at approximately one-third the size of a year ago.	61.0	999.0
201609	214	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Consistent with trends seen to date, market participants anticipate that most of the outflows will continue to be allocated to government funds.	61.0	999.0
201609	215	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Survey respondents’ expectations for the investments of these inflows are shown in the right-hand column.	61.0	999.0
201609	216	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	While a majority of the inflows are expected to be invested in government securities and private repo, around $100 billion is anticipated to initially be invested in Federal Reserve ON RRPs, the light blue area in the chart.	61.0	999.0
201609	217	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-left panel, usage of the ON RRP facility increased modestly over the period, with much of this increase coming from government funds.	61.0	999.0
201609	218	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	However, their usage of the overnight RRP facility as a proportion of their overall AUM remains little changed.	61.0	999.0
201609	219	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants have suggested that we could see a particularly notable increase in overnight RRP usage around the September quarter- end, and that the increase may persist a bit longer than normal,due to the combination of money fund reform–related flows and quarter-end balance sheet adjustments.	61.0	999.0
201609	220	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The middle-right panel shows that prime funds have been reducing the weighted- average maturity of their holdings in preparation for additional outflows.	61.0	999.0
201609	221	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Industry WAMs, shown in red, are already at multiyear lows and are widely expected to fall further.	61.0	999.0
201609	222	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The decline in both WAMs and AUM has led to a sharp decline in prime funds’ holdings of CP and time deposits, shown in blue.	61.0	999.0
201609	223	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	This reduction in term lending from prime money funds has had a material effect on the cost of term funding.	61.0	999.0
201609	224	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the bottom-left panel, the three-month LIBOR–OIS spread—a common measure of bank funding pressure—has widened since late last year to around 42 basis points, a level last seen during the 2011 European sovereign debt and banking crisis.	61.0	999.0
201609	225	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Rates on certificates of deposit and financial CP have risen by similar amounts to LIBOR, and rates on short-dated U.S interest rate swaps, which settle to three-month LIBOR, have increased.	61.0	999.0
201609	226	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	In the municipal debt market, short-term yields have also increased notably as outflows from tax-exempt money funds that invest in short-term municipal securities have accelerated.	61.0	999.0
201609	227	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	With prime money fund AUMs and WAMs expected to decline further, both survey- and market-implied measures point to a modest further widening in LIBOR– OIS spreads as the implementation date approaches.	61.0	999.0
201609	228	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	By early December, however, the spread is expected to narrow.	61.0	999.0
201609	229	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The expected narrowing could result from prime funds extending their WAMs amid reduced uncertainty about further outflows and from lending in somewhat larger sizes if AUMs rebound modestly.	61.0	999.0
201609	230	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	However, the cost of borrowing from prime funds—as reflected in LIBOR, CP, and CD rates—will likely remain elevated by historical standards because prime fund investors are expected to require relatively higher returns to invest in those funds following the implementation of reform.	61.0	999.0
201609	231	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The adjustments in pricing and issuance of financial CP and CDs, while notable, have been relatively smooth, without disruptions in funding to issuers.	61.0	999.0
201609	232	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	However, market participants note some unease that there could be more abrupt liquidity needs as the reform implementation date approaches.	61.0	999.0
201609	233	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The bottom-right panel shows upcoming weekly maturities of financial CP and CDs with tenors from one month to one year, broken out by the domicile of the issuer.	61.0	999.0
201609	234	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The countries highlighted in the chart represent the top four in terms of the volume of CP maturing between now and October 14, and cumulatively they make up over half of the roughly $350 billion maturing over that period.	61.0	999.0
201609	235	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	These maturities will likely necessitate further changes in issuers’ funding profiles through a combination of paying higher rates to reissue or shifts to alternative funding sources.	61.0	999.0
201609	236	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants have been particularly focused on the funding and liquidity profiles of Japanese banks, shown in red, as their reliance on CP and CD issuance to US money funds for dollar funding remains large relative to other countries.	61.0	999.0
201609	237	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Concerns over the effect of US money fund reform on Japanese banks’ US dollar funding have contributed to the continued upward pressure on the US dollar– yen swap basis, shown as the dark blue line in the top-left panel of your final exhibit.	61.0	999.0
201609	238	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Recall that the basis indicates the implied cost of borrowing US dollars offshore through the foreign exchange market, above what it would cost to borrow dollars directly at US dollar LIBOR.	61.0	999.0
201609	239	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Contacts expect the basis could widen further around the September quarter-end and as the money fund reform implementation date approaches because Japanese banks may need to seek dollar funding through alternative sources.	61.0	999.0
201609	240	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	This is important to note because, as we have observed, if the implied average cost of US dollar funding materially exceeds the costs on foreign central banks’ dollar liquidity operations, draws of the swap lines may increase.	61.0	999.0
201609	241	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Despite these sizable effects across money markets, money fund reform has not had a notable effect on overnight secured or unsecured interest rates.	61.0	999.0
201609	242	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-right panel, these rates remained within ranges seen over recent months.	61.0	999.0
201609	243	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The effective federal funds rate averaged 40 basis points this period, which is unchanged from last period’s average.	61.0	999.0
201609	244	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Shifting to the SOMA portfolio, reinvestment operations continue to be executed smoothly, in line with the Committee’s reinvestment policy.	61.0	999.0
201609	245	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle- left panel, monthly reinvestment purchases of agency MBS have been increasing, driven primarily by the ongoing low level of interest rates and a resulting pickup in refinancing activity.	61.0	999.0
201609	246	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The Desk expects to conduct around $46 billion of MBS reinvestment purchases in September, which would be the largest monthly reinvestment amount to date.	61.0	999.0
201609	247	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Finally, in light of the Committee’s approval of the Foreign Authorization documents and the pending instructions from the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, we plan to implement the new investment framework we discussed at the April FOMC meeting.	61.0	999.0
201609	248	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	As you may recall from that discussion, the Desk undertook a strategic review of the foreign reserves management framework, as our overall approach had not been formally reviewed for about a decade.	61.0	999.0
201609	249	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The negative interest rate environment in the euro area and Japan, which has resulted in negative total income on the foreign portfolio in recent months, also reinforced the need to revisit our approach.	61.0	999.0
201609	250	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The new framework, summarized in the middle-right panel, involves a more explicit process for assessing policymakers’ investment preferences and uses a mean-variance optimization approach to establish a benchmark portfolio for asset allocation.	61.0	999.0
201609	251	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	With the new benchmark, the Desk would begin a three-month process of reinvesting maturing proceeds to match the new asset allocation, which will result in an increase in cash and a more modest increase in longer-term securities in the euro portfolio.	61.0	999.0
201609	252	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Eligible securities for investment will now include Dutch sovereign securities in addition to French and German sovereign debt.	61.0	999.0
201609	253	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	For the yen portfolio,as we still receive a zero interest rate on deposits with the Bank of Japan, we will leave maturing proceeds from securities holdings on deposit with the BOJ for the time being.	61.0	999.0
201609	254	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	However,in view of the dynamic nature of policy in Japan, it’s possible that changes to our approach for the yen portfolio may be required; we will seek instruction from the Subcommittee, in consultation with the Committee, if we need to adjust.	61.0	999.0
201609	255	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	We plan to update the Committee at the next meeting on the status of the implementation and provide quarterly updates on the portfolio thereafter.	61.0	999.0
201609	256	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	As usual, your appendix contains a summary of operational tests performed over the intermeeting period and those planned during the next period.	61.0	999.0
201609	257	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Susan McLaughlin will now continue the presentation, focusing on the proposed Desk counterparty policy.	61.0	999.0
201609	258	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Thank you, Lorie.	61.0	999.0
201609	259	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	I’ll be referring to the exhibit titled “Proposed Counterparty Policy.”	61.0	999.0
201609	260	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	The staff is seeking your concurrence with a new counterparty policy that we propose to publish on the FRBNY’s website in early November.	61.0	999.0
201609	261	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	The policy documents, in draft form, can be found in the appendixes of the memo that we sent to you last week.	61.0	999.0
201609	262	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	The new policy represents the culmination of a multiyear project conducted by FRBNY and Board staff to strengthen and improve the FRBNY’s framework for managing counterparties for market operations.	61.0	999.0
201609	263	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	The staff also consulted with the staff in the Treasury’s Office of Domestic Finance,on account of the role that primary dealers play in Treasury auctions, as well as the staff in the Treasury’s Office of International Affairs,on account of their reliance on the FRBNY’s foreign exchange/reserve management counterparties for Exchange Stabilization Fund, or ESF, operations.	61.0	999.0
201609	264	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	The review identified a number of improvements that could be made to the FRBNY’s counterparty framework.	61.0	999.0
201609	265	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Last year, the FRBNY implemented the first set of improvements from the review by establishing a single, consistent set of internal management practices and processes with regard to all Desk counterparties.	61.0	999.0
201609	266	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	We are coming back to you now to seek your concurrence with the second set of improvements to the FRBNY’s public documentation on counterparties.	61.0	999.0
201609	267	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	The proposed new policy consolidates the administration and respective expectations of all counterparty types for SOMA operations and for ESF and Treasury auctions that the FRBNY conducts for the Treasury as fiscal agent.	61.0	999.0
201609	268	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	This consolidated format clarifies for the public the overarching framework within which all counterparties for market operations are managed and highlights common themes.	61.0	999.0
201609	269	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	It may also help moderate the perception that primary dealers are special in some way by showing how they are similar to other types of counterparties and the various obligations they assume.	61.0	999.0
201609	270	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	As panel 1 in your exhibit shows, the FRBNY is currently more transparent about its counterparties for open market operations than those for foreign market operations.	61.0	999.0
201609	271	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	We propose to eliminate this inconsistency by expanding the set of information we provide on foreign operations counterparties in two ways.	61.0	999.0
201609	272	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	First, for the first time, we will publish the lists of our FX and foreign reserves counterparties, just as we do today for primary dealers and reverse repo counterparties.	61.0	999.0
201609	273	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	And, second, we will add information on expectations and eligibility criteria for foreign reserve management counterparties to what we already publish for other types of counterparties.	61.0	999.0
201609	274	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	The FRBNY relies on primary dealers not only for the conduct of open market operations, but also to ensure robust coverage of Treasury auctions of new securities.	61.0	999.0
201609	275	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	We propose three changes to the eligibility criteria for primary dealers that will modestly expand the pool of regulated banks and broker-dealers eligible to become primary dealers in an effort to augment operational capacity.	61.0	999.0
201609	276	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	These changes are summarized in panel 2.	61.0	999.0
201609	277	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	First, we would reduce the Federal Reserve’s minimum net regulatory capital, or NRC, threshold for broker-dealers to $50 million from the current $150 million level.	61.0	999.0
201609	278	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Second, we would increase the minimum Tier 1 capital threshold to $1 billion to better align and scale it for the new NRC threshold.	61.0	999.0
201609	279	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Third, we would establish a 0.25 percent Treasury market share threshold to accompany the new minimum capital thresholds.	61.0	999.0
201609	280	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	I would note that reducing the minimum NRC threshold to $50 million is likely to have a fairly modest effect on the number of primary dealers in the near term, as shown in panel 3.	61.0	999.0
201609	281	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Our impact analysis was based on an examination of the 168 broker-dealers that are registered with the SEC, had NRC in excess of $50 million as of year-end 2014, and are not already primary dealers.	61.0	999.0
201609	282	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Of those 168, only 25 appeared to act as market makers in Treasury securities.	61.0	999.0
201609	283	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	And 13 of these 25 firms already had NRC in excess of the current $150 million threshold, leaving only 12 additional dealers that would become eligible to apply at the new $50 million NRC threshold.	61.0	999.0
201609	284	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	I would also like to clarify why we are proposing to increase the minimum Tier 1 capital threshold for banking organizations with subsidiaries or branches as primary dealers to $1 billion from the current level of $150 million as we reduce the minimum NRC threshold.	61.0	999.0
201609	285	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	While NRC is a net measure of capital at the broker-dealer subsidiary level, Tier 1 is a measure of capital supporting all operations of a holding company; the two measures are not equivalent.	61.0	999.0
201609	286	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	In trying to ascertain the level of Tier 1 capital that is analogous to NRC, we looked at the Tier 1 and NRC levels of current primary dealers and found that they differ widely with respect to the scale and scope of businesses their Tier 1 capital supports.	61.0	999.0
201609	287	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	In the absence of a clear relationship between NRC and Tier 1 capital, the staff judged that $1 billion was a reasonable complement to the new NRC threshold proposed.	61.0	999.0
201609	288	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Like the NRC threshold, the Tier 1 threshold is a gating mechanism rather than a mitigant of counterparty credit risk.	61.0	999.0
201609	289	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Finally, we plan to establish a 0.25 percent Treasury market share threshold for primary dealers in order to better gauge new applicants’ ability to meet our transaction needs.	61.0	999.0
201609	290	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	As shown in panel 4, Treasury market share has in the past been used as a gauge of primary dealer capabilities.	61.0	999.0
201609	291	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	You may recall that between 2013 and 2015, the Desk conducted two yearlong pilot programs with small firms, first as participants in our Treasury purchase operations and then as participants in our MBS purchase operations.	61.0	999.0
201609	292	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Our experiences with these pilots suggest that having an explicit, quantifiable criterion like market share may become more important as we consider applications from smaller firms.	61.0	999.0
201609	293	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	We selected the 0.25 percent threshold on the basis of Treasury market share data received from a number of primary dealer applicants and Treasury pilot applicants over the 2010–14 period; these data are summarized in panel 5.	61.0	999.0
201609	294	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Expanding the pool of applicants to some smaller firms will require a few changes to our processes for monitoring counterparty credit risk.	61.0	999.0
201609	295	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Currently, most primary dealers are affiliated with or are branches of publicly traded banks or other publicly traded companies, and FRBNY has access to a range of market-based and supervisory or regulatory information to use in monitoring them.	61.0	999.0
201609	296	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	The others are affiliated with companies that issue debt in the capital markets and are thus subject to SEC filing requirements and rating agency analysis that FRBNY uses in its monitoring process.	61.0	999.0
201609	297	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Because firms with NRC below $150 million are unlikely to have either of these characteristics, much of the information on which FRBNY currently relies will not be available in the case of these firms.	61.0	999.0
201609	298	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	FRBNY will develop an equivalent monitoring process that is appropriate for these firms before taking any new applicants on board.	61.0	999.0
201609	299	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	The staff would appreciate any feedback, either now or in the coming weeks, that you may have on the policy materials.	61.0	999.0
201609	300	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	If the Committee is generally supportive of the approach, we plan to publish the documents on November 9 after incorporating any comments.	61.0	999.0
201609	301	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201609	302	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	That concludes our prepared remarks.	61.0	999.0
201609	303	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	We’d be happy to respond to your questions.	61.0	999.0
201609	304	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Any questions for the presenters?	62.0	65.0
201609	305	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	62.0	65.0
201609	306	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	I had a question for Lorie on the reinvestment purchases.	62.0	103.0
201609	307	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	At one point, the expectations were that we would cease reinvestments when we’d get to a federal funds rate of 1 to 1¼ percent.	62.0	103.0
201609	308	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Are those expectations of when people expect us to cease reinvestments moving at all relative to expectations for the funds rate, and how would they compare with our own?	62.0	103.0
201609	309	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The reinvestment expectations in the policy survey are adjusting to changes in expectations for the rate level, so they’ve been consistently moving out as expectations of the path of policy have moved out.	62.0	999.0
201609	310	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	That relationship has stayed fairly stable.	62.0	999.0
201609	311	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	So with our projections coming out, they are likely to change.	62.0	103.0
201609	312	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	So 1⅜ is the median estimate of where the federal funds rate will be.	62.0	999.0
201609	313	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	62.0	103.0
201609	314	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Any further questions?	62.0	65.0
201609	315	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	We do not need a vote on the new counterparty policy, but I would like to see whether there is general support for the Desk to go ahead with the plans as we’ve discussed.	63.0	65.0
201609	316	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	63.0	108.0
201609	317	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes.	63.0	96.0
201609	318	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63.0	65.0
201609	319	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	You have general support.	63.0	65.0
201609	320	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	And I do need a vote to ratify domestic open market operations.	63.0	65.0
201609	321	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So moved.	63.0	96.0
201609	322	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	63.0	65.0
201609	323	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	63.0	65.0
201609	324	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	We’re ready to move along to the economic and financial briefings, and David Wilcox is going to start us off.	11.0	65.0
201609	325	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11.0	999.0
201609	326	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I will be referring to the packet titled “The US Outlook.”	11.0	999.0
201609	327	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The staff economic projection is not much revised since our assessment in either June, which is the last time you provided forecasts for the SEP, or compared with July, so I’ll summarize the current economic situation with greater brevity than usual and will then make the briefing longer than usual overall by reviewing in some detail the comparative labor market experience of blacks, Hispanics, and whites over the past couple of decades.	11.0	999.0
201609	328	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Real GDP growth during the first half of this year is currently estimated to have been noticeably weaker than we anticipated in July, but a shortfall in inventory investment below our expectations more than accounted for the downside surprise.	11.0	999.0
201609	329	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The growth of private domestic final purchases during the first half of the year was, according to current estimates, as strong as we had expected.	11.0	999.0
201609	330	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As shown in panel 1, the available indicators as seen through the lens of the various nowcasting models in operation around the System suggest that real GDP growth has rebounded in the current quarter, a view with which we concur.	11.0	999.0
201609	331	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Indeed, as you will see from the path of the black line, our judgmental assessment is that the rebound has been a little stronger than we anticipated at the time of the July meeting, even taking on board last Thursday’s slightly disappointing retail sales release.	11.0	999.0
201609	332	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Our forecast of real GDP growth over the year as a whole is now unrevised from the July Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201609	333	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from panel 2, our September Tealbook forecast of real GDP growth over the medium term is just a shade weaker than the one we had in July, largely because we trimmed our assumption for potential GDP growth and let that show through to actual GDP.	11.0	999.0
201609	334	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Overall, the picture remains one of steady growth, modestly faster than the growth of potential GDP and slowing slightly toward the end of the projection period as the normalization of monetary policy takes firmer hold and discretionary fiscal policy actions add a little less to the growth of demand.	11.0	999.0
201609	335	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As shown in panel 3, we estimate that the output gap has essentially closed—an assessment very much in line with the range of four models that we track and that produce their own independent estimates of an output gap.	11.0	999.0
201609	336	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Over the medium term, we expect that output will move above its potential, with the differential reaching about 1½ percent of potential GDP by the end of 2018.	11.0	999.0
201609	337	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As a result, the unemployment rate, shown to the right, continues to drift down, reaching a low of 4¼ percent in 2019.	11.0	999.0
201609	338	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As shown in the bottom two panels, the outlook for inflation is also essentially unrevised.	11.0	999.0
201609	339	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The most noteworthy development here since the July meeting is that we’ve received some hard data corroborating our earlier expectation that core inflation would step down in the second half of the year.	11.0	999.0
201609	340	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	We had expected a combination of residual seasonality and the absence of elevated readings in a few idiosyncratic categories to bring core quarterly inflation down into the neighborhood of 1¼ to 1½ percent in the second half of this year, and that reduction seems to be in train—an assessment that survived the publication late last week of the PPI and CPI for August.	11.0	999.0
201609	341	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As shown in panel 7 on the next page, our forecast for top-line PCE inflation this year is unrevised, on net, since December of last year when you first raised the funds rate 25 basis points, reflecting a fortuitous counterbalancing of weaker-than-expected food prices against stronger-than-expected core inflation.	11.0	999.0
201609	342	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As shown to the right, we parse the changes in core inflation into the yellow box for “other” price inflation in 2016.	11.0	999.0
201609	343	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Inflation mavens will recall that there were some price spikes early in the year in categories such as jewelry, apparel, and nonmarket prices—categories that historically have not had much signal value for future inflation.	11.0	999.0
201609	344	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Thus far, the call not to carry any of those higher readings forward into the second half appears to have been the right one.	11.0	999.0
201609	345	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	In 2017 and 2018, a variety of very small factors have caused us to trim a cumulative 0.1 percentage point per year out of our projection.	11.0	999.0
201609	346	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The most easily identifiable of these factors is that, back in March, we took down our assumption for the underlying pace of inflation this year 5 basis points.	11.0	999.0
201609	347	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I will now turn to reviewing the comparative labor market outcomes of blacks or African Americans, Hispanics or Latinos, and whites over the past couple of decades.	11.0	999.0
201609	348	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	A high-level summary is that overall labor market conditions have continued to improve over the past several years, and that this improvement has generally been broadly shared across major racial and ethnic groups.	11.0	999.0
201609	349	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	In relative terms, conditions on at least some dimensions have been improving more rapidly of late for African Americans and Hispanics than for whites.	11.0	999.0
201609	350	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	However, in absolute terms, labor market conditions remain notably worse for African Americans and Hispanics.	11.0	999.0
201609	351	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The following three panels illustrate the overall improvement in labor market conditions.	11.0	999.0
201609	352	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As shown by the black dashed line in panel 9, the national average U-3 unemployment rate has continued to trend down in recent years, and, as shown by the other lines, this is true for blacks and Hispanics as well as for whites.	11.0	999.0
201609	353	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As shown in panel 10, the broader U-6 measure has also generally continued to trend downward, though progress on this measure appears to have been more uneven in recent months for blacks and Hispanics.	11.0	999.0
201609	354	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Panel 11 shows employment-to- population ratios for these same groups, focusing here on persons between the ages of 25 and 54 in order to limit the influence of the marked differences in age structure across racial and ethnic groups.	11.0	999.0
201609	355	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The EPOPs for all groups have trended up over the past several years, with the EPOP for blacks or African Americans making especially notable gains after having suffered especially severely during the Great Recession and having lagged the recovery experienced by other groups.	11.0	999.0
201609	356	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Thus, the labor market experience of Hispanics and African Americans has improved considerably during the past few years.	11.0	999.0
201609	357	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	That said, it remains notably worse in many respects than the labor market experience of whites.	11.0	999.0
201609	358	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Starting with the most obvious fact to illustrate this point, the unemployment rates for blacks and Hispanics remain much higher than that for whites.	11.0	999.0
201609	359	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	For example, 8.7 percent, on average, for blacks over the 12 months ending in August, 5.9 percent for Hispanics, and 4.4 percent for whites.	11.0	999.0
201609	360	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Moreover, panel 12 on your next page shows that, at every age, unemployment rates are higher for blacks and Hispanics than they are for whites.	11.0	999.0
201609	361	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Similarly, panel 13 shows that, with only one exception, unemployment rates for blacks and Hispanics at every level of educational attainment are higher than they are for whites of the same educational attainment.	11.0	999.0
201609	362	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	An especially sobering take on the relative experience of blacks or African Americans compared with whites is revealed by comparing unemployment rates across levels of educational attainment.	11.0	999.0
201609	363	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Remaining in panel 13, for example, comparing the blue bar in the rightmost cluster with the green bar just to the left, we see that during the 12 months ending in August, blacks with a bachelor’s degree or more experienced unemployment at the same 4.2 percent rate as whites with only some college or an associate’s degree.	11.0	999.0
201609	364	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Moving to the left, blacks with some college education but not a bachelor’s degree experienced a higher unemployment rate than did whites with only a high school degree.	11.0	999.0
201609	365	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	And blacks with a high school degree experienced more unemployment than did white high school dropouts.	11.0	999.0
201609	366	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Another aspect of the labor market reality of blacks and Hispanics over the past two decades has been that they have tended to experience a “high beta” version of the unemployment variation of whites.	11.0	999.0
201609	367	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Panel 14 on the next page provides a scatter plot of the unemployment rate for blacks, plotted against the y-axis, against the unemployment rate for whites, plotted against the x-axis.	11.0	999.0
201609	368	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The red dots show unemployment rates from 1994 through 2007, while the blue dots show rates since the beginning of 2011.	11.0	999.0
201609	369	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from the red trend line for the early dots, a 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate for whites before the Great Recession was associated with a 1.8 percentage point increase in the rate for blacks.	11.0	999.0
201609	370	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The bad news is that nothing has changed more recently:  As shown by the trend line for the blue dots, exactly the same relationship holds in the more recent period.	11.0	999.0
201609	371	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The good news, to the extent there is any here, is that this high-beta relationship implies that unemployment rates have been coming down more rapidly for blacks lately than for whites.	11.0	999.0
201609	372	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Panel 15 provides a similar comparison of Hispanic unemployment rates to white unemployment rates.	11.0	999.0
201609	373	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	In this case, and viewed through this simple lens without controlling for other workforce characteristics, there seems to have been some convergence in unemployment experience from the 1990s compared with more recently.	11.0	999.0
201609	374	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As denoted by the red dots, the multiplier for the Hispanic rate during the 1990s was more than 2, and the level of rates was consistently higher.	11.0	999.0
201609	375	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Since the turn of the century, the level of the relationship seems to have rotated downward, but still, the multiplier for Hispanics during the past decade and a half has run in the neighborhood of about 1½.	11.0	999.0
201609	376	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	An obvious question is what the underlying cause of this high-beta experience of blacks and Hispanics might be.	11.0	999.0
201609	377	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	One prominent author has suggested that much of the high-beta experience of blacks and Hispanics can be attributed to the disproportionate employment of blacks and Hispanics in the highly cyclical manufacturing and construction industries.	11.0	999.0
201609	378	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Another prominent author has attributed the phenomenon to discrimination.	11.0	999.0
201609	379	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	A third possibility is that it might reflect different age structures or levels of educational attainment across racial and ethnic groups.	11.0	999.0
201609	380	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	To shed light on the plausibility of differing educational attainments as an explanation for the high-beta experience of blacks and Hispanics, I stratified the earlier scatter plots by level of educational attainment.	11.0	999.0
201609	381	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The four panels on your next page show the results for blacks.	11.0	999.0
201609	382	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	For example, the panel in the upper left compares the unemployment experience of blacks with less than a high school degree with that of whites with the same educational attainment.	11.0	999.0
201609	383	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see, the multiplier in this educational group has averaged 1.7.	11.0	999.0
201609	384	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The remaining panels perform the same exercise for successively higher levels of attainment.	11.0	999.0
201609	385	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The counterintuitive result here is that there is no attenuation of the high-beta experience as education goes up: Even for blacks with a college degree, if the unemployment rate of their white counterparts goes up 1 percentage point, their own unemployment rate goes up 1.8 percentage points on average.	11.0	999.0
201609	386	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The data point furthest to the northeast in this panel—that is, the lower-right panel—is for 2011: In that year, the unemployment rate for whites with a BA or more peaked at 3.9 percent, while the rate for their black counterparts hit 7.1 percent.	11.0	999.0
201609	387	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Your next page presents the analogous results for Hispanics, limiting the sample to 2002 and forward.	11.0	999.0
201609	388	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	In this case, the results differ much more across levels of educational attainment.	11.0	999.0
201609	389	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	In particular, there’s no significant difference between the cyclicality of unemployment of Hispanics and whites who have less than a high school degree (the top-left panel) and a notably smaller difference in the case of those who have a high school degree (shown in the top right).	11.0	999.0
201609	390	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	On the other hand, the unemployment beta for Hispanics who have some college education (in the bottom left) is about 1.3, and the beta for those having a bachelor’s degree or more (in the bottom right) is actually a little higher than in the aggregate.	11.0	999.0
201609	391	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	This investigation is far from providing a complete answer to the question of why the black and Hispanic unemployment rates historically have behaved like an amplified version of the white unemployment rate.	11.0	999.0
201609	392	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	But it suggests to me that even if disproportionate employment in manufacturing and construction is part of the explanation for the high-beta experience of blacks and Hispanics, more may be going on.	11.0	999.0
201609	393	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	In particular, I am struck by the fact that, at least in the case of African Americans, the high-beta behavior manifests at all levels of educational attainment, including among those with a college degree or more.	11.0	999.0
201609	394	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	But, for sure, more work needs to be done here.	11.0	999.0
201609	395	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Before closing, let me briefly note that blacks and Hispanics have worse labor market experiences in other dimensions as well, aside from unemployment.	11.0	999.0
201609	396	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	To give two quick illustrations: As shown in panel 18, blacks and Hispanics report experiencing involuntary part-time employment for economic reasons at considerably higher rates than do whites.	11.0	999.0
201609	397	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	And, as shown in panel 19, blacks experience longer spells of unemployment than do whites.	11.0	999.0
201609	398	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	You can see this latter result by noting that relatively less of black unemployment relative to white unemployment is accounted for in short-duration spells, to the left of the graph, whereas relatively more of black unemployment is taken up in long-duration spells, to the right of the graph.	11.0	999.0
201609	399	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	And I haven’t even touched on the issue of wage equity across racial and ethnic groups.	11.0	999.0
201609	400	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The bottom line that I take away is this:  Much progress has been made in recent years in overall labor market conditions.	11.0	999.0
201609	401	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Moreover, in relative terms, blacks and Hispanics have gained disproportionately during the past few years.	11.0	999.0
201609	402	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	However, in absolute terms, the differences across groups remain large and disturbing.	11.0	999.0
201609	403	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Much more work remains to be done about why this is so and what can be done about it.	11.0	999.0
201609	404	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Paul will carry on with our briefing.	11.0	999.0
201609	405	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201609	406	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	This has been a relatively quiet round for international developments.	11.0	999.0
201609	407	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Global financial and commodity market settings have not moved much since your previous meeting, and, similarly, the outlook for foreign growth and inflation is little changed from what we presented in the July Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201609	408	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Moreover, the hubbub over Brexit has died down for now, with financial markets continuing to recover from the initial declines and economic data showing less near- term effect on the UK and euro-area economies than originally feared.	11.0	999.0
201609	409	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In the July Tealbook, we had based our estimates of Brexit effects on measures of economic uncertainty (panel 1) and related financial stress.	11.0	999.0
201609	410	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Although those measures initially spiked, they have come down considerably.	11.0	999.0
201609	411	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	However, we still expect negotiations between UK and EU authorities over their future trade relationship will be a source of uncertainty that will weigh on both economies during the forecast period.	11.0	999.0
201609	412	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In addition, we expect some drag on UK economic growth from the long-run effects of reduced trade and integration with the rest of Europe.	11.0	999.0
201609	413	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	For the overall foreign economy, the second-quarter pothole in GDP growth was even larger than expected, mostly because temporary factors weighed heavily on the output of our North American trading partners.	11.0	999.0
201609	414	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In Canada, oil production was disrupted by wildfires in May but started to recover by June.	11.0	999.0
201609	415	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In Mexico, economic growth suffered in part from weakness in US industrial production.	11.0	999.0
201609	416	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	However, foreign growth excluding Mexico and Canada (the red line in panel 2) held up better in the second quarter.	11.0	999.0
201609	417	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	With those two countries bouncing back, total foreign growth should recover to around 2½ percent in the second half and stay near that rate through the forecast period.	11.0	999.0
201609	418	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	As shown in panel 3, in most advanced foreign economies, inflation on a four- quarter basis remains near zero, partly because of past declines in energy prices.	11.0	999.0
201609	419	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	With oil prices stabilizing, we see a rebound in headline inflation over the next year, but even by the end of 2019 we project inflation at only 1½ percent in the euro area and 1 percent in Japan.	11.0	999.0
201609	420	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	The sharp sterling depreciation following the Brexit vote is expected to push UK inflation above 2 percent next year, but the Bank of England has said it will “look through” that rise as it counteracts some of the real effects of the Brexit shock.	11.0	999.0
201609	421	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	As Simon discussed, the Bank of England provided further stimulus in early August.	11.0	999.0
201609	422	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In contrast, the ECB held off on easing at its recent meeting, and the Bank of Japan announced only modest further stimulus in late July, even though inflation in those economies remains well below target and long-term inflation compensation (panel 4) is low.	11.0	999.0
201609	423	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In the euro area, it has declined in recent years from around 2½ percent to less than 1½ percent.	11.0	999.0
201609	424	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Japanese inflation compensation was boosted by Abenomics in 2013, rising as yen depreciation spurred actual inflation, but it has fallen back to near zero.	11.0	999.0
201609	425	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Amid questions on why its stimulus has failed to durably raise inflation, the Bank of Japan is undertaking a “comprehensive assessment” of its unconventional policies to be released tonight following its policy meeting.	11.0	999.0
201609	426	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	More generally, foreign central banks are grappling with the effectiveness of further stimulus and what form it should take.	11.0	999.0
201609	427	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	The asset purchases and negative policy rates pursued by the ECB and Bank of Japan have provided stimulus, including through reduced domestic borrowing rates.	11.0	999.0
201609	428	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	As seen in panel 5, since the ECB took its deposit rate negative in mid-2014 and began large-scale sovereign bond purchases in early 2015, interest rates on loans to nonfinancial corporations have declined significantly in the core euro-area economies and even more sharply in the periphery.	11.0	999.0
201609	429	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Yield curves in the euro area and Japan (panel 6) also have shifted down and flattened.	11.0	999.0
201609	430	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	However, with both short and longer-term interest rates so low, there are questions of whether pushing them further down will encourage additional borrowing and spending or provide further stimulus through other channels.	11.0	999.0
201609	431	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In addition, flatter yield curves tend to hurt the profitability of banks, which generally borrow short and lend long, and thus could reduce the transmission of monetary stimulus through the bank lending channel, which is important in both of those economies.	11.0	999.0
201609	432	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Concerns about the bank lending channel arise even at low positive interest rates, prompting the introduction of programs such as the Bank of England’s Term Funding Scheme.	11.0	999.0
201609	433	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	But those concerns intensify as policy rates turn negative, squeezing net interest margins for banks (panel 1 of your next exhibit) if they reduce lending rates but are unable to pass on negative rates to retail depositors.	11.0	999.0
201609	434	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	These potential side effects are leading foreign policymakers to worry that the effective lower bound on the policy rate may not be determined by substitution into cash but by concerns that further rate cuts could be counterproductive.	11.0	999.0
201609	435	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	ECB officials have stressed that lower interest rates also have some positives for banks, including capital gains on bond portfolios and lower charge-offs as a result of improvements in credit quality, and they point to increased bank lending in recent years.	11.0	999.0
201609	436	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Nonetheless, as shown by the blue line in panel 2, we believe the ECB is inclined to pursue other types of stimulus and will leave its deposit rate unchanged at negative 0.4 percent for most of the forecast period.	11.0	999.0
201609	437	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	By the same token, Bank of Japan Governor Kuroda recently acknowledged that negative policy rates can hurt banks’ margins while arguing that rate cuts still have greater benefits than costs.	11.0	999.0
201609	438	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	We expect that, in its comprehensive assessment, the Bank of Japan will conclude that its negative rate policy is effective, opening the possibility of further rate cuts.	11.0	999.0
201609	439	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	However, assuming the Japanese economy achieves the tepid growth and meager rise in inflation projected in our baseline, we currently anticipate the Bank of Japan will not actually reduce the policy rate further.	11.0	999.0
201609	440	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Perhaps responding to the criticism that Bank of Japan and ECB policies have received from the banking community, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has made clear recently he is no fan of negative interest rates, indicating that he sees the effective lower bound as “a positive number close to zero.”	11.0	999.0
201609	441	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	We expect the Bank of England to keep its policy rate at its current low level as the UK economy adjusts to life outside the EU.	11.0	999.0
201609	442	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	But Carney’s view is not universally held in central banking circles, and some draw a different conclusion from the recent experience with negative rates.	11.0	999.0
201609	443	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	For instance, this past December, the Bank of Canada reviewed its policy tools and suggested its policy rate could go as low as negative 0.5 percent, if needed.	11.0	999.0
201609	444	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In addition to low rates, all of these central banks except the Bank of Canada have ongoing asset purchase programs, primarily buying sovereign bonds.	11.0	999.0
201609	445	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Recent discussions of ECB and Bank of Japan policies have often focused on whether and how to expand these purchases.	11.0	999.0
201609	446	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Regarding “whether,” policymakers in both institutions have been surprised by the extent to which long yields have fallen and, as I noted earlier, are concerned about their effects on bank profits.	11.0	999.0
201609	447	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Regarding “how,” both institutions are facing issues and constraints as their asset holdings grow.	11.0	999.0
201609	448	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	The ECB’s constraints are largely self-imposed, as its sovereign debt holdings are still only a small share of outstanding euro-area sovereign debt.	11.0	999.0
201609	449	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In particular, the ECB limits its holdings of any bond and any issuer, its purchases are allocated across countries by its capital key, and it buys only bonds that yield more than its deposit rate.	11.0	999.0
201609	450	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	These constraints interact with each other and become more binding when bond yields decline.	11.0	999.0
201609	451	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	For instance, German bonds have to make up a large share of its purchases (about 25 percent), but many German bonds yield less than the deposit rate and thus are not eligible.	11.0	999.0
201609	452	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	We expect the ECB to announce, most likely in December, an extension of its purchases to the end of 2017 from its current commitment of March 2017.	11.0	999.0
201609	453	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	To do so, it will have to relax some of those constraints, and it has tasked committees with evaluating the options.	11.0	999.0
201609	454	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	The BOJ faces greater concerns over running out of room to buy more sovereign bonds.	11.0	999.0
201609	455	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	As shown in panel 3, it currently holds more than one-third of outstanding JGBs.	11.0	999.0
201609	456	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Moreover, Japanese life insurance companies and pension funds have long- term yen-denominated liabilities and thus are reluctant to sell their JGBs even at elevated prices.	11.0	999.0
201609	457	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Of course, large fiscal deficits are also increasing the supply of JGBs, and the Abe government has announced renewed fiscal stimulus.	11.0	999.0
201609	458	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	We expect the BOJ to maintain its current pace of JGB purchases for the next several years but not to increase that pace.	11.0	999.0
201609	459	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Given the issues associated with further sovereign bond buying, central banks are moving into purchases of riskier, private-sector assets.	11.0	999.0
201609	460	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In July, the Bank of Japan increased its rate of ETF purchases, and we think it likely will increase its purchases of real estate investment trusts and corporate bonds, both of which it currently buys in relatively small amounts.	11.0	999.0
201609	461	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	The ECB began in June a program to buy corporate bonds, and corporate bond spreads (panel 4) have declined significantly since the announcement.	11.0	999.0
201609	462	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In August, the Bank of England also announced corporate bond purchases as part of its stimulus program.	11.0	999.0
201609	463	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In sum, we believe that AFE central banks still have room to provide further stimulus, but further action comes with growing complications and side effects that need to be managed.	11.0	999.0
201609	464	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Hence, central banks are resorting to a widening array of instruments, and they face growing challenges of communicating simultaneously about not only the stance of monetary policy, but also its shifting composition.	11.0	999.0
201609	465	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Regardless of whether AFE central banks add to their stimulus in the years to come, their policies are generally expected to remain highly accommodative.	11.0	999.0
201609	466	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	As discussed in Carol Bertaut’s pre-FOMC briefing, this expectation is spurring capital flows to emerging markets and boosting EME asset prices as well as reducing high- yield credit spreads in advanced economies.	11.0	999.0
201609	467	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	However, as evidenced by the backup in long yields in recent weeks, this buoyancy is fragile and could be undermined by signs that accommodation is being removed more quickly than anticipated.	11.0	999.0
201609	468	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In this environment, the risks associated with FOMC tightening may be greater than usual, especially with regard to the dollar.	11.0	999.0
201609	469	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Accordingly, we have chosen to increase the sensitivity of our dollar forecast to policy rate surprises, a move supported by the experience of the past couple of years.	11.0	999.0
201609	470	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	We now assume the dollar will increase by 3 percent against all floating currencies for each 100 basis points of policy rate surprise, compared with about 2¼ percent previously.	11.0	999.0
201609	471	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In addition, we reassessed our assumption about the path of the Chinese renminbi (panel 5) in light of the Chinese government’s apparent willingness to allow further gradual declines in its currency.	11.0	999.0
201609	472	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	We now assume that the dollar will appreciate against the renminbi through the end of the forecast period.	11.0	999.0
201609	473	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Previously, we had assumed the dollar would depreciate starting in the second half of 2017.	11.0	999.0
201609	474	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	All told, as shown in panel 6, we now project a steeper path of dollar appreciation over the forecast period.	11.0	999.0
201609	475	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	And, as illustrated by an alternative scenario in the Tealbook, we view the risks to our dollar outlook as toward the upside.	11.0	999.0
201609	476	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Beth Klee will continue our presentation.	11.0	999.0
201609	477	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	I’ll be referring to the packet labeled “Material for Briefing on the Summary of Economic Projections.”	11.0	999.0
201609	478	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	To summarize, while your near- and medium- term economic projections are quite similar to those you submitted in June, more than half of you reduced your estimates of longer-run real GDP growth.	11.0	999.0
201609	479	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	In addition, most of you revised down your assessments of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate through 2018 and over the longer run.	11.0	999.0
201609	480	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Exhibit 1 summarizes your economic projections, which are conditional on your individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.	11.0	999.0
201609	481	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As shown in the top panel, the median of your projections of real GDP growth this year is 1.8 percent.	11.0	999.0
201609	482	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Most of you project that economic growth will pick up a bit next year and run at or slightly above your estimates of its longer-run rate in 2017 and 2018, and a majority of you expect real GDP growth to be at its longer-run trend in 2019.	11.0	999.0
201609	483	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	One participant did not submit longer-run projections of the percentage change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate.	11.0	999.0
201609	484	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	That fact will be noted in the SEP material that will be released to the public.	11.0	999.0
201609	485	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As shown in the second panel, the median of your projections of the unemployment rate by the end of this year is 4.8 percent, equal to the median of its longer-run normal level.	11.0	999.0
201609	486	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	A substantial majority of you see the unemployment rate falling to or below its longer-run normal level over the next two years.	11.0	999.0
201609	487	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	In addition, many of you see the unemployment rate edging up to or toward its longer-run level in 2019.	11.0	999.0
201609	488	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As can be seen in the third panel, the median of your projections of headline PCE inflation moves up from 1.3 percent this year to 1.9 percent in 2017 and 2 percent in 2018 and 2019, when all of you project that inflation will be equal to or within a couple tenths of a percentage point of the Committee’s objective.	11.0	999.0
201609	489	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Turning to the bottom panel, the medians of your projections of core inflation also increase gradually over the next three years.	11.0	999.0
201609	490	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Exhibit 2 compares your current projections with those in the June Summary of Economic Projections and with the September and June Tealbooks.	11.0	999.0
201609	491	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As indicated in the top panel, the median of your forecasts of real GDP growth in 2016 has fallen since June; many of you attributed the downward revision to weaker-than-expected incoming data for the first half of this year.	11.0	999.0
201609	492	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	The median values of your projections of real GDP growth in 2017 and 2018 are unchanged from June at 2 percent, a pace slightly above the median projection of its longer-run growth rate, which was revised down to 1.8 percent.	11.0	999.0
201609	493	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As shown in the second, third, and fourth panels, the medians of your projections of the unemployment rate and of total and core PCE inflation are little changed from June.	11.0	999.0
201609	494	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Compared with the latest Tealbook, the median of your projections of real GDP growth is a bit higher this year, moderately lower in 2017, and about in line for 2018 and beyond.	11.0	999.0
201609	495	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	The median of your projections of the unemployment rate and for headline and core inflation are generally somewhat higher than those presented in the Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201609	496	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Exhibit 3 provides an overview of your assessments of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate.	11.0	999.0
201609	497	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	The median of your projections, indicated by the red horizontal lines in the top panel, is consistent with one 25 basis point rate hike by the end of this year.	11.0	999.0
201609	498	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Thereafter, the medians of your projections are 1.1 percent at the end of 2017, 1.9 percent at the end of 2018, and 2.6 percent at the end of 2019.	11.0	999.0
201609	499	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Compared with the June projections, which are shown in the bottom panel, 12 of you revised down the federal funds rate you expect to prevail at the end of this year; the median of your projections is now 25 basis points lower.	11.0	999.0
201609	500	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	All but a couple of you revised down your funds rate forecast over the next two years, and, since June, many of you also lowered your assessment of the appropriate pace of rate hikes in 2017.	11.0	999.0
201609	501	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	The median federal funds rate projection moves up 50 basis points from the end of 2016 to the end of 2017, compared with a 75 basis point increase expected in June, and by another 75 basis points in 2018.	11.0	999.0
201609	502	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Many of you expressed a view that increases in the federal funds rate over the next several years will need to be gradual in light of a short-term neutral real interest rate that is currently low and will only rise slowly—a phenomenon that a number of you attributed to persistently low productivity growth and other factors.	11.0	999.0
201609	503	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	In addition, some of you cited risk-management considerations,due to the proximity of the effective lower bound, as a reason for taking a cautious approach to normalization.	11.0	999.0
201609	504	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	With respect to the longer-run federal funds rate, 12 of you moved down your projections by at least 25 basis points, and the median now stands at 2⅞ percent, compared with 3 percent in June.	11.0	999.0
201609	505	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	In making the downward revisions, participants noted a number of factors, including the persistence of unfavorable global demographic dynamics; weak productivity growth; and low longer-term yields stemming from, for example, a weak outlook for economic growth abroad.	11.0	999.0
201609	506	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As in June, almost all of you anticipate that the appropriate level of the funds rate at the end of 2018 will remain below your individual judgments of its longer-run level.	11.0	999.0
201609	507	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Most of you expect this difference to narrow considerably by the end of 2019.	11.0	999.0
201609	508	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As shown by the red diamonds in exhibit 3, the median federal funds rate that a non-inertial Taylor (1999) rule prescribes for the end of this year,conditional on your individual projections of core inflation, the unemployment rate gap, and the longer- run federal funds rate, has shifted down since June, reflecting downward revisions to projected inflation and the longer-run federal funds rate as well as upward revisions to the unemployment rate.	11.0	999.0
201609	509	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	The lower Taylor rule prescriptions for 2017 and 2018 primarily reflect the downward revisions to the longer-run federal funds rate.	11.0	999.0
201609	510	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	All of you continue to project levels of the federal funds rate in 2016, 2017, and 2018 that are well below the prescriptions using your individual economic outlooks as variables in the policy rule, and only two of you project the federal funds rate in 2019 to be equal to that suggested by the rule.	11.0	999.0
201609	511	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Exhibit 4 compares the medians of your current projections with those from September 2015.	11.0	999.0
201609	512	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As illustrated in the top panel, the median projections of real GDP growth in 2016 and 2017 are a bit lower than a year ago.	11.0	999.0
201609	513	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As shown in the second panel, the median projection of the unemployment rate is modestly lower than it was in September 2015.	11.0	999.0
201609	514	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As depicted in the third panel, the median projection of inflation in 2016 has been revised down, generally reflecting declines in energy prices and continued strength in the dollar that were not expected a year ago.	11.0	999.0
201609	515	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	While the median projections of economic activity, employment, and inflation are little changed from the September 2015 SEP, the path of the federal funds rate that you anticipate will generate these outcomes is much lower in the current projection.	11.0	999.0
201609	516	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	In September 2015, the median federal funds rate at year-end 2016 was 1.4 percent, compared with 0.6 percent now.	11.0	999.0
201609	517	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	This gap widens through 2018.	11.0	999.0
201609	518	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Moreover, over the past year, the median of your longer-run federal funds rate declined from 3.5 percent to 2.9 percent.	11.0	999.0
201609	519	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Exhibit 5 shows your assessments of the uncertainty and risks surrounding your economic projections.	11.0	999.0
201609	520	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As shown in the figures to the left, you continue to view the uncertainty attached to your projections as being broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years.	11.0	999.0
201609	521	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As in June, the majority of you also see the risks to your projections of GDP growth and the unemployment rate as being broadly balanced, as illustrated in the top two figures to the right, and fewer of you see the risks to economic growth as weighted to the downside or view the risks to unemployment as weighted to the upside than in June.	11.0	999.0
201609	522	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Moving to the two bottom-right figures, a couple more of you now see the risks to your inflation projections as broadly balanced rather than as tilted to the downside; those who revised their view pointed to an easing of concerns about global financial developments or inflation expectations remaining anchored at policy- consistent levels.	11.0	999.0
201609	523	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Those who continue to judge that the risks to inflation are weighted to the downside cited the risks associated with encountering negative economic shocks at the effective lower bound as well as recent readings on survey-based measures of inflation expectations and financial market measures of inflation compensation, among other reasons.	11.0	999.0
201609	524	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201609	525	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	That concludes our prepared remarks, and we would be happy to respond to your questions.	11.0	999.0
201609	526	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for any of the presenters are welcome.	12.0	65.0
201609	527	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	12.0	65.0
201609	528	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	107.0
201609	529	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	This is for David Wilcox.	12.0	107.0
201609	530	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	I thought the discussion and the decomposition on unemployment experiences by different racial groups was extremely interesting.	12.0	107.0
201609	531	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	It seems very important as we try to figure out where we are with regard to remaining slack and where that remaining slack may be, although it’s a little unclear as to why there are these very differential experiences.	12.0	107.0
201609	532	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	As I look at it, I thought the decomposition by education was very striking, both in terms of the variability and in terms of the levels.	12.0	107.0
201609	533	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	And, as you were talking, it seems a little harder superficially to associate that kind of a pattern with sectoral differences as opposed to potentially alternative explanations like discrimination.	12.0	107.0
201609	534	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	But I wondered whether you had any further thoughts on what this is telling you so far or what additional analysis you might think about doing to try to get further insights into that.	12.0	107.0
201609	535	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I think it’s a really important question to be investigated.	12.0	999.0
201609	536	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As I said in the course of the briefing itself, I don’t regard this work as having laid to rest the question.	12.0	999.0
201609	537	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I’m a little skeptical that differential exposure to cyclical industries—in particular, manufacturing and construction—can account for the high-beta experience of blacks and Hispanics.	12.0	999.0
201609	538	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	My view on that is informed importantly by the results, perhaps most especially those in the lower-right panel in exhibit 16, which show that even for African Americans with a bachelor’s degree or more, this multiplier of 1.8 pertains relative to whites.	12.0	999.0
201609	539	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I haven’t looked at the industry exposure of African Americans and whites with a bachelor’s degree or more, but I’m a little skeptical that the exposure of African Americans with a bachelor’s or more to construction and to manufacturing could be significant enough to account for that.	12.0	999.0
201609	540	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Industry exposure itself may account for some of this behavior.	12.0	999.0
201609	541	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I am skeptical that it provides a complete explanation.	12.0	999.0
201609	542	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	There are marked differences in the age structure of these racial and ethnic groups.	12.0	999.0
201609	543	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	For example, relatively speaking, the Hispanic population has far fewer elderly than the white population.	12.0	999.0
201609	544	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	So another avenue for investigation is something akin to what I’ve done that would investigate the potential role of differential age structure and account for this sort of situation.	12.0	999.0
201609	545	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	But I think there’s a lot of work to be done not only here inside the Federal Reserve, but by outside researchers as well.	12.0	999.0
201609	546	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	12.0	65.0
201609	547	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I thought that the box in Tealbook A, “Alternative View:  A Return to the Greenspan Conundrum,” was really interesting.	12.0	102.0
201609	548	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I want to reiterate something I think I’ve said many times over the years—how much I appreciate the alternative view boxes.	12.0	102.0
201609	549	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I know that you’re not supporting the particular views here, but I think they are really valuable, at least for us—2,500 miles away we sit and discuss these, and it forces us to think through things in a very constructive way.	12.0	102.0
201609	550	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, again, I view this as a very positive exercise.	12.0	102.0
201609	551	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, that one exercise did get me looking at the alternative scenario that was related to that, which was, again, named “A Return to the Greenspan Conundrum.”	12.0	102.0
201609	552	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	One intriguing result of that alternative scenario was that the unemployment rate comes down to 3¼ percent in late 2019.	12.0	102.0
201609	553	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I know that throughout my lifetime we’ve never had a 3¼ percent unemployment rate.	12.0	102.0
201609	554	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I actually don’t think we’ve had one, probably, since World War II.	12.0	102.0
201609	555	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	You’re not that young.	12.0	999.0
201609	556	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	[Laughter]	12.0	999.0
201609	557	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay.	12.0	102.0
201609	558	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I don’t think we’ve had an unemployment rate that low.	12.0	102.0
201609	559	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	No, I don’t think so.	12.0	65.0
201609	560	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	It got down to about 3.5, I think, in 1999?	12.0	65.0
201609	561	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes.	12.0	102.0
201609	562	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	It has not gone to 3.	12.0	65.0
201609	563	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	No.	12.0	102.0
201609	564	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	But what about in the ’60s, at the end of the ’60s?	12.0	65.0
201609	565	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	It didn’t go to 3¼ percent in the ’60s.	12.0	102.0
201609	566	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	No.	12.0	999.0
201609	567	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay.	12.0	102.0
201609	568	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So the unemployment rate has not gone down to 3¼ percent in my lifetime.	12.0	102.0
201609	569	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’ll stick with that.	12.0	102.0
201609	570	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	12.0	102.0
201609	571	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	The question I have is—I think this simulation was done in the FRB/US model—if you thought through that scenario of a really strong economy, in which monetary policy, for whatever reason, is not taming output growth, do you really think the unemployment rate would go down to close to 3 percent?	12.0	102.0
201609	572	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Or do you think that something else would give in the model?	12.0	102.0
201609	573	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Are we pushing this model outside of the historical norms far enough that maybe labor force participation would pick up, maybe wages would pick up, or something?	12.0	102.0
201609	574	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	How do you think about scenarios of an essentially linear model when you’re taking it well outside a historical norm that was estimated?	12.0	102.0
201609	575	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Really tough question.	12.0	999.0
201609	576	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t have a ready, fully formed answer for you.	12.0	999.0
201609	577	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I’ll answer with a partial response, which is that I suspect that a feature of a lot of these alternative scenarios in which we’re stressing one aspect of the economy would entail other aspects.	12.0	999.0
201609	578	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	So the all-else-being-equal assumption would fail for sure.	12.0	999.0
201609	579	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Now, where the rivets would pop off, I think, is what you’re asking, and I don’t know the answer to that.	12.0	999.0
201609	580	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	If I had thought 3.2 percent unemployment was absolutely outlandish, I wouldn’t have shown the results in the scenario.	12.0	999.0
201609	581	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I do think it begins to push the boundaries of what we’re likely to see, but, by design, this is a pretty extreme scenario.	12.0	999.0
201609	582	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I thought it was appropriate to show that kind of an outcome even though it pushes pretty far into the tail of the probability distribution.	12.0	999.0
201609	583	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t have a ready answer for how things might evolve differently from the way that the model portrays them.	12.0	999.0
201609	584	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	The question I go to is, if we look at episodes in which unemployment went very low or in which we were pushing the economy hard, did we actually see something different happening?	12.0	102.0
201609	585	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Do we get off the linear relationships?	12.0	102.0
201609	586	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Do wages accelerate more quickly, or does something else happen differently in those extreme scenarios?	12.0	102.0
201609	587	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m thinking about the stuff that I remember Mike Kiley doing years ago, looking at how relationships work when you’re at the ends of the distribution.	12.0	102.0
201609	588	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As it happens, I think Mike is here.	12.0	999.0
201609	589	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	He’s going to deny my referencing his work.	12.0	102.0
201609	590	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Mike, do you have anything to add to this?	12.0	999.0
201609	591	2016-09-21	meeting	KILEY	I think, David, the only thing that I can add is that if you look at the picture—although I don’t have it in front of me—that President Williams is referring to, you can see that the confidence intervals of the unemployment rates are very low.	12.0	999.0
201609	592	2016-09-21	meeting	KILEY	And the folks that work on the FRB/US model are quite worried about exactly the point that President Williams is raising, that historical experience doesn’t have these things.	12.0	999.0
201609	593	2016-09-21	meeting	KILEY	What are the relevant nonlinearities?	12.0	999.0
201609	594	2016-09-21	meeting	KILEY	Are they on participation?	12.0	999.0
201609	595	2016-09-21	meeting	KILEY	Would they be in wages?	12.0	999.0
201609	596	2016-09-21	meeting	KILEY	But I just don’t think we have historical episodes.	12.0	999.0
201609	597	2016-09-21	meeting	KILEY	The one that is in our lifetime, the one in the late 1990s, was accompanied by very favorable other developments regarding productivity, et cetera.	12.0	999.0
201609	598	2016-09-21	meeting	KILEY	So wage pressures or price pressures or other things weren’t particularly apparent.	12.0	999.0
201609	599	2016-09-21	meeting	KILEY	We might imagine they might arise, but that experiment didn’t particularly shed light.	12.0	999.0
201609	600	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	12.0	102.0
201609	601	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	One comment on a point that President Williams raised.	12.0	96.0
201609	602	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	A rate of 3.2 percent today would be very different than a rate of 3.2 percent in the late ’60s because the demographics of the population are quite different.	12.0	96.0
201609	603	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So while I basically take your point, I think you’d have to adjust for the changes in the demographic structure of the economy.	12.0	96.0
201609	604	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I want to come back to the issue of the black and Hispanic unemployment.	12.0	96.0
201609	605	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there’s no question that discrimination is a factor because we have a lot of evidence on things like long- term unemployment that hurts people in terms of their ability to be hired.	12.0	96.0
201609	606	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So while we don’t know the proportion, I think discrimination definitely plays a role.	12.0	96.0
201609	607	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I’m inclined to agree, and this evidence pushes me further in that direction.	12.0	999.0
201609	608	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Another body of research that corroborates that view is the matched résumé submitting, showing that when identical résumés are sent to employers but one of the names has a stereotypical ethnic association, and callback rates differ dramatically between the two.	12.0	999.0
201609	609	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	So that, in my mind, is another piece of corroborating evidence.	12.0	999.0
201609	610	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I just wanted to make it clear that it’s not up in the air.	12.0	96.0
201609	611	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s actually evidence.	12.0	96.0
201609	612	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Right.	12.0	65.0
201609	613	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	There is evidence.	12.0	65.0
201609	614	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	12.0	65.0
201609	615	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Well, I agree with President Williams that extrapolations like this do make you wonder about what could go wrong, and I think there are other things that could happen, right?	12.0	91.0
201609	616	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	In a simulation like this, it could be that the matching technology for employment is better so that, in fact, labor market outcomes are more efficient and you get lower unemployment.	12.0	91.0
201609	617	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	To the extent that there’s tension, I agree it would be manifest either in wages or maybe inflation expectations.	12.0	91.0
201609	618	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	And in this scenario inflation expectations are undoubtedly anchored, but if there was a tension, I would expect that to go wrong.	12.0	91.0
201609	619	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	So that’s the element of the model or the data I’d be looking for, in order to try to weigh in on that.	12.0	91.0
201609	620	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	12.0	65.0
201609	621	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	We’re going back and forth between President Williams’s comments and the earlier comments on further study.	12.0	88.0
201609	622	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	I’d also add that gender cuts, I think, could tell us a great deal.	12.0	88.0
201609	623	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	And just yesterday in Atlanta, I attended a meeting that talked about the judicial system and incarceration rates and the effect of a record of some kind on employment.	12.0	88.0
201609	624	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	So this is a multilayered thing.	12.0	88.0
201609	625	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	If we’re going to tackle it, I think we have to tackle it in a very thorough way, and that’s why I mentioned the gender cuts.	12.0	88.0
201609	626	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I agree completely, but despairing of being able to come to the Committee with a complete answer on all dimensions, I thought I’d come to the Committee with some evidence that I thought was pretty interesting, even if only partial.	12.0	999.0
201609	627	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The incarceration rates are just astonishing—not only the stock of individuals who are currently incarcerated, but those who have a previous record of incarceration.	12.0	999.0
201609	628	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	And that’s bound to be a significant influence in what’s going on.	12.0	999.0
201609	629	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	With regard to gender, I absolutely agree that that’s another important dimension to be explored.	12.0	999.0
201609	630	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	But, as I say, I wanted to come before my own retirement [laughter] with some kind of discussion to the Committee.	12.0	999.0
201609	631	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Thank you.	12.0	999.0
201609	632	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Further comments or questions?	12.0	65.0
201609	633	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	12.0	65.0
201609	634	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	94.0
201609	635	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	My question is on exhibit 2 in “The International Outlook,” panel 6, “Real Dollar Indexes.”	12.0	94.0
201609	636	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We talked before about the reason we’re projecting a stronger dollar is because we think we’re going to surprise markets with our path of rate increases.	12.0	94.0
201609	637	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	So is that surprise the Taylor (1999) rule, or is it the SEP median?	12.0	94.0
201609	638	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Well, the surprise is the difference between the staff assumption about the federal funds rate over the next three or four years.	12.0	999.0
201609	639	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Which is Taylor (1999)?	12.0	94.0
201609	640	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Which is Taylor (1999).	12.0	999.0
201609	641	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Yes.	12.0	94.0
201609	642	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	I would just say, because the entire outlook for the US and global economy is conditioned on that assumption, I wanted to make clear that it’s a staff assumption about the future path of the federal funds rate, which is indeed based on Taylor (1999).	12.0	999.0
201609	643	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	It’s the comparison of that and one measure of what the market expects, which is the OIS rate path.	12.0	999.0
201609	644	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	And it’s that gap that represents the surprise because the markets, as represented by the OIS rates, expect a much shallower uplift in the federal funds rate than is embedded in the staff forecast.	12.0	999.0
201609	645	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Would you say that this is becoming increasingly tenuous, to make this kind of assumption, because Taylor (1999) is getting further and further away from market expectations?	12.0	94.0
201609	646	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Well, that’s a question for my colleagues.	12.0	999.0
201609	647	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	[Laughter]	12.0	999.0
201609	648	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	The reason that we use that staff assumption about the path of the federal funds rate is so that our dollar forecast is exactly consistent with both the economic forecast and the conditioning assumption about monetary policy.	12.0	999.0
201609	649	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Then that raises the question about what is the right conditioning assumption regarding the federal funds rate, and we have reviewed that, and I’ll let one of my colleagues speak more on that.	12.0	999.0
201609	650	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	In a tough spot.	12.0	999.0
201609	651	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The one thing that I would simply note is that, as time progresses, the median expectations from the primary dealer survey, for example, are for a substantially flatter increase than what the Taylor rule applied to our economic forecast implies.	12.0	999.0
201609	652	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	So, by the end of 2019, I think you are looking at a gap on the order of about 1¼ percentage points.	12.0	999.0
201609	653	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	The assumption there is informing the whole outlook and sort of changing the whole context of what you’re presenting to the Committee.	12.0	94.0
201609	654	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	But aren’t these really small effects?	12.0	96.0
201609	655	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re talking about, what, 3½ or 4 percent on the dollar?	12.0	96.0
201609	656	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201609	657	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	On the dollar, you can look at the picture on panel 6.	12.0	999.0
201609	658	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The uncertainty associated with that has got to be a lot greater.	12.0	96.0
201609	659	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Yes, you can see that our real dollar goes up about 5 percent over the next three and a half years or so.	12.0	999.0
201609	660	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	The 5 percent is a non-negligible amount but, stretched over that long a period, it does not have very strong effects on US economic growth.	12.0	999.0
201609	661	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Now, in the Tealbook we have an alternative assumption of a 10 percent rise over a much shorter period, and that is, of course, very material.	12.0	999.0
201609	662	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	And, as Vice Chairman Dudley mentions, that uncertainty dwarfs the arguments you might have about the baseline path of the dollar.	12.0	999.0
201609	663	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Well, the reason I bring this up is because it’s particularly stark when you look at exchange rates because you would expect foreign exchange markets to already have encompassed assumptions about various central bank policies, and therefore you wouldn’t be able to predict very well—and, in fact, you can’t predict very well—what’s going to happen to exchange rates.	12.0	94.0
201609	664	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	But here we’re saying we have some kind of information that the markets do not have, and then that’s feeding into the entire forecast.	12.0	94.0
201609	665	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	That’s exactly right.	12.0	999.0
201609	666	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	We do believe that the current configuration of exchange rates incorporates all information about the future that is expected both by markets and by us.	12.0	999.0
201609	667	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	In almost all areas of global economics that might influence the current exchange rate are information sets that we probably hold in common with the markets.	12.0	999.0
201609	668	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	So there’s really one key area in which our views differ from the market, and that’s the assumption about the future path of the federal funds rate.	12.0	999.0
201609	669	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	We also incorporate into our dollar forecast some differences in views about foreign central bank monetary policy, but they’re not that material.	12.0	999.0
201609	670	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	It’s mainly differences of views about US monetary policy, about the federal funds rate, which in turn lead to expectations on our part that the market will be surprised.	12.0	999.0
201609	671	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	That is that one difference between our information sets and the markets’ that we build into our forecast.	12.0	999.0
201609	672	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	12.0	94.0
201609	673	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	12.0	65.0
201609	674	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	103.0
201609	675	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	My question is spawned by President Williams’s question, only looking at the Tealbook.	12.0	103.0
201609	676	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	The Tealbook unemployment rate for 2019 of 4.2 percent, and long-run of 5—would there be historical experience to say what happens when you go from 4.2 to 5, just even in that range?	12.0	103.0
201609	677	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	There’s not a lot.	12.0	999.0
201609	678	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The excursions of the unemployment rate below the natural rate and then back up to the natural rate are pretty rare, and as I think Michael Kiley was referring to, one has to wonder whether at that point, with a rising unemployment rate, some nonlinear dynamics might take over and we might end up with something other than a smooth landing.	12.0	999.0
201609	679	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I think the record of the postwar period, in my view, is less dispositive on that point than it might first appear because many of the recessions in the postwar period were actually deliberatively induced by the Federal Reserve in order to wring inflation out of the system.	12.0	999.0
201609	680	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	This is what gave rise to the designation by Christina Romer and David Romer of the so-called “Romer dates” when they divined that the mind of the Committee had switched from one mode, which was promoting economic growth, to another mode, which was fighting inflation.	12.0	999.0
201609	681	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	So I think it’s less evident than it might seem on the surface that it’s impossible to accomplish a smooth landing of the kind that’s portrayed at the baseline projection, but there isn’t a long historical record to show that it can be done.	12.0	999.0
201609	682	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	If I may, just ever so briefly, I’d like to come back to President Williams’s original comment about the alternative view.	12.0	999.0
201609	683	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I’m aware that there’s been quite a lot of turnover on the Committee since that franchise was introduced, and I thought I might just place it a little bit into context.	12.0	999.0
201609	684	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	It’s the only place in the Tealbook in which I give individual staff members a byline, so they’re individually invested and identified in the production of that.	12.0	999.0
201609	685	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The goal here is to ask staff members to make the case for an off-baseline possibility of consequence to you as policymakers.	12.0	999.0
201609	686	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I’m asking them to act as lawyer advocates of a nonbaseline possibility.	12.0	999.0
201609	687	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	And my compact with them is that I will never ask them if they believe that their scenario is superior to the baseline scenario, because if I did that, I would be putting them in the position of saying that they think their judgment is better than mine.	12.0	999.0
201609	688	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Now, I suspect that, frankly, many of them do believe that [laughter], but I never force them to come out and say that to my face.	12.0	999.0
201609	689	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	It’s good enough.	12.0	999.0
201609	690	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	And the way that I assess the quality of their work is, simply, “How well did you marshal the evidence on behalf of your case?	12.0	999.0
201609	691	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Did you argue it well by appealing to history, foreign central bank experience, US central bank experience, or other issues like that?”	12.0	999.0
201609	692	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	All I’m asking them to do is, articulate a plausible possibility off baseline with the goal, I hope, of advancing the ability of all of you to think through various contingencies that you might confront.	12.0	999.0
201609	693	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	12.0	65.0
201609	694	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes.	12.0	102.0
201609	695	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I want to clarify something, again, for people who may not be following exactly what David said earlier.	12.0	102.0
201609	696	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	You said something about how you may have assumed that it’s impossible to get a soft landing when you have the unemployment rate way below its natural rate.	12.0	102.0
201609	697	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	You didn’t actually say what the fact was, and the fact is, it’s never happened.	12.0	102.0
201609	698	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I just wanted everyone to be clear.	12.0	102.0
201609	699	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s the thing that you were talking about that you weren’t convinced by, but I think that does get to President George’s question.	12.0	102.0
201609	700	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	We have not seen an example in the postwar history in which the unemployment rate went up more than ½ percentage point that wasn’t associated with a recession.	12.0	102.0
201609	701	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, the reasons for that, which you brought up in the debate about why that is the case, is definitely a live subject.	12.0	102.0
201609	702	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	But it is a striking—not even a “stylized” fact but a fact that this hasn’t occurred in the past.	12.0	102.0
201609	703	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So it is an area in which I worry that, when you have an unemployment rate that low, it is very hard, and historically hard—you have to go way back in history, I think—to find an example of that being successful.	12.0	102.0
201609	704	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t know if that was a legal two-hander [laughter].	12.0	102.0
201609	705	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	This is an important issue.	12.0	91.0
201609	706	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I’m going to guess that in models you’ve written down, President Williams—I don’t tabulate these things myself—if you simulate them, you probably have a lot of examples in which the unemployment rate has gone up in those simulations without it being what somebody might call a recession.	12.0	91.0
201609	707	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Andin view of the small number of recessions that we’ve had and some lack of luck during some of these—as we were talking about in Chicago just last week, one of my colleagues pointed out that, well, 1990 and ’91 could have been a soft landing, but then Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait came about.	12.0	91.0
201609	708	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	And, you know, things happen during fragile times.	12.0	91.0
201609	709	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	So there’s a small number of observations.	12.0	91.0
201609	710	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	There are some shocks that do that.	12.0	91.0
201609	711	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	If it was as much of a slam dunk as your comment kind of suggests offhand, then your models ought to be reflecting this, and I just don’t think they are.	12.0	91.0
201609	712	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	So it’s worth a lot of discussion because, frankly, I think it is a big deal.	12.0	91.0
201609	713	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	If, in fact, undershooting the natural rate of unemployment is something that is going to lead to a recession, and if we think that the Phillips curve mechanism is going to be important to get inflation up to our target, well, then, we’re probably never going to get it up to target, because we’re going to say, “If I do this, I’ll have a recession, and that would be worse.”	12.0	91.0
201609	714	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	And then that’s going to ratify that 2 percent as a ceiling.	12.0	91.0
201609	715	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	So I think this is a really important issue for more discussion.	12.0	91.0
201609	716	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	I absolutely agree with you.	12.0	65.0
201609	717	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I agree, President Evans—and President Williams, too.	12.0	999.0
201609	718	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I think that one needs to acknowledge that this is an area in which it is going to be difficult to make solid progress in research.	12.0	999.0
201609	719	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I certainly feel that I can’t speak with great conviction that our nice, tidy linear models describe well the dynamics that take over in a more fragile economy when demand is growing more slowly.	12.0	999.0
201609	720	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	One is struck, for example, by the profile of unemployment over the business cycle.	12.0	999.0
201609	721	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	You see steep increases in the unemployment rate, and you don’t see equivalently steep declines in the unemployment rate.	12.0	999.0
201609	722	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	And in a simple, tidy linear model like the FRB/US model, there probably shouldn’t be that discrepancy in behavior.	12.0	999.0
201609	723	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Now, that said, my impression is that there have been two attempts at a soft landing in the post–World War II era.	12.0	999.0
201609	724	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	And, as President Evans just mentioned, I think there is an easily identifiable event with regard to one of them—namely, the 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq— that provided a plausible shock of sharp magnitude that disrupted economic processes.	12.0	999.0
201609	725	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I just don’t think you can look to the historical record and get a dispositive answer on that question.	12.0	999.0
201609	726	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	And I don’t have a huge amount of confidence in the ability of our models to discriminate, because the kind of model you go to in looking for that answer—that will pretty much give you the answer.	12.0	999.0
201609	727	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	If you go to a linear model like the FRB/US model and you rely on that model as the source for your answer, you will decide that it’s feasible that there’s no particular problem here.	12.0	999.0
201609	728	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	If you go to a model that incorporates nonlinear dynamics, that will be the answer that you get.	12.0	999.0
201609	729	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	12.0	65.0
201609	730	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’ll talk about it in my own session, so I will follow-up then.	12.0	90.0
201609	731	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	12.0	65.0
201609	732	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	I just want to confirm my recollection of a number that the previous Chairman told us about in early 2008, and I think it’s that the unemployment rate doesn’t rise more than 0.3 percentage point without a recession.	12.0	81.0
201609	733	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Is that the right number?	12.0	81.0
201609	734	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Three-month moving average.	12.0	96.0
201609	735	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Of what?	12.0	81.0
201609	736	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	A three-month moving average of the unemployment rate.	12.0	96.0
201609	737	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	If it goes up more than 0.3 percentage point, we’ve always had a recession.	12.0	96.0
201609	738	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Thanks.	12.0	81.0
201609	739	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Not causation.	12.0	102.0
201609	740	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	12.0	65.0
201609	741	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	94.0
201609	742	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Just on this Greenspan conundrum discussion, we may not have observed a 3¼ percent unemployment rate in President Williams’s lifetime.	12.0	94.0
201609	743	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	But we did observe a conundrum in the early 2000s, and we do have some experience with that.	12.0	94.0
201609	744	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	In that episode, we did not see this huge decline in the unemployment rate.	12.0	94.0
201609	745	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	That’s just another way to look at that issue.	12.0	94.0
201609	746	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	So it’s not like it’s completely out of historical experience.	12.0	94.0
201609	747	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12.0	65.0
201609	748	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we get started then on our economic go-round.	13.0	65.0
201609	749	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll have a few comments and then take a coffee break.	13.0	65.0
201609	750	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s start with President Rosengren.	13.0	65.0
201609	751	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Oh, am I going now?	13.0	90.0
201609	752	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	13.0	65.0
201609	753	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’m sorry.	13.0	90.0
201609	754	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	I thought we were going for the break.	13.0	90.0
201609	755	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	[Laughter]	13.0	90.0
201609	756	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	My apologies.	13.0	90.0
201609	757	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	No problem.	13.0	65.0
201609	758	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	He was changing what he was going to say.	13.0	97.0
201609	759	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	13.0	97.0
201609	760	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201609	761	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	We can come back to you.	13.0	65.0
201609	762	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	My forecast is quite similar to that of the Tealbook.	13.0	90.0
201609	763	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	I expect real GDP growth for the second half of this year to be more than 1 percentage point higher than for the first half of this year.	13.0	90.0
201609	764	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	This pickup will largely reflect continued strength in consumption and some rebuilding of inventories.	13.0	90.0
201609	765	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Growth in real final sales to private domestic purchasers has been fairly solid over the past year, and I expect a solid increase in 2017 as well.	13.0	90.0
201609	766	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, abstracting from transitory fluctuations induced by inventory changes, domestic economic growth remains quite healthy, with limited spillovers to date from the strong dollar and weak growth of our trading partners.	13.0	90.0
201609	767	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	My expectation regarding core PCE inflation for the second half of this year is slightly higher than the Tealbook’s.	13.0	90.0
201609	768	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	By the end of 2017, I expect core inflation to be only slightly below our 2 percent inflation target.	13.0	90.0
201609	769	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	One concern with such an inflation forecast has been the decline in inflation expectations in the Michigan survey.	13.0	90.0
201609	770	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, as with other measures of inflation expectations, the lowest quartile has been relatively stable, with most of the decline coming from the higher quartiles.	13.0	90.0
201609	771	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Such behavior could be consistent with households finally realizing that the inflation environment has changed.	13.0	90.0
201609	772	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Even with a noticeable rise in the funds rate, I expect the unemployment rate to reach 4.5 percent by the end of 2017.	13.0	90.0
201609	773	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	This forecast of an overshoot of full employment is not an outlier, as both the Tealbook and the Blue Chip consensus forecast also expect the unemployment rate to be 4½ percent by the end of 2017.	13.0	90.0
201609	774	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Using the Tealbook’s estimate of the natural rate, this implies a ½ percentage point overshoot of full employment.	13.0	90.0
201609	775	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	My estimate of the natural rate is a bit lower, so 4½ percent implies only a 0.2 percentage point overshoot of full employment.	13.0	90.0
201609	776	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, within 15 months, all three forecasts expect the unemployment rate to fall below where the consensus of the Committee expects the unemployment rate to be in the long run.	13.0	90.0
201609	777	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Like the Tealbook, I expect the unemployment rate to continue drifting down through 2018, reaching 4.2 percent at the end of 2019.	13.0	90.0
201609	778	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Hence, my forecast envisions economic growth in excess of potential, even with 100 basis points of tightening in 2017.	13.0	90.0
201609	779	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	The Tealbook also expects the unemployment rate to fall to 4.2 percent.	13.0	90.0
201609	780	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	While this is my modal forecast, I believe risks are balanced around that outlook.	13.0	90.0
201609	781	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	There is a significant risk that we will exceed this already large overshoot of full employment.	13.0	90.0
201609	782	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	If foreign trade partners grow more quickly or moderate demand does not draw workers back into the labor force, the unemployment rate could easily decline even further.	13.0	90.0
201609	783	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	One reason why I see balanced risks associated with the Tealbook forecast of the unemployment rate is because I believe an assumption of an additional increase in labor force participation is far from certain.	13.0	90.0
201609	784	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	My staff examined state-level participation rates to see if participation has risen significantly in states whose unemployment rate is quite low.	13.0	90.0
201609	785	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	They do not find a strong state-level correlation between recent changes in participation rates and low unemployment rates.	13.0	90.0
201609	786	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, we must consider the possibility of a more significant overshoot of full employment, which would bring with it significant risks to the sustainability of the expansion.	13.0	90.0
201609	787	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we find ourselves in the position in which we need to increase the unemployment rate ½ percentage point or more in order to return to full employment, we will be attempting a feat that is yet to be accomplished.	13.0	90.0
201609	788	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Historically, every attempt to raise the unemployment rate ½ percentage point or more from below full employment has resulted in a recession that produces a much larger rise in unemployment than a few tenths.	13.0	90.0
201609	789	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Overshooting tends to happen in both directions.	13.0	90.0
201609	790	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	This was part of the discussion that we were just having, as mentioned earlier by President Williams and President Evans.	13.0	90.0
201609	791	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think this is actually very fundamental to the discussions that we are having today.	13.0	90.0
201609	792	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	While it may be possible to have a soft landing, is it probable, particularly if we do a significant overshoot?	13.0	90.0
201609	793	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	While there are advantages to using accommodative monetary policy to probe for additional improvements in labor markets, particularly for low-skilled workers and minorities who may benefit from a stronger market, we must balance these potential benefits against the risk of a significant overshoot of full employment that could ultimately do even more harm to the same populations.	13.0	90.0
201609	794	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Should we once again be unsuccessful in fine-tuning a slowdown, the ensuing recession will likely fall disproportionately on low-skilled workers and minorities.	13.0	90.0
201609	795	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	I will discuss the policy implications of that concern tomorrow.	13.0	90.0
201609	796	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201609	797	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	798	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13.0	65.0
201609	799	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	81.0
201609	800	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Reports received from contacts in the Fifth District have been more positive than negative since the previous meeting and are consistent with the continuation of recent growth trends.	13.0	81.0
201609	801	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The manufacturing picture remains mixed.	13.0	81.0
201609	802	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Our August survey shows a decline in the overall manufacturing index, as did preliminary figures for September due out next Tuesday.	13.0	81.0
201609	803	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	I continue to receive positive reports from some industries, particularly those tied to consumer markets and, particularly, autos.	13.0	81.0
201609	804	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The service sector index also softened in August, but preliminary readings for September show a rebound.	13.0	81.0
201609	805	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	In both surveys, wage indexes remain very high.	13.0	81.0
201609	806	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Contacts indicate continued tightness in labor markets across regions and industries.	13.0	81.0
201609	807	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Regulatory issues and uncertainty regarding the upcoming election were cited as potentially weighing on economic activity.	13.0	81.0
201609	808	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The outlook for commercial real estate remains very strong according to recent data and comments from contacts.	13.0	81.0
201609	809	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The residential sector is more uneven, however, with reports of very strong markets in some areas but also a number of weaker markets.	13.0	81.0
201609	810	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Constraints on the supply of lots and skilled workers is said to be restraining activity in some areas.	13.0	81.0
201609	811	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	In assessing the national outlook at this meeting, I think it’s useful to look back to last December.	13.0	81.0
201609	812	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	At that point, we saw an economy that had expanded steadily, if slowly, in the years since the recession.	13.0	81.0
201609	813	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	For 2015, it looked as if payroll employment had increased about 220,000 jobs per month.	13.0	81.0
201609	814	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The unemployment rate had declined 0.6 percentage point to 5 percent, close to most estimates of the natural rate.	13.0	81.0
201609	815	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Real GDP had grown at about 2 percent, supported by strong PCE growth.	13.0	81.0
201609	816	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	And 12-month core PCE inflation had stabilized at 1.3 percent despite low headline inflation and a strengthening dollar.	13.0	81.0
201609	817	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The median outlook for 2016 of the SEP was for a further decline in the unemployment rate, supported by more strong growth in payroll employment, real GDP growth of 2.4 percent, and fourth-quarter core inflation firming to around 1.6 percent.	13.0	81.0
201609	818	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Coming into the final quarter of this year, the data are lining up fairly well with that December outlook.	13.0	81.0
201609	819	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	There have been some misses, but they’re relatively minor, I’d argue.	13.0	81.0
201609	820	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Payroll employment has averaged about 180,000 a month, a small slowdown from last year’s pace but still much higher than we would need to maintain constant unemployment rates across demographic cohorts.	13.0	81.0
201609	821	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	And you’d expect payroll employment growth to slow as the unemployment rate flattens out.	13.0	81.0
201609	822	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The unemployment rate has declined 0.1 percentage point, just 0.1 less of a decline than the Tealbook expected by now, so labor market conditions seem very close to our earlier projections.	13.0	81.0
201609	823	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	GDP growth has been below forecast for the first half of the year, but a significant portion of the slowdown is attributable to the inventory surprise, and that’s unlikely to persist.	13.0	81.0
201609	824	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The inventory swing, together with an upturn in nonresidential structures and continued strength in PCE, is likely to give us fourth-quarter GDP growth that’s close to but below 2 percent for this year.	13.0	81.0
201609	825	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	I wrote down 1.9 percent.	13.0	81.0
201609	826	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The median SEP forecast is 1.8 percent.	13.0	81.0
201609	827	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	It is about ½ percentage point lower than the median SEP forecast in December, but it’s well within the usual forecast uncertainty.	13.0	81.0
201609	828	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	With employment coming in close to expectations, the implication is that productivity growth has been lower than anticipated.	13.0	81.0
201609	829	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Core PCE inflation has been right in line with our December SEP forecasts.	13.0	81.0
201609	830	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The 12-month figure was 1.6 percent in July, equal to the median December projection for 2016 as a whole and up from 1.3 percent a year earlier.	13.0	81.0
201609	831	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The August CPI report is in line with that firming trend, causing the staff to increase the third-quarter core inflation forecast, and I expect that the 12-month figure is going to continue its gradual climb toward 2 percent.	13.0	81.0
201609	832	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Against the background of expectations of stable or somewhat increasing energy prices, this should bring headline PCE inflation closer to 2 percent as well.	13.0	81.0
201609	833	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	So the inflation outlook has not changed and remains in line with our expectations in December that inflation would gradually rise to our target.	13.0	81.0
201609	834	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Employment and core inflation are tracking quite close to what we expected as of December, but productivity growth is coming in low.	13.0	81.0
201609	835	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	In contrast, as illustrated in exhibit 4 of Elizabeth Klee’s presentation, the policy outlook is significantly different than it was in December.	13.0	81.0
201609	836	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Then, the median participant expected it to be appropriate to raise rates four times, so we probably would have been making our third increase of the year at this meeting, bringing the funds rate target above 1 percent.	13.0	81.0
201609	837	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	This gives rise to a question:  What explains the significant shift in our policy stance over that time frame despite little or no change in the outlook for employment or inflation?	13.0	81.0
201609	838	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Well, I mentioned that productivity growth has been lower than expected.	13.0	81.0
201609	839	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Monetary policy is unlikely to have much effect on productivity, though, and besides, our mandate is employment and inflation, not productivity or output.	13.0	81.0
201609	840	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	But, of course, lower steady-state productivity growth does imply a lower steady-state real interest rate and arguably would imply a lower value for the intercept term in a Taylor-type policy reaction rule.	13.0	81.0
201609	841	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	So, by how much should we revise our estimate of r* in response to the latest productivity numbers?	13.0	81.0
201609	842	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	This is analogous to how much we should think trend employment has fallen after seeing the May employment report.	13.0	81.0
201609	843	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Obviously, you wouldn’t think that the trend employment growth is 30,000 after seeing the May employment report; one uses a moving average of recent data.	13.0	81.0
201609	844	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	So the econometric methods of Lubik-Matthes and Laubach-Williams tell us quantitatively how much to take on board for r*, and the answer is, essentially, some, but not enough to rationalize where the funds rate is today.	13.0	81.0
201609	845	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Now, we have seen a series of flare-ups since the beginning of the year that seem to suggest heightened downside risks to the outlook:  global financial disturbances in January and February, a very weak employment report for May, and concerns about Brexit in June.	13.0	81.0
201609	846	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	As it turned out, the financial market tumult of the first quarter was mostly about Chinese economic growth concerns that have dissipated; the May payroll employment number was, as suspected, a fluke; and the Brexit vote turned out to have much smaller near-term implications for economic growth than feared for the United Kingdom and negligible implications for the United States.	13.0	81.0
201609	847	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	While holding off on a second rate increase may have been a prudent and reasonable choice in each case, it seems unlikely to have had much to do with how things turned out.	13.0	81.0
201609	848	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	It’s hard to argue that holding off raising the funds rate stabilized Chinese growth prospects, boosted the June employment report, or damped the real effects of the Brexit vote.	13.0	81.0
201609	849	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The data on employment and inflation are in line with what we expected in December, but there are no risk flare-ups in sight that might rationalize another delay.	13.0	81.0
201609	850	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Holding steady at this meeting would thus mark a substantial and persistent departure from the policy settings that would be expected, on the basis of our December projections or policy reaction functions characterizing our past behavior.	13.0	81.0
201609	851	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	This would appear to imply a distinct shift in our policy reaction function—that is, in how policy settings depend on the data.	13.0	81.0
201609	852	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	I plan to discuss this topic further in the next round.	13.0	81.0
201609	853	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13.0	65.0
201609	854	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201609	855	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	The tone and content of reports of my District contacts and directors in the most recent cycle were largely unchanged from the reports given before the July and June meetings.	13.0	88.0
201609	856	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Overall sentiment remains positive, with an outlook of continued, steady, moderate growth.	13.0	88.0
201609	857	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	If there was any difference this time around, comments were slightly more cautious in tone.	13.0	88.0
201609	858	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard some mention of uncertainty related to the upcoming election.	13.0	88.0
201609	859	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Reports on consumer spending were positive on balance.	13.0	88.0
201609	860	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Most retailers report solid sales levels and expect modestly higher sales for the remainder of 2016 compared with earlier this year.	13.0	88.0
201609	861	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	A minority of reports pointed to softening sales.	13.0	88.0
201609	862	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Auto sales were worthy of note.	13.0	88.0
201609	863	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Earlier cautionary reports on the sustainability of auto sales of our director who heads the country’s largest retailer seem to be accurate.	13.0	88.0
201609	864	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	He very clearly attributes some of the slowing to added caution of consumers ahead of the election.	13.0	88.0
201609	865	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	While firms tied to the oil and gas sector continue to report layoffs, many of our contacts remain in net hiring mode and report widespread wage pressure.	13.0	88.0
201609	866	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	And according to a number of reports, labor market tightening has deepened at various levels of the firm, with some weighting to low-skill, and broadened across a range of job types.	13.0	88.0
201609	867	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	These trends are confirmed by the elevated reading of the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker.	13.0	88.0
201609	868	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	In this cycle we repeated our practice of asking about pricing power of firms, and pricing power, to generalize, remains constrained.	13.0	88.0
201609	869	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	That said, margins seem to be holding steady for most contacts.	13.0	88.0
201609	870	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	At a more strategic level, we picked up a theme in this cycle of firms reevaluating business models to avoid expanding capacity.	13.0	88.0
201609	871	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard reports of efforts to leverage underutilized assets at capacity owned by other firms before moving forward with traditional growth-oriented investments.	13.0	88.0
201609	872	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	A major national rental car company is exploring the use of idle space in parking lots with valet service in lieu of building new rental facilities.	13.0	88.0
201609	873	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	As regards the third quarter, our tracking estimate as of this morning puts the quarter at just short of 3 percent annualized GDP growth, with real final sales growth around 2.3 percent.	13.0	88.0
201609	874	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	So I’m confident we’re experiencing meaningful acceleration after the weak first half.	13.0	88.0
201609	875	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	My forecast has not changed materially from June.	13.0	88.0
201609	876	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	My forecast anticipates continuation of moderate GDP growth around 2 percent for the forecast period.	13.0	88.0
201609	877	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	This marginally exceeds potential but is sufficient to absorb any remaining resource slack.	13.0	88.0
201609	878	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	In my forecast, I have an assumption of some acceleration of growth of business fixed investment.	13.0	88.0
201609	879	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	So far this year, we’ve heard little from District contacts that would support this assumption.	13.0	88.0
201609	880	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	The reasons for a cautious approach to capital spending are familiar—most notably, a reference to uncertainty.	13.0	88.0
201609	881	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	This cycle we did a survey of more than 200 CEOs, CFOs, and business owners and asked about uncertainty tied to the upcoming election.	13.0	88.0
201609	882	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Roughly one-third reported that uncertainty about election results is influencing their business decisions, and we took that number to be material.	13.0	88.0
201609	883	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	A failure of business investment to pick up after the election and through the forecast period is a downside risk to my outlook.	13.0	88.0
201609	884	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding our inflation objective, my forecast foresees a modest acceleration of inflation achieving the 2 percent target by year-end 2017.	13.0	88.0
201609	885	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	We read the August CPI report and its various cuts as consistent with this view.	13.0	88.0
201609	886	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	I see the risks to my outlook as being more balanced today than at the time of our June meeting, and I’m comfortable with describing the near-term outlook as “roughly balanced,” as in policy alternative B, or just “balanced,” as in alternative C.	13.0	88.0
201609	887	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201609	888	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	889	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13.0	65.0
201609	890	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	13.0	107.0
201609	891	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	The economy has seen welcome progress on some fronts in recent months, in part because of the prudent approach taken by the Committee and the corresponding supportive financial conditions.	13.0	107.0
201609	892	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent data on the labor market and aggregate spending suggest we are continuing to move toward full employment, but that progress is gradual.	13.0	107.0
201609	893	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	The labor market has continued to improve, with few indications of overheating and some signs that continued slack remains.	13.0	107.0
201609	894	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	So far this year, monthly job gains have averaged 180,000, below last year’s pace but still sufficient to reduce slack.	13.0	107.0
201609	895	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	The slowing pace of job gains has been associated with a flattening out in the unemployment rate over the past year, along with a heartening ½ percentage point increase in the prime-age labor force participation rate.	13.0	107.0
201609	896	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	These developments suggest that an improving job market has made joining or remaining in the labor force increasingly attractive and may imply the labor market has some room for further improvement.	13.0	107.0
201609	897	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Despite this improvement, the prime-age labor force participation rate remains about 1½ percentage points below its pre-crisis level.	13.0	107.0
201609	898	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	While it’s possible that this simply reflects ongoing pre-crisis trends, we cannot rule out the possibility that it reflects a lagged, and still incomplete, response to a very slow recovery in job opportunities and wages.	13.0	107.0
201609	899	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	The latter possibility is reinforced by the continued muted recovery in wage growth.	13.0	107.0
201609	900	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Although wage growth has picked up to about a 2½ percent pace in recent quarters, this is only modestly above that which prevailed over much of the recovery and well below growth rates seen before the crisis.	13.0	107.0
201609	901	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	This reinforces the point that uncertainty remains about how much slack is left.	13.0	107.0
201609	902	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	In the SEP, the projection regarding the longer-run rate of unemployment has come down significantly from a central tendency of 5.2 to 6.0 percent only four years ago to a median of 4.8 in the most recent SEP, well below the lower end of that previous range.	13.0	107.0
201609	903	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	We can’t rule out the possibility that estimates of the natural rate may move further lower.	13.0	107.0
201609	904	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	In the presence of uncertainty and in the absence of accelerating inflationary pressures, it would be unwise for policy to foreclose the possibility of making further gains in the labor market.	13.0	107.0
201609	905	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	With regard to aggregate spending, economic activity over the past three quarters has been disappointing, with growth in GDP and GDI each averaging less than 1 percent, a significant step-down from the same period in the previous year.	13.0	107.0
201609	906	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	However, recent data suggest a pickup in third-quarter output growth.	13.0	107.0
201609	907	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Although retail spending stalled in July and August following several strong months, I would expect continued job growth, buoyant sentiment, and rising household wealth to lead to consumption growth near 3 percent over the second half, about in line with the average pace of gains since the beginning of 2014.	13.0	107.0
201609	908	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	There are also some positive signs for investment.	13.0	107.0
201609	909	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Inventory investment, which edged lower last quarter, should step up over the second half of the year to a level more in line with continued moderate increases in final sales.	13.0	107.0
201609	910	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	The number of oil drilling rigs in operation has edged up in recent months after the previous sharp declines, and nonresidential building investment also appeared strong in the middle of the year, although the data are notoriously volatile and subject to revisions.	13.0	107.0
201609	911	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	However, other parts of the economy remain weak, likely still reflecting the large appreciation of the dollar since June 2014.	13.0	107.0
201609	912	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	The recent data on equipment investment continue to be quite tepid, manufacturing output remains flat, and real exports are a little more than 1 percent below their level a year ago.	13.0	107.0
201609	913	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Corporate profits fell close to 5 percent over the four quarters ending in the second quarter, and the housing sector, which provided important support to GDP growth last year, looks to be contracting in the middle of this year.	13.0	107.0
201609	914	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Thus, while I would expect economic growth to move up from its weak pace over the first half of the year, the persistent weakness in several key areas suggests that the pace will be moderate.	13.0	107.0
201609	915	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Progress on inflation has been mixed.	13.0	107.0
201609	916	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	While core inflation has increased from a year ago, we’re still some distance from our target, which is symmetric, and some measures of inflation expectations remain quite low.	13.0	107.0
201609	917	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	The recent data seem consistent with the staff’s projection that core PCE inflation would slow noticeably over the second half of this year.	13.0	107.0
201609	918	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	But on a 12-month basis, core PCE inflation is estimated to be 1.6 percent in August, which is an improvement over a year ago.	13.0	107.0
201609	919	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, core inflation has not yet convincingly broken out of the 1.4 to 1.6 percent range it has occupied for most of the past three years.	13.0	107.0
201609	920	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	The underperformance of core inflation relative to our target has been extremely persistent.	13.0	107.0
201609	921	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	If the staff projection for September is correct, core PCE inflation on a 12-month change basis will have been below 2 percent for all but four months out of the past eight years.	13.0	107.0
201609	922	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	I want to highlight this fact because it does seem important for our discussion of policy.	13.0	107.0
201609	923	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	With the stabilization of the dollar and oil prices, there is reason to expect inflation to rise.	13.0	107.0
201609	924	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	However, even putting aside the renewed dollar appreciation that would likely accompany further tightening, there are ample reasons to worry that the unwinding of these forces alone will not be sufficient to move core back to our target.	13.0	107.0
201609	925	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	First, recent research suggests the Phillips curve is quite flat.	13.0	107.0
201609	926	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Second, as I noted earlier, we may still be some distance from full employment.	13.0	107.0
201609	927	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	And, lastly, the persistently low level of survey-based inflation expectations and very weak readings on inflation compensation may indicate that inflation expectations have moved down in recent quarters.	13.0	107.0
201609	928	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Despite the recent increases in oil prices and stabilization of the dollar, 10-year inflation compensation is less than 1.5 percent, close to its historic low.	13.0	107.0
201609	929	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	At the same time, as everyone, I think, has noted, median 5-to-10-year inflation expectations in the Michigan survey matched its historical low of 2.5 percent in both August and the preliminary September reading.	13.0	107.0
201609	930	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	In view of the apparent weak relationship between levels of resource utilization and inflation and signs of downward pressure on inflation expectations, reaching our inflation target requires ensuring the US economy maintains sufficient positive momentum, especiallyin the broader international environment.	13.0	107.0
201609	931	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Let me close by briefly referring to the risks.	13.0	107.0
201609	932	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	We have been able to maintain positive momentum in the labor market so far this year despite some notable risk events, most recently Brexit, in part because of our prudent approach to monetary policy.	13.0	107.0
201609	933	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	However, important medium-term risks remain.	13.0	107.0
201609	934	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	In Europe, economic growth is slow and inflation is very low.	13.0	107.0
201609	935	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Low growth and a flat yield curve are contributing to reduced profitability and a high cost of equity financing for banks, which in turn could impair a key transmission channel of monetary policy in the euro area.	13.0	107.0
201609	936	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	A low-growth/low-inflation environment also makes progress on fiscal sustainability difficult and leaves countries with high debt-to-GDP levels very vulnerable.	13.0	107.0
201609	937	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Against this backdrop, uncertainty about the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union could damp business sentiment and investment in the period ahead.	13.0	107.0
201609	938	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Japan, as everyone has noted, remains greatly challenged by weak economic growth and low inflation.	13.0	107.0
201609	939	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	And it’s striking that despite active and creative monetary policies in both the euro area and Japan, inflation remains far below target.	13.0	107.0
201609	940	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	The experiences of these economies highlight the risk of becoming trapped in a low-growth, low-inflation, low-inflation-expectations environment and suggest that policy here should be oriented toward minimizing the risk of the United States slipping into such a situation.	13.0	107.0
201609	941	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Downside risks are also prominent in emerging markets, most notably China.	13.0	107.0
201609	942	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	As China has experienced very high growth in corporate debt, the downshift in economic growth that everyone anticipates could pose risks.	13.0	107.0
201609	943	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	And while Chinese authorities have made some progress on clarifying their policy stance and capital outflows have slowed in recent months, considerable uncertainty remains and further volatility cannot be ruled out, particularly if we were to see a notable strengthening of the dollar, which could lead to renewed fears of a larger exchange rate devaluation and capital outflow pressures.	13.0	107.0
201609	944	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent research suggests that changes in expectations regarding developments in other major economies—and I think Steve was referring to this earlier—relative to the United States and the associated policy responses lead to exchange rate movements that appear to be bigger than they were several years ago.	13.0	107.0
201609	945	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	These risks have implications for risk management in a low neutral rate environment, a subject we will return to tomorrow.	13.0	107.0
201609	946	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	107.0
201609	947	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	948	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13.0	65.0
201609	949	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201609	950	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I decided this time to do something slightly different than pore through the Tealbook to see whether I agreed with it or didn’t and just give a presentation from a less detailed viewpoint of what appears to be going on in the economy.	13.0	108.0
201609	951	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I’ll divide this into four unequal parts:  the labor market, inflation, economic growth, and tomorrow’s decision.	13.0	108.0
201609	952	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	First, the labor market.	13.0	108.0
201609	953	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Employment has been continuing to grow at a good pace, averaging 180,000 per month so far this year.	13.0	108.0
201609	954	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Calculations suggest that depending on the rate of labor force participation, it will take somewhere between 75,000 and 150,000 net new hires a month to keep the U-3 unemployment rate from rising.	13.0	108.0
201609	955	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Accordingly, the gloomy tone of the headlines about the 151,000 estimate of net new hires in August was not appropriate.	13.0	108.0
201609	956	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	One hears the concern that the U-3 unemployment rate has barely fallen over the course of the past 12 months, but over the same period, the participation rate has stopped falling.	13.0	108.0
201609	957	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I believe we should prefer the current labor market situation, in which people are being attracted back into the labor force while the unemployment rate remains constant, to a situation such as the one we faced in May, when the U-3 unemployment rate declined to 4.7 percent while the participation rate declined significantly.	13.0	108.0
201609	958	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	The rise in participation may reflect the effects of the modest pickup in wage growth we are now seeing, with the rate of increase of the employment cost index having risen from an annual rate of about 2 percent last year to around 2.5 percent this year.	13.0	108.0
201609	959	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Attention has also been drawn to the fact that the trend rate of new hires is declining, but that should not be a surprise as the labor market tightens.	13.0	108.0
201609	960	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Over the course of the past year, we have been concerned about the effects of a variety of negative shocks on the US economy, including the Chinese devaluation, market turbulence in the first six months of this year, the May pothole, Brexit, and more.	13.0	108.0
201609	961	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	But employment has resumed robust growth after each temporary slowdown.	13.0	108.0
201609	962	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	This has been, and continues to be, a powerful recovery, at least in terms of employment.	13.0	108.0
201609	963	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Let me turn now to the second part, inflation.	13.0	108.0
201609	964	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	We have not heard many complaints about the low rate of inflation from the general public.	13.0	108.0
201609	965	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	The 2 percent inflation target was set originally as a tradeoff between the many costs of positive inflation and the increased efficiency of reallocation in the labor market that a moderate rate of inflation makes possible.	13.0	108.0
201609	966	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I do not recall that the costs associated with a greater probability of being at the zero lower bound or the effective lower bound with a lower rate of inflation were taken into account at that time, which I think was the early and mid-’90s.	13.0	108.0
201609	967	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	The core rate of PCE inflation has been increasing since the middle of last year—slowly, to be sure—and is now close to our 2 percent target.	13.0	108.0
201609	968	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	In view of the imprecision of our estimates of the optimal rate of inflation, we should be happy to be as close as we are to the target we have chosen, particularly when the Phillips curve appears to be so flat.	13.0	108.0
201609	969	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	The CPI rate of core inflation has been above 2 percent and the rate of wage increase has been increasing, an indication that the Phillips curve lives, if not with the same vigor as in the past.	13.0	108.0
201609	970	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	But, on balance, I believe we are close to meeting our inflation target.	13.0	108.0
201609	971	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Let me discuss a few other aspects of the inflation target.	13.0	108.0
201609	972	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	One is the argument that because we set 2 percent as our target, that is the number we have to hit if we are to remain credible.	13.0	108.0
201609	973	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I give this argument some weight, though I do not believe we need to hit precisely 2 percent, but rather that some divergence should be permitted both above and below 2 percent.	13.0	108.0
201609	974	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Taking into account the confidence interval around the economic cost of diverging from the 2 percent target, which is wide, I believe it would have been better to define an optimal range for the inflation rate—for example, 1.5 to 2.5 percent—rather than a precise number.	13.0	108.0
201609	975	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	A final point on inflation.	13.0	108.0
201609	976	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	The jury is still out on whether there has been a permanent downward revision in the level of r*, something that’s extremely difficult to predict, both because the future is long and “permanent” is a long way off, and the standard deviation of r* is large, which is more relevant.	13.0	108.0
201609	977	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	However, as everyone knows, if r* remains low for a long time, monetary policy could be constrained by the ELB more frequently than in the past.	13.0	108.0
201609	978	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Should we, therefore, raise the target inflation rate, as many well-known economists have suggested?	13.0	108.0
201609	979	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Well, of course, the optimal rate of inflation is an area of active research and debate.	13.0	108.0
201609	980	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	But, actually, changing the target rate is a serious matter not to be entered into lightly.	13.0	108.0
201609	981	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	First, there are welfare costs to higher inflation, which kick in at a relatively low rate of inflation, especially in the form of indexation.	13.0	108.0
201609	982	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Further, there is the credibility cost of changing the target inflation rate, something that done once becomes a permanent credibility-reducing part of history.	13.0	108.0
201609	983	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	If such a step were nonetheless taken, it would be essential to include a formal mechanism for dealing with future changes in the target rate—for instance, the mechanism used by Canada in which the inflation target can, in principle, be reset every five years.	13.0	108.0
201609	984	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	So, on inflation, all this is to say that core PCE inflation is indeed approaching its target level, that real wages are rising at a more rapid rate than earlier in the post–Great Recession period, and that we need to think very hard before deciding to change the monetary framework to solve a problem that is likely to be solved within a year or two without changing the inflation target.	13.0	108.0
201609	985	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I will digress slightly into a discussion of economic growth, which will be short.	13.0	108.0
201609	986	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Each of us probably asks himself or herself, when wondering why people don’t like us, why our outstanding performance in the period since the fall of Lehman Brothers is so underappreciated.	13.0	108.0
201609	987	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I mean that.	13.0	108.0
201609	988	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I think the performance has been outstanding.	13.0	108.0
201609	989	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	The slow growth of the economy is due mainly to the extremely low rate of productivity growth, to which the low rate of physical investment contributes despite the near-zero short-term interest rate.	13.0	108.0
201609	990	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	But there’s not much we at the Federal Reserve can do that directly affects productivity growth except to maintain conditions conducive to investment and productivity growth by giving confidence to investors in the stability of the economy and the financial system and by continuing to support the excellent research on productivity growth of several of our economists.	13.0	108.0
201609	991	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Finally, the decision.	13.0	108.0
201609	992	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Our Committee has been justifiably cautious about raising the federal funds rate since 2009.	13.0	108.0
201609	993	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Two arguments have carried the day:  first, that we should not raise the rate because we could soon be forced to reduce it and return to the ZLB or ELB, thereby suffering a loss of credibility; and, second, that there’s very little difference between making the decision at this FOMC meeting rather than at a subsequent meeting.	13.0	108.0
201609	994	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	With regard to the credibility loss of having to return to the effective lower bound, there are also credibility costs to the extremely low frequency with which we have raised the interest rate since 2008.	13.0	108.0
201609	995	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	The argument I have just made is liable to be countered by the statement: “But it’s only because we kept the interest rate so low for so long that the US economy has performed so well since 2009.”	13.0	108.0
201609	996	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I’m sure that is right for a significant part of the period since 2009, but it remains to be shown that the performance of the economy would have been worse with an interest rate path 25 or 50 basis points above the path that was actually obtained during the past few years.	13.0	108.0
201609	997	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I’m aware that I’ve entered dangerous territory here, but it has been suggested that our superlow interest rates have encouraged financial transactions, particularly mergers and acquisitions, as much as they have encouraged physical investment.	13.0	108.0
201609	998	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	We’ve been sending a message to everyone in the economy that says the US economy is still weak and requires the support of superlow interest rates to grow, even at the moderate 2 percent rate to which we have all gradually become accustomed.	13.0	108.0
201609	999	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I do not believe that to be the case, and I do believe that we should very soon take the second step on our gradual path away from the ELB and toward interest rate normalization.	13.0	108.0
201609	1000	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Now, this is the less technical version.	13.0	108.0
201609	1001	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	For the technical version, I suggest you read again the presentation by President Rosengren in his remarks that opened this discussion.	13.0	108.0
201609	1002	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	13.0	108.0
201609	1003	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201609	1004	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest we take a coffee break—how about 25 minutes.	52.0	65.0
201609	1005	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	We will return at 5 minutes to 4:00.	52.0	65.0
201609	1007	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	52.0	65.0
201609	1008	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we continue our go-round with President Mester.	13.0	65.0
201609	1009	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201609	1010	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Overall, economic conditions in the Fourth District softened a bit in August.	13.0	999.0
201609	1011	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The Bank’s diffusion index of business contacts reporting better versus worse conditions declined to minus 4 from plus 18 at the time of our previous meeting.	13.0	999.0
201609	1012	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	This is the only negative reading in the index this year.	13.0	999.0
201609	1013	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	It dipped to become negative late last year as well, so it’s too soon to read too much into it at this point.	13.0	999.0
201609	1014	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	By sector, construction, freight, and banking continue to show positive readings.	13.0	999.0
201609	1015	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Energy was stable, and manufacturing and retail showed negative readings.	13.0	999.0
201609	1016	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Some District manufacturers and commercial construction firms reported that they put some planned investments on temporary hold.	13.0	999.0
201609	1017	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	In contrast, consumers in the District appear to be more optimistic.	13.0	999.0
201609	1018	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Delinquency rates across most consumer borrowing categories are down, and home prices and incomes are rising, all of which are supporting higher levels of consumer lending than we have seen for some time.	13.0	999.0
201609	1019	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Labor market conditions in the District remain healthy.	13.0	999.0
201609	1020	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	As of July, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland staff estimates that year-over-year growth in District payrolls was 1 percent, and the District’s unemployment rate remained low and stable at 5 percent.	13.0	999.0
201609	1021	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Anecdotal reports suggest District firms continue to add workers.	13.0	999.0
201609	1022	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	As was true last time, nearly all District sectors reported some upward pressure on wages, and the diffusion index of those reporting increases versus decreases has risen over the year.	13.0	999.0
201609	1023	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	District firms report that pressure on nonlabor input costs are rising this year as well.	13.0	999.0
201609	1024	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland Fed’s diffusion index of nonlabor costs, which was flat to negative last year, has steadily risen this year to more than 20.	13.0	999.0
201609	1025	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Prices received have also been generally moving up since the beginning of the year.	13.0	999.0
201609	1026	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Some manufacturers have told us that they have raised their finished good prices in recent weeks in response to higher steel prices.	13.0	999.0
201609	1027	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Construction companies have been reporting raising prices for some time either to cover rising import costs or in response to strong demand.	13.0	999.0
201609	1028	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	As far as the national economy is concerned, second-quarter GDP growth came in weaker than anticipated, with much of the drag reflecting weaker inventory investment.	13.0	999.0
201609	1029	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Although GDP growth was subdued in the first half of the year, incoming economic information summarized in the nowcasts suggests that growth will strengthen in the second half of the year, as the drag due to inventories wanes and consumer spending, buoyed by strength in labor markets and personal income growth, remains solid.	13.0	999.0
201609	1030	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Housing continues to improve at a gradual pace.	13.0	999.0
201609	1031	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The trouble spot continues to be weak business investment spending, but financial conditions, including low corporate bond spreads and stability in oil prices, are supportive of a coming pickup in investment.	13.0	999.0
201609	1032	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The July and August employment reports confirm continued solid performance in the labor market.	13.0	999.0
201609	1033	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Monthly payroll job gains have averaged 182,000 this year.	13.0	999.0
201609	1034	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Although this is down from last year’s average monthly pace of 229,000, it is well above current estimates of the pace of job growth consistent with estimated trends in output growth and the labor force participation rate.	13.0	999.0
201609	1035	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The Board staff estimates that range of job growth at 85,000 to 115,000 per month.	13.0	999.0
201609	1036	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Other estimates put it at 75,000 to 120,000 or even lower.	13.0	999.0
201609	1037	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The unemployment rate has been roughly stable around my estimate of its longer-run rate.	13.0	999.0
201609	1038	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	It and most of the other labor market indicators suggest to me that we are basically at full employment from the standpoint of what monetary policy can effectively address, and that labor market conditions will remain healthy.	13.0	999.0
201609	1039	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	We have seen some acceleration in wages, but productivity growth has been weaker than in earlier expansions.	13.0	999.0
201609	1040	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	If weak productivity growth persists, then it seems unlikely that wage growth will return to the pre-recession pace.	13.0	999.0
201609	1041	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Overall, my outlook for the US economy over the medium run is little changed since our previous meeting.	13.0	999.0
201609	1042	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I made relatively minor changes to my SEP forecasts of GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation since my SEP submission in June.	13.0	999.0
201609	1043	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	In response to the weak first-half data, I marked down my GDP growth forecast a tad for 2016 and less so for 2017.	13.0	999.0
201609	1044	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I continue to see the fundamentals, including accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions, improved household balance sheets, the strong labor market, and low and stable oil prices, as supportive of continued growth at the pace at or slightly above trend, which I put at 2 percent over the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201609	1045	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	This pace is sufficient to put downward pressure on the unemployment rate, which falls below my longer-run rate over the next two years before returning to my longer-run rate of 5 percent by the end of 2019.	13.0	999.0
201609	1046	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	My undershooting of the longer-run unemployment rate is less than in the Tealbook.	13.0	999.0
201609	1047	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I continue to anticipate that inflation will rise gradually toward our goal of 2 percent over the next couple of years.	13.0	999.0
201609	1048	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The trajectory of both headline and core inflation over the past year is consistent with this forecast.	13.0	999.0
201609	1049	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Headline PCE inflation has risen as the effects of the earlier declines in oil prices and appreciation of the dollar have passed through.	13.0	999.0
201609	1050	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Measured year-over- year, core PCE inflation and trimmed mean PCE inflation are 1.6 percent, which is near the goal.	13.0	999.0
201609	1051	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Other measures of underlying inflation, like core CPI and median CPI, have picked up to levels of more than 2 percent.	13.0	999.0
201609	1052	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland Federal Reserve median CPI measure has been above 2¼ percent all year and at or above 2½ percent for the past four months.	13.0	999.0
201609	1053	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Long-term inflation expectations from the Survey of Professional Forecasters and the Cleveland Federal Reserve 10-year and 5-year, 5-year-forward measures have been stable.	13.0	999.0
201609	1054	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The New York Fed’s measure of consumer inflation expectations two years ahead has moved up and down from month to month this year, averaging around 2.6 percent over the year to date.	13.0	999.0
201609	1055	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The University of Michigan survey measure of inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years has been trending down since 2013.	13.0	999.0
201609	1056	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Cleveland Federal Reserve staff’s analysis of the microdata underlying the survey indicates that over that time period, the numbers of respondents reporting expected inflation rates at 5 percent and at 10 percent have fallen.	13.0	999.0
201609	1057	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	It’s not clear whether this change in the distribution accounts for the downward trend in the median, which would be less susceptible to outliers than the mean would be.	13.0	999.0
201609	1058	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	So while the downward movement in the Michigan survey bears watching and further investigation, at this point I view longer-run inflation expectations as reasonably stable.	13.0	999.0
201609	1059	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	This, along with output growth at or slightly above trend and continued strength in the labor market, suggests that inflation is on a path of gradually returning to our 2 percent goal over the next couple of years, which is sooner than in the Tealbook forecast.	13.0	999.0
201609	1060	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I see the risks associated with my forecast as broadly balanced.	13.0	999.0
201609	1061	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Economic growth abroad and US investment spending could be weaker than I have assumed, but accommodative financial conditions could lead to stronger growth than I am anticipating.	13.0	999.0
201609	1062	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Inflation could remain below our target for longer than I have assumed, but accommodative monetary policy could lead to stronger price pressures.	13.0	999.0
201609	1063	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Risks to financial stability from very low interest rates appear to be contained, but a failure to implement a gradual rise in interest rates will increase these risks.	13.0	999.0
201609	1064	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I continue to project that a gradual upward path of interest rates over the forecast horizon will be appropriate.	13.0	999.0
201609	1065	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	On the basis of the evidence of how economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation have been evolving and the continued low estimates of the equilibrium real rate, I have revised down my estimate of the longer-run federal funds rate 25 basis points to 3 percent.	13.0	999.0
201609	1066	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I want to acknowledge that there is a wide confidence band around this estimate and that my 25 basis point reduction isn’t statistically significant.	13.0	999.0
201609	1067	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	But this revised estimate, coupled with my slightly weaker economic growth forecast, has led me to project a funds rate path that is 25 to 50 basis points more shallow over the forecast horizon than in my June projection.	13.0	999.0
201609	1068	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201609	1069	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	1070	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13.0	65.0
201609	1071	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201609	1072	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Anecdotal and aggregate statistical information received during the intermeeting period remains consistent with the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis’s new regime-based view of near-term macroeconomic outlook and monetary policy.	13.0	94.0
201609	1073	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Our view emphasizes a forecast that places real GDP growth at about 2 percent over the forecast horizon, with inflation also at about 2 percent.	13.0	94.0
201609	1074	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Unlike the Tealbook, we do not regard 2 percent real GDP growth as being meaningfully above trend.	13.0	94.0
201609	1075	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Consequently, we also expect relatively little change in the unemployment rate over the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201609	1076	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We think end-of- year unemployment rates will remain centered on 4.7 percent.	13.0	94.0
201609	1077	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We see optimal monetary policy as being regime dependent.	13.0	94.0
201609	1078	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Under the current regime, we see the current setting of the policy rate as being just slightly below neutral.	13.0	94.0
201609	1079	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We think there is a case to be made to move the policy rate to the regime-neutral value at some point.	13.0	94.0
201609	1080	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	However, unless there is a switch in regime, we think it is unwise to give the impression, as the Tealbook does and perhaps the dot plot does, that the Committee is on the precipice of a 275 basis point move in the policy rate over the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201609	1081	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Instead, we should acknowledge that, on the basis of the information we have today, we do not expect much different to happen over the next several years, and, therefore, we do not need to forecast a major move in the policy rate.	13.0	94.0
201609	1082	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	At the heart of the St Louis Federal Reserve view is that real GDP growth has been slow and is not expected to meaningfully accelerate.	13.0	94.0
201609	1083	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	The annualized real GDP growth rates for the past three quarters are 0.9 percent, 0.8 percent, and 1.1 percent, averaging about 1 percent, well below even pessimistic estimates of the potential real GDP growth rate.	13.0	94.0
201609	1084	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Although growth looks set to accelerate in the second half of 2016, all this will do if it materializes is bring the real GDP growth rate for all of 2016 somewhat closer to, but less than, 2 percent.	13.0	94.0
201609	1085	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Any acceleration from there into 2017 is likely to be modest and is, in my mind, a speculative guess.	13.0	94.0
201609	1086	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I think it strains credulity to suggest that eight years after the Committee moved the policy rate close to zero, there is still any meaningful cyclical dynamic that would push the real output growth rate above potential in a statistically significant way.	13.0	94.0
201609	1087	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	A better way to think about the current situation is to accept that the current real output growth rate is slow and likely not too different from the potential growth rate.	13.0	94.0
201609	1088	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	The corollary is that the unemployment rate is likely to remain in the 4½ to 5 percent range as long as we remain in the current regime.	13.0	94.0
201609	1089	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	This is what happened during 2006 and 2007, a period that was arguably characterized by stronger GDP growth—due in part to the housing bubble, to be sure—than what we are witnessing today.	13.0	94.0
201609	1090	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Inflation has been running somewhat below 2 percent according to PCE-based measures, with CPI-based measures somewhat higher.	13.0	94.0
201609	1091	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We think an inflation forecast centered on 2 percent over the forecast horizon is reasonable.	13.0	94.0
201609	1092	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I was encouraged, in reaching this forecast, by page 22 of Tealbook A, which gives the staff forecast of headline PCE inflation, core PCE inflation, and core CPI inflation in graphical format with 70 percent confidence intervals.	13.0	94.0
201609	1093	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I think it is reasonable to interpret these figures as illustrating forecasts essentially centered at 2 percent over the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201609	1094	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I do remain concerned that market-based measures of inflation expectations remain too low to be consistent with the 2 percent inflation forecast.	13.0	94.0
201609	1095	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	This is a risk to the outlook that I have described.	13.0	94.0
201609	1096	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Output growing at its potential rate, unemployment essentially unchanging, and inflation expected to hit 2 percent sounds like a steady state.	13.0	94.0
201609	1097	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	However, the regime-switching conceptualization acknowledges that this situation can and will change at some point in the future.	13.0	94.0
201609	1098	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	The most likely candidates for a switch in regime are, one, faster productivity growth and, two, an abating of the very large liquidity premium on short-term government debt.	13.0	94.0
201609	1099	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Both of these possibilities would suggest upside risk to the St Louis Federal Reserve’s policy rate forecast.	13.0	94.0
201609	1100	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	However, as of today, I see little evidence that a switch is occurring on either of these dimensions.	13.0	94.0
201609	1101	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Accordingly, we continue to assume we are in a low-growth regime, driven in part by low productivity growth, as well as in a regime characterized by very low real rates of return on short-term government debt, the so-called r†.	13.0	94.0
201609	1102	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	This, in turn, leads us to project a very flat policy rate path over the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201609	1103	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201609	1104	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201609	1105	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	13.0	65.0
201609	1106	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201609	1107	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Overall economic activity in the Third District has been somewhat sluggish over the intermeeting period.	13.0	999.0
201609	1108	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Job growth continues to lag the nation, with employment growing a mere 0.7 percent in July, less than half that of the nation.	13.0	999.0
201609	1109	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	And the unemployment rate ticked up another 0.1 percentage point to 5.4 percent.	13.0	999.0
201609	1110	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	In part, the increase in unemployment is due to a stronger rebound in labor force participation than one sees nationally.	13.0	999.0
201609	1111	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Additionally, the sharp contraction in mining and drilling in the Marcellus shale region was responsible for much of the weaker job growth in the region.	13.0	999.0
201609	1112	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	And to give you some sense of the sharpness of that contraction, the number of active wells in Pennsylvania has gone over the past few years from more than 4,600 to around 200 today.	13.0	999.0
201609	1113	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Manufacturing has picked up a bit, with the general activity index in our Business Outlook Survey now in positive territory.	13.0	999.0
201609	1114	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	At 12.8, the September index is slightly above its nonrecessionary average.	13.0	999.0
201609	1115	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	The new orders index eked into positive territory as well, but shipments contracted and, although employment improved substantially, that index remained in negative territory.	13.0	999.0
201609	1116	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Survey respondents remain upbeat, with all of the forward-looking indexes showing substantial optimism.	13.0	999.0
201609	1117	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	In a series of special questions, we attempted to gauge the future capital spending plans of manufacturers in the region.	13.0	999.0
201609	1118	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	A vast majority indicated that they primarily intended to modernize existing manufacturing processes, while only one-third indicated they intended to expand facilities.	13.0	999.0
201609	1119	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Very few, roughly 17 percent, indicated that they were looking to grow through acquisition.	13.0	999.0
201609	1120	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Further, modernization has taken on increasing importance in firm planning, with roughly 60 percent of firms indicating that it was now more important to them than it had been over the past five years.	13.0	999.0
201609	1121	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Some reasons cited for this shift in priorities were increases in labor costs due to government mandates such as the ACA and the need or desire to replace labor with robotics and automation.	13.0	999.0
201609	1122	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Thus, there was not much in the responses to indicate why we have been seeing such very weak investment numbers at the national level.	13.0	999.0
201609	1123	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	But this type of investment activity may lead to better productivity numbers down the road.	13.0	999.0
201609	1124	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	At my recent board of directors meeting, the board of directors, on the other hand, expressed unanimous sentiment that policy uncertainty is weighing on capital expenditure plans.	13.0	999.0
201609	1125	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	As one director phrased it, “The data are positive.	13.0	999.0
201609	1126	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	It’s the psychology that’s driving caution.”	13.0	999.0
201609	1127	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	The FOMC is also viewed as contributing to that uncertainty.	13.0	999.0
201609	1128	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	A lack of confidence to raise rates is causing business leaders to wonder what the FOMC is seeing that they are not.	13.0	999.0
201609	1129	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	That is not to say that policy is not being conducted systematically.	13.0	999.0
201609	1130	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	I think there is a lot of coherence to our deliberations.	13.0	999.0
201609	1131	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	But the view around my boardroom seems to indicate the existence of communications challenges that we as a Committee may not be fully addressing.	13.0	999.0
201609	1132	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Another director characterized the climate as one of “caution, caution, caution.”	13.0	999.0
201609	1133	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Thus, the opinions of my directors appear consistent with what we’re seeing in the investment data.	13.0	999.0
201609	1134	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Regarding the labor market, we are hearing a rising crescendo of complaints regarding the inability to fill high-skilled positions, which is consistent with the growing gap between the job openings rate and the hiring rate in the JOLTS data.	13.0	999.0
201609	1135	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	We are also hearing instances of fairly aggressive nominal wage growth as well.	13.0	999.0
201609	1136	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	For example, a local hospital has just raised wages for its nursing staff 9 percent and is considering additional increases.	13.0	999.0
201609	1137	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	A few other areas in the District are doing well.	13.0	999.0
201609	1138	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	One such area is construction, in which we are seeing fairly strong growth.	13.0	999.0
201609	1139	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Although the value of permits has recently declined, the value of contracts remains at a high level, and nonresidential construction in the District continues to outpace that of the nation.	13.0	999.0
201609	1140	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	The trend in the mix of new housing construction in the District has also gravitated toward a greater share of multifamily units.	13.0	999.0
201609	1141	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	That may be the cause for an interesting behavioral element that one of my directors, who has an interest in an organic pet food company, pointed out—namely, that there has been a shift in dog ownership preferences to smaller dogs.	13.0	999.0
201609	1142	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Perhaps baby boomers and millennials find smaller dogs more conducive to an urban lifestyle.	13.0	999.0
201609	1143	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	But related to being a dog owner, one of my other directors brought up the following.	13.0	999.0
201609	1144	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	There has been an interesting innovation in the fintech community.	13.0	999.0
201609	1145	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	A company called Wags Lending has pioneered a financial contract that provides for leasing with an option of buying a dog.	13.0	999.0
201609	1146	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	He estimates that we should see a drop in the dog unemployment rate we commonly refer to as the “U-canine.”	13.0	999.0
201609	1147	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Sorry, I had to do that.	13.0	999.0
201609	1148	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	[Laughter]	13.0	999.0
201609	1149	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Regarding Third District consumers, the pace of activity has diminished somewhat, which was reflected in the general activity index in our nonmanufacturing survey.	13.0	999.0
201609	1150	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	It fell to slightly below its nonrecessionary average.	13.0	999.0
201609	1151	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	However, in our District, auto sales continue to be brisk and consumers remain optimistic.	13.0	999.0
201609	1152	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Overall, the Third District is seeing and should continue to see steady if unspectacular growth, and contacts remain upbeat about the future.	13.0	999.0
201609	1153	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	For the nation as a whole, I, like many of you, anticipate a solid bounceback in economic activity this quarter, with a gradual return to trend growth over the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201609	1154	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Thus, my economic projections are not much different from those of the staff, although I see inflation returning to trend at a bit brisker pace.	13.0	999.0
201609	1155	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Much of the near-term acceleration activity is driven by strong consumption growth and by a bounceback in inventories.	13.0	999.0
201609	1156	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	I believe that economic fundamentals are in line with this view, as income growth has been solid and balance sheets remain healthy.	13.0	999.0
201609	1157	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Thus, I see 1.8 percent GDP growth for this year, 2.3 percent growth in 2017, and a return to trend-like growth over the rest of the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201609	1158	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	My main concern is the low productivity growth that we’ve experienced of late.	13.0	999.0
201609	1159	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	The recovery will look increasingly fragile if productivity growth does not strengthened.	13.0	999.0
201609	1160	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Regarding unemployment, I envision job growth will gradually taper to a rate consistent with the constant rate of unemployment, but my projections of the unemployment rate do somewhat undershoot that level, falling to 4.4 percent in 2017 before beginning to rise very gradually.	13.0	999.0
201609	1161	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	And with respect to inflation, I continue to anticipate a gradual return to target, with the return achieved perhaps as early as the beginning of 2018.	13.0	999.0
201609	1162	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	With that projection in hand, I see a gradual rise in the funds rate as appropriate with the funds rate slightly exceeding its long-run value of 3 percent in 2019.	13.0	999.0
201609	1163	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	My somewhat optimistic outlook will inform my views on policy tomorrow.	13.0	999.0
201609	1164	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201609	1165	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	1166	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	13.0	65.0
201609	1167	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201609	1168	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I’ll start with a discussion of the District, and I’ll begin with energy.	13.0	110.0
201609	1169	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Our view on energy, despite recent price volatility, is basically the same as it was at the previous FOMC meeting.	13.0	110.0
201609	1170	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	We continue to believe that global supply and demand will move into balance sometime during the first half of 2017, and that global oil inventories will begin to climb in the third quarter of 2017.	13.0	110.0
201609	1171	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Some observers, particularly recently, see this process taking six months longer, but we continue to expect that daily demand will increase approximately 1.3 million barrels per day in 2016 and 2017 and that this growth in demand, along with a slowing trajectory of growth in global supply—which includes significant cuts in the United States—should ultimately lead to balance.	13.0	110.0
201609	1172	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	We expect continued price volatility, though, during the intervening period, but we expect the overall trend in prices to be one of firming as we move toward balance.	13.0	110.0
201609	1173	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Several factors apprear to have contributed to the recent price volatility.	13.0	110.0
201609	1174	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	First, refinery margins are very volatile, and they can influence the level of gasoline inventories.	13.0	110.0
201609	1175	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Our view is that market participants may, in some cases, have overread the implications of excess gasoline inventories for oil supply.	13.0	110.0
201609	1176	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	We prefer to focus on global oil supply and demand as more essential.	13.0	110.0
201609	1177	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Second, there’s been talk from Russia and OPEC members about a production freeze.	13.0	110.0
201609	1178	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	We continue to believe, on the basis of conversations we have had with our contacts, that a freeze is unlikely, but the talk about this has probably had some positive effects on prices over the past couple of months.	13.0	110.0
201609	1179	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	And, third, there have been outages, which we’ve mentioned before, in Nigeria, Libya, Canada, Iraq, and other nations, which appear to have caused trading participants at times to be unduly optimistic about the timing of supply–demand balance.	13.0	110.0
201609	1180	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	It’s our view that most of these outages are going to be restored, although Nigeria and Libya will persist for some time.	13.0	110.0
201609	1181	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	So with all of this, the rig count in Texas is starting to build, albeit very gradually, and we think that expansion will only accelerate if prices rise to between $50 and $60 a barrel, and we’re not there yet.	13.0	110.0
201609	1182	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Even in the Permian, the breakeven is above $50 a barrel.	13.0	110.0
201609	1183	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Certainly on many long-lived projects, the breakeven is much higher, and we are a considerable period of time away from significant investment in those.	13.0	110.0
201609	1184	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	We continue to believe there will be more bankruptcies, mergers, and restructurings in this sector, in view of the existence of several highly leveraged companies as well as the fact that breakeven levels for shale in the Permian Basin are well in excess of $50 a barrel.	13.0	110.0
201609	1185	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Overall, though, we think the energy sector will only be a modest headwind for our District for the remainder of 2016 as opposed to being the significant headwind that it was in the first half of the year.	13.0	110.0
201609	1186	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	In connection with that point, employment growth in the state of Texas was flat for the first six months of 2016.	13.0	110.0
201609	1187	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	We think the second half of 2016 is looking considerably brighter, and we’re expecting approximately 2 percent job growth for the last half of the year.	13.0	110.0
201609	1188	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	And our forecast now is for 2 percent job growth during 2017.	13.0	110.0
201609	1189	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Texas continues to benefit from significant continued migration of people and firms to the state, and we expect this trend to continue in 2017.	13.0	110.0
201609	1190	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	For the nation, my projections regarding the US economy in the latest SEP round are strongly influenced by analysis recently conducted at the Dallas Federal Reserve and around the Federal Reserve System, which suggests that the economy’s real growth potential is only about 1¾ percent or lower,in light of demographic and productivity trends, and that the longer-run normal federal funds rate is certainly lower than it has been previously.	13.0	110.0
201609	1191	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	In response, I’ve lowered my projected path of both GDP growth and the funds rate.	13.0	110.0
201609	1192	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	We’re participant number 12, by the way, in the dot plot.	13.0	110.0
201609	1193	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I’ve not materially changed my projections regarding unemployment or inflation.	13.0	110.0
201609	1194	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	We continue to forecast that, under appropriate policy, the unemployment rate will fall modestly from its current level, and we continue to believe that this drop in unemployment will be accompanied by some level of improved nominal wage growth.	13.0	110.0
201609	1195	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	The Dallas trimmed mean PCE inflation rate has been running between 1.6 and 1.7 percent for the past year and a half.	13.0	110.0
201609	1196	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Imbedded in this rate is a historically muted level of health- care inflation, and we’ve been talking more recently at our bank about whether this muted level of health-care inflation is likely to persist.	13.0	110.0
201609	1197	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Overall, these numbers give us confidence that we will gradually move toward our 2 percent objective in the medium term.	13.0	110.0
201609	1198	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	A word about the recent ISM surveys, which have been weak.	13.0	110.0
201609	1199	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	We prefer to look at the three-month moving averages of both the nonmanufacturing and the manufacturing surveys.	13.0	110.0
201609	1200	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Both have held steady on a three-month moving average basis.	13.0	110.0
201609	1201	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	In addition, the NFIB small business survey for August, initial unemployment insurance claims, and various surveys of consumer attitudes tell us that we are not seeing a deterioration in the outlook.	13.0	110.0
201609	1202	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Let me just briefly comment on our discussion with contacts in our District about business investment.	13.0	110.0
201609	1203	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	We also see, as many of you do, business leaders continuing to be cautious about hiring plans and capacity expansion.	13.0	110.0
201609	1204	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Apart from the obvious effect of lower oil prices on energy cap-ex, we also see business cap-ex being held back by sluggish global demand, high rates of industry disruption, challenging levels of regulatory requirements, and one more factor, a rise in shareholder activism, which has shortened time horizons for CEOs and their boards of directors.	13.0	110.0
201609	1205	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	CEO tenures in this country are shorter.	13.0	110.0
201609	1206	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Investment time frames are shorter.	13.0	110.0
201609	1207	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Activism is on the rise.	13.0	110.0
201609	1208	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Investor patience is as short as at any time in my career, and the threat of fund redemptions is as high as I’ve ever seen it because investors are searching, and in some cases desperately searching, for adequate return.	13.0	110.0
201609	1209	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	All of this makes capital spending, which pays off with lags of 5 to 10 years or more, much tougher to justify versus share repurchase and dividend increases.	13.0	110.0
201609	1210	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I don’t see this changing materially in the months and years ahead unless there are changes to business incentives for capital spending.	13.0	110.0
201609	1211	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	One other comment outside the United States.	13.0	110.0
201609	1212	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	A team from the Dallas Federal Reserve visited Beijing and Shanghai in August.	13.0	110.0
201609	1213	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I know a number of others around this table also visited China in the past two months.	13.0	110.0
201609	1214	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	This trip confirmed our analysis regarding high levels of overcapacity, growing levels of debt to GDP—particularly to support an economic growth rate of 6½ percent, which we think is artificially elevated—the challenges of an aging workforce, and the challenges of a transition to a more consumer-service oriented economy.	13.0	110.0
201609	1215	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	It is clear, on the basis of our discussions throughout that country, that currency controls have been dramatically tightened to reduce outflows and that nonperforming loans are likely closer to $2 trillion than $1 trillion.	13.0	110.0
201609	1216	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	These issues, though, are mitigated by the fact that most of these loans have been made by government-owned entities to government-controlled entities, and China has shown an ability to keep the need for external capital to a relatively modest level.	13.0	110.0
201609	1217	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	So the trip reinforced our view that while non-performing loans  are building, China can manage them because of the internal nature of its debt problem.	13.0	110.0
201609	1218	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	There’s a question about how effective the currency controls are going to be and whether they’re going to be able to bind things the way they have, even with the recent deterioration in the currency.	13.0	110.0
201609	1219	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	As the private sector continues to grow in China, the country hopes to steadily reduce its reliance on state-owned enterprises, but there’s no question that the challenges faced by China are unlikely to be resolved in quarters or years—it’s more likely to take decades.	13.0	110.0
201609	1220	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	And in the meantime, we believe that the world is certainly going to have to become accustomed to lower levels of Chinese GDP growth and may suffer periodic bouts of financial instability in the same manner that we saw in January and February.	13.0	110.0
201609	1221	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201609	1222	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	1223	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13.0	65.0
201609	1224	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201609	1225	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Before I dive into my laboriously prepared and scripted report, I need to prepare everyone for a euphemism I will use about halfway through my remarks.	13.0	91.0
201609	1226	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	The quickest explanation is the following example of a backyard family conversation: “Mommy, what did Daddy say just now when he hit his thumb with the hammer?”	13.0	91.0
201609	1227	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	“ ‘Shirt,’ dear.	13.0	91.0
201609	1228	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Daddy said, ‘Shirt.’ ”	13.0	91.0
201609	1229	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	13.0	91.0
201609	1230	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	All right.	13.0	91.0
201609	1231	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	With this modest preamble, I will try to avoid reading from the Governor Rick Mishkin playbook.	13.0	91.0
201609	1232	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	13.0	91.0
201609	1233	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Now, the reports from my directors and other business contacts were quite similar to those in the previous round.	13.0	91.0
201609	1234	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	On balance, the mixed tone of the commentary continues to feel consistent with the 1 to 2 percent GDP growth rates we’ve seen over the past year.	13.0	91.0
201609	1235	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	As we’ve been hearing for some time, consumer-facing businesses are holding up well.	13.0	91.0
201609	1236	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	In Chicago, we also heard some encouraging news about nonresidential construction and the labor market serving these projects.	13.0	91.0
201609	1237	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	My labor union director, who heads the Chicago Federation of Labor, reported that several new large building projects are luring workers out of retirement and justifying the expansion of sorely needed apprenticeship programs.	13.0	91.0
201609	1238	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	However, local stories like these are tempered by other national contacts who are less sanguine about construction for the United States as a whole.	13.0	91.0
201609	1239	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Furthermore, many non-consumer-facing businesses, especially in manufacturing, face lingering challenges.	13.0	91.0
201609	1240	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Our steel contacts note that mills are reducing capacity in response to falling demand.	13.0	91.0
201609	1241	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	A director who formerly headed a nationwide trucking company reported that the freight industry no longer needs to expand capacity.	13.0	91.0
201609	1242	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	The demand for new heavy trucks has fallen sharply, and the industry is no longer facing a significant shortage of drivers.	13.0	91.0
201609	1243	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	With regard to the international situation, several contacts reported that their global sales are improving, but in many countries these gains are just coming off the bottom, and they still see the level of demand as relatively weak and the outlook as highly uncertain.	13.0	91.0
201609	1244	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	On the financial front, regulatory changes have increased some short-term borrowing costs, but my contacts said that longer-term debt markets continue to be highly receptive to investment-grade issuers.	13.0	91.0
201609	1245	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I heard contrasting stories about risk-taking.	13.0	91.0
201609	1246	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	My director from Discover Financial noted some stretch-for-yield activities.	13.0	91.0
201609	1247	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Some of his credit card competitors are increasing card issuance to households further down the credit spectrum and luring customers with overly generous rewards programs.	13.0	91.0
201609	1248	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	He thinks they will be unprofitable.	13.0	91.0
201609	1249	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	In contrast, several contacts mentioned increased equity in commercial real estate markets.	13.0	91.0
201609	1250	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	One report characterized a type of deal that last year would have been written at 35 percent equity and 65 percent debt.	13.0	91.0
201609	1251	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Now, similar deals are being struck at a 50–50 split, so there’s a noticeable shift to more equity and less debt.	13.0	91.0
201609	1252	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	In addition, this report cited tougher recourse provisions in these transactions.	13.0	91.0
201609	1253	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	We heard that private equity deals were also being structured with somewhat less leverage.	13.0	91.0
201609	1254	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	The loans are still often covenant-lite, but the borrowers now have more skin in the game.	13.0	91.0
201609	1255	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Turning to our economic growth outlook—and, by the way, we are number 11 in the SEP—we expect increased inventory accumulation and some pickup in business fixed investment.	13.0	91.0
201609	1256	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	These factors will lift real GDP growth to around a 2¾ percent annual rate during the second half of this year.	13.0	91.0
201609	1257	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	In 2017 and 2018, we see GDP growth averaging just over 2 percent, roughly similar to the Tealbook.	13.0	91.0
201609	1258	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	We do differ with the Tealbook, however, on the degree of slack we see in the economy.	13.0	91.0
201609	1259	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	For 2016, we estimate the natural rate of unemployment to be 4.7 percent.	13.0	91.0
201609	1260	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	We also think the labor force participation rate is still a little below trend.	13.0	91.0
201609	1261	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	These observations and others from wages indicate that some slack remains in the labor market.	13.0	91.0
201609	1262	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	In our forecast, resource gaps are closed by the end of 2017.	13.0	91.0
201609	1263	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	There is some modest overshooting thereafter, though less than in the Tealbook.	13.0	91.0
201609	1264	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I should note that we expect demographic factors to lower the natural rate of unemployment gradually, by 5 basis points annually for some time.	13.0	91.0
201609	1265	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	By 2020, our estimate is down to 4½ percent.	13.0	91.0
201609	1266	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	More generally, uncertainty seems high.	13.0	91.0
201609	1267	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Corporate expectations for capacity expansion seem weak, and I continue to see downside risk to our outlook for economic growth.	13.0	91.0
201609	1268	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Our main concern is that if the US consumer begins to falter, there will be no component of domestic or foreign demand to pick up the slack for the foreseeable future.	13.0	91.0
201609	1269	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Even though things have been relatively quiet of late, the international situation definitely remains an important risk.	13.0	91.0
201609	1270	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	On the domestic front, my biggest concern is that business caution will hold back capital spending more than we expect and may even impinge on future hiring.	13.0	91.0
201609	1271	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	All right, now for the euphemism.	13.0	91.0
201609	1272	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Am I the only one who talks to business CEOs who describe their challenges as selecting from a “shirt” bucket of low-growth opportunities?	13.0	91.0
201609	1274	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Apparently.	13.0	102.0
201609	1275	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13.0	102.0
201609	1276	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	This remark came from a CEO describing the most recent discussions of the Business Roundtable, and it is discouraging.	13.0	91.0
201609	1277	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Separately, but along this same theme, Manpower Employment Services’s CEO said most of his customers expect to be in cost-cutting mode next year.	13.0	91.0
201609	1278	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Such plans hardly are consistent with an outbreak of capital spending.	13.0	91.0
201609	1279	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Also, the head of John Deere reported that its internal baseline projection for 2017 is for a slight decline in equipment sales, but the company is preparing for the possibility of even worse outcomes.	13.0	91.0
201609	1280	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	As corporate CEOs prepare to navigate an economy with 1¾ to perhaps 2 percent trend growth, I realize that I haven’t spoken with anyone who talks about robust expansion plans in the United States.	13.0	91.0
201609	1281	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Turning to inflation, my numbers are again close to the Tealbook.	13.0	91.0
201609	1282	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I see both core and total inflation moving up gradually but still falling short of our 2 percent target at the end of 2019.	13.0	91.0
201609	1283	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	While we see less overshooting of potential output than the Tealbook, our forecast is conditioned on a flat dollar and a somewhat slower pace of policy normalization.	13.0	91.0
201609	1284	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Our monetary policy assumption is a key factor in our forecast narrative, as we see it bolstering inflation expectations and their eventual upward pull on actual pricing.	13.0	91.0
201609	1285	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	That said, I again see downside risk to this forecast.	13.0	91.0
201609	1286	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	TIPS-derived inflation compensation in financial markets and many survey measures of inflation expectations remain low, and my business contacts report few inflationary pressures and no appreciable pricing power.	13.0	91.0
201609	1287	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	We have heard more accounts of wage increases, but it is striking how modest the gains are.	13.0	91.0
201609	1288	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	There are very few reports that appear commensurate with the 2 percent PCE inflation environment.	13.0	91.0
201609	1289	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	If we were likely to see a quick return to 2 percent inflation, I would expect to see more bubbling up with these indicators by now, but there just isn’t that much there.	13.0	91.0
201609	1290	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Instead, I see a rather firmly entrenched low-inflation psychology.	13.0	91.0
201609	1291	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, why are businesses holding the line on wages even when many tell us there’s a shortage of workers?	13.0	91.0
201609	1292	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	It must be because they don’t expect to be able to increase prices enough to justify the expense.	13.0	91.0
201609	1293	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	This psychology is unlikely to change quickly, not without more dramatic and sustained increases in aggregate demand or something else supporting expectations of upward movement and underlying inflation.	13.0	91.0
201609	1294	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Until this happens, even modest inflation increases remain more of a hope than a solid expectation.	13.0	91.0
201609	1295	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201609	1296	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	1297	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13.0	65.0
201609	1298	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	102.0
201609	1299	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	During the past few meetings, the economy has had several flares fly across the bow.	13.0	102.0
201609	1300	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	We saw jobs data, financial volatility, and Brexit worries, but each of these shots passed without effect, and, all told, the expansion remains solid and on track.	13.0	102.0
201609	1301	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	As others have said, we’re on course to add nearly 2¼ million jobs this year, and that’s far more than the million or so that we need to keep pace with labor force growth.	13.0	102.0
201609	1302	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’d like to comment on something President Evans said, which I agree with.	13.0	102.0
201609	1303	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I hear some similar remarks.	13.0	102.0
201609	1304	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	We have a trucking company and a couple of metals companies on our boards, and I’m definitely hearing the exact same thing.	13.0	102.0
201609	1305	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So there’s no question about that.	13.0	102.0
201609	1306	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	But then, when you switch over to anyone who’s affected by the energy industry, the strong dollar, some of these other factors, you definitely hear more negative comments.	13.0	102.0
201609	1307	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	On the services and consumer sides, I hear much more positive comments.	13.0	102.0
201609	1308	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the end, the comments I hear from our directors and our business contacts are consistent with what we’re seeing in the overall economy—that consumer services are really driving economic growth today.	13.0	102.0
201609	1309	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s above trend because it has to make up for weakness in other areas.	13.0	102.0
201609	1310	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I actually agree with that way of describing it, and I think it reflects what we see in the data when you look at how we’re getting the real GDP growth that we’re getting.	13.0	102.0
201609	1311	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Also, when I look across my District, one of the things that I find encouraging is that job growth has been pretty broad based.	13.0	102.0
201609	1312	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	A lot of people think, “Well, it’s San Francisco, of course it’s booming.”	13.0	102.0
201609	1313	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, generally, seven of the nine states in the 12th District are among the fastest growing in the United States.	13.0	102.0
201609	1314	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s different stories.	13.0	102.0
201609	1315	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I was just in Reno, Nevada, where it’s really just a story of recovery from a very deep recession.	13.0	102.0
201609	1316	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	In other states, like Utah, it’s just a very strong economy.	13.0	102.0
201609	1317	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, overall, I’m seeing good growth broadly, not just in the very hot areas like the Bay Area and Seattle.	13.0	102.0
201609	1318	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Looking ahead, I think that real GDP growth will be about 1¾ percent on a national basis this year, which is faster than my estimate of potential.	13.0	102.0
201609	1319	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	My outlook hasn’t changed much over this year.	13.0	102.0
201609	1320	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Economic data, as they relate to our dual mandate, continued to meet or beat expectations, and the domestic headwinds slowing the economy have eased.	13.0	102.0
201609	1321	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	In particular, government spending on all levels is on the upswing, and households have registered solid gains in disposable income and net wealth and are well positioned for strong consumption.	13.0	102.0
201609	1322	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	With output and unemployment gaps now closed and substantial monetary accommodation still in place, I expect that the economy will overshoot potential next year, and that will push the unemployment rate down to nearly 4½ percent.	13.0	102.0
201609	1323	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the resulting upward pressure on inflation should speed the return to our 2 percent price objective, which I expect to reach by the end of next year.	13.0	102.0
201609	1324	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I view the risks to the outlook as basically balanced and similar to those of the past 20 years, especially in light of the diminished downside risk emanating from abroad.	13.0	102.0
201609	1325	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Importantly, this projection embeds an assumption of an appropriate policy rate path, with two increases in the funds rate this year and four in 2017.	13.0	102.0
201609	1326	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Perhaps the most crucial issue regarding the forecast is not so much what the specific numbers are, but how they relate to the “new normal” for steady-state growth.	13.0	102.0
201609	1327	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	On this point, I found the box in Tealbook A about the neutral pace of payroll growth a very useful reminder that steady-state monthly employment gains are much lower than what we’ve been used to in the past.	13.0	102.0
201609	1328	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	As I mentioned in a previous meeting, looking across a lot of estimates, including those obtained by our colleagues at the Chicago Federal Reserve, my own view is that something like 80,000 jobs is the likely benchmark as we go forward.	13.0	102.0
201609	1329	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, we’ve been averaging about 180,000 jobs per month this year, and that’s an extraordinary pace that can’t be sustained forever.	13.0	102.0
201609	1330	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	The special staff memos on the new lower estimates of g* and r*, I thought, were very useful.	13.0	102.0
201609	1331	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	They were clear, concise, and astutely aware of the relevant literature.	13.0	102.0
201609	1332	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	As the memos describe—yes, I’m only reading what I was given [laughter]—there is growing consensus that a long period of slow productivity growth is under way.	13.0	102.0
201609	1333	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Modest underlying productivity growth, combined with slower growth in labor quality and less favorable demographics, means that 2.5 percent real GDP growth on a sustainable basis just isn’t possible anymore.	13.0	102.0
201609	1334	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, people’s estimates differ by a tenth or two here and there.	13.0	102.0
201609	1335	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	My own estimate is that longer-run potential output growth is 1.6 percent.	13.0	102.0
201609	1336	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, looking at most forecasters, they have taken on board the idea that something around 1½ percent is more likely than something like 2½ percent.	13.0	102.0
201609	1337	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	In that context, the real GDP growth of about 1 percent in the first half of this year was really only a bit below trend.	13.0	102.0
201609	1338	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	As noted in the Board staff memo, the continuation of slow real growth has implications for r*.	13.0	102.0
201609	1339	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, in the model that Thomas Laubach and I developed a while ago, the effect is roughly one-for-one with the neutral real rate falling with lower potential output growth.	13.0	102.0
201609	1340	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have for this reason—but on the basis of a lot of analysis—lowered my own estimate of r* to ¾ percent, down from 1 percent in June, much like the Tealbook assumption.	13.0	102.0
201609	1341	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	One comment I’d like to make on the r* issue that does come up in thinking about monetary policy is that from my own perspective, I felt that the short-run r*, if you will, has been around zero.	13.0	102.0
201609	1342	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that is consistent with some analysis that Thomas has done, consistent with—I guess I’m peeking ahead at your memo—with a number of our views here.	13.0	102.0
201609	1343	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So in the short run, I felt that an r* of zero was about right.	13.0	102.0
201609	1344	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	The real question is whether this a transitory phenomenon and we’re going to move back to a more normal level, or is this really something that’s going to be—I don’t know about permanent, but will be with us for 5 or 10 years?	13.0	102.0
201609	1345	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	And that’s really the area in which the evolution in my thinking has happened.	13.0	102.0
201609	1346	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	The short-run r* has been at zero for quite some time, and I haven’t changed that view.	13.0	102.0
201609	1347	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s really more the accumulation of evidence not only in the United States—from different models, different approaches—but also recent work showing that r* seems to have fallen more broadly across countries that’s pushed me in the direction of lowering my long-run r*.	13.0	102.0
201609	1348	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s one way you can try to figure out how I can have my own views of the short run.	13.0	102.0
201609	1349	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s not really about changing my views on the short-run r*, it’s really about how much of that is likely to be with us for 5 to 10 years.	13.0	102.0
201609	1350	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Another steady-state star variable, if you will, that has come up a few times already today is u*, the natural rate of unemployment, and, of course, that can move around over time.	13.0	102.0
201609	1351	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	In particular, demographics have an effect on the natural rate, and President Evans talked a bit about that.	13.0	102.0
201609	1352	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Younger workers consistently face higher unemployment rates than older workers, so the fall in the share of younger workers in the labor force is pushing down the natural rate, all else being equal.	13.0	102.0
201609	1353	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Typically, economists use these fixed-weight unemployment rates or demographically adjusted unemployment rates to try to take that into account.	13.0	102.0
201609	1354	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	My own staff has developed a more granular demographic adjustment.	13.0	102.0
201609	1355	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	They went to the underlying microdata of the six fundamental labor force transitions on the movements between “employment,”	13.0	102.0
201609	1356	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	The analysis based on this method shows that over the past decade or so, changes in the demographic composition of the labor force have lowered the natural rate, as President Evans and others have said, but by only about ¼ percentage point.	13.0	102.0
201609	1357	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So taking this onboard, it’s consistent with a view that the natural rate is somewhere between 4.75 and 5 percent, but I don’t think demographics can push you—at least where we are today—to a much lower view of the natural rate of unemployment.	13.0	102.0
201609	1358	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, there are other factors besides demographics that can affect the natural rate of unemployment.	13.0	102.0
201609	1359	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s useful to look at a lot of other measures: Vacancy rates as well as survey data on the ease of finding jobs and filling jobs have continued to improve and are at levels consistent with our maximum employment goal.	13.0	102.0
201609	1360	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Furthermore, several measures of wage growth, especially for workers who are continuously full-time employed, have picked up notably this year, and that suggests the labor market is at full employment.	13.0	102.0
201609	1361	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Taking all of this into account, I’ve left my estimate of the long-run rate of unemployment unchanged at this time at 5 percent.	13.0	102.0
201609	1362	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	For the record, since we’re on a run right now, I’m SEP respondent lucky number 13.	13.0	102.0
201609	1363	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13.0	102.0
201609	1364	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13.0	65.0
201609	1365	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	103.0
201609	1366	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	The District economy expanded modestly since the previous meeting, and unemployment rates held steady, although they did tick higher in a few states.	13.0	103.0
201609	1367	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	The divergence between energy and non-energy-producing states remains notable, with states like Oklahoma and Wyoming in what could be viewed as a regional recession.	13.0	103.0
201609	1368	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Our District survey shows the manufacturing sector is also still facing some headwinds, with the majority of the weakness concentrated in the oil-producing states, although within the energy sector, the rig count in the District has stabilized and started to modestly increase.	13.0	103.0
201609	1369	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	In the agriculture sector, farm income is expected to fall, and lower crop prices continue to weigh on profit margins.	13.0	103.0
201609	1370	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Margins also remain poor in the cattle and dairy sectors, and as a result, agriculture credit conditions bear close watching, as loan repayment rates have fallen.	13.0	103.0
201609	1371	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Although agriculture and energy certainly remain soft, the spillovers to broader activity in the District have been limited so far and primarily are centered in those energy- and agriculture- concentrated states.	13.0	103.0
201609	1372	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	And even in these states, economic activity is more diversified than a few decades ago, which accounts for sentiment that is relatively more upbeat.	13.0	103.0
201609	1373	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	In the much larger services sector throughout the region, services are growing at a pace similar to that of the nation.	13.0	103.0
201609	1374	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	My outlook for the national economy is little changed.	13.0	103.0
201609	1375	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	I expect GDP growth in the second half of the year to pick up significantly from the disappointing pace in the first half, and looking at next year, I continue to see moderate growth, with inflation rising to 2 percent.	13.0	103.0
201609	1376	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	The key question for me in framing this outlook is whether consumers can continue to pull the economy forward over the next few years.	13.0	103.0
201609	1377	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Consumption growth was strong in the second quarter, with another robust gain projected in the current quarter.	13.0	103.0
201609	1378	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Looking ahead, I expect consumption growth to be supported by strong labor market conditions.	13.0	103.0
201609	1379	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	The steady growth in average hourly earnings, amid modest productivity gains, also points to a tightening labor market.	13.0	103.0
201609	1380	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Consistently, last week’s Census report on income and poverty highlighted a welcome gain in real median household incomes last year.	13.0	103.0
201609	1381	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Although the labor market looks likely to continue its improvement, I do think a risk worth monitoring is the decline in the workweek since the beginning of the year.	13.0	103.0
201609	1382	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Analysis by my staff offers a couple of observations concerning the declining hours in retail trade, leisure and hospitality, and professional business services.	13.0	103.0
201609	1383	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	In the categories of leisure and hospitality and professional business services, which comprise a substantial share of employment, the workweek appears to be returning to a level comparable with a few years ago, suggesting there may have been some overshooting in the average workweek in these sectors.	13.0	103.0
201609	1384	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	On the other hand, the workweek for retail trade has been on a downward trend since late 2011.	13.0	103.0
201609	1385	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	This may be related to structural changes in this sector, such as the emergence of online retailers.	13.0	103.0
201609	1386	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Regarding the outlook for residential investment, analysis by my staff suggests that the falloff in single-family construction reflects a limited amount of undeveloped land in locations desired by households, a supply-side factor that is likely to persist for a considerable time.	13.0	103.0
201609	1387	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Additionally, existing home sales appear to be constrained by a shortage of listings.	13.0	103.0
201609	1388	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	These supply constraints may lead homeowners to remodel an existing house rather than buying a new one.	13.0	103.0
201609	1389	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	With improvements accounting for one-third of residential investment, spending associated with home improvements could resume its upward trend of the past three years and offset much of the drag over the medium term arising from the behavior of new construction.	13.0	103.0
201609	1390	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Like Tealbook, I see few signs of strength in business fixed investment, yet nonfinancial corporate debt as a share of GDP is approaching its highest level on record going back to 1959.	13.0	103.0
201609	1391	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Debt-to-earnings in the nonfinancial corporate sector is also at multidecade highs for firms able to issue investment-grade debt.	13.0	103.0
201609	1392	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	For firms issuing high-yield debt, debt relative to earnings is also at its highest level since 2003.	13.0	103.0
201609	1393	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Clearly, the nonfinancial corporate sector has increased leverage, which concerns me in an environment in which S&P 500 firms have collectively spent more on dividends and buybacks than they generated in operating income in the last seven quarters.	13.0	103.0
201609	1394	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	An unusually low rate environment has facilitated these trends, and the economy could be at risk if earnings disappoint and the markets reevaluate exposures to the sector.	13.0	103.0
201609	1395	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, since our July meeting, inflation expectations in the recent Survey of Consumer Expectations moved up both at the one-year and three-year horizons.	13.0	103.0
201609	1396	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Last week’s CPI release was also encouraging, as core goods inflation was not a drag on the overall CPI for the first time in three months.	13.0	103.0
201609	1397	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	This suggests some stabilization in the portion of US inflation that is most affected by dollar strength.	13.0	103.0
201609	1398	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	With the stable trend in core CPI above 2 percent, stable survey- based inflation expectations, tight labor markets, and rising wages, I see inflation as fully consistent with our mandate for price stability and moving toward our long-run goal of 2 percent.	13.0	103.0
201609	1399	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	103.0
201609	1400	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	1401	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	13.0	65.0
201609	1402	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	111.0
201609	1403	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	The Ninth District economy continues to perform well, though the pace of economic growth slowed.	13.0	111.0
201609	1404	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Wage growth appears moderate.	13.0	111.0
201609	1405	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Price inflation remains subdued, partly reflecting depressed oil prices in our large region with the Bakken.	13.0	111.0
201609	1406	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Actually, we welcomed the very good news from the Census last week on the 5.2 percent rise in median household income between 2014 and 2015, with significantly fewer households in poverty.	13.0	111.0
201609	1407	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	It’s great that the recovery is finally extending more broadly across the income distribution, and it reflects steadily strengthening labor market conditions between 2010 and last summer.	13.0	111.0
201609	1408	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	We hope the growth in median income will continue.	13.0	111.0
201609	1409	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	On the inflation front, from our perspective, we’ve made little progress toward our inflation objective.	13.0	111.0
201609	1410	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	I find it interesting that the staff forecast of core PCE inflation is to remain at 1.6 percent for both 2016 and all of 2017.	13.0	111.0
201609	1411	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Market- and survey-based measures of expected inflation are near record lows.	13.0	111.0
201609	1412	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Some attribute this to temporary factors and argue that inflation is coming.	13.0	111.0
201609	1413	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	The inflation hawks might be right, but I’m looking for it in the data, not just faith and hope.	13.0	111.0
201609	1414	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	On the labor market front, growth has slowed over the past 12 months.	13.0	111.0
201609	1415	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	The unemployment rate and the staff’s labor market conditions index are little changed since last summer, and as others have noted, recent manufacturing and retail sales data have been disappointing.	13.0	111.0
201609	1416	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Economic growth in Mexico and Canada, our major trading partners, also looks very weak, so my baseline outlook is more of the same:  sluggish growth, subdued inflation.	13.0	111.0
201609	1417	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	We have talked about this many times since I’ve been here that there’s asymmetry with our tools related to the lower bound, so for me, the risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside.	13.0	111.0
201609	1418	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	It’s much tougher for us to respond to very low inflation than to high inflation.	13.0	111.0
201609	1419	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	The risk of unsustainable growth stoking inflation seems remote,in view of the less than 2 percent GDP growth and the stable labor market indicators  And I think I’ve mentioned it before: If it were to surprise us on the upside, that’s a high-class problem compared with surprising us on the downside.	13.0	111.0
201609	1420	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	13.0	111.0
201609	1421	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	1422	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13.0	65.0
201609	1423	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201609	1424	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	At the December 2015 meeting at which the Committee raised the interest rate, I wrote down three rate increases for 2016, and I guess I see two main unexpected developments since then that have changed my view of the appropriate path so far this year.	13.0	104.0
201609	1425	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	First, the period of financial market turmoil in January and February linked to the possibility of a large devaluation of the RMB was followed by a series of weak incoming data.	13.0	104.0
201609	1426	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Real GDP growth in the first half of the year came in at 1¼ percent, well below expectations.	13.0	104.0
201609	1427	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Payroll growth also declined sharply in the first half.	13.0	104.0
201609	1428	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Although this weakness is now passing, it does leave, for me, a declining residue of uncertainty.	13.0	104.0
201609	1429	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Second, and of more significance for the period ahead, interest rates have declined significantly right across the curve, and, like many others, I have come to the view that rates need to be lower than I had thought to support activity.	13.0	104.0
201609	1430	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	The kinds of rate increases that have been in the SEP for the past few years seem increasingly unrealistic in the global context that we are now in.	13.0	104.0
201609	1431	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	For me, that argues for a more gradual path of increases but not a change in the direction of travel.	13.0	104.0
201609	1432	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	To talk about each of those a little bit, even though GDP in the first half disappointed, about half of that slowdown over the past year, as David Wilcox covered, was about a decline in inventory accumulation—an inventory correction—which really says little about the underlying strength of demand.	13.0	104.0
201609	1433	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Private domestic final purchases are a better indicator.	13.0	104.0
201609	1434	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	They have behaved about as expected, growing at 3 percent last quarter and 2¼ percent over the past four quarters.	13.0	104.0
201609	1435	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	The Tealbook and seemingly all private forecasters expect stronger GDP growth in the second half.	13.0	104.0
201609	1436	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	And, for what I regard as good reasons:  The inventory correction should end.	13.0	104.0
201609	1437	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	The drag on business investment from lower oil prices that should end now that rig counts appear to have stabilized.	13.0	104.0
201609	1438	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	The contractionary effects of the big increase in the exchange value of the dollar should be waning.	13.0	104.0
201609	1439	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Financial conditions have eased materially since December.	13.0	104.0
201609	1440	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	And, finally, consumer spending should remain strong, with rising real incomes, continued job market strength, and much improved household balance sheets.	13.0	104.0
201609	1441	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Overall, I expect strong growth in the second half that will lift 2016 GDP close to 2 percent for the year as a whole.	13.0	104.0
201609	1442	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	In labor markets, payroll growth this year has averaged 180,000, down 50,000 from last year’s pace, but the underlying pattern is significant.	13.0	104.0
201609	1443	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	The average for March, April, and May, which is what the Committee saw at the time of the June meeting, was only about 120,000, which was a sharp deceleration since 2015.	13.0	104.0
201609	1444	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Fortunately, the average for the past three months through August is back up to 230,000, which is reassuring.	13.0	104.0
201609	1445	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	I would add that labor markets are also a better real-time indicator of the strength of GDP than is reported GDP.	13.0	104.0
201609	1446	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	With the increase in labor force participation, both unemployment and participation appear now to be very close to their longer-term trends, suggesting that the economy is pretty close to full employment.	13.0	104.0
201609	1447	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Indeed, despite modest rates of increases for wages, the very low levels of productivity growth and inflation over the past few years mean that unit labor costs are now rising faster than prices.	13.0	104.0
201609	1448	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	In addition, the Conference Board’s survey on job availability now shows, for the first time since 2008, that more respondents think jobs are plentiful than find them hard to get, and that has generally only happened when unemployment is at or below the natural rate.	13.0	104.0
201609	1449	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	In contrast to recent years, the improvement in labor markets has shown up this year in the form of an apparent upside surprise in our admittedly volatile measure of labor force participation.	13.0	104.0
201609	1450	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	If participation had declined as predicted in the December Tealbook, and holding all else equal, the unemployment rate would now be 4.3 percent.	13.0	104.0
201609	1451	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	I suspect that this would have been a very different meeting if that had been the case.	13.0	104.0
201609	1452	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	In any case, above-forecast labor force participation suggests that the economy has more room to expand, or at least that supply-side limits are probably more than usually uncertain, and I think we would be wise to take that into account in thinking about policy.	13.0	104.0
201609	1453	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	If job growth continues at anything like these rates, unemployment may fall well below current estimates of the natural rate, or labor force participation may continue to improve relative to trend, or both.	13.0	104.0
201609	1454	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Any of these outcomes would support a return to 2 percent inflation and would be welcome for me.	13.0	104.0
201609	1455	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Another possibility is that inflation does not pick up and that we continue to revise down our estimate of the natural rate.	13.0	104.0
201609	1456	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Finally, it’s also possible, of course, that wage and price pressures will appear to an unexpected degree, and that would require a more aggressive response from policy and potentially put the recovery at risk.	13.0	104.0
201609	1457	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	There are no risk-free paths, and this latter I find a good argument for which the time has not yet come, in my thinking.	13.0	104.0
201609	1458	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	The third factor I mentioned is much lower interest rates.	13.0	104.0
201609	1459	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Since the rate increase of December, there has been significant loosening in financial conditions.	13.0	104.0
201609	1460	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Between that SEP and the current SEP, we’ve seen median FOMC participant expectations regarding the total number of rate increases for this year and next year decline from eight to three.	13.0	104.0
201609	1461	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	By a straight read, markets are pricing in about a 50 percent chance of one increase this year and one more rate increase next year.	13.0	104.0
201609	1462	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Accounting for term premiums and other factors, I think, actually, for 2017, market expectations are probably not far from this meeting’s SEP.	13.0	104.0
201609	1463	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Other financial conditions have loosened as well, with lower long-term rates, higher stock prices, a weaker dollar, and narrower credit spreads.	13.0	104.0
201609	1464	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	With this loosening of financial conditions, GDP growth and the pace of job creation have stabilized, and I do see a causal relationship between the first and the second.	13.0	104.0
201609	1465	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	The implication, though, is that the neutral rate of interest remains very low, even lower than I had thought.	13.0	104.0
201609	1466	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Inflation, on the other hand, has performed very close to expectations.	13.0	104.0
201609	1467	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Year-to-date core inflation is 1.6 percent, up 0.3 percentage point over the year.	13.0	104.0
201609	1468	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	That said, rising unit labor costs may put some downward pressure on profits and upward pressure on prices, helping us get back to 2 percent inflation.	13.0	104.0
201609	1469	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	I continue to see inflation rising to 2 percent over the medium term, although I do see the risks as slightly more to the downside.	13.0	104.0
201609	1470	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	In particular, low measures of inflation expectations remain a concern, and to address that concern, I do see it as appropriate to allow unemployment to decline modestly below the natural rate in order to support progress toward our 2 percent inflation target.	13.0	104.0
201609	1471	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201609	1472	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	1473	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13.0	65.0
201609	1474	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201609	1475	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	During the day on Saturday and on Sunday morning, I composed a set of remarks for the economic go-round that were, I believe, destined to be remembered as one of the most remarkable interventions in the annals of the FOMC.	13.0	97.0
201609	1476	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	On Sunday afternoon, my computer crashed, and those remarks, unfortunately, were lost to posterity.	13.0	97.0
201609	1477	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	13.0	97.0
201609	1478	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Having tried to reconstitute them Sunday evening and yesterday, somehow the brilliance had been fleeting, and for that reason, I’m grateful that Presidents Evans, Rosengren, and Williams what I actually think is the most important thing to talk about in this meeting:  the relative risks of overshoot against failing to stimulate more.	13.0	97.0
201609	1479	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	So, in a somewhat impromptu way, I’m going to try to make some remarks about that.	13.0	97.0
201609	1480	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	First, we really are in a fundamentally different position than a year—or certainly two or three—ago.	13.0	97.0
201609	1481	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	At that time, I honestly couldn’t understand arguments that were being made for why we needed to be ready to start tightening, or we should start thinking about tightening, or the like.	13.0	97.0
201609	1482	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Whatever one’s view, and I think people know where I stand on this relative to others on the Committee, we are surely in a realm now in which the possibilities and the risks on both sides have to be taken seriously.	13.0	97.0
201609	1483	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And even though I come out differently from, say, where President Rosengren is, I think he has raised an important set of issues both here and in his public speeches, which it behooves all of us to engage in and just try to balance to see what the right path is for the period ahead.	13.0	97.0
201609	1484	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	The first thing I’d say on that—and this is the risk of overshooting—and as I think the discussion among Presidents Evans, Rosengren, and Williams and David Wilcox showed, it’s actually hard to find historical examples of pretty much anything that we want to demonstrate here.	13.0	97.0
201609	1485	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	One of the problems is that, as President Williams pointed out, it’s hard to find an example when there was a soft landing where unemployment went up several tenths of a percentage point without a recession.	13.0	97.0
201609	1486	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	But, on the other side, it is also hard to find one of those circumstances in which the FOMC did not arguably keep its foot on the brake way too long.	13.0	97.0
201609	1487	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	One has to recognize that, in these cases, inflation had actually gotten well above target for some period of time.	13.0	97.0
201609	1488	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	So I think while it’s reasonable for all of us to look at history and try to learn from it, I suspect that history isn’t going to provide an answer here, even though it will, in a sort of Biblical fashion, provide a little bit of support on both sides.	13.0	97.0
201609	1489	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	So, the question of what the risks associated with a modest to moderate overshoot are, I think, are the ones that Eric lays out, and others have echoed, and are the ones that we should be worried about.	13.0	97.0
201609	1490	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And the questions are, first:  How likely is that to happen?	13.0	97.0
201609	1491	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Because, obviously, that’s important.	13.0	97.0
201609	1492	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And then, second: What are the risks on the other side?	13.0	97.0
201609	1493	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	That is, if one takes the approach of beginning to raise rates in order to avoid those risks, what kinds of risks are you courting on the other side?	13.0	97.0
201609	1494	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	As you can tell from what I already said about history, while I agree that there is the risk of an overshoot that requires us to respond in a very robust way and thereby induces a recession, it seems to me that in an environment in which inflation has been running below target as long as it has, in which there is a global arguably disinflationary—and certainly not inflationary— environment, and in which we are talking not about massive overshoots but a few tenths of a percentage point overshoot, my instinct is that the risks are nontrivial but modest to moderate.	13.0	97.0
201609	1495	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And that’s reinforced for me by looking at the flip side of this, which is: What are the risks of nonlinearity in the labor market—specifically, with the unemployment rate going down below what is perceived to be a natural rate?	13.0	97.0
201609	1496	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	If this is the concern, I think there aren’t really a lot of historical examples to support that kind of concern.	13.0	97.0
201609	1497	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	If you want to see a nonlinear relationship between falling unemployment, arguably below the natural rate, and a nonlinear increase in wages, you can go back to the 1990s, but that did not translate into price inflation, presumably, at least in part because of the fact that the Phillips curve had already flattened by then.	13.0	97.0
201609	1498	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	So if you want to see price inflation being associated in a nonlinear fashion with a dip below the natural rate, I think you have to go back to the 1960s.	13.0	97.0
201609	1499	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And if you’re going back to the 1960s—again, I lived through that period, but I do not recall what was happening with inflation directly at that time—my understanding is that the estimates of the natural rate may have been off by a substantial amount, like 1 or maybe 2 percentage points, not several tenths of a percentage point.	13.0	97.0
201609	1500	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	So, again, it was really quite a different context from the one in which we find ourselves today.	13.0	97.0
201609	1501	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And then, I add to that the uncertainty that Governor Brainard and President Evans have referred to regarding the exact value of the natural rate of unemployment is.	13.0	97.0
201609	1502	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	If we’re worrying about overshooting it by too much and if it’s actually lower than the staff estimate of 5 percent, then the kinds of overshooting that we are talking about are obviously smaller still.	13.0	97.0
201609	1503	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And I do continue to think there’s a pretty good chance that the rate of unemployment at which even wage pressures will be significantly built up is lower than the 5 percent estimated by the staff.	13.0	97.0
201609	1504	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	What we have seen over the past year or so has been an encouraging phenomenon that there really is more slack in the labor market than some believed.	13.0	97.0
201609	1505	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	That is the significance of the fact that the unemployment rate has remained stable during this period.	13.0	97.0
201609	1506	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	It is that we’ve been creating jobs at a healthy clip—above the number needed to deal with new entrants into the labor force—and yet unemployment has not been falling during that period.	13.0	97.0
201609	1507	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Now, maybe that could all reverse very quickly, and you would simultaneously have no people coming into the labor market and unemployment beginning to decline very quickly.	13.0	97.0
201609	1508	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	But it seems to me as though it is more likely that we are testing the bounds of how much slack there is, and this will be something more of a gradual process, because the amounts really have exceeded, I think, what many people expected even a year or two ago.	13.0	97.0
201609	1509	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Just a couple of mildly relevant comments on this from current activities: EPOP has been increasing faster this year than last year, again suggesting that it has been drawing slack back into the labor market.	13.0	97.0
201609	1510	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And recently, compensation increases have actually flattened out a bit.	13.0	97.0
201609	1511	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	With some exceptions, like construction, for which supply constraints do seem to be present, we haven’t seen an unusual acceleration of wages at the high end of the distribution of wage growth, and that is the phenomenon that has been observed during past recoveries when unemployment dropped below what later proved to be the natural rate.	13.0	97.0
201609	1512	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	All in all, to me, the situation we’re in now is a pretty good one of continued job creation that is taking up slack in the economy, a process that has helped bring the share of the long-term unemployed back to its pre-crisis level.	13.0	97.0
201609	1513	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	It is now helping minority and other groups whose unemployment rates traditionally run significantly higher than the average for the labor force as a whole.	13.0	97.0
201609	1514	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	So that’s my own assessment, gloss, and obviously, to some degree, disagreement with the very salient issue that Eric raised as to how much of a risk there is there.	13.0	97.0
201609	1515	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And I’d just much more briefly point out that, on the other side, there are risks, too.	13.0	97.0
201609	1516	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	There is, it seems to me, a growing case for some variant on the secular-stagnation hypothesis.	13.0	97.0
201609	1517	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Maybe not secular stagnation itself, but the cognitive transmogrification of headwinds into prevailing winds, which I think a lot of people have gone through, is something that needs to be taken quite seriously.	13.0	97.0
201609	1518	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	That suggests, again, that if we’re in an environment in which there is a risk that inflation is not going to go up and indeed is susceptible to recessions pushing it down further again, one actually wants to err on what I’ve characterized as the “show me” side of things, of looking for tangible evidence that inflation is rising toward and will remain around its target level.	13.0	97.0
201609	1519	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t expect to persuade people who have the other view, but I really do think that that’s the discussion.	13.0	97.0
201609	1520	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	The discussion of the set of issues, which Presidents Evans, Rosengren, and Williams started in their questioning of David Wilcox and which I’m trying to continue now, is I think probably the right one to have maybe in October as people think, looking ahead, about where this balance of risks really does lie and forcing each of us to confront the quite legitimate position that those who have the opposite instincts are taking.	13.0	97.0
201609	1521	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201609	1522	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	1523	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13.0	65.0
201609	1524	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201609	1525	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I want to endorse what Governor Tarullo just said.	13.0	96.0
201609	1526	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this issue about where the risk lies is really the germane subject that we’re wrestling with.	13.0	96.0
201609	1527	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think that one reason why I’m less worried about the overshooting risk, which I think is legitimate, is because we are growing only very modestly above trend, so we’re approaching full employment at a very shallow trajectory.	13.0	96.0
201609	1528	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Inflation is below our target rather than above our target, and inflation expectations are probably a little bit depressed.	13.0	96.0
201609	1529	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Obviously, nobody wants to repeat the 1960s.	13.0	96.0
201609	1530	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	But I would emphasize that, to get the inflation that we got in the 1970s, we had to work really, really hard for a decade of a whole series of policy mistakes over and over again.	13.0	96.0
201609	1531	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Not only was the unemployment rate allowed to decline below the natural rate, but I think there also was a fundamental error in policymakers’ thinking that if the unemployment rate got too low, the inflation rate would go a little bit higher, but it wouldn’t be the case that the change in the inflation rate would continue to go up every year that you kept the unemployment rate below its full-employment rate.	13.0	96.0
201609	1532	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think there was a model failure in terms of how the inflation process actually worked, so as inflation expectations got unanchored, what happened was, as you stayed below that full employment unemployment rate, inflation got worse year after year.	13.0	96.0
201609	1533	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think coming back in October and maybe actually reviewing some of this historical evidence is certainly an interesting thing to take a look at.	13.0	96.0
201609	1534	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I would encourage the staff to bring all this back to us and maybe actually talk about some of these various episodes and whether the current situation is different or similar to those earlier circumstances.	13.0	96.0
201609	1535	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, in terms of the outlook, my views, as I’ve said many times, have not changed much since the previous FOMC meeting.	13.0	96.0
201609	1536	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	On the growth side, we expect real GDP growth to average about 2¾ percent during the second half of the year, and for 2017 and 2018 we’re penciling in GDP growth around 2 percent but have considerable uncertainty about that.	13.0	96.0
201609	1537	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the very near-term outlook—in other words, the next couple of quarters—I’m of two minds.	13.0	96.0
201609	1538	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	On the one hand, I do take comfort from the fact that financial conditions are accommodative, the fiscal impulse is positive, and real GDP is getting a short-term boost as the drag due to the decline in inventory investment reverses itself.	13.0	96.0
201609	1539	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	But, on the other hand, we do have to recognize that some of the recent data have been quite weak.	13.0	96.0
201609	1540	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, although the last employment report had 151,000 in payrolls and people took a lot of comfort from that, the rest of the report was very soft—aggregate hours worked declined, and some of the earlier rise that we saw in average hourly earnings on a year-over-year basis reversed.	13.0	96.0
201609	1541	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	In addition, retail sales were quite soft in August, suggesting that maybe some of the recent momentum in consumer spending has faded, and the past two ISM reports for manufacturing and services for August registered large drops.	13.0	96.0
201609	1542	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	As President Kaplan has noted, this may just be noise, and maybe we want to look at a smooth three-month moving average.	13.0	96.0
201609	1543	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	But the size of the declines in both of those were quite large, so I’m not willing to discount it completely.	13.0	96.0
201609	1544	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the labor market, my assessment is that there is still some slack.	13.0	96.0
201609	1545	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we need to be clear when we talk about the monthly payroll gains needed to keep the unemployment rate steady in the long run, which is suggested at 85,000 to 115,000 in the Tealbook.	13.0	96.0
201609	1546	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	That is a long-run concept and may not be a good metric to use in assessing when is the appropriate time to remove monetary policy accommodation.	13.0	96.0
201609	1547	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	As we’ve seen over the past eight months, payrolls can grow considerably more rapidly than that without necessarily pushing down the unemployment rate.	13.0	96.0
201609	1548	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	If an improving labor market pulls discouraged workers back into the labor force, I think that’s a welcome development, and we don’t necessarily want to forestall that.	13.0	96.0
201609	1549	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I can, in fact, imagine payroll gains persisting at 151,000 a month or more for some time without that generating much downward movement in the unemployment rate.	13.0	96.0
201609	1550	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	If that occurred and other data suggested no evidence of a rise in inflationary pressures, the right conclusion might be to conceivably keep monetary policy on hold for some time to come.	13.0	96.0
201609	1551	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Obviously, the decision wouldn’t just depend on what is happening in the labor market.	13.0	96.0
201609	1552	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	It would depend on many factors.	13.0	96.0
201609	1553	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	My point here, though, is that we shouldn’t suggest that our actions are going to mainly be dictated by the pace of monthly payroll change relative to the long-term pace consistent with a stable unemployment rate.	13.0	96.0
201609	1554	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	That is just too simplistic a metric, I think, in terms of our monetary policy decision rule.	13.0	96.0
201609	1555	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Another issue I am concerned about on the economic growth side is whether low interest rates are losing their punch in terms of supporting the economy.	13.0	96.0
201609	1556	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	There are at least two issues here.	13.0	96.0
201609	1557	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	First, the attenuation of monetary policy stimulus over time, as the activity that has been pulled forward by lower interest rates—for example, motor vehicle sales—is no longer there when the future inevitably arises.	13.0	96.0
201609	1558	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	We may be starting to see that in the motor vehicle sector, as sales have flattened out this year and in August actually declined.	13.0	96.0
201609	1559	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The second is the prospect that a persistent period of low interest rates may eventually lead to a rise in the saving rate.	13.0	96.0
201609	1560	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	If real rates stay very low, households, pension funds, and endowments will likely have to save more to achieve their wealth objectives.	13.0	96.0
201609	1561	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	On the household side, we see some evidence of this in the fact that the household saving rate is a bit elevated today relative to what one would expect, just on the basis of the level of household net worth relative to income.	13.0	96.0
201609	1562	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, one could take this as a positive sign.	13.0	96.0
201609	1563	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	If the typical relationship was restored, the household savings rate would drop, and consumption would grow faster than income as the saving rate declined.	13.0	96.0
201609	1564	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Or it could be that the current situation is just the beginning of a more persistent updrift in the saving rate as savings behavior responds to the low level of interest rates.	13.0	96.0
201609	1565	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	As I’ve said at other meetings, we have never been in this circumstance before, so to think that we understand the dynamics of how the household sector is going to react to this long period of low interest rates is just an open question at this point.	13.0	96.0
201609	1566	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	If the saving rate were to rise, consumption would grow more slowly than income, and that, in turn, would exert a restraining effect on economic activity.	13.0	96.0
201609	1567	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to institutions such as pensions and endowments, I’d like to relate a conversation I had with a person responsible for overseeing the management of a major university’s endowment fund recently.	13.0	96.0
201609	1568	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Currently, this university takes 5 percent of its endowment each year into its general budget.	13.0	96.0
201609	1569	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	But 5 percent seems too high to be sustainable in the current financial market environment, so the endowment managers are faced with some tough choices: They can take more risks to generate a 5 percent real rate of return, they can reduce the draw on the endowment to a smaller percentage and reduce university spending to compensate, or they can let the endowment diminish in size in real terms by maintaining the 5 percent annual drawdown but not actually getting investment returns sufficient to replenish it.	13.0	96.0
201609	1570	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not sure how this is all going to play out in terms of timing, but this does seem to be another avenue that might eventually translate into less spending.	13.0	96.0
201609	1571	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The same dynamic is at play in terms of corporate defined-benefit plans and state and local pension plans.	13.0	96.0
201609	1572	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	For both corporate and state and local plans, the annualized nominal rates of return that they are assuming varies considerably across different plans—there’s a pretty broad range.	13.0	96.0
201609	1573	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	But the median is around 7½ percent nominal rate of return annually; such returns are unlikely to be achieved over the long term.	13.0	96.0
201609	1574	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, this has been papered over a bit in recent years because declining longer-term rates have boosted bond prices, generating capital gains that have supported the terms.	13.0	96.0
201609	1575	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	But this can’t go on indefinitely.	13.0	96.0
201609	1576	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Eventually, the low level over the current yield will dominate in terms of determining future returns.	13.0	96.0
201609	1577	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Eventually, the contributions in the pension funds will have to rise, with consequences for corporate profits and for state and local taxes and expenditures I think we need to do more work to understand the potential consequences of a “low interest rate forever” environment on savings and spending behavior not because I necessarily think that we are going to have a low interest rate environment forever, but because I’d like to understand the consequences if we stay on the current trajectory.	13.0	96.0
201609	1578	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I can imagine an environment in which persistently low interest rates led to more saving that in turn depressed economic growth, and the sluggish rate of growth in turn reinforced the downward pressure on interest rates.	13.0	96.0
201609	1579	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So there would be a sort of feedback loop that would lead to low interest rates and sluggish economic growth.	13.0	96.0
201609	1580	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	In fact, you could argue that’s what we’ve been experiencing.	13.0	96.0
201609	1581	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	On the inflation side, my outlook also hasn’t changed much.	13.0	96.0
201609	1582	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Whereas before we had an expectation that core PCE inflation would moderate during the second half of the year, now it appears that expectation is being realized.	13.0	96.0
201609	1583	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Combined with somewhat less wage pressure in the most recent reading, the persistence of low energy prices, and subdued inflation expectations, there doesn’t seem to be much risk that inflation is going to get away from us on the upside any time soon.	13.0	96.0
201609	1584	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The fact that inflation is still low and below our target, the likelihood that there is still some slack in the labor market, and some concerns I have about the growth outlook all reinforce my view that there is little urgency to tightening monetary policy right now.	13.0	96.0
201609	1585	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think a patient approach is warranted for the time being, but more on that tomorrow.	13.0	96.0
201609	1586	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, a few thoughts on the updraft in the short-term LIBOR and in the foreign exchange swap basis for both the euro and yen.	13.0	96.0
201609	1587	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	This was the focus of much of the discussion at the most recent BIS meetings Stan and I were at over the weekend.	13.0	96.0
201609	1588	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The general consensus was that the upward movements were due mainly to regulatory changes that increased the cost of dealer balance sheets.	13.0	96.0
201609	1589	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Money market fund reforms that require prime institutional money market funds to move to floating net asset value on October 14 was also considered to be a factor.	13.0	96.0
201609	1590	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Much money has already shifted out of such money market mutual funds, and if you look at the money market mutual fund’s prime institutional funds, they have already reduced their weighted- average maturity sharply to only 11 days in the most recent reading.	13.0	96.0
201609	1591	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	This suggests to me that most, if not all, of the adjustment in short-term rates due to money market fund reform may already have taken place.	13.0	96.0
201609	1592	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I expect that once we get past the October 14 deadline, these prime funds will presumably lengthen their average maturities.	13.0	96.0
201609	1593	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The consequence of that will push up the relative yields on these funds compared with Treasury funds, and that will actually cause some funds to flow back into the prime funds.	13.0	96.0
201609	1594	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The Tealbook looks at the issue of how much the rise in the three-month LIBOR represents a tightening of financial market conditions through the channel of nonfinancial corporate borrowing costs.	13.0	96.0
201609	1595	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I agree with the analysis that this has a very small effect.	13.0	96.0
201609	1596	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The main channel of monetary policy, in my mind, is how changes in the expected short-term rate path affect longer-term interest rates.	13.0	96.0
201609	1597	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	If the three-month LIBOR rises because the term structure of interest rates otherwise doesn’t change, then I think the effect should be little.	13.0	96.0
201609	1598	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So if everything is the same, and the only thing that has moved is three-month LIBOR, I don’t really think that has much consequence for financial market conditions, and we should basically not put much weight on it.	13.0	96.0
201609	1599	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So to sum up, while I think there are several good reasons not to tighten monetary policy at this meeting, I don’t think the rise in the three-month LIBOR or money market fund reform are among them.	13.0	96.0
201609	1600	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201609	1601	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	1602	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	And my thanks to everyone for an interesting discussion of the outlook and particularly the risks that we face at this juncture.	13.0	65.0
201609	1603	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	I’d just like to wrap up the go-round with brief comments on two issues that I consider relevant to our policy discussion tomorrow.	13.0	65.0
201609	1604	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	First, what does the current pace of labor market improvement imply for resource utilization?	13.0	65.0
201609	1605	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	And, second, are there signs of emerging inflation pressures?	13.0	65.0
201609	1606	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	On the first issue, I’m echoing what the Vice Chairman and Governor Tarullo and others have indicated:  The data clearly show that labor market conditions have improved appreciably over the past year.	13.0	65.0
201609	1607	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Since August of last year, the economy has added about 2½ million jobs, enabling the employment-to-population ratio to rise 0.3 percentage point despite demographic effects that are pulling down the underlying trend.	13.0	65.0
201609	1608	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Furthermore, job growth remained solid through the late spring and summer, with payroll gains averaging about 180,000 per month over the past four months.	13.0	65.0
201609	1609	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	In light of the apparent pickup in real GDP growth in the second half of this year, it seems reasonable to expect, as the Tealbook does, that job gains will remain solid through the rest of the year and into early next year.	13.0	65.0
201609	1610	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Even if payroll gains in coming months were to moderate somewhat from their recent average pace—say, to the 150,000 increase recorded in August—employment growth would still be running ahead of what is sustainable in the longer run.	13.0	65.0
201609	1611	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you have emphasized this point.	13.0	65.0
201609	1612	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	The staff’s estimates, reported in the Tealbook,  suggest that job gains will eventually have to moderate substantially over time to stabilize the unemployment rate, most likely to somewhere in the 85,000 to 115,000 per month range,in view of the downward trend in labor force participation and likely divergence between payroll and household employment gains, but conceivably as low as 65,000 per month.	13.0	65.0
201609	1613	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	That long-run growth constraint does not necessarily imply, though, that continued job gains in the 150,000 to 200,000 range would be problematic in the near term, because data we have received over the past year suggest that the economy may have more room to grow than previously thought.	13.0	65.0
201609	1614	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Consider the labor force participation rate, which rose over the past year, rather than declining as the staff projected last September.	13.0	65.0
201609	1615	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	That allowed the unemployment rate to remain virtually unchanged, despite the strong job gains.	13.0	65.0
201609	1616	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	One reasonable response to this unexpected development would be to revise up the path of employment estimated to be consistent with a given unemployment rate.	13.0	65.0
201609	1617	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	For anyone who gauges inflationary pressures using the standard unemployment gap, this sort of revision effectively constitutes a favorable supply shock, and it implies that the economy can sustainability operate with a higher long-run employment-to- population ratio.	13.0	65.0
201609	1618	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Other labor indicators also seem to be consistent with the proposition that labor market slack has been shrinking at only a modest pace recently.	13.0	65.0
201609	1619	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Involuntary part-time employment and the broad U-6 measure of labor utilization are both little changed since last fall.	13.0	65.0
201609	1620	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	And even in the case of those indicators that continue to trend up—such as JOLTS readings on openings and quits and survey assessments of job availability and whether jobs are hard to fill—the pace of improvement appears to have slowed this year.	13.0	65.0
201609	1621	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	In light of these developments, I anticipate that utilization will continue to tighten at a gradual pace as we move into next year, especially as I see some potential for a healthy labor market to attract yet more people back into the labor force.	13.0	65.0
201609	1622	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, employment growth does have to moderate at some point if we want to ensure longer-run price stability.	13.0	65.0
201609	1623	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Nonetheless, we should be wary of slowing employment growth too rapidly, especially as some slack still remains, and a moderately tight labor market would help speed the return to 2 percent inflation.	13.0	65.0
201609	1624	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	After all, the unemployment rate is still a couple of tenths above my estimate of its longer-run value, and involuntary part-time employment is more than 1 percentage point above its average pre-crisis level.	13.0	65.0
201609	1625	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Let me now turn to my second question:  Are there signs of emerging inflation pressures?	13.0	65.0
201609	1626	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	If there were, I would be more concerned that we could be falling “behind the curve,” but, frankly, I can’t see many signs of that yet.	13.0	65.0
201609	1627	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	The September Beige Book reported remarkably few signs of rising cost pressures or planned price increases.	13.0	65.0
201609	1628	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	From what I heard around the table, this was also not a significant theme in your conversations with your various business contacts.	13.0	65.0
201609	1629	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	As regards hard data, nominal wage gains remain subdued by most measures.	13.0	65.0
201609	1630	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Oil prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar are little changed from where they stood last fall.	13.0	65.0
201609	1631	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Non-energy commodity prices have moved up some this year, but only to a moderate level.	13.0	65.0
201609	1632	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Market-based measures of inflation compensation and survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations have changed little in recent months and remain at or below their longer- run averages.	13.0	65.0
201609	1633	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Most directly, the monthly price data have come in about as I and the staff expected.	13.0	65.0
201609	1634	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Accordingly, I continue to expect that core PCE inflation will come in at just over 1½ percent this year.	13.0	65.0
201609	1635	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	That’s up ¼ percentage point from 2015 due to the waning effects of past dollar appreciation.	13.0	65.0
201609	1636	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	That was my SEP forecast a year ago.	13.0	65.0
201609	1637	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	And my  forecast for 2015 has remained essentially unchanged since then.	13.0	65.0
201609	1638	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Now, it’s true, and several of you mentioned this, that core CPI inflation and other CPI-based measures of trend inflation have risen more notably than core PCE inflation over the past two or three years, primarily because of differences between the CPI and PCE weights on rents and medical prices and differences in the measurement of health-care inflation in the two series.	13.0	65.0
201609	1639	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, if one looked at movements in the CPI were more closely related to consumer welfare than movements in the PCE index, then the recent rise in CPI-based measures of underlying inflation would be cause for concern.	13.0	65.0
201609	1640	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	But the Committee judged that the opposite was true when it decided to define our inflation objective using the PCE measure.	13.0	65.0
201609	1641	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Alternatively, one might be alarmed by the growing wedge between these two inflation measures, if such a gap signals an increased likelihood of a pickup in future PCE price inflation, all else being equal.	13.0	65.0
201609	1642	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	We conducted some regression analysis to look at that issue, and the results suggest exactly the opposite.	13.0	65.0
201609	1643	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	When core CPI inflation rises relative to core PCE inflation, it’s core CPI inflation that tends to fall in the following year.	13.0	65.0
201609	1644	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, it is worth stressing that some other price measures, including GDP prices excluding food and energy and the trimmed mean PCE price index, also suggest little net change in underlying inflation over the past two or three years.	13.0	65.0
201609	1645	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there.	13.0	65.0
201609	1646	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	I think we still have time before we head to dinner to let Thomas give us his policy briefing.	21.0	65.0
201609	1647	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201609	1648	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21.0	999.0
201609	1649	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	One issue you have been discussing in recent meetings is the amount of monetary policy accommodation provided by current and expected settings for the federal funds rate.	21.0	999.0
201609	1650	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	Exhibit 1 examines that issue through the lens of your SEP-implied neutral real rates.	21.0	999.0
201609	1651	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	As Beth noted in her briefing on the SEP, your forecasts for 2017 and 2018 for your two key goal variables have changed very little over the past year, with the unemployment rate at the end of 2018 at or slightly below its longer-run level and inflation moving toward the Committee’s objective.	21.0	999.0
201609	1652	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	However, as shown in the top- left panel, your assessments of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate associated with those projections has shifted down notably.	21.0	999.0
201609	1653	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	That shift reflects revisions to both the longer-run equilibrium level of the federal funds rate and the pace at which the federal funds rate is projected to rise to achieve the Committee’s economic objectives.	21.0	999.0
201609	1654	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	Since the September 2015 SEP, the median estimate of the longer-run federal funds rate has been marked down, as Beth noted, from 3.5 percent to 2.9 percent.	21.0	999.0
201609	1655	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	A year ago, in considering the appropriate path of the funds rate over the medium run, most of you expected that it would be appropriate to move the policy rate up at a pace that would put it close to its longer-run level by the end of 2018.	21.0	999.0
201609	1656	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	In subsequent SEPs, that path has moved lower.	21.0	999.0
201609	1657	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	And many of you now anticipate that the appropriate level of the funds rate consistent with your economic projections will, at the end of 2019, still be below its longer-run level.	21.0	999.0
201609	1658	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The remaining panels return to an analysis that I presented a couple of times before.	21.0	999.0
201609	1659	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	This analysis requires your longer-run projections, so I have results for only 16 participants.	21.0	999.0
201609	1660	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	Because a year has passed since I most recently did this exercise, I summarize the key steps in the box at the top right:  First, I estimate an IS equation that relates the unemployment gap (u minus u*) to its own lag and the lagged real rate gap, defined as the deviation of the real federal funds rate (r) from a time-varying equilibrium level (r*).	21.0	999.0
201609	1661	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	This equation has the property that, if the actual real rate were kept at its equilibrium level, the unemployment rate gap would close over time.	21.0	999.0
201609	1662	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The coefficients in this equation are estimated over the 1961–2014 period using data for the fourth quarter of each year, the staff’s estimates of u*, and estimates of r* taken from the Laubach-Williams model.	21.0	999.0
201609	1663	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	With the estimated coefficients in hand, I insert each participant’s projected values of the unemployment rate and the real federal funds rate, as well as his or her estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate, and solve the equation for the implied values of the time-varying r* at the end of each year from 2016 to 2019.	21.0	999.0
201609	1664	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	Note that, to calculate the implied r* for 2019, the equation requires assumptions regarding your unemployment rate forecasts for 2020.	21.0	999.0
201609	1665	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	For this exercise, I simply set them at their 2019 levels, but therefore the implied r* values for 2019 should be treated with caution.	21.0	999.0
201609	1666	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The implied values of each participant’s r* projections are plotted as the blue dots in the middle-left panel.	21.0	999.0
201609	1667	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	As always,reflecting the diversity of your views about the outlook and appropriate monetary policy, these estimates of r* show some dispersion.	21.0	999.0
201609	1668	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	In line with the views that many of you have expressed during recent meetings, the implied r* for almost all of you is 0.5 percent or lower at the end of 2016.	21.0	999.0
201609	1669	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	And, by these calculations, the implied r* remains low over the next several years.	21.0	999.0
201609	1670	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The median implied r* estimates (shown by the red diamonds) remain close to zero through 2018 before moving up to the longer-run value in 2019.	21.0	999.0
201609	1671	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The analysis I just presented suggests that the relevant measure of policy accommodation implicit in your individual SEPs is the gap at each point in time between your individual projections of the real federal funds rate and your implied time-varying equilibrium real rates.	21.0	999.0
201609	1672	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	These gaps are plotted in the middle right.	21.0	999.0
201609	1673	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	Although I don’t want to oversell the results of this simple analysis, it highlights three points that would likely hold under different approaches to measuring neutral rates and implied real rate gaps:  First, all of you view the stance of policy that you see as appropriate at the end of this year to be accommodative; second, the neutral real rate is expected to remain near zero over the next two years, and then move up by only a modest amount; and, finally, as illustrated in the bottom-left panel, the median path of the neutral rate implied by your projections has shifted down substantially over the past year.	21.0	999.0
201609	1674	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The footnote to that panel is correct—as the red line in the legend should be labeled “September 2016.”	21.0	999.0
201609	1675	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	Sorry about that.	21.0	999.0
201609	1676	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	As summarized in the bullets in the bottom right, the choices offered by the policy alternatives in front of you can be understood as emphasizing these three points to varying degrees.	21.0	999.0
201609	1677	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The policy strategy in alternative C would be warranted if the Committee was confident that the economy is now well positioned to achieve the outcomes for the labor market and inflation summarized in paragraph 2 of the statement, with an increase in the federal funds rate at today’s meeting followed by further gradual adjustments to the stance of policy.	21.0	999.0
201609	1678	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The sizable median real rate gap in 2016 shown in the middle right supports the view expressed by alternative C that policy would remain accommodative in the near term even after an increase in the funds rate tomorrow.	21.0	999.0
201609	1679	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	You might prefer alternative C if you judge that it is important to start narrowing this gap in order to limit the risk of falling “behind the curve” if the economy picks up more quickly than currently expected.	21.0	999.0
201609	1680	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The policy strategy in alternative A is grounded in a much less sanguine view of the economic outlook—that r* is low, perhaps well below zero, and likely to remain quite low for some time.	21.0	999.0
201609	1681	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	If that is the situation as you see it, you might deem it appropriate for the Committee to convey that it is in no rush to remove accommodation, and that the current level of policy accommodation is needed until inflation has moved closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis.	21.0	999.0
201609	1682	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The Committee could view the persistence of below-trend inflation even as the labor market has tightened and some signs of lower longer-term inflation expectations as having increased its uncertainty about the cyclical position of the economy—the natural rate of unemployment might be lower and the economy remains short of conditions that would lead to a step-up in inflation in the near term.	21.0	999.0
201609	1683	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	With alternative B, the Committee would acknowledge the mostly favorable economic and financial developments in recent months, including developments that might indicate that the labor market has a little more room to tighten than previously expected.	21.0	999.0
201609	1684	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative B would suggest that the Committee does not need much additional supporting evidence to conclude that another increase in the target range for the federal funds rate is warranted.	21.0	999.0
201609	1685	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	However, it would indicate that the Committee is deferring the next step in removing accommodation “for the time being.”	21.0	999.0
201609	1686	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	You might see waiting for some further evidence as appropriate in light of the successive downward revisions to medium- and longer-run r* in recent years, as well as the continued proximity to the effective lower bound.	21.0	999.0
201609	1687	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	That completes my prepared remarks.	21.0	999.0
201609	1688	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The July statement and the draft alternatives are shown on pages 3 to 11 of the handout.	21.0	999.0
201609	1689	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	I will be happy to take questions.	21.0	999.0
201609	1690	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201609	1691	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	22.0	65.0
201609	1692	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Thomas?	22.0	65.0
201609	1693	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Quiet group today.	22.0	65.0
201609	1695	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Very good.	52.0	65.0
201609	1696	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	52.0	65.0
201609	1697	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Well, seeing no questions, we’ve got a reception and dinner across the street that’s ready now, and we will resume our policy go-round tomorrow morning at 9:00 am September 21 Session .	52.0	65.0
201609	1698	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	52.0	65.0
201609	1699	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s get started.	52.0	65.0
201609	1700	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to call on Steve Kamin to discuss the Bank of Japan actions.	11.0	65.0
201609	1701	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11.0	999.0
201609	1702	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Obviously, my colleagues and I were just as shocked as you all were when we woke up to the news this morning.	11.0	999.0
201609	1703	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Who would have guessed that, after all of these years, Brad and Angelina would have finally split up?	11.0	999.0
201609	1704	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	[Laughter]	11.0	999.0
201609	1705	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	By comparison, the Bank of Japan’s announcement following its monetary policy meeting yesterday was more in line with expectations.	11.0	999.0
201609	1706	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Just to back up and reiterate what Paul Wood described yesterday, the Bank of Japan has basically been struggling with two main monetary control problems of late.	11.0	999.0
201609	1707	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	One of them is how to get inflation and inflation expectations back up to its 2 percent target.	11.0	999.0
201609	1708	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	And the second problem is how to do that without further flattening the yield curve and putting downward pressure on bank profits and those of pension funds, insurance companies, and other financial intermediaries.	11.0	999.0
201609	1709	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	In response to those concerns, the Bank of Japan launched the so-called comprehensive assessment project.	11.0	999.0
201609	1710	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	The outcome of that, which was announced last night, was basically two main elements of the program.	11.0	999.0
201609	1711	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	The first of these is a so-called inflation-overshooting commitment, in which the Bank of Japan commits itself to expand the monetary base until the observed rate of increase in the CPI exceeds 2 percent in a stable manner.	11.0	999.0
201609	1712	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Now, that has at least two, or maybe two and a half, distinctive elements.	11.0	999.0
201609	1713	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	The first of those is that the Bank of Japan basically abandoned a particular date at which it was predicting that it would achieve its 2 percent target.	11.0	999.0
201609	1714	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	The second aspect of that is that it committed not just to hit its target, but also to exceed it.	11.0	999.0
201609	1715	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	And the third was a slight clarification, being very explicit, that the QE program would continue until it achieved that slight overshoot.	11.0	999.0
201609	1716	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	It had had a soft commitment before to continuing the program until it got to its target.	11.0	999.0
201609	1717	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	But this made it a little bit more concrete.	11.0	999.0
201609	1718	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	That was the first aspect of its announcement.	11.0	999.0
201609	1719	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	The second aspect was a so-called yield curve control aspect.	11.0	999.0
201609	1720	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Basically, that involved a commitment to control both the short-term and the long-term aspects of the yield curve in order to prevent a shallowing of the yield curve that would put excessive pressure on financial industry profits.	11.0	999.0
201609	1721	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	In particular, the Bank of Japan committed to keep the 10-year yield at zero.	11.0	999.0
201609	1722	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	It had previously been below zero.	11.0	999.0
201609	1723	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Then it announced a number of technical measures that might be used to achieve that, including buying JGBs at a fixed interest rate and even making low fixed- rate loans up to 10 years’ maturity.	11.0	999.0
201609	1724	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	In the event, that was the basic framework that the Bank of Japan announced.	11.0	999.0
201609	1725	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	It didn’t really announce any concrete new actions immediately or for the future, but the framework is broadly consistent with our earlier forecast that the Bank of Japan would continue to make heavy QE purchases over the next several years and might, in certain situations—greater weakness— lower the near-term policy rate further into negative territory.	11.0	999.0
201609	1726	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	But neither of those actions was taken today.	11.0	999.0
201609	1727	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	The announcement was, broadly speaking, in line with market expectations.	11.0	999.0
201609	1728	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	In response, the JGB yield moved a little bit—for the 10-year, a little further up, although it’s still a little bit negative.	11.0	999.0
201609	1729	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	The basic index of stock prices in Japan rose about 2 percent.	11.0	999.0
201609	1730	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Commercial bank stocks rose a lot more, around 7 percent.	11.0	999.0
201609	1731	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	The yen initially weakened, which was presumably part of the goal of the program, but actually has subsequently strengthened.	11.0	999.0
201609	1732	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Right now, it’s actually slightly stronger than it was before the announcement for reasons that are a little bit unclear.	11.0	999.0
201609	1733	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Global markets have pretty much taken everything in stride.	11.0	999.0
201609	1734	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Foreign stock prices are up a bit.	11.0	999.0
201609	1735	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	I think US futures are little changed, and US yields are little changed, too.	11.0	999.0
201609	1736	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	So that’s what I have for you.	11.0	999.0
201609	1737	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	I’d be happy to take any of your questions.	11.0	999.0
201609	1738	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	12.0	65.0
201609	1739	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	In the press release, I saw they talked about keeping their 10-year at zero, associated with bond buying.	12.0	110.0
201609	1740	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	But it struck me:  Won’t they need to sell the 10-year to keep the rate at zero?	12.0	110.0
201609	1741	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	I think the answer could well be “yes,” but they were not explicit on that point.	12.0	999.0
201609	1742	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Okay.	12.0	110.0
201609	1743	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	So they could do either, and people are anticipating they could actually sell the 10-year, if necessary.	12.0	110.0
201609	1744	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	I don’t know that people are expecting that, but it is a natural question to ask.	12.0	999.0
201609	1745	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	There are no details yet.	12.0	999.0
201609	1746	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	I think, at the end of the month, they’ll release more details.	12.0	999.0
201609	1747	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Okay, got it.	12.0	110.0
201609	1748	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any other questions?	12.0	65.0
201609	1749	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	12.0	65.0
201609	1750	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Steve, are you willing to speculate on any spillover onto our yield curve?	12.0	88.0
201609	1751	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	A few weeks ago, the Wall Street Journal, I believe, carried an article that talked about major Japanese institutions essentially buying the long end of our curve, hedged.	12.0	88.0
201609	1752	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	At that time, they were concerned that if the hedges expired and they went off hedge, it could have some effect on the yield curve here in the United States.	12.0	88.0
201609	1753	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	How should we think about this affecting financial conditions and the dollar?	12.0	88.0
201609	1754	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	I guess what I’d say is that if their actions had involved a much more substantial change in their target for yields—for example, if their goal was to drive 10-year JGB yields up to 25 or 50 basis points—you could imagine that actually having a material effect on capital flows and leading to some upward pressure on our longer-term yields and perhaps downward pressure on the dollar.	12.0	999.0
201609	1755	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	But so far, as they are targeting the 10-year yield at zero, which is only a little bit higher than it had been, it doesn’t seem like the changes that are in store are large enough, at least for now, to make a material difference for the dollar or our yields.	12.0	999.0
201609	1756	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Again, this announcement is more like a backup or contingency plan just in case the yield curve was to get too shallow again.	12.0	999.0
201609	1757	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions?	12.0	65.0
201609	1758	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	12.0	65.0
201609	1759	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	But doesn’t that constrain their ability to actually go more negative?	12.0	90.0
201609	1760	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Presumably, if you’re fixing the 10-year rate at zero, people can go in and out of the 10-year at zero risk as long as that peg is on.	12.0	90.0
201609	1761	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	So, as they lower the short end of the market, you’d assume there’d be no trading at the short end.	12.0	90.0
201609	1762	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	People would just be buying at the 10-year maturity.	12.0	90.0
201609	1763	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Am I missing something?	12.0	90.0
201609	1764	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Well, let’s put it this way.	12.0	999.0
201609	1765	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	I think the goal is to anchor the long end so that the yield does not fall too much, giving them the freedom, in some sense, to lower the short end even further into negative territory.	12.0	999.0
201609	1766	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	In their announcement, further down in the text, they talk about their view that Japanese economic performance is more influenced by short- and medium-term yields than by longer-term yields, with the longer-term yields being the ones that might, if they fall, negatively affect the financial industry.	12.0	999.0
201609	1767	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Who’s the marginal investor that would choose to be at the short end rather than at the long end, in which they can go in and out at will as long as there is rate pegging?	12.0	90.0
201609	1768	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The point is, you’re reducing the risk of moving to a 10-year instrument.	12.0	96.0
201609	1769	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	They haven’t shown that they can actually do it yet.	12.0	999.0
201609	1770	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	So that would be part of it.	12.0	999.0
201609	1771	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	I think your point is well made.	12.0	999.0
201609	1772	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Suddenly, it makes the 10-year look like a great risk-free investment.	12.0	999.0
201609	1773	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Although your prospects for capital gains on the 10-year will go away.	12.0	96.0
201609	1774	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	It could be argued before that if you thought Japan was going to continue to go into deflation and 10-year yields could keep falling, they had a capital-gains component—which they’re taking off the table now.	12.0	96.0
201609	1775	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think it’s pretty complicated to see how people react to this, frankly.	12.0	96.0
201609	1776	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	If it is credible—you’d be taking the capital gains off it.	12.0	999.0
201609	1777	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any further questions?	12.0	65.0
201609	1778	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	12.0	65.0
201609	1779	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12.0	65.0
201609	1780	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	If I might, I’d like to start off our policy go-round, and I want to emphasize that today’s decision is not an easy one.	23.0	65.0
201609	1781	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	On the basis of the data in hand, one person may reasonably conclude that the economic outlook and associated risks argue for an increase in the target range today, while another looking at the same information reasonably decides that holding off is the better strategy.	23.0	65.0
201609	1782	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	In contrast to many of our previous meetings, the appropriate policy decision today is not clear cut.	23.0	65.0
201609	1783	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	This ambiguity is reflected in alternatives B and C, which present essentially the same characterization of the incoming data and the economic outlook yet arrive at different conclusions about what action we should take.	23.0	65.0
201609	1784	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	We may not all agree on today’s decision, but I think, in line with the SEP, that most of us will be inclined to support an increase in the federal funds rate before year-end if the economy continues along its current trajectory, with economic growth picking up as expected, continued solid employment gains, an absence of notable downside inflation surprises, and the emergence of no significant new risks.	23.0	65.0
201609	1785	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	If this assessment is correct, we should be careful not to exaggerate the consequences of raising the federal funds rate now as opposed to in an upcoming meeting.	23.0	65.0
201609	1786	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	My recommendation for today is not to move and to adopt alternative B, teeing up a likely move in December if things move along their current course.	23.0	65.0
201609	1787	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	But why not move now,as the economic consequences of tightening today instead of waiting until December are probably minimal?	23.0	65.0
201609	1788	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	At our July meeting, after all, I said that raising the target range in September would likely be appropriate if we saw reasonably strong payroll gains in July and August, which we have, and the overall outlook remained favorable, which it has.	23.0	65.0
201609	1789	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	And, at the Jackson Hole symposium, I said that the case for tightening had strengthened.	23.0	65.0
201609	1790	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Still, despite the generally satisfactory state of current conditions, I recommend that we hold off raising the funds rate for the moment for two reasons.	23.0	65.0
201609	1791	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	First, incoming data suggest to me that we have a bit more running room than I’d anticipated, and I see little danger that monetary policy is falling “behind the curve.”	23.0	65.0
201609	1792	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	As I said yesterday, some slack still remains in the labor market.	23.0	65.0
201609	1793	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Utilization appears to be increasing at a relatively slow pace.	23.0	65.0
201609	1794	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	There are few signs of emerging inflationary pressures, and inflation continues to run below our objective.	23.0	65.0
201609	1795	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Under these conditions, we can afford to proceed patiently, and doing so will promote additional labor market improvements and so speed the return to 2 percent inflation.	23.0	65.0
201609	1796	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’ll have ample time to adjust policy in the event the economy shows signs of becoming overheated.	23.0	65.0
201609	1797	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	After all, as long as we remain in a low-r* environment, it won’t take very many rate increases to get back to a neutral policy stance.	23.0	65.0
201609	1798	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Furthermore, a moderately tight labor market might also pull more people back into the labor force than we anticipate, and that’s a potential supply-side benefit that we shouldn’t close off prematurely.	23.0	65.0
201609	1799	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Indeed, as I noted yesterday, we have seen solid employment growth over the past year without significant declines in either U-3 or U-6.	23.0	65.0
201609	1800	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Over the past year, the labor market seems to have had more room to improve without creating inflation pressures than I’d expected.	23.0	65.0
201609	1801	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	This is an important reason why I’m inclined, in the words of alternative B, “for the time being, to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward [our] objectives.”	23.0	65.0
201609	1802	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Second, I consider waiting until we’ve seen somewhat more progress on our objectives advisable on risk-management grounds.	23.0	65.0
201609	1803	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	If economic growth in the second half of the year was to turn out to be stronger than I anticipate or if we were to begin seeing signs of accelerating wages and prices, we would have ample opportunity to respond appropriately over the course of 2017 and beyond.	23.0	65.0
201609	1804	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	But if economic conditions were instead to turn out to be weaker than expected or if downside risks to the outlook were to emerge, then we would probably regret having decided to move today.	23.0	65.0
201609	1805	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	After all, the surprising events that we’ve encountered so far this year—turmoil in global financial markets, wild month-to-month swings in the data, and Brexit— demonstrate that bumps in the road are common and the concerns related to the effective lower bound are not to be dismissed.	23.0	65.0
201609	1806	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	And this is especially true in an environment in which we find ourselves repeatedly lowering our estimates of r*.	23.0	65.0
201609	1807	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	While I strongly believe that economic performance has been well served by our caution in raising interest rates thus far this year, we clearly can’t delay too long because policy does need to be forward looking.	23.0	65.0
201609	1808	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	If labor market conditions improve somewhat further in coming months, as I expect, then a December rate hike will, in all likelihood, be warranted to reduce the risk of the unemployment rate markedly undershooting its longer-run level in 2017 and beyond.	23.0	65.0
201609	1809	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	I think an increase will be appropriate even if inflation readings remain near their current levels, as I expect.	23.0	65.0
201609	1810	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	The language in alternative B is meant to convey this expectation for policy.	23.0	65.0
201609	1811	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	I recognize that the phrase “for the time being” is essentially a calendar-based reference, but I think, in the current circumstances, we need to be clear in our intentions.	23.0	65.0
201609	1812	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Softening this language by just saying that policy will be data dependent would, in my view, only increase confusion about our reaction function and intentions.	23.0	65.0
201609	1813	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	So let me stop there, and our next speaker is President Williams.	23.0	65.0
201609	1814	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	102.0
201609	1815	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I favor alternative C.	23.0	102.0
201609	1816	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’re at full employment, the labor market is robust, and inflation is on a path to meet our 2 percent target over the medium term.	23.0	102.0
201609	1817	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Interestingly, as you just said, this is the characterization of the economy in both alternatives B and C.	23.0	102.0
201609	1818	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	In arguing for an increase in interest rates, I want to emphasize that I’m not seeking to derail the economic expansion.	23.0	102.0
201609	1819	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s exactly the opposite.	23.0	102.0
201609	1820	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	My aim is to keep it on a sound footing so that it can be sustained for a long time.	23.0	102.0
201609	1821	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I do worry that further delays in raising rates increase the risk of unintended consequences down the road.	23.0	102.0
201609	1822	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, we had a good start of a discussion yesterday.	23.0	102.0
201609	1823	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Governor Tarullo, President Rosengren, President Evans, President George, and I all commented on this issue, and I always like it when a conversation breaks out at the meeting.	23.0	102.0
201609	1824	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	23.0	102.0
201609	1825	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So that’s a good thing.	23.0	102.0
201609	1826	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I do look to see more work coming from the staff on these issues about these unintended consequences of waiting too long.	23.0	102.0
201609	1827	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do think we have to be humble about our understanding of that.	23.0	102.0
201609	1828	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yesterday there was a little bit of going through, recession by recession, and finding, well, that was because of this, and that was because of that.	23.0	102.0
201609	1829	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think we don’t truly understand the dynamics surrounding recessions.	23.0	102.0
201609	1830	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m taken back to an event that happened to me that has stuck with me ever since.	23.0	102.0
201609	1831	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	That was when I was on the staff of the Council of Economic Advisers sometime in 1999 or 2000—I can’t remember exactly when.	23.0	102.0
201609	1832	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	But then-Chairman Greenspan came and gave an impromptu talk about recessions in the hallway of the Old Executive Office Building.	23.0	102.0
201609	1833	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	It was interesting because, of course, at the time we were well along the way of the longest expansion in the history of the US economy.	23.0	102.0
201609	1834	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Everything was looking great.	23.0	102.0
201609	1835	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	And his talk was basically that we don’t understand the dynamics of the economy when it’s in recession.	23.0	102.0
201609	1836	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	He emphasized the nonlinear aspects of how things happen when the economy, for whatever reason, goes off the cliff.	23.0	102.0
201609	1837	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	He also emphasized that our linear models—of course, at the time, that’s what my day job was, working on the FRB/US model—are good at capturing the dynamics during expansions and normal times, but, during recessions, they don’t capture the dynamics there.	23.0	102.0
201609	1838	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think David Wilcox mentioned that one of the facts we don’t understand is, why does unemployment move very gradually down, but, when it moves up, it moves up very sharply?	23.0	102.0
201609	1839	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even back then, I remember talking in 2000 about this little factoid—that you never see unemployment rates move up by any significant amount without there being a recession.	23.0	102.0
201609	1840	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I think we should be humble in our understanding of the dynamics.	23.0	102.0
201609	1841	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s not the case that I think we should just be looking at, well, monetary policy causes recessions.	23.0	102.0
201609	1842	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think imbalances form when the economy runs too hot for too long.	23.0	102.0
201609	1843	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Those can happen in a multitude of different ways, and the dynamics of that are hard to understand.	23.0	102.0
201609	1844	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, in thinking about risk management, we have to take seriously the fact that if we do drive the unemployment rate down to 4.2 percent or 4 percent, or even lower, then those risks would grow significantly.	23.0	102.0
201609	1845	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	At this point, our policy stance already incorporates a significant amount of delay, and that’s illustrated in the optimal control simulations in Tealbook B.	23.0	102.0
201609	1846	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	For instance, if you have a minimal weight on rate adjustments—this artificial cost of moving the funds rate around—the optimal control simulation calls for a 350 basis point increase in the funds rate by the end of next year.	23.0	102.0
201609	1847	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	That just shows you how big the gap is between where we would be in optimal control, given the objective, and where we are today in that simulation.	23.0	102.0
201609	1848	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, importantly, that simulation ignores uncertainty.	23.0	102.0
201609	1849	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, again, it just shows you how heavily we already are weighing risk-management arguments in the current stance of policy.	23.0	102.0
201609	1850	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	If you look at another optimal control simulation that does penalize rate adjustments— you might think of this as a proxy for a cautious approach—it projects a lower path of the funds rate.	23.0	102.0
201609	1851	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	But even there, the simulation has two rate increases this year and has us reaching the long-run neutral rate by the end of next year.	23.0	102.0
201609	1852	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, again, I think these optimal control simulations provide some context for thinking about, absent risk management and other asymmetries, where we would be, and then you can adjust from there.	23.0	102.0
201609	1853	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	More concretely, the median SEP forecast back in June called for two 25 basis point rate increases.	23.0	102.0
201609	1854	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Since then, strong employment gains have resumed, the Brexit vote has passed without any near-term consequences, inflation data have been basically right what we thought, equity markets have risen, and there’s really been very little movement in the dollar.	23.0	102.0
201609	1855	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	There’s been a notable decrease in the spread between high- and low-grade corporate debt, and that could reflect some increased search-for-yield activity.	23.0	102.0
201609	1856	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Taken together, financial conditions are easier than in June, and the risks of getting “behind the curve” loom larger.	23.0	102.0
201609	1857	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Accordingly, at this meeting, I support alternative C as written.	23.0	102.0
201609	1858	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I actually do understand that that’s not the decision the Committee will likely make today.	23.0	102.0
201609	1859	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	In that light, I would comment on the language in alternative B.	23.0	102.0
201609	1860	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	In view of the decision that’s going to be made, I think the language in alternative B is about the best that can be hoped for in explaining the reasoning for today’s decision for further delay.	23.0	102.0
201609	1861	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Madam Chair, I think your description of the reasoning makes sense.	23.0	102.0
201609	1862	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	It takes an appropriately positive stand on the economy and its direction, consistent with our policy goals and longer-run strategy statement and our past FOMC statements.	23.0	102.0
201609	1863	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Importantly, it does not introduce new hurdles or conditions for future action.	23.0	102.0
201609	1864	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, again, I think that the statement is about as good as I could hope for at this juncture.	23.0	102.0
201609	1865	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23.0	102.0
201609	1866	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	1867	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	23.0	65.0
201609	1868	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201609	1869	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	My views are actually quite consistent with what President Williams just laid out.	23.0	90.0
201609	1870	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would say that I would also endorse his view that it would be quite worthwhile to have a discussion of what the likelihood and costs of possibly overshooting are.	23.0	90.0
201609	1871	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think those comments were made by Governor Tarullo and Vice Chairman Dudley yesterday, and I think that that would be a very good discussion to have.	23.0	90.0
201609	1872	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	For this meeting, I support alternative C.	23.0	90.0
201609	1873	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Since our last tightening in December, we have made significant progress toward achieving our dual mandate.	23.0	90.0
201609	1874	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	We have added more than 1 million jobs since the beginning of the year.	23.0	90.0
201609	1875	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	As evidence that labor markets have tightened relative to earlier in the recovery, wages have risen gradually above the 2 percent level that they seemed stuck at earlier.	23.0	90.0
201609	1876	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Core PCE inflation was running between 1.3 and 1.4 percent and is now at 1.6 percent.	23.0	90.0
201609	1877	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	This progress has occurred despite significant headwinds from abroad, including a slowdown in China, a surprising Brexit vote, and continued European banking problems.	23.0	90.0
201609	1878	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Based solely on the economic progress since our last tightening, a further increase in rates could easily be justified.	23.0	90.0
201609	1879	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is in the forecast, however, that the case for raising rates at this meeting becomes even more compelling.	23.0	90.0
201609	1880	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	The Tealbook’s and my own forecast expect that by 2019, the unemployment rate will have dropped to 4.2 percent despite an assumption that monetary policy accommodation is more aggressively removed.	23.0	90.0
201609	1881	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	As I highlighted yesterday, such overshoots in the past have always been followed by recessions, as the unsustainably low unemployment rate begins to generate higher inflation rates, rising asset prices, or both.	23.0	90.0
201609	1882	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Driving the unemployment rate to such a low level goes well beyond probing on full employment.	23.0	90.0
201609	1883	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	We should aim for a long and durable recovery.	23.0	90.0
201609	1884	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	A significant overshoot of full employment places the recovery in jeopardy.	23.0	90.0
201609	1885	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	We now have the ability to raise rates gradually and gently probe to find the level of full employment.	23.0	90.0
201609	1886	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	But our ability to gently probe shrinks the longer we defer action.	23.0	90.0
201609	1887	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Failure to continue the gradual removal of accommodation now could ultimately require us to raise rates faster and more aggressively, which could shorten rather than lengthen the duration of this expansion.	23.0	90.0
201609	1888	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, I am arguing for tightening now out of a concern that not doing so today will put the recovery at greater risk.	23.0	90.0
201609	1889	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201609	1890	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	1891	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23.0	65.0
201609	1892	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	81.0
201609	1893	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	At our July meeting, I argued that our policy rate should be moving back toward a more normal level because estimated gaps for both inflation and real activity are currently quite small.	23.0	81.0
201609	1894	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Economic conditions have not changed materially since our July meeting, so I believe an increase in our policy rates is appropriate today.	23.0	81.0
201609	1895	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Accordingly, I support alternative C.	23.0	81.0
201609	1896	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	I’d argue the delay represents an increasingly significant departure from our past behavior.	23.0	81.0
201609	1897	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	At our July meeting, I made reference to parametric policy rules that support the case for raising rates.	23.0	81.0
201609	1898	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Those benchmark reaction functions—Taylor rules, if you will—do a good job of describing our behavior during past periods in which monetary policy seems to have been effective.	23.0	81.0
201609	1899	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	It’s important to emphasize that these are relevant whether or not you believe that we are following a Taylor rule or we make direct reference to a Taylor rule in the formulation of policy then or now.	23.0	81.0
201609	1900	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	We may have thought of ourselves as looking at everything and setting policy optimally in the past, but whatever we were doing gave rise to the fact—the clear fact—that Taylor rules do a good job of characterizing the statistical relationship between those gap variables on the right-hand side and our policy-setting.	23.0	81.0
201609	1901	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	So, to behave in a way that generates a significant variance between those relationships that are captured in the data suggests that we are departing from past policy-setting principles, whatever those principles were and whatever we founded them on.	23.0	81.0
201609	1902	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Even after adjusting the econometric estimates for the downward trend in the natural real rate of interest, rates ought to be substantially higher than they are now, according to these benchmarks.	23.0	81.0
201609	1903	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	For example, the two non-inertial Taylor rules shown in the Tealbook both show values above 2¼ percent.	23.0	81.0
201609	1904	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Those implementations use the staff’s assumed r* value of ¾ percent.	23.0	81.0
201609	1905	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Using the current estimates of basically zero from Lubik-Matthes or Laubach-Williams, you still get values around 1½ percent.	23.0	81.0
201609	1906	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	These benchmark rules take into account the degree to which a shortfall of inflation from our goal would, in the past, stay our hand.	23.0	81.0
201609	1907	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	So even if we account for our core inflation running around 1.6 percent, past practice indicates that an increase in the funds rate target today is well warranted.	23.0	81.0
201609	1908	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Those benchmark rules capture the extent to which we’ve consistently tightened policy in the past as labor market slack was eliminated in order to preclude having to raise rates precipitously later on and risk inducing a recession, as President Rosengren alluded to.	23.0	81.0
201609	1909	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Presidents Rosengren and Williams have spoken convincingly about this risk in public in recent weeks, as did you, Madam Chair, last December.	23.0	81.0
201609	1910	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	In the SEP submissions for our December 2015 meeting, the median funds rate for the end of this year was 1.3 percent, which would have represented four further rate increases.	23.0	81.0
201609	1911	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	That path would have closed a good part of the gap between actual rates and our benchmark.	23.0	81.0
201609	1912	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Presumably, those rate increases would have occurred at the press conference meetings in March, June, September, and December.	23.0	81.0
201609	1913	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Instead, a series of special factors emerged, which caused us to delay raising rates.	23.0	81.0
201609	1914	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	In March it was global market turbulence, and in June it was the May employment report and looming Brexit risks.	23.0	81.0
201609	1915	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	These concerns might have been plausible and reasonable at the time, but the downside risks failed to materialize.	23.0	81.0
201609	1916	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Actual economic data since December have been close to what we expected, and the outlook for employment and inflation is relatively unchanged as well.	23.0	81.0
201609	1917	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The usefulness of Taylor rules as policy guides is not inconsistent with temporary departures.	23.0	81.0
201609	1918	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	After all, the historical fit is seldom perfect, and the residuals presumably reflect outlook-relevant information to which policymakers responded beyond what was captured by the usual right-hand-side gap variable.	23.0	81.0
201609	1919	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Nonetheless, a more substantial and sizable—a more persistent—departure from how we behaved in the past would be problematic.	23.0	81.0
201609	1920	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Inflation expectations rest squarely on beliefs about how we are likely to respond to future developments.	23.0	81.0
201609	1921	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	While our communications can play a useful role in fostering public understanding of our likely future responses, actions generally speak louder than words.	23.0	81.0
201609	1922	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Accumulated observations on our past conduct are likely to be the critical determinant of public beliefs about our behavior.	23.0	81.0
201609	1923	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	New observations that conflict with expectations will ultimately result in shifts in beliefs, and those shifts could be sudden and unpredictable.	23.0	81.0
201609	1924	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Such shifts would pose a real risk to the stability of inflation expectations.	23.0	81.0
201609	1925	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Holding steady yet again at this meeting would represent a substantial and persistent movement away from how we’ve typically behaved in similar circumstances.	23.0	81.0
201609	1926	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	It would represent not only a deviation from the behavior that served us well in the past, but also a deviation from the behavior that in December we led markets to expect this year.	23.0	81.0
201609	1927	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	No obvious disturbances at hand that would justify such a departure, and the clear implication is that a discrete shift in our policy reaction function is in train.	23.0	81.0
201609	1928	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	In particular, we would appear to be moving away from preemption, the defining element of the strategy that ushered in the current multidecade period of inflation stability that we now take for granted.	23.0	81.0
201609	1929	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Preemption meant raising rates before inflation began rising precipitously.	23.0	81.0
201609	1930	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	It meant raising rates before we run out of running room.	23.0	81.0
201609	1931	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	In attempting to wring out slack, we seem to be implicitly adopting a reaction function that places heavy reliance on our ability to tighten policy just in time in response to accelerating inflation.	23.0	81.0
201609	1932	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The current quiescence of inflation and inflation expectations suggests that markets may be sanguine about our shifting policy strategy, but history suggests that this is cold comfort.	23.0	81.0
201609	1933	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Erosion of credibility occurs most often after the application of too much stimulus rather than before or during.	23.0	81.0
201609	1934	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	I recognize the legitimate concern that the asymmetric effectiveness of our policy instrument in a low-natural-rate environment makes the risks to our objective skewed to the downside.	23.0	81.0
201609	1935	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	But I believe that a later-but-faster strategy of moving little unless inflation pressures actually emerge gives rise to risks that are skewed heavily in the other direction, and, for me, the latter outweigh the former.	23.0	81.0
201609	1936	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	1937	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23.0	65.0
201609	1938	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201609	1939	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	I think the decision to raise the policy rate at this meeting versus later this year is a close call.	23.0	88.0
201609	1940	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	In the big scheme of things, an increase at this meeting, as opposed to the November or December meeting, won’t matter much in its effect on the real economy.	23.0	88.0
201609	1941	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Therefore, exercising my prerogative as a nonvoter, I’m prepared to support either alternative B or alternative C, and I won’t vehemently oppose waiting until December.	23.0	88.0
201609	1942	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	On the basis of the data in hand and progress toward objectives in my forecast for the second half of this year and 2017, I believe there’s a good data-dependent case for at least one increase this year.	23.0	88.0
201609	1943	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	My criteria are growth of real GDP and of employment at rates consistent with absorbing remaining resource slack over the forecast horizon.	23.0	88.0
201609	1944	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	I’ve also been looking for indications that wage growth is picking up.	23.0	88.0
201609	1945	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	I see those conditions as being satisfied by the third- quarter data we now have in hand.	23.0	88.0
201609	1946	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Because the probable decision today is alternative B, I’d like to comment on some implications as I see the situation for the next two meetings.	23.0	88.0
201609	1947	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	The case for waiting, as I see it, is to accumulate more data evidence that the current read on third-quarter activity is not a head fake and progress toward our objectives will be sustained into the fourth quarter.	23.0	88.0
201609	1948	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	In light of some weaker signals in the very recent incoming data, I see the wisdom of this approach.	23.0	88.0
201609	1949	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	But the forward lean in paragraph 3 of alternative B naturally raises the question of, at what point over the next two meetings will we likely have accumulated enough evidence that we remain on track to pull the trigger on a rate increase?	23.0	88.0
201609	1950	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Looking to the data calendar, by the November meeting, we will have just one more employment report.	23.0	88.0
201609	1951	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	By the December meeting, we will have two more employment reports.	23.0	88.0
201609	1952	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Otherwise, we will not have a lot of information on the fourth quarter, particularly about economic growth or inflation.	23.0	88.0
201609	1953	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	If December is the date we have in mind, it strikes me that labor market developments, therefore, will be the determining factor in the decision.	23.0	88.0
201609	1954	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	In view of the forward lean in the alternative B draft statement, it’s desirable to have a common understanding of what data will be required to make a “go” or “no go” call and when we will have that data in hand.	23.0	88.0
201609	1955	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Without that understanding, I’m concerned that the Committee is inviting communications challenges on the question of why we passed on this meeting—and might pass on the November meeting, if that’s what we choose to do.	23.0	88.0
201609	1956	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	I have some reservations about delaying a rate increase decision to December.	23.0	88.0
201609	1957	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	My reservations relate to risk events that could be timed to be around the December meeting.	23.0	88.0
201609	1958	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Although the date has not yet been set, there’s a possibility the Italian constitutional referendum could be scheduled around the time of our meeting.	23.0	88.0
201609	1959	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	The Italian referendum is considered by some observers to be critical to the future of the EU.	23.0	88.0
201609	1960	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Closer to home, there’s a chance that the continuing resolution expected to be passed by the Congress before the elections will expire on or about December 9.	23.0	88.0
201609	1961	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Depending on election results, there could be another budget showdown just before we meet.	23.0	88.0
201609	1962	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	These are events that could create a lot of volatility in financial markets and an awkward environment for a rate hike, even if the data play out in a satisfactory way.	23.0	88.0
201609	1963	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Let me emphasize that I’m not projecting that market noise and volatility associated with these transitory events will materially affect inflation and employment outcomes.	23.0	88.0
201609	1964	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Brexit passed with little apparent effect on the real economy of the United States.	23.0	88.0
201609	1965	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	But even if the economic fundamentals are satisfactory for a policy action, the Committee might be hesitant, as we were in June.	23.0	88.0
201609	1966	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	At some point, repeatedly backing off, even if justified by developments, will hurt the Committee’s credibility.	23.0	88.0
201609	1967	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	So I am not opposed to waiting until December, but, with these concerns I’ve expressed, I’m trying to assume an “eyes wide open” mindset.	23.0	88.0
201609	1968	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201609	1969	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	1970	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	23.0	65.0
201609	1971	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201609	1972	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Because of my fairly upbeat outlook for the economy and the slow but persistent march of inflation to target, I could easily support a funds rate increase at this meeting.	23.0	999.0
201609	1973	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	However, due to a variety of risks, including heightened political and subsequent policy uncertainty, I can see this case for being a bit cautious.	23.0	999.0
201609	1974	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	However, I don’t view the language in alternative B as sufficiently indicative of a funds rate increase by December.	23.0	999.0
201609	1975	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	I actually preferred the original draft language.	23.0	999.0
201609	1976	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	I felt it more clearly communicated a predilection for a rate hike in the near future.	23.0	999.0
201609	1977	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	My reading of that language was that, absent a significant departure from our expectations of how the economy will evolve, we would be raising the funds rate this year.	23.0	999.0
201609	1978	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	The revised language seems a bit more guarded and hedged, which makes me somewhat uncomfortable.	23.0	999.0
201609	1979	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	The current statement acknowledges an improved outlook for the economy and a balanced assessment of risks but remains vague about what it would take for the Committee to raise rates.	23.0	999.0
201609	1980	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	What further evidence do we need for us to move?	23.0	999.0
201609	1981	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Do we need to hit our inflation target or continue to see it evolving in line with the Tealbook forecast—or just be more sure that we will not see any disinflation between now and the end of the year?	23.0	999.0
201609	1982	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	I think we should be clearly signaling that if economic growth appears to be attaining its projected rate, we would very likely raise rates this year.	23.0	999.0
201609	1983	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Now, of course, the signal can be delivered outside of this statement via the press conference and speeches that we all give.	23.0	999.0
201609	1984	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	And we often put too much emphasis on the words in one single statement.	23.0	999.0
201609	1985	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	But I do think it’s important that we begin to move the market probability of a rate increase this year.	23.0	999.0
201609	1986	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Thus, taking that into consideration, I can live with the current alternative B language, although, again, I preferred the original draft language.	23.0	999.0
201609	1987	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	It’s not overly important whether we act today, as several of my colleagues have said, or in the very near future.	23.0	999.0
201609	1988	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	What’s important is that the signal we deliver today and in the future will, in itself, start the process and will achieve some measure of tightening in financial markets that will start to move those probabilities.	23.0	999.0
201609	1989	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	So if economic data materialize in line with the staff forecast, it is very important, in my view—I echo President Lockhart—and I think it’s important to the credibility of the Committee, that we act this year.	23.0	999.0
201609	1990	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	I think it’s important that we send a strong signal today and in the future that we will.	23.0	999.0
201609	1991	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201609	1992	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	1993	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23.0	65.0
201609	1994	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201609	1995	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	In my opinion, normalization is not going well.	23.0	94.0
201609	1996	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I think our normalization program is, in fact, on the rocks.	23.0	94.0
201609	1997	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We began the year expecting four increases in the policy rate.	23.0	94.0
201609	1998	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We’re going to end the year with one or possibly no increases in the policy rate.	23.0	94.0
201609	1999	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Moving once a year is not a normalization program.	23.0	94.0
201609	2000	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We should quit describing it as such.	23.0	94.0
201609	2001	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	It would take eight years to go 200 basis points.	23.0	94.0
201609	2002	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	That’s way outside of any business cycle time with which we’re familiar.	23.0	94.0
201609	2003	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	This, in my opinion, is very damaging to the credibility of the Committee, and I worry that now we may not have credibility when we actually need it in the future.	23.0	94.0
201609	2004	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	The real ex post rate on government paper is very low.	23.0	94.0
201609	2005	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We should be looking at this rate, which we’re calling r† in St Louis, as the key rate because there are other assets in the economy.	23.0	94.0
201609	2006	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	It’s not clear that all real rates of return are low.	23.0	94.0
201609	2007	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	In particular, rates of return on capital right out of the GDP accounts have not fallen nearly as much as real rates of return on government paper.	23.0	94.0
201609	2008	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	The slow growth in the US economy is largely driven by slow productivity growth.	23.0	94.0
201609	2009	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	So we should treat this as a regime.	23.0	94.0
201609	2010	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	It’s almost like thinking of it as a steady state, except that you’re acknowledging you can pop out of that steady state at some point in the future.	23.0	94.0
201609	2011	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	The implication of viewing things this way is that the market-based expectations of what this Committee will do are ratified, and you get a view of future rates that is more realistic versus thinking in terms of the Taylor (1999) policy rule.	23.0	94.0
201609	2012	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	The policy rate increase last December packed a punch much larger than anticipated.	23.0	94.0
201609	2013	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Global market turmoil increased substantially, and, in my opinion, this was because the one rate hike was accompanied by a projection of four additional increases during 2016.	23.0	94.0
201609	2014	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	This event made me think that we have the wrong model, and I’m sympathetic with President Williams’s comments just now about how out of line with reality some of the things we’re looking at in our optimal control exercises are.	23.0	94.0
201609	2015	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We should think in terms of this slow-growth, low real interest rate regime that corresponds more closely to reality.	23.0	94.0
201609	2016	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We should design policy for the regime we’re in.	23.0	94.0
201609	2017	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Policy should be regime dependent.	23.0	94.0
201609	2018	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	The mean reversion to the so-called normality of the past gets de-emphasized appropriately in this type of formulation.	23.0	94.0
201609	2019	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Under this interpretation, the current policy rate is only slightly less than neutral, and cyclical dynamics coming from the 2007–09 period are completely exhausted.	23.0	94.0
201609	2020	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	There would be no reason to change the policy rate very much in the foreseeable future provided no further major shocks occur.	23.0	94.0
201609	2021	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Major shocks would be regime switches in this formulation.	23.0	94.0
201609	2022	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Instead of thinking of the current policy rate as being far out of position, we can think of the current policy rate as being about rightunder the regime.	23.0	94.0
201609	2023	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I think this is much closer to what markets are thinking and is more appropriate for our situation.	23.0	94.0
201609	2024	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I also think that we should incorporate some thinking along this line in future Tealbook exercises.	23.0	94.0
201609	2025	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	At a minimum, I suggest an alternative simulation with the market expectation of the future policy rate instead of the Taylor (1999) rule, which has become increasingly irrelevant as a benchmark.	23.0	94.0
201609	2026	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I presume that the Board staff’s model—the FRB/US model—and other models would predict that bad things would happen in that scenario.	23.0	94.0
201609	2027	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I think it’s important for this Committee to understand what those bad things are so that we can weight them appropriately, and this feeds into some of the discussion around the table yesterday.	23.0	94.0
201609	2028	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	One could go a step further and feed into the staff model a different regime just by changing the steady state.	23.0	94.0
201609	2029	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	That isn’t really the appropriate way to do it, but it’s a quick and dirty way to do it.	23.0	94.0
201609	2030	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	And the alternative steady state would simply have a very low real rate of return on government paper persisting into the indefinite future, along with a very low growth rate, which is already part of the model.	23.0	94.0
201609	2031	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	That would be a simple way to get at the regime idea.	23.0	94.0
201609	2032	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We’ve done that with our own models at the St Louis bank, and I’m pretty sure what you’re going to get is very little cyclical dynamics for the period ahead and something that’s much closer to the market expectation for the US economy.	23.0	94.0
201609	2033	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	For today, I support alternative B as written.	23.0	94.0
201609	2034	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I think that the probability on December will rise substantially in reaction to this statement, possibly close to 1.	23.0	94.0
201609	2035	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I think very difficult questions will be asked about the November meeting.	23.0	94.0
201609	2036	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	If it was a close call here, why wouldn’t it also be a close call in November, and possibly the Committee would move in November?	23.0	94.0
201609	2037	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I would see the probability on that meeting moving up as well.	23.0	94.0
201609	2038	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I think we need to be very clear about what would have to happen to cause us not to move in December.	23.0	94.0
201609	2039	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	This is going to be viewed as more or less committing to a December rate increase.	23.0	94.0
201609	2040	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	If we get to that date and we want to back off that, it’s going to be very difficult to do so, and I don’t want the Committee to be in a position in which we have to plow ahead even though the data have not come in to be supportive of that.	23.0	94.0
201609	2041	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	So that’s a danger about this type of decision that we’re making today, but I agree with others that this is probably the best we can do for today.	23.0	94.0
201609	2042	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201609	2043	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	2044	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23.0	65.0
201609	2045	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201609	2046	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The theory and practice of central banking provide several lessons for monetary policymakers.	23.0	999.0
201609	2047	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	First, as the Chair indicated, policymakers should be forward looking because monetary policy affects the economy with long and variable lags.	23.0	999.0
201609	2048	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	So policy actions need to be taken before the goals are met, on the basis of the economic outlook over the medium run and the risks to that outlook.	23.0	999.0
201609	2049	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Second, policymakers should strive to be consistent in how they respond to economic conditions and to effectively communicate the rationale for their decisions.	23.0	999.0
201609	2050	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	This helps the public form expectations about the future path of policy and raises public confidence in the policy itself.	23.0	999.0
201609	2051	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Third, policymakers should remain humble about what they know about the economy and how monetary policy can affect it.	23.0	999.0
201609	2052	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	There’s uncertainty associated with the outlook, with the monetary policy transmission mechanisms, and with the underlying structural aspects of the economy, such as the natural rate of unemployment, potential output growth, structural productivity growth, and the equilibrium real rate of interest.	23.0	999.0
201609	2053	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	In view of the uncertainties, monetary policy need not respond in the way suggested by benchmarks that have worked well in the past.	23.0	999.0
201609	2054	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	But when policy does deviate from those benchmarks, policymakers need to think carefully about the factors influencing their decisions to deviate.	23.0	999.0
201609	2055	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	In light of these lessons, I support alternative C today.	23.0	999.0
201609	2056	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Conditional on the outlook, which has been corroborated by economic developments, and the risks associated with the outlook, I believe that a gradual upward path of interest rates is appropriate and that we should take a further step on that path today.	23.0	999.0
201609	2057	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	We’ve made progress on both of our monetary policy goals.	23.0	999.0
201609	2058	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Various forecasts, optimal control exercises, and our own statements indicate that to promote our longer-run policy goals, it’s appropriate that we gradually increase the federal funds rate.	23.0	999.0
201609	2059	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Even after a 25 basis point move today, policy would remain accommodative, with the real federal funds rate below the range of estimates of the equilibrium interest rate.	23.0	999.0
201609	2060	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	This accommodative policy will continue to lend support to the economic expansion in the period ahead.	23.0	999.0
201609	2061	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	In my view, the evidence on labor market conditions in our models indicates that, from the standpoint of what can be achieved using monetary policy, we have met our maximum-employment goal.	23.0	999.0
201609	2062	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I recently visited Hazard, Kentucky, in the heart of Appalachia.	23.0	999.0
201609	2063	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	On the trip, I spoke with several coal miners who were just about to graduate from an electrical fiber-optic lineman program.	23.0	999.0
201609	2064	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Of the 30 coal miners who started the one-year program, 28 were graduating, and all had jobs or were entertaining several job offers.	23.0	999.0
201609	2065	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I was impressed by the program and the people I met.	23.0	999.0
201609	2066	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	These types of programs hold promise in addressing the longer-run workplace development issues our country faces.	23.0	999.0
201609	2067	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I don’t believe monetary policy will be an effective tool with respect to these longer-run issues.	23.0	999.0
201609	2068	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	But the Federal Reserve, through its community development function, does have a role to play in helping such regional transitions.	23.0	999.0
201609	2069	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Via our own objective analysis, we can help measure the scope of the problems communities in transition face, we can study how to make small programs like the one I saw in Kentucky scalable, and we can evaluate the effectiveness of alternative policies and other programs.	23.0	999.0
201609	2070	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Regarding the other part of our mandate, PCE inflation remains below our 2 percent goal, but it’s been rising over the past year as anticipated, and it’s projected to return to 2 percent gradually over the forecast horizon.	23.0	999.0
201609	2071	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	This forecast is supported by other measures of underlying inflation, including the core CPI and the median and trimmed mean CPI measures.	23.0	999.0
201609	2072	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Longer-run inflation expectations have been reasonably stable.	23.0	999.0
201609	2073	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	And this, coupled with growth that’s expected to be slightly above trend, also supports the forecast that inflation will return to goal.	23.0	999.0
201609	2074	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The risks that the Committee has been concerned about have diminished.	23.0	999.0
201609	2075	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The data have shown that the weak reading on employment in May was temporary.	23.0	999.0
201609	2076	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Concerns about the fallout from the UK referendum have subsided.	23.0	999.0
201609	2077	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Financial conditions are accommodative.	23.0	999.0
201609	2078	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	In my view,against the background of progress in achieving our two statutory goals, the economic outlook, and the risks associated with the outlook, today’s decision should not be framed as, “Is it appropriate to take the next step on the gradual policy rate path we communicated?” but rather as, “Is it really appropriate not to take the next step?”	23.0	999.0
201609	2079	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I agree with Governor Tarullo’s remarks yesterday that we need to assess the costs and benefits of our policy options.	23.0	999.0
201609	2080	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Since last December, when we increased rates, our discussions focused on the risks of moving rates up too quickly, and we have emphasized these risks in our communications.	23.0	999.0
201609	2081	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	However, there are also risks to delaying.	23.0	999.0
201609	2082	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I don’t think we’re “behind the curve” yet, but if we continue to wait for every piece of data to line up before we act, we will surely be “behind the curve.”	23.0	999.0
201609	2083	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The lesson that policy should be forward looking is based on the history of poor outcomes when that strategy hasn’t been followed.	23.0	999.0
201609	2084	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Sometimes being prudent means moving the policy rate up.	23.0	999.0
201609	2085	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Some may say that the macro effects of waiting for another meeting or two would be small, but I do see risks in continuing to delay action when incoming information has been corroborating both our outlook and the gradual upward path that we have been communicating is appropriate.	23.0	999.0
201609	2086	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	If we fail to set policy on the basis of the realized and projected progress on our goals and our medium-run outlook, we risk further confusing the public about our policy rationale, reinforcing a growing view that the Committee is acting in a discretionary manner, and undermining the credibility we’ve gained with the public over time.	23.0	999.0
201609	2087	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Our policy lessons tell us that we need to set policy in a manner consistent with the communications we continue to make.	23.0	999.0
201609	2088	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	This isn’t to say that we’re locked in by past communications.	23.0	999.0
201609	2089	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	If it was the case that incoming information had changed our outlook, then we would need to change what we are communicating to the public about our anticipated policy rate path.	23.0	999.0
201609	2090	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	But that’s not the situation we’re in.	23.0	999.0
201609	2091	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The outlook is little changed, and the consensus anticipation among participants is that a gradual upward path of interest rates is appropriate.	23.0	999.0
201609	2092	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Given economic conditions and the outlook, I believe taking the next action sooner rather than later makes it more likely that the gradual path will indeed turn out to be appropriate.	23.0	999.0
201609	2093	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	If we continue to delay even as we make further progress on our goals, perhaps in an attempt to drive the unemployment rate well below its natural rate in order to generate a cyclical rebound in labor force participation, stronger nominal wage growth, and a faster increase in inflation, then we risk having to undertake a considerably steeper policy rate path later on in order to foster our goals.	23.0	999.0
201609	2094	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Such a strategy is inconsistent with what we have been communicating, and I do not believe it’s a strategy we want to follow.	23.0	999.0
201609	2095	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	As we discussed yesterday, in the past, strategies like that have led to recession.	23.0	999.0
201609	2096	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	As David Wilcox’s briefing yesterday showed, if we end up in recession, it will disproportionately harm the very demographic groups—minorities, older workers, and lower-income people—the strategy was intended to help, because their unemployment rates are more sensitive to downturns.	23.0	999.0
201609	2097	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Moreover, if we end up in a poor outcome, it will also raise questions about our ability to exit from the nontraditional policies we’ve put into effect in the aftermath of the crisis, jeopardizing their use in the future should the need arise.	23.0	999.0
201609	2098	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I’d rather be in a position of being able to move rates up gradually.	23.0	999.0
201609	2099	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I think it gives us a better chance of recalibrating the policy rate path over time as we gain more insights into the underlying structural aspects of the economy I mentioned earlier.	23.0	999.0
201609	2100	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	In my view, there’s a strong case for raising the funds rate target range 25 basis points today, and that’s what I feel compelled to support.	23.0	999.0
201609	2101	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I deeply respect my colleagues around this table.	23.0	999.0
201609	2102	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Some of you hold views that differ from mine, and my reading of the economy and policy judgment may not be correct.	23.0	999.0
201609	2103	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I very much appreciate the Chair’s commitment to fostering an atmosphere in these meetings of serious deliberation and the free exchange of ideas.	23.0	999.0
201609	2104	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I believe the history of the institution has shown that better policy decisions are made when a diversity of views is considered, and I appreciate the opportunity and responsibility to express my nonconsensus view today.	23.0	999.0
201609	2105	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201609	2106	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	2107	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23.0	65.0
201609	2108	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201609	2109	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I have to say that these are among the most thoughtful comments I remember on any morning of a policy decision, so I really appreciate the conversations.	23.0	91.0
201609	2110	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	We are facing hard and consequential choices in the period ahead.	23.0	91.0
201609	2111	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	It’s only 25 basis points at the moment, but there’s so much more.	23.0	91.0
201609	2112	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	And I look forward to more conversation about the important issues—about the risk of overshooting and what the evidence is.	23.0	91.0
201609	2113	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	At the moment, I’m reluctant to weigh the evidence that we talked about yesterday on overshooting at face valueon the basis of the time periods that we’ve experienced.	23.0	91.0
201609	2114	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I do recall, as research director, with my former boss providing commentary and advice very much like I’ve heard this morning, about “One way to make sure we can sustain the recovery is by increasing interest rates at this moment, because that’s how we keep the momentum going without overshooting.”	23.0	91.0
201609	2115	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	But I believe all of the overshooting evidence to date was in an environment that’s very different from what we’re facing today.	23.0	91.0
201609	2116	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	In the 1970s, in the ’80s, and in the ’90s, inflation was always well above what the Committee’s objective was—in the 1970s, it was double digits—and the Committee was hoping just to get it down.	23.0	91.0
201609	2117	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	In the 1980s, when Chairman Volcker left office, it was 4 to 5 percent, substantially higher than where we are and what we’ve committed to.	23.0	91.0
201609	2118	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	The advice was always “Let’s get it down.”	23.0	91.0
201609	2119	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	So when we found ourselves overshooting, the risk was so much worse because we were not going to be moving down in a secular fashion, but we were going to lose what progress we’d made.	23.0	91.0
201609	2120	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Now, today, we’re in a very different situation, in which inflation is below our inflation objective.	23.0	91.0
201609	2121	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	How will policy respond?	23.0	91.0
201609	2122	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	It is true that, in the past, Taylor rules have captured the Committee’s intention to raise rates to keep the economy sustainable.	23.0	91.0
201609	2123	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Maybe that’s the way the Committee behaved.	23.0	91.0
201609	2124	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	But we’re lower than our inflation objective, so the Lucas critique really bears minding at this point.	23.0	91.0
201609	2125	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Do we know that the policy environment that the Taylor rule was premised on is the environment that we face now?	23.0	91.0
201609	2126	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I don’t know that the answer is “yes.”	23.0	91.0
201609	2127	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I don’t know what the right answer is to any of these questions.	23.0	91.0
201609	2128	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I look forward to more discussion.	23.0	91.0
201609	2129	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I have to say, I can’t refrain from making the following comment—and I’ve used this myself.	23.0	91.0
201609	2130	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	When we use the term “humble” or “humility,” it’s almost always used in the context that, because I get to say it first, I’m going to talk about what I think is the more humble channel or thought—that type of thing.	23.0	91.0
201609	2131	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	It’s a first-mover advantage, I’ve always felt.	23.0	91.0
201609	2132	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s why you go first.	23.0	102.0
201609	2133	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	23.0	102.0
201609	2134	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	And I suppose if I had gone first, I could say, “Well, it’s important to be humble,”	23.0	91.0
201609	2135	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I think, about the claim that at 4.9 percent unemployment, “We’re at full employment, and we can’t do better.”	23.0	91.0
201609	2136	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	The Federal Reserve Act says we should seek conditions to support maximum employment.	23.0	91.0
201609	2137	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	It takes a lot of courage, conviction, and strength of how you analyze things to say, “I think that the unemployment rate naturally might be 5 percent.”	23.0	91.0
201609	2138	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Many have that view, and I’m not saying it’s wrong.	23.0	91.0
201609	2139	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I don’t know what the right answer is.	23.0	91.0
201609	2140	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	My own assessment is, it’s lower, and I think that in the current environment, with inflation below our target, we can continue to see how much more room there is to grow.	23.0	91.0
201609	2141	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Madam Chair, I agree with your comment very much in that regard.	23.0	91.0
201609	2142	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Now, having said that, I’ll turn back to my more prepared remarks, with apologies.	23.0	91.0
201609	2143	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I support alternative B—no change in our policy setting today.	23.0	91.0
201609	2144	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Although I worry that the current expansion may be somewhat fragile and there are many risks to the outlook, I believe solid fundamentals for the labor market and the consumer should be adequate to support my baseline projections of moderately above-trend economic growth.	23.0	91.0
201609	2145	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	If core PCE inflation was clearly on its way to 2 percent, then I would see a readjustment of monetary policy toward its long-run neutral setting as an appropriate and easy decision.	23.0	91.0
201609	2146	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I say “toward its long-run neutral setting” because,in view of the headwinds and impediments that remain, the short-run equilibrium federal funds rate likely is still below our longer-run assessment, and that’s like what President Williams indicated yesterday.	23.0	91.0
201609	2147	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	The lack of building wage and price pressures is strong evidence for this hypothesis, especially in light of our long period of low interest rates.	23.0	91.0
201609	2148	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Furthermore, inflation has been below 2 percent for many years, as Governor Brainard mentioned yesterday.	23.0	91.0
201609	2149	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, the inflation endpoint attractor used in the Board model has been stuck near 1¾ percent for quite some time.	23.0	91.0
201609	2150	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	This is consistent with what we see in financial markets, in which participants are clearly much more concerned about ensuring against low-inflation outcomes than they are about above-target inflation.	23.0	91.0
201609	2151	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I’m left thinking that forecasts that have sustainable 2 percent PCE inflation any time soon aren’t much more than hopes, and so we need to be very careful about adjusting policy and communication surrounding the appropriate path that normalization should take.	23.0	91.0
201609	2152	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	In my public commentary, I routinely state that the FOMC has a symmetric 2 percent objective.	23.0	91.0
201609	2153	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Frankly, this comment is often greeted by blank stares.	23.0	91.0
201609	2154	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I can’t recall anyone saying to me that, yes, the FOMC has clearly demonstrated a commitment to a symmetric objective.	23.0	91.0
201609	2155	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Many see 2 percent as a hard ceiling on where we would allow inflation to go.	23.0	91.0
201609	2156	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Again,in light of our inflation performance and public rhetoric, I understand why they think like that.	23.0	91.0
201609	2157	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	This worries me greatly.	23.0	91.0
201609	2158	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	If we end this economic cycle with inflation still below 2 percent, I can’t imagine why anyone will believe us or our future colleagues when we say our symmetric target is 2 percent.	23.0	91.0
201609	2159	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	This will be a huge problem when policy is next confronted with disinflationary forces, a zero- lower-bound challenge, and the need to establish higher inflation expectations in order to lower real rates enough and help right the economy.	23.0	91.0
201609	2160	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Our complacency today and our willingness to try to thread the needle to get to 2 percent without any overshooting will create substantial challenges for Committees in the future.	23.0	91.0
201609	2161	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I worry that we and our future colleagues will regret this lack of a strong and full commitment.	23.0	91.0
201609	2162	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	At the Jackson Hole symposium, Chris Sims regaled us with an elaborate theory indicating that only fiscally irresponsible policies could increase inflation and inflation expectations.	23.0	91.0
201609	2163	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Although I’m unpersuaded by Sims’s highly theoretical analysis without adequate empirical investigation that the role of fiscal policy currently trumps monetary policy for generating higher inflation, my assessment shares one similar characteristic.	23.0	91.0
201609	2164	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	In the current environment, moving inflation expectations from 1¾ percent up to 2 percent requires strong, bold, and explicit policy prescriptions.	23.0	91.0
201609	2165	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I simply do not have confidence that our current expected course of policy adjustments and our existing communications regarding that path will be sufficient.	23.0	91.0
201609	2166	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Alternative B leans very heavily toward a rate increase later this year.	23.0	91.0
201609	2167	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Although the current debate is over when we make the next move, the larger issue is how we’re going to decide on a path of rates after that.	23.0	91.0
201609	2168	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	When we move, we need to think carefully about how we will characterize the conditions for our subsequent rate increases.	23.0	91.0
201609	2169	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Again, in the current environment, I believe achieving our target requires moving the inflation attractor up from 1¾ percent to 2 percent.	23.0	91.0
201609	2170	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I keep saying “attractor.”	23.0	91.0
201609	2171	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	The Board, I understand, uses “underlying inflation,” but that seems to bury the real concept, it seems to me.	23.0	91.0
201609	2172	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	To do this, I believe we need more explicit policy prescriptions than what we have in the current statement.	23.0	91.0
201609	2173	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	When we raise rates to the ½ to ¾ percent range, it will be important for the Committee to state explicit conditions governing further increases.	23.0	91.0
201609	2174	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	The statement needs to assure the public that this Committee is seeking economic and financial conditions to support inflation attaining our 2 percent PCE inflation objective sustainably, symmetrically, and sooner rather than later.	23.0	91.0
201609	2175	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I would prefer an explicit marker that core PCE inflation should be very close to 2 percent before we move rates again.	23.0	91.0
201609	2176	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Of course, other indicators could signal this, too.	23.0	91.0
201609	2177	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Another useful explicit marker would be continued reductions in unemployment, which presumably would help foster tighter labor and resource conditions to boost inflation.	23.0	91.0
201609	2178	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	And a third condition would be increases in measures of inflation expectations in line with the Board’s inflation attractor moving up to 2 percent from below where it’s been stuck for quite some time.	23.0	91.0
201609	2179	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	At the time of our next policy move, I would strongly support incorporating some configuration of these conditions, along with continued good economic fundamentals, as markers for guiding further continuation of the—I said “normalization process.”	23.0	91.0
201609	2180	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I agree with President Bullard that I’m not sure what the right term is.	23.0	91.0
201609	2181	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	By the way, I sincerely hope I soon will be embarrassed by my current inflation pessimism.	23.0	91.0
201609	2182	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	It would be fantastic if I am mistaken about the difficulty we face in getting inflation to target.	23.0	91.0
201609	2183	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I hope I’m wrong.	23.0	91.0
201609	2184	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I think this language I discussed is robust to this possibility.	23.0	91.0
201609	2185	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	If I’m wrong about inflation, then these inflation, unemployment, and expectations markers will be met sooner rather than later, and we will appropriately be on a speedier path to increasing rates than I now envision.	23.0	91.0
201609	2186	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	That would be a very good thing.	23.0	91.0
201609	2187	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201609	2188	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	2189	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23.0	65.0
201609	2190	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201609	2191	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Well, once again, I found Tealbook B’s “The Case for Alternative B” very useful in developing the argument for waiting for more evidence before deciding to raise the federal funds rate 25 basis points.	23.0	108.0
201609	2192	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	However, I see the case for going now as almost as strong as that for waiting.	23.0	108.0
201609	2193	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Or, in the words of Tealbook B, page 35, I “judge that not much additional evidence would be needed to warrant a rate hike,” and I therefore accept the Tealbook’s request that I so indicate in my statement.	23.0	108.0
201609	2194	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Tealbook B’s outline of the current economic conditions and outlook points to the staff’s real GDP forecast for the second half of the year of about 2.6 percent growth and to the fact that they see the near-term risks to the US economic outlook as roughly balanced.	23.0	108.0
201609	2195	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	They note, however, that headline inflation is likely to run below the 2 percent target.	23.0	108.0
201609	2196	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	That is to say, the staff and the draft statement of alternative B are in close agreement on the state of the economy, both the present state and expectations of future states.	23.0	108.0
201609	2197	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	The staff’s presentation is valuable, but I’d like to highlight a few points they make with which I do not fully agree.	23.0	108.0
201609	2198	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	First, their presentation refers to the solid average gain in payroll employment over recent months as indicating that there have been increases in labor utilization.	23.0	108.0
201609	2199	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	But they then go on to argue that because the unemployment rate has, on net, remained constant at 4.9 percent since the beginning of the year, there has been little increase in labor utilization.	23.0	108.0
201609	2200	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I do not understand this argument, which does not even mention the increase in the labor force participation rate that has taken place over the past year.	23.0	108.0
201609	2201	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	And, accordingly, I judge that labor utilization should also be regarded as a positive factor in assessing the current state of the labor market.	23.0	108.0
201609	2202	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	In the policy strategy discussion of the case for alternative B, the staff starts by considering the possibility that policymakers “may judge it prudent to wait for more evidence that domestic demand will continue to grow at a moderate pace and that the labor market will strengthen somewhat further” before raising the interest rate.	23.0	108.0
201609	2203	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	They then give three arguments for this possibility.	23.0	108.0
201609	2204	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	First, while job gains have rebounded since May, the unemployment rate and other indicators have changed little since the beginning of the year.	23.0	108.0
201609	2205	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	A further wait “could allow the Committee to better assess underlying trends in employment, productivity, and inflation.”	23.0	108.0
201609	2206	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Second, policymakers may be leaning toward raising the interest rate, but a number of factors— among them, slow output growth, little change in labor utilization, and low wage and price inflation since the start of the year—may have reduced FOMC voters’ confidence in the view that current policy provides considerable accommodation.	23.0	108.0
201609	2207	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	So a wait-and-see posture might seem appropriate.	23.0	108.0
201609	2208	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Well, these two arguments have been deployed in the past to explain why we have elected not to move on occasions in which the economic gestalt was similar to that of today.	23.0	108.0
201609	2209	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	They are valid, and they are likely to remain valid.	23.0	108.0
201609	2210	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	But they are doubts that, before making a decision to take action, any serious decisionmaker has to examine and take into account and decide that they’re not sufficiently important to prevent action.	23.0	108.0
201609	2211	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	The third argument the staff makes for being hesitant to move is that the nominal interest rate is close to the effective lower bound, which limits the ability of monetary policy to respond to negative shocks.	23.0	108.0
201609	2212	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	My second doubt about the staff’s view is, this seems to me to be a reason, when a decision is close, to move—to build up a policy reserve to deal with future negative shocks.	23.0	108.0
201609	2213	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	In saying that, I should add that I believe the global level of the nominal interest rate is set primarily by the United States, and that decisions by us would have affected the interest rates of other countries.	23.0	108.0
201609	2214	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	That is to say, I think that relative interest rates would likely not have been very different had we raised our rate on some previous occasions.	23.0	108.0
201609	2215	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	This subject, the effect of our policies on those of other countries, is one to which I believe we should give more attention at some point in the near future.	23.0	108.0
201609	2216	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	We have been taking the rest of the world into account as a Stackelberg follower and not as a leader, and we are the leaders in the global economy.	23.0	108.0
201609	2217	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	My third doubt is, the staff then points out that a decision to maintain the current target range would be in line with the expectations of financial market participants.	23.0	108.0
201609	2218	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	This is not convincing as a reason not to move, for it ignores the fact that the market’s expectations of what we are likely to do is heavily influenced by the speeches of the Chair and other members of the FOMC and by the wording of the statement.	23.0	108.0
201609	2219	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	That is to say that the expectations of market participants are, in most respects, a policy choice of the FOMC—which is to say that our communications could have prepared the markets and the public for either decision that we were going to make.	23.0	108.0
201609	2220	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Let me add a fourth point that is frequently made in favor of waiting—that we know how to deal with high inflation if it comes.	23.0	108.0
201609	2221	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	We do, but we also know that dealing with high inflation, if it comes, requires a “tough love” approach where, unfortunately, the toughness is typically more needed than the love.	23.0	108.0
201609	2222	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	And that is what we will face if we don’t move in time.	23.0	108.0
201609	2223	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	All in all, I do not think there’s a strong case for waiting, which means that I support alternative B and expect that if the economy continues on its current course, we should raise the federal funds rate at our December meeting.	23.0	108.0
201609	2224	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201609	2225	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	2226	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	23.0	65.0
201609	2227	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201609	2228	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	In the first half of the year, we’ve seen weakness outside the United States, particularly in China.	23.0	110.0
201609	2229	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Our GDP forecast is lower than at the start of the year, and we’ve been making frustratingly slow progress in meeting our inflation target.	23.0	110.0
201609	2230	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	For all of those reasons and others, I’ve agreed up to now with exercising patience before removing accommodation.	23.0	110.0
201609	2231	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I’ve also been influenced by analysis that showed that the neutral rate is lower than it had previously been thought.	23.0	110.0
201609	2232	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	And, I am a believer that the economy is not yet overheating.	23.0	110.0
201609	2233	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I also agree that there are persistent headwinds, particularly demographics and other global risks.	23.0	110.0
201609	2234	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	These issues need to be weighed, however, against the costs of accommodation, particularly the cost to savers as well as the market and business imbalances that are being created.	23.0	110.0
201609	2235	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m particularly and increasingly concerned about a growing trend toward use of what I will loosely call the carry trade—people going out on the risk curve, people leveraging up low- volatility assets to produce acceptable returns, and overallocation to risk assets by institutions and households.	23.0	110.0
201609	2236	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	As a result, time frames for risk assets are becoming shorter, and I think, as I mentioned yesterday, that is putting increasing pressure on corporate leaders to leverage up to buy back stock.	23.0	110.0
201609	2237	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I think all of these financial trends can be managed, but I think we’re at the point—if not now, then very soon—where they need to be tamped down because they will be increasingly painful to unwind.	23.0	110.0
201609	2238	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I’ve been in favor, as I said, of “slow and gradual,” but I don’t want “slow and gradual” to become a stall.	23.0	110.0
201609	2239	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	And I am concerned that if we don’t act today, there will be very valid reasons that will emerge for not acting in December.	23.0	110.0
201609	2240	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	On the basis of all of this—and the fact that, near the effective lower bound, there is unlikely to be a good time to raise rates—I would prefer that we raise the federal funds rate 25 basis points today and emphasize, using the SEP that’s coming out, that the path of rates is likely to be historically shallow, and that the terminal rate is likely to be lower than has been widely expected.	23.0	110.0
201609	2241	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I would emphasize that we intend to continue to be accommodative, and that future removals of accommodation will be done only in a gradual and patient manner.	23.0	110.0
201609	2242	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I am concerned about FOMC credibility in that—to my eye, at least—three- and six- month rolling job growth numbers are in the strike zone.	23.0	110.0
201609	2243	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	And the weaker ISM is a concern, but our own model suggests that the consumer is strong and will continue to be strong for the remainder of this year.	23.0	110.0
201609	2244	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Given that it appears we are not going to raise rates today, I would love to see us emphasize, as we’ve discussed, that the normalization process is very challenging, maybe more challenging than has been widely understood, due to these persistent headwinds, particularly aging demographics and the effects of globalization.	23.0	110.0
201609	2245	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I would emphasize that we do not have a predetermined timetable, we do not intend to be bound by calendar considerations, we will move when conditions warrant, and we need to see continual removal of labor slack and some greater evidence that inflation will return to our 2 percent target in the medium term.	23.0	110.0
201609	2246	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	And I would continue to emphasize that our tools are asymmetrical at or near the lower bound.	23.0	110.0
201609	2247	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	That is, it is much easier to tighten than to ease.	23.0	110.0
201609	2248	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201609	2249	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	2250	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23.0	65.0
201609	2251	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	103.0
201609	2252	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	I support alternative C.	23.0	103.0
201609	2253	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	With unemployment and inflation at or near their longer-run levels, removing some accommodation is warranted.	23.0	103.0
201609	2254	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	An increase in the funds rate is overdue, as I see it, and waiting for further evidence continues to unwisely discount future costs in order to reap perceived marginal benefits today.	23.0	103.0
201609	2255	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	As I reflected on yesterday’s discussion, it may indeed be the case that historical experience and relationships will not serve us well today, and that this time may be different.	23.0	103.0
201609	2256	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	I’m not persuaded that we should ignore the history, but, as others have suggested, I do think it’s essential that we talk about the risks associated with various policy options to understand the consequences.	23.0	103.0
201609	2257	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Understanding the risk of overshooting full employment seems particularly important over the next year, especially if we continue a wait-and-see approach along the lines of alternative B.	23.0	103.0
201609	2258	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Instead, if the majority of the Committee is truly convinced that r* is likely to stay extremely low for an extended time, alternative A may, in fact, be a more honest representation of the Committee’s intentions.	23.0	103.0
201609	2259	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	We hurt our credibility by repeatedly projecting multiple rate increases in the SEP, only to stand pat in the face of tightening labor markets and inflation moving toward 2 percent.	23.0	103.0
201609	2260	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, alternatives B and C have nearly identical descriptions of current conditions and the outlook, while one calls for acting at this meeting and the other signals a move is on the horizon.	23.0	103.0
201609	2261	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	This feels to me like a classic central bank trap of needing to move but not just yet in order to see a bit more information.	23.0	103.0
201609	2262	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	The divergence between the current setting of the funds rate and prescriptions from simple policy rules also suggests that the Committee’s policy choices lean too much in the direction of discretion, even after accounting for the downward revision in the longer-term equilibrium real rate.	23.0	103.0
201609	2263	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Since June 2014, the Board staff has marked down its assumptions regarding r* and longer-run growth.	23.0	103.0
201609	2264	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	The projections in the SEP have followed, and I, too, have marked down my assessment of r*.	23.0	103.0
201609	2265	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	But if there is substantial uncertainty about the trend rate of growth or the value of r*, surely the Committee would be well served to ground its judgments with some kind of analytical instrumentation.	23.0	103.0
201609	2266	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	For example, my understanding of first-difference rules suggests that their use might fit well during such a time of uncertainty.	23.0	103.0
201609	2267	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Here, too, according to the Tealbook, the Board’s version of a first-difference rule has been prescribing a move since March of this year.	23.0	103.0
201609	2268	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	103.0
201609	2269	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	2270	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23.0	65.0
201609	2271	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201609	2272	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	I will support alternative B.	23.0	104.0
201609	2273	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	This year, financial turmoil, weaker incoming data, and a reassessment of the neutral rate of interest have pointed financial markets and the Committee toward a more gradual path of rate increases.	23.0	104.0
201609	2274	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	That path can and will be adjusted, either up or down, as events evolve.	23.0	104.0
201609	2275	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	I believe that the Committee’s patience through this period has paid dividends and will continue to do so.	23.0	104.0
201609	2276	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Nonetheless, the labor market has continued to tighten, and the forecast is for output to strengthen and inflation to continue on its path of gradual increases.	23.0	104.0
201609	2277	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	If that forecast is broadly realized, then I believe that it will be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate soon.	23.0	104.0
201609	2278	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	I’ve written down one rate increase for this year and two for next year.	23.0	104.0
201609	2279	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	It is possible, as several here have pointed out, to wait too long to move.	23.0	104.0
201609	2280	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	This would put the Committee “behind the curve” and require more aggressive action, possibly risking a recession.	23.0	104.0
201609	2281	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	That risk increases as the unemployment rate continues to move down and labor markets show increased signs of tightening.	23.0	104.0
201609	2282	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	For me, the time for the overshooting argument is coming but is probably not yet here for a couple of reasons.	23.0	104.0
201609	2283	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	The apparent upside surprise in labor force participation suggests that we have more room to grow.	23.0	104.0
201609	2284	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	In fact, looking back this morning, labor force participation has now really been flat, in the high 62s, since late 2013, which represents a pretty significant three-year gain against our estimate of the underlying downward trend.	23.0	104.0
201609	2285	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	It does suggest that we may actually be using up a margin of slack, but it also suggests, yes, grounds for humility that, in fact, there may be more room to go.	23.0	104.0
201609	2286	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	The economy is growing just barely above trend.	23.0	104.0
201609	2287	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Inflation is below our 2 percent objective and has been every single month since the second quarter of 2012.	23.0	104.0
201609	2288	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	We’re making progress toward 2 percent inflation, and my baseline case that we can continue to do that.	23.0	104.0
201609	2289	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	But let’s face it—it’s happening at a snail’s pace.	23.0	104.0
201609	2290	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	So, for me, the balance of risks continues to call for patience and a gradual path of rate increases, assuming the forecast is realized.	23.0	104.0
201609	2291	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201609	2292	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	2293	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	23.0	65.0
201609	2294	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	111.0
201609	2295	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	I am comfortable with alternative B, but I lean toward alternative A.	23.0	111.0
201609	2296	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	I prefer alternative A because I would like to see evidence of rising inflationary pressure before tightening.	23.0	111.0
201609	2297	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	In particular, I’m looking for either a sustained upward move in core PCE inflation or evidence of rising inflation expectations or a substantial decline in the headline unemployment rate.	23.0	111.0
201609	2298	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	The discussion we had yesterday about workers coming off the sidelines—it’s not moving the headline unemployment rate.	23.0	111.0
201609	2299	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	The truth is that we don’t know how much slack is left.	23.0	111.0
201609	2300	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	It seems to me that there is still some more slack.	23.0	111.0
201609	2301	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	I’d like to find out how much more there is.	23.0	111.0
201609	2302	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Actually, I found President Evans’s comments very consistent with my own views.	23.0	111.0
201609	2303	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	When I saw the Tealbook and its staff forecast of core PCE inflation of 1.6 percent for the rest of this year and for all of next year, I asked myself, “If that’s right, what would it take to get me to want to move?”	23.0	111.0
201609	2304	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	I’d want to see inflation expectations climb, or I’d want to see the headline unemployment rate fall meaningfully, such that I had confidence that slack had actually been taken up.	23.0	111.0
201609	2305	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Absent that, I’m starting to get persuaded by my neighbors here, President Bullard and President Evans, that I don’t see a strong case for raising rates.	23.0	111.0
201609	2306	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Alternative A lays down a marker that we want to see meaningful progress toward our inflation target, and I think that that would be helpful.	23.0	111.0
201609	2307	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Alternative B isn’t terrible, but I’m a little nervous about the language, because I do think it signals to the market that a rate hike is coming.	23.0	111.0
201609	2308	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	It may not come, and I think we all agree that every time we put out a marker that it’s about to come and then we don’t deliver, there’s a cost to us in terms of our credibility.	23.0	111.0
201609	2309	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	So I’m nervous about alternative B being too strong in signaling a December rate increase.	23.0	111.0
201609	2310	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Now, some say that we need to get going to raise rates so that we don’t fall “behind the curve.”	23.0	111.0
201609	2311	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	I think each of us reads these optimal control simulations and takes what we want out of them, because I look at them and, even in the most accommodative scenarios, the overshoot is 2.2 percent inflation.	23.0	111.0
201609	2312	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	So if these things are valuable at all, I don’t see where the concern is.	23.0	111.0
201609	2313	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	If the worst-case scenario is 2.2 percent inflation, that’s less of an overshoot than we’re undershooting right now.	23.0	111.0
201609	2314	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Then there’s been discussion that, well, it’s better that we gradually raise rates because a shallow path and then steep at the end is somehow more recessionary.	23.0	111.0
201609	2315	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	My staff found a Board memo of 2014, a background memo on potential implications of alternative approaches to the timing and pace of tightening.	23.0	111.0
201609	2316	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	This memo by Board staff suggests that it’s entirely unclear that a late and steep path of tightening is somehow more recessionary than a gradual path.	23.0	111.0
201609	2317	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	So I don’t find those arguments persuasive.	23.0	111.0
201609	2318	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	I’m not saying one is right and one is wrong, but it doesn’t appear to be clear that one is better than the other.	23.0	111.0
201609	2319	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	In view of where economic growth is—it’s pretty slow—and that inflation is definitely below target, I think we should be patient and allow the data to come to us before we are anticipating inflation that may not come.	23.0	111.0
201609	2320	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	The last thing I’ll say is, I know this makes me sound like I’m an uber-dove or a perma-dove.	23.0	111.0
201609	2321	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	I’m not.	23.0	111.0
201609	2322	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	When the data reveal themselves—when inflation actually materializes or expectations change—I will be advocating raising rates.	23.0	111.0
201609	2323	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	I just don’t see it yet.	23.0	111.0
201609	2324	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	23.0	111.0
201609	2325	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	2326	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23.0	65.0
201609	2327	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201609	2328	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	I favor alternative B-plus or A-minus.	23.0	97.0
201609	2329	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	I’m not exactly sure which.	23.0	97.0
201609	2330	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And the reason is, I have some measure of uncomfortableness with a couple of the elements of alternative B as written.	23.0	97.0
201609	2331	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	First, the characterization of the risks as being roughly balanced doesn’t accord with my own understanding.	23.0	97.0
201609	2332	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	I think that shorter-term risks still are modestly to moderately on the downside.	23.0	97.0
201609	2333	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	While I don’t take too much signal on the basis of the retail sales numbers because, basically, that’s stuff from stores, a decreasingly important part of total consumption, the bouncing-around of housing permits and starts gives at least a little pause.	23.0	97.0
201609	2334	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And, like Vice Chairman Dudley, I do put a little bit more weight on, or at least have a little bit more concern with, the nonmanufacturing purchasing managers’ survey, particularly because it’s a forward-looking indicator in the much larger part of the economy that’s relatively insulated from the effect of the stronger dollar.	23.0	97.0
201609	2335	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	When coupled with the apparent softness in the total number of hours worked, as reported by the BLS, which was applicable in the service sector as well as the manufacturing sector, it indicates to me at least something to watch, but it’s a risk.	23.0	97.0
201609	2336	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	It’s not a reality—it’s just a risk.	23.0	97.0
201609	2337	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	But I think that the “roughly balanced” is getting a little bit ahead of ourselves.	23.0	97.0
201609	2338	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Second, I am also a little uncomfortable with the language in paragraph 3 of alternative B because, as many have commented, it does lean forward—perhaps not as far as some would like—to a December rate increase.	23.0	97.0
201609	2339	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And as Presidents Bullard and Lockhart and others have noted, in and of itself, that may raise some communication problems, but it may also raise some issues for us of, what is it that we’re expecting to see?	23.0	97.0
201609	2340	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	However, it may be the best language that could garner a consensus,in view of the rather divergent views of people here.	23.0	97.0
201609	2341	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	But I did want to indicate that I am a little bit uncomfortable with it.	23.0	97.0
201609	2342	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	I think, by the way, the problems that Presidents Bullard and Lockhart and others have referred to will only be exacerbated if everybody on this Committee runs out trying to influence market expectations about later increases, because then we’re going to get into another one of these wars of words, in which everybody goes out and gives their speeches and then sees how much the 10-year has moved to see whether they’ve given a good speech or not.	23.0	97.0
201609	2343	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And I don’t think that’s been particularly useful for the Committee as a whole.	23.0	97.0
201609	2344	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	I feel like we’re stuck in a bit of a collective action problem here, and I don’t know how to get out of it.	23.0	97.0
201609	2345	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	But maybe the communications subcommittee—no, I’m only kidding, Stan.	23.0	97.0
201609	2346	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Well, if you joined it, then—[Laughter]	23.0	108.0
201609	2347	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	No.	23.0	97.0
201609	2348	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	I was on it briefly.	23.0	97.0
201609	2349	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	For reasons I’ll explain in a moment, though, I’m not actually totally comfortable with alternative A, either.	23.0	97.0
201609	2350	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	I did want to say a couple of things about the discussion that’s gone back and forth, both in part of the go-round yesterday and today.	23.0	97.0
201609	2351	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	This is not exactly on the humility point, but we are in an environment in which there’s good reason to believe that the structure and dynamics of the US economy are really quite different from what they have been in the relatively recent past and through much of the postwar period.	23.0	97.0
201609	2352	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And what I think that indicates is the possibility that tools and even analytic frameworks, such as various correlations among economic variables, that were quite useful for some period of time in thinking about and setting monetary policy may have more limited utility in the current circumstances.	23.0	97.0
201609	2353	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	What, of course, goes along with that is the idea that historical precedent becomes rather less useful, because the precedent just abstracts a couple of things and pulls them out of the broader context in which various more important secular forces are affecting the structure and dynamics of the economy.	23.0	97.0
201609	2354	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	That first observation counsels more openness to the idea that things may be different and thus that you don’t take some things—whether it’s the Taylor rule or the traditional understanding of the Phillips curve or any number of other analytical frameworks—as your presumptive path.	23.0	97.0
201609	2355	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	From there—and, as I said, this is where humility comes in—we, as policymakers, don’t then want to jump to the conclusion of, “Ah, we now understand the way the dynamics and structure in this different economy are actually functioning, and thus we’re pretty confident about the way in which we will set policy.”	23.0	97.0
201609	2356	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	So that is why—and I think a number of people, even though they haven’t used the language, and other people around the table have taken a similar approach—it seemed to me that we have to develop at least operating presumptions that allow us to make policy decisions from meeting to meeting.	23.0	97.0
201609	2357	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	But we need to be more open than usual to the possibility that something different is going on than is reflected in that operating presumption.	23.0	97.0
201609	2358	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	So that’s what’s led me to what I’ve described as a pragmatic approach.	23.0	97.0
201609	2359	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Just to be clear—and this is where my difference with alternative A comes in—what I’ve been saying is, I would like to see more evidence that inflation would be moving toward the 2 percent target on a sustainable basis.	23.0	97.0
201609	2360	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	For me, that doesn’t necessarily translate into the inflation rate itself moving there, because I can imagine that there would be evidence of an underlying dynamic in certain parts of the economy that suggested pretty convincingly that, because of other things going on, inflation was going to rise.	23.0	97.0
201609	2361	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	So I think, again, one can be a little bit more open minded about what it is that would be evidence that would give reasonable certainty, to invoke a past phrase we used, that inflation will move back to target.	23.0	97.0
201609	2362	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And the second thing, obviously, that’s been important to me is what we discussed yesterday, which is the comparative longer-term risk framework.	23.0	97.0
201609	2363	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	By the way, let me just say it explicitly today—boy, talk about a heterodox idea—it would be great to dispense with the economic go-round, as conventionally done, in November and just come in prepared to have a conversation about the set of issues that at least half a dozen or eight of us were discussing yesterday.	23.0	97.0
201609	2364	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	But I haven’t consulted with anybody beyond Presidents George and Rosengren on this, and they didn’t even endorse it.	23.0	97.0
201609	2365	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	They just said, “That’s interesting.”	23.0	97.0
201609	2366	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	23.0	97.0
201609	2367	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Let’s see.	23.0	97.0
201609	2368	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Finally—notwithstanding my reservations about some of the language in alternative B—obviously, when it comes to a vote today, I’ll vote for alternative B and do so with the understanding that either the evidence on inflation or my understanding of that comparative-risk framework may change between now and the next couple of meetings.	23.0	97.0
201609	2369	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	So, while I’m concerned about the degree of forward lean, I by no means foreclose the possibility that I will be there as well later in the year.	23.0	97.0
201609	2370	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201609	2371	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	2372	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23.0	65.0
201609	2373	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201609	2374	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	I, too, want to express my appreciation for the very thoughtful arguments that are being made on both sides, and I’ll try to provide my take on some of these arguments.	23.0	107.0
201609	2375	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	First of all, I believe that our prudent risk-management approach has served us well this year, supporting continued gains in employment and progress on inflation while helping to navigate a number of risks.	23.0	107.0
201609	2376	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Several have noted that the economy is not far from the forecasts of the Committee a year ago.	23.0	107.0
201609	2377	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	I would simply point out that this has been achieved only with a very substantial reduction in both the actual and expected policy rate path and the corresponding adjustment in broader financial conditions.	23.0	107.0
201609	2378	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Even so, actual progress on inflation still remains tentative, and there’s uncertainty about how close the economy is to full employment.	23.0	107.0
201609	2379	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	To me, it seems, therefore, appropriate to continue a fairly cautious approach and wait to see confirmation of further progress on inflation and tightening of resource constraints before removing further accommodation.	23.0	107.0
201609	2380	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Of course, as many have noted, that policy stance contains risks.	23.0	107.0
201609	2381	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, if momentum in the economy is much stronger than the data now suggest and resource constraints start to bind more quickly than I currently anticipate, then inflation could rise more quickly than expected.	23.0	107.0
201609	2382	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	In such a contingency, we have tried-and-tested tools and ample policy space in which to react.	23.0	107.0
201609	2383	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, there are several features of today’s economy, today’s new normal, that might lead us to expect that the effects of such unexpected strength in demand on inflation, and on the economy more generally, will be somewhat more modest and require a somewhat more tempered policy response than in the handful of historical episodes that are frequently referenced.	23.0	107.0
201609	2384	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	First, due to the experience, in particular, of the past year, it reminds us that it is possible material resource slack still remains, and that full employment in the wake of the severe recession might look a bit different.	23.0	107.0
201609	2385	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Second, the recent elevated sensitivity of the exchange rate to policy surprises suggests that an appreciating currency would play an important role in absorbing any excess demand and restraining inflation.	23.0	107.0
201609	2386	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Third, because the neutral rate has been and likely will be persistently low, the distance back to a neutral stance is not as great.	23.0	107.0
201609	2387	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	And, finally, inflation expectations are well anchored to the upside.	23.0	107.0
201609	2388	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Together, these factors suggest that the response of inflation to unexpected strength in demand will likely be modest and gradual, requiring a correspondingly moderate policy response and implying relatively slight costs to the economy.	23.0	107.0
201609	2389	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	In the face of an adverse shock, however, our conventional policy toolkit is very limited, and thus the risk of being unable to respond adequately is greater.	23.0	107.0
201609	2390	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	The experience of the Japanese and euro-area economies should be sobering and suggests that prolonged weakness in demand is very difficult to correct, leading to economic costs that can be considerable.	23.0	107.0
201609	2391	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	In short, in what I think of as today’s new normal, the costs to the economy of greater-than-expected strength in demand are likely to be lower than the costs of significant unexpected weakness.	23.0	107.0
201609	2392	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	There’s another question that’s been raised that is important in this context that I wanted to address briefly address.	23.0	107.0
201609	2393	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Some are asking whether there really is a cost to signaling that the Committee is comfortable acquiescing in underlying inflation remaining in the 1.4 to 1.6 percent range, which it hasn’t meaningfully exceeded over the past several years.	23.0	107.0
201609	2394	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	In the “new normal,” in which the long-run neutral rate may well be 1¼ to 1½ percentage points below the canonical Taylor 2 percent, every ½ point reduction in our perceived inflation target reduces to an uncomfortably tight margin the conventional policy space we have in which to respond to a shock.	23.0	107.0
201609	2395	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	For that reason, I join others in thinking it’s extremely important that we defend the credibility of the target and make clear through our actions that there really is symmetry around 2 percent.	23.0	107.0
201609	2396	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	I agree that we would regret complacency on this front.	23.0	107.0
201609	2397	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	In short, the costs of entrenching a low-inflation, low-growth, low-expectations environment are considerable.	23.0	107.0
201609	2398	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	The asymmetry in risk management counsels prudence in the removal of policy accommodation.	23.0	107.0
201609	2399	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	I believe this approach has served us well and will continue to do so.	23.0	107.0
201609	2400	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	When we look at the language, I must say that I, too, have some concerns about locking ourselves in to moving before the end of the year.	23.0	107.0
201609	2401	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	That approach hasn’t worked so well for us previously.	23.0	107.0
201609	2402	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, I also recognize there’s a large diversity of views around the table, and I’m very comfortable supporting the Chair’s preferred formulation in alternative B.	23.0	107.0
201609	2403	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	23.0	107.0
201609	2404	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	2405	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23.0	65.0
201609	2406	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	23.0	96.0
201609	2407	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B as written, although I do have some unease about how forward leaning it is in terms of December, because I think the market is going to take it as making December highly likely.	23.0	96.0
201609	2408	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I’ll talk about that at the end of my remarks.	23.0	96.0
201609	2409	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	But I can certainly support it as written.	23.0	96.0
201609	2410	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Although I agree that the case for tightening monetary policy has strengthened in recent months as financial conditions have eased, near-term Brexit risks have receded, and the pace of economic growth has picked up, I don’t find the case sufficiently compelling to move today for three reasons.	23.0	96.0
201609	2411	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this is very similar to what the Chair said in her earlier remarks.	23.0	96.0
201609	2412	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	First, the economy is just not growing that fast.	23.0	96.0
201609	2413	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The pressure on labor utilization is increasing very slowly, and discouraged workers are coming back into the workforce, augmenting the supply of labor.	23.0	96.0
201609	2414	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	With the unemployment rate broadly stable this year and wage gains still subdued, I don’t see a labor market that signals there’s urgency to tighten right now.	23.0	96.0
201609	2415	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	And I would really be hesitant to keep a bunch of people out of work on the presumption that somehow we’re already at the full-employment unemployment rate.	23.0	96.0
201609	2416	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that would be unconscionable.	23.0	96.0
201609	2417	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, inflation is still below our target and is projected in the Tealbook to be below our target for some time to come.	23.0	96.0
201609	2418	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Earlier in the year, we did see core PCE inflation increase a bit on a sequential basis, but it’s subsequently come back down.	23.0	96.0
201609	2419	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, before, that was just a forecast, but I think the fact that the forecast is now being realized is significant.	23.0	96.0
201609	2420	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The core PCE price index is moving sideways rather than upward on a year-over-year basis.	23.0	96.0
201609	2421	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that and the fact that inflation has been consistently below our 2 percent objective, and the potential consequences of that on inflation expectations, also argue for patience.	23.0	96.0
201609	2422	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Third, monetary policy is not very accommodative.	23.0	96.0
201609	2423	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this is a pretty widely held view in this room.	23.0	96.0
201609	2424	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The gap between where we are and where we judge the neutral short-term rate, the so-called r*, to be has narrowed.	23.0	96.0
201609	2425	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I would judge that a neutral monetary policy regime currently is likely no more than 100 to 150 basis points above where we are now.	23.0	96.0
201609	2426	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So that gap could be closed quite quickly if we needed to do so.	23.0	96.0
201609	2427	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	If the gap was larger, then I think the economy would presumably be growing faster and there would be more work to do to move policy back toward neutral.	23.0	96.0
201609	2428	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So if that was the case, that would push you on the side of moving more quickly, but I don’t think that’s where we are right now.	23.0	96.0
201609	2429	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, if we mostly agree that there’s going to be only one move this year and the debate is really between today versus December, I ask the obvious question:  Why not wait to see whether a more favorable GDP growth trend actually emerges before moving?	23.0	96.0
201609	2430	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	At the end of October, we’ll get the GDP data for the third quarter, and I think that’ll be something that you can hang your hat on in terms of why you’re tightening monetary policy subsequently.	23.0	96.0
201609	2431	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	With inflation below our objective, I will feel less bad if it turns out a hike was justified today on the basis of subsequent data and we move a few months later, compared with a situation in which the economy disappoints, suggesting that we really shouldn’t have moved at today’s meeting.	23.0	96.0
201609	2432	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	For the SEP, I’ve got one further 25 basis point rate hike for 2016, two for ’17, and three for ’18, and that takes the federal funds rate up to 1¾ to 2 percent at the end of 2018.	23.0	96.0
201609	2433	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I’ve also reduced my longer-run federal funds rate projection to 2½ percent from 3 percent.	23.0	96.0
201609	2434	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think r* is depressed relative to its historical norm of 2 percent and will remain sodue to slower productivity growth, an aging population, and the persistence of a global savings glut.	23.0	96.0
201609	2435	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, I’ve become more skeptical of the story we’ve been telling for some time, that the headwinds following the financial crisis are likely to dissipate relatively soon.	23.0	96.0
201609	2436	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So that also feeds into my reassessment of what the long-term federal funds rate is likely to be.	23.0	96.0
201609	2437	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, in terms of language, I think we should have no illusions.	23.0	96.0
201609	2438	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The market is going to react to what we put out today as making December highly likely.	23.0	96.0
201609	2439	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there are several aspects of that that are going to push in that direction.	23.0	96.0
201609	2440	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	First, I view the statement language as stronger than what the market generally expects.	23.0	96.0
201609	2441	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	If you look at the surveys of the primary dealers and the buy side, most of them didn’t really see a lot of changes as likely occurring in the statement.	23.0	96.0
201609	2442	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	There are two changes that I think are going to be important.	23.0	96.0
201609	2443	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	One is the movement of risks to “roughly balanced.”	23.0	96.0
201609	2444	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think people who thought that might change were more likely to think “nearly balanced,” but “roughly,”	23.0	96.0
201609	2445	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess, is closer to neutral than “nearly”—by a little bit.	23.0	96.0
201609	2446	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The second thing is, this language that the case has strengthened—I don’t think that will surprise people.	23.0	96.0
201609	2447	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	But the phrase “for the time being,” putting in the time component there, will, I think, push in the same direction.	23.0	96.0
201609	2448	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The SEP, I think, is also going to do the work in the same direction.	23.0	96.0
201609	2449	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	All but three of us have one or two rate hikes in 2016, so it’ll be the strong sense of the Committee that the Committee expects a rate hike this year.	23.0	96.0
201609	2450	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	And the fact that we’re going to have three dissents on the side of tightening at this meeting—three dissents is a relatively large number of dissents.	23.0	96.0
201609	2451	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	That’ll also push in the same direction.	23.0	96.0
201609	2452	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So I don’t think we should be surprised if the probability for December goes up.	23.0	96.0
201609	2453	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think that’s a big problem if the data cooperate.	23.0	96.0
201609	2454	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	But if the data don’t cooperate, then that’s going to be a problem, because it’s going to be another case of raising the probability and subsequently shrinking back from that.	23.0	96.0
201609	2455	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So I hope the data will cooperate this time.	23.0	96.0
201609	2456	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201609	2457	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	24.0	65.0
201609	2458	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’ve had a really great discussion of the issues and done an excellent job of identifying the key risks that we face on both sides as we try to decide the appropriate path of policy.	24.0	65.0
201609	2459	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	And I will work with the staff—before our next meeting, I hope—to see if there’s some further work we can do to try to analyze the various risks that have been identified here.	24.0	65.0
201609	2460	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	For today, while I recognize that there’s discomfort of all sorts in both directions with alternative B, my proposal is to vote on alternative B as written.	24.0	65.0
201609	2461	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Brian.	24.0	65.0
201609	2462	2016-09-21	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	24.0	999.0
201609	2463	2016-09-21	meeting	MADIGAN	This vote will be on the policy statement for alternative B as included on pages 5 and 6 of Thomas Laubach’s briefing materials and on the directive to the Desk as included in the implementation note on page 9 of those materials.	24.0	999.0
201609	2464	2016-09-21	meeting	MADIGAN	Chair Yellen Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Brainard Yes President Bullard Yes Governor Fischer Yes President George No President Mester No Governor Powell Yes President Rosengren No Governor Tarullo Yes .	24.0	999.0
201609	2465	2016-09-21	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you.	24.0	999.0
