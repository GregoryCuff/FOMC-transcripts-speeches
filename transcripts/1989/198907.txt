198907	0	GREENSPAN	 Good afternoon, everyone. Ed Boehne is in transit. Apparently the train broke down or something unbelievable happened; he's driving in and should be here in about one-half hour. But let's move forward. Would somebody like to move approval of the previous meeting's minutes? 	5	5	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	1	SEGER	 I'll move it. 	5	5	0.0	1.0	40.0
198907	2	SPEAKER	 Second. 	5	5	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	3	GREENSPAN	 Without objection. Mr. Cross, would you bring us up to date on your operations? 	5	5	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	4	CROSS	" During the past three months, the dollar experienced two  bouts of strong upward pressure. The first episode, which started in  late April, was fed largely by investment-related demand for dollars  and a world-wide adjustment in portfolios. This demand appeared to  peak in late May and by the end of that month the dollar had started  to move down. The second episode then was initiated when political  upheaval in China unleashed another set of pressures, and the dollar  moved up again as capital flowed out of Asia. During the course of  this second bout of upward pressure, speculators came to play an  increasingly active role in pushing the dollar higher, and the  weakening of the yen associated with Japan's political difficulties  also has been an important contributing factor.  The United States monetary authorities resisted the dollar's rise  throughout this period with persistent and at times heavy  intervention. For the intermeeting period as a whole, they sold  nearly $10 billion against marks and yen. These operations helped to  keep the dollar's rise in check, so the dollar is once again trading  near the level where it was when you last met. The strongest upward  pressures, the heaviest intervention, and the highest dollar rates  occurred around mid June. Since then, the adjustment of portfolios  has begun to fade, the speculators found themselves overextended and  vulnerable to central bank intervention, and political uncertainties  have lost some of their force. Moreover, questions have arisen about  whether the prospects for growth and interest rates are so favorable  to the dollar as once supposed. Under these circumstances, the  pressures on the dollar receded and subsequently intervention was much  more modest. As of now, the rates for dollar/yen and for dollar/mark  have declined from their intermeeting period highs by roughly 8 or 9  percent to trade below the levels that market participants had  believed to be the top of the unannounced ranges set for the dollar by  G-7.  Throughout both episodes of upward pressure, investment-  related demand for dollars was important, reflecting an unusual  combination of developments in the United States economic and political  environment. The foreign exchange markets, having gained comfort  earlier this year from their perception that the Federal Reserve's  monetary policy stance was relatively tight, grew increasingly  confident that the United States economic expansion would glide into a ""soft  landing""--where a gentle slowdown to a more sustainable pace would  relieve inflationary pressures and yet allow for a continued reduction  in the trade and fiscal deficits. With the United States farther  along the cyclical curve than other countries, and the expectation  that the next interest rate changes would be down in the United States  and up in Europe and Japan, funds were attracted here looking for  capital gains. The many political uncertainties abroad--in Japan, in  Germany, in Britain--also enhanced the dollar as a currency of  denomination for investment. This was partly because the investment  outlook here was presumed to be more stable and predictable, and  partly because of a view that funds could be parked here with some  assurance that United States markets could provide the liquidity to permit a  redeployment when uncertainties abroad are resolved.  Thus, investors sought to increase the share of dollar-  denominated assets in their portfolios, even as interest rate  differentials narrowed by as much as 200 basis points since April.  Investors increased their dollar exposure partly by buying United States  equities and fixed income securities, thereby contributing to the  rallies in the United States capital markets. But perhaps even more  importantly, they reduced the hedges they had previously set up to  protect themselves against exchange-rate loss on dollar portfolios.  The performance of the dollar in the exchange markets during 1988 and  1989 made it appear less necessary for investors and corporate  customers alike to maintain these hedges. We hear for example, that  Japanese insurance companies reduced their hedges from about 60  percent to 35 percent of their portfolios, mainly during May and early  June. Our sense was that if dollar exchange rates were allowed to  ratchet still higher, the dynamics of the market would reinforce this  trend and lead to further dehedging and increases in dollar exposures.  Mr. Chairman, let me comment on the intervention we have  undertaken. During this intermeeting period, United States operations were  much heavier than in earlier periods, as intervention was used to  attempt to shield the economy and domestic financial markets from the  full force of potentially reversible and destabilizing pressures in  the exchange market. It is hard to see what possible gain there would  be from a further sharp and unsustainable rise in the dollar from the  levels it had reached. In the circumstances, the Desk conducted some  of its largest operations to date. We had to request two extensions  of the intermeeting limits that the Committee has in place, though I  should point out that these intermeeting limits were last changed in  the late 1970's when the size of the foreign exchange market was a  fraction of what it is today, perhaps one-tenth as large. In the  event, with the operations of this period, we have increased United States  foreign exchange reserves substantially--the Treasury and the Federal  Reserve together now hold more than $20 billion equivalent of marks  and almost $10 billion of yen. We are in a much more comfortable  reserve position than we were only 18 months ago, for example, when  the dollar was at an all time low and falling, and our yen balances  were virtually down to zero.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to request the Committee's  approval of the foreign exchange operations during the intermeeting  period. Of the Desk's total dollar sales, the Federal Reserve share  was $3,153.75 million sold against yen and $1,814.75 million sold  against marks. Also, as we have reported earlier, the Federal Reserve  warehoused $3 billion of Deutschemarks for the Exchange Stabilization  Fund of the United States Treasury in accordance with existing agreements.

198907	5	GREENSPAN	 Are there any questions for Mr. Cross? Lee. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	6	HOSKINS	 Sam, on the warehousing agreement: When was that done and do we review it regularly at this Committee? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198907	7	CROSS	 We review it every year. It was reviewed in March of this year and reestablished without change, as has been done for many years--ever since I've been here. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	8	TRUMAN	 There were similar arrangements that we used in the early 1970s. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	9	HOSKINS	 Is that ever questioned by Congress as a way to circumvent the limit that's placed on the [Exchange Stabilization] Fund? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198907	10	TRUMAN	 To my knowledge Congress has never raised any questions about it. It was established more or less permanently in the late 1970s when the Treasury issued Carter bonds and they wanted to simply [make permanent] that limit and wanted to monetize the Carter bonds; so we held them from that point. It was carefully examined by the Committee at that time and [the decision] was made public; since then we've continued the arrangement. It is reviewed at the March organizational meeting. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	11	HOSKINS	 It's reviewed and voted on? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198907	12	CROSS	 Yes. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	13	GREENSPAN	 Do we have statutory limits? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	14	TRUMAN	 No, the $5 billion limit is a limit that the FOMC imposed. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	15	GREENSPAN	 But Lee is asking-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	16	HOSKINS	 I thought the limit was imposed by Congress.  	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198907	17	CROSS	 No. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	18	TRUMAN	 No. I took your comment to mean that a limit is imposed by Congress in that the balance sheet of the ESF is in some sense controlled by Congress. It was last voted on by Congress I think in the 1930s but implicitly also, I guess, when they voted on the SDR [amendment to the IMF Articles]. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	19	HOSKINS	 Then why do we have to go through a warehousing arrangement? You could just allow them to increase the Fund. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198907	20	TRUMAN	 Because there is a practical limit on the [Fund], which is the size of their balance sheet. They have dollars that were originally acquired at the time gold was-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	21	CROSS	 The devaluation of gold in 1933. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	22	TRUMAN	 The dollar amount was set up in the Exchange Stabilization Fund then; it has been used periodically for a variety of things and they also hold United States SDRs. Congress did review this issue in the context of the approval of the SDRs. In the first amendment to the [Articles of] Agreement in the late 1960s, they authorized the ESF to transfer to the Federal Reserve SDR certificates which, in effect, allows them to monetize those SDRs. In that sense, they again reviewed that source of the ESF funding itself. But that's the last time I know of that it was formally reviewed. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	23	CROSS	 The logic in a sense is not too different from what the Treasury and the Central Bank have. Even when the gold flowed into the country then you were allowed to issue those certificates and receive dollars for them. We no longer have the gold flows; we have foreign exchange flows. And this, in a sense, is a similar allowance for the Treasury to monetize these assets and gain the dollars for them. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	24	GREENSPAN	 There's also another implicit issue here: namely, that there's a pro forma 50/50 split. If that split were not there we could do it all and they would not do anything. So, it's merely a question for them of being able to maintain their 50 percent share of the intervention that's involved. So it's not a circumvention of any statute or convention; it's merely the result of the arithmetic of the limits of the ESF plus a desire on the part of the Treasury to maintain the 50/50 split. The only way it can be done is through the warehousing operation. I should say it's one of the ways; there are other ways. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	25	HOSKINS	 There are other ways they can get Congressional approval for more money for the Fund. I'm not asking anybody to do that, but it seems to me that to some extent we've got something out of whack here. Either the Fund is too small relative to the size of operations we're currently conducting-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198907	26	CROSS	 It isn't the Fund. What this does is to shift the assets in the Fund; it doesn't change the size of the Fund. It allows them to transfer one asset to another asset. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	27	HOSKINS	 I understand that. Well, let me ask you another question, Sam.  	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198907	28	TRUMAN	 It is true, as the Chairman commented, that until the late 1970s, all the foreign exchange held by the United States--what little we had--was held by the Federal Reserve. So this issue didn't come up in that context. The Treasury didn't get into the holding of foreign exchange balances except with respect to their own lending operations until the late 1970s. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	29	HOSKINS	 Are they accumulating [unintelligible] now? Sam, is that sufficient? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198907	30	CROSS	 Yes. The dollar has been declining now for several weeks and we're about 8 or 9 percent down from the highs. We still have more than $2 billion availability under the open limit. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	31	GREENSPAN	 Do we run into a headroom problem there? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	32	CROSS	 Pardon me? 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	33	GREENSPAN	 Do we run into a headroom problem there? In other words, has the dollar decline-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	34	TRUMAN	 No, it's at historical rates. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	35	CROSS	 We value it on the basis at which we have actually made a transaction; so we don't change it when the exchange rates change. That is the only way we can do it because, if we didn't handle it that way, we could inadvertently run out of leeway with nothing happening. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	36	ANGELL	 Sam, to what extent did you use banks to execute the orders in such a manner that the market would not have immediately recognized it as a central bank order? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198907	37	CROSS	 Well, during this period we did most of it in what we call a discreet manner. That is to say, we operated through a bank acting as an agent so that--although the word does get around in some way and people who are following these markets closely can often tell a lot of what's going on--we did not go in openly buying foreign currencies. For the most part we had particular banks operating on our behalf in order not to show the extent to which the central banks were in there. We had gotten to a point where operating visibly was not really working very effectively and we thought it would be better to operate this way. Indeed, it has been much more successful. Remember, the other central banks have done the same thing, following our doing it. The Germans most recently, and the Japanese too, have been operating in a discreet manner. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	38	ANGELL	 Do you think you were able to buy more cheaply by buying discreetly than if you had bought openly? Did you buy the portfolio-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198907	39	CROSS	 I think it was a lot more effective because we had reached a point where the market tended to feel that these rates were out of control--well, not out of control but beyond the ranges that the authorities wanted. And when they saw the central bank coming in there they almost took that as a basis [for believing] that the dollar was by definition undervalued. And they tended to hit it quickly. Now, in operating more discreetly we have been able to kind  of encourage the dollar down without appearing to try to take on the market in a direct way. Under certain conditions one technique is more appropriate and under other circumstances another way is. We have felt during this period, given the market conditions that we faced, that this was the better way to operate. And I think that has proved to be the case. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	40	ANGELL	 Well, Mr. Chairman I would make a comment: I just do not agree that it's appropriate for us to act in ways that are intended to confuse the markets or mislead the markets. I believe that markets work best when all participants have information as to what's going on. I am not a strong believer [in the view] that it made the difference because you did it in a discreet fashion lately. My guess would be that if you had operated discreetly during the previous period and you operated openly during this period you'd have found out that an open way would have worked in a better fashion. I just don't hold that these kinds of moves make that much difference. But even if they did, I do not believe it's appropriate for a government agency in a market society to be acting in such a manner. It's not appropriate for us; I believe it opens up the possibility for the charge of someone privately benefitting from what we do. So, Mr. Chairman, I would register not a dissent from the actions but an indication that if that were to continue I think I would have to object. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198907	41	TRUMAN	 Governor Angell, Sam does make a regular report on Desk operations [public] every three months. It's not as if the operations are-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	42	GREENSPAN	 Give me a scenario in which private parties-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	43	ANGELL	 Well, when we operate in securities transactions at the foreign Desk in what I would call the normal manner that we use at the open market Desk we would be indicating to a group--to more than one participant--what the Fed is doing. And they could all have a chance to participate. When you start choosing one bank to be your agent it seems to me it opens up possibilities. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198907	44	GREENSPAN	 You're saying that that individual bank may choose to-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	45	ANGELL	 Well, yes. And we have-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198907	46	CROSS	 Let me say a couple of things. First, even when we're operating openly we may go to, say, 5 banks out of 100--whatever the number is. So it's not as though we operate in the way the domestic Desk does and broadcast [our operations]; we never do that. We operate with a certain--we go out to do the transaction. Secondly, when we've operated discreetly we have done that with a bank on the understanding that they not reveal this information or talk to other parts of their institution and so forth. Now, obviously the word-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	47	GREENSPAN	 I believe Governor Angell was raising the question as to whether the individual bank trades on that information, which is not available to other participants in the market.  	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	48	CROSS	 Well, in a sense, a bank can do that any time we are in the market and are trading with a bank. As I say, if we are operating quite openly we might go out and talk to 5 banks or 10 banks. They might choose to join us, and this helps move the market in the direction [we want] if they're convinced that it's going that way. We do move around from one institution to another; we don't use the same one, obviously. Sometimes we might use several at once, but we do it in a way that they are not supposed to go tell all their customers and others that they are operating on behalf of the Fed. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	49	ANGELL	 I prefer to be operating in markets in which self interest is assumed to be the motivating factor for the parties we're dealing with rather than to be operating under the assumption that someone is going to be behaving in the manner that suits our interests and that might be against their own self interest. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198907	50	CROSS	 Anybody who is operating to suit our interest against their own interest is going to end up in the hardware business or something pretty soon. I don't think any of them do that. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	51	ANGELL	 Well, in addition to the possibility of something occurring that would give an impression of being inappropriate--in regard to a favorable opportunity for one bank or one trader--I still would hold that it's always best to let markets know what it is we're doing and to try to buy at the best price. And it seems to me that buying at the best price-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198907	52	CROSS	 We do buy at the best price. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	53	TRUMAN	 Governor Angell, we're doing it at the best price but within the limit. If you want to take your rule to the limit--if [buying at the best price] was the objective--then we should have been talking up the dollar for weeks and then Sam could have gone in and bought the foreign exchange cheap. The objective was not to minimize the price at which we picked up yen and DM balances; for better or for worse, it was to limit the rise of the dollar. That doesn't necessarily always mean picking up the [best price]; you can't have it both ways. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	54	CROSS	 We were trying to influence the market; that doesn't mean we were trying to fool the market. But I don't know that it would follow that we always have to tell everybody in the market every time we operate. That seems to me to be a different matter. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	55	ANGELL	 Well, I realize that a bully has more clout at times than does someone who plays according to the rules. But central banks have considerable power. And it seems to me they should operate in an open and clear fashion that gives participants access to information in a timely manner and does not seek to confuse. My view, Mr. Chairman, is that operating as we did tended to disrupt the normal market processes, including the price of gold. And I think it was unnecessary and undesirable. That's all I have to say. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198907	56	HOSKINS	 Just a question. It may be more appropriate for you, [Mr. Chairman]. It seems to me, if I've done my numbers right, that we have increased our net exposure some 50 percent in the last couple of months.  	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198907	57	CROSS	 Well, we increased it by $10 billion; we had $20 billion and we now have $30 billion. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	58	HOSKINS	 That's about 5 0 percent. So the question is: Do we have any practical limits to the exposure that we want to take on in terms of United States economic policy? Since the warehousing arrangement can be expanded indefinitely-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198907	59	GREENSPAN	 Implicitly, there are two questions involved in this. They are basically separate ones. One is: Do we have any limits on the amount of those transactions and eventually the net positions we take strictly for the purpose of influencing the market? And two is: Are we aware or do we care about the capital gains and losses that are implicit in that particular action? To date, the amounts of monies involved have been rather modest. One of the problems that you have, no matter what level you're dealing with, is that it's not always the case that maximizing one's capital gain in intervention would involve the same set of tactics that one would employ to influence the market in a certain way. So, those can be two separate basic issues. I don't remember those issues ever coming up or [our positions] ever being of the size where those issues arose. But I would be more inclined to ask Sam whether he knows of any case back in history when there was a concern about the size of our positions. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	60	CROSS	 Well, no. I certainly don't recall any such time. We have always had [some] and, indeed, even though $30 billion is higher than what we've had in the past I suspect the time may come when we will be pleased to have some currencies. But-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	61	GREENSPAN	 Sam, what's the market value of our gold stock? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	62	CROSS	 Let's see. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	63	TRUMAN	 It's about 9 times the $11 billion; so, about $90 billion. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	64	CROSS	 It's $90 billion if you use market price. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	65	GREENSPAN	 In that sense the same issue as on the foreign currencies is involved-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	66	ANGELL	 Very similar. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198907	67	GREENSPAN	 One should consider them the same if we raise the issue about an absolute level of foreign currencies. The same logic requires that we question the size of [both]. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	68	TRUMAN	 Oh, but that-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	69	HOSKINS	 I see that differently. I see we are not intervening in gold and in my view muddying up the water; we are intervening in currencies. I'm just wondering: How much would we do? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198907	70	GREENSPAN	 What I'm trying to get at is--you're not raising the question on capital gains?  	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	71	HOSKINS	 No, I'm not. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198907	72	JOHNSON	 So, you're talking about whether there is a limit as to how much sterilized intervention we would do as a matter of policy. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198907	73	HOSKINS	 How much are we willing to do? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198907	74	JOHNSON	 But that question, it seems to me, involves our relationship with the Treasury as agent and whether we could do anything we wanted to. That's a big legal question and it gets into all kinds of issues; I've asked those questions before too. It's not very clear. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198907	75	CROSS	 It's not clear. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	76	HOSKINS	 But is there some limit where we will be concerned about it? If we doubled [our exposure] to $60 billion, would that call for being semi-concerned? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198907	77	GREENSPAN	 If we get up to $60 billion the discussion will last twice as long here! 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	78	TRUMAN	 Mr. Chairman, it is fair to say--and maybe this is a flimsy excuse, President Hoskins--that the reason there is a limit in the Authorization is precisely for the concerns that you are raising. I think you realize you're asking for a systematic rather than a routine basis. Historically, the limit was in there because we were concerned about the other side; we were building up exposures historically because we were drawing down-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	79	CROSS	 Right. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	80	TRUMAN	 We were running into debt in periods when it wasn't clear how we were going to bail ourselves out of this process. But it was put into the Authorization--and that was a conscious move on the part of the FOMC at the time--asymmetrically because the exposure was to find out whether we were net long or net short. And it was intended so that the Committee could be concerned about these things. Now, on the Chairman's second question, we have done a staff analysis in a research paper here that was issued recently which does suggest that, at least on the financial risk side of things, our intervention has been profitable. I agree with the Chairman; I don't think that's the major issue here. But that is one of the concerns. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	81	JOHNSON	 I don't think that was what Lee was saying. He's saying, as a matter of policy, is sterilized intervention something that you want to do and are there limits to that? I don't think he's talking about capital gains. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198907	82	HOSKINS	 No, I'm not talking about capital gains. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198907	83	GREENSPAN	 I think that Lee went into this [issue of] volume. I've never really focused on what the limits are but I think it has been the consensus that we're looking at a dollar bubble that is going to turn down and make the issue moot at some point. If that turns out to be false, I think we had better get involved in a good deal more strategic [discussion] of this with respect to the  Treasury, because I think we all feel uncomfortable about this. But at the moment I would say that the issue is probably unnecessary and will eventually disappear from [unintelligible] forecast on what exchange rates are materializing in this group. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	84	JOHNSON	 Still, the interesting question would be, just hypothetically, if we stated that the Federal Reserve would no longer do any intervention for [unintelligible] what would that mean? I'm not sure it would make any difference. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198907	85	GREENSPAN	 It would make no difference. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	86	JOHNSON	 That's the problem. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198907	87	CROSS	 It might not make any difference; it would depend on what the Treasury's attitude was and what they were able to do about it in part. And that creates all kinds of-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	88	GREENSPAN	 I think it will be for their own account presumably to get authorization to hold unlimited amounts of foreign currencies. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	89	CROSS	 Well, or to make some other changes. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	90	TRUMAN	 The worst of all possible worlds would be to give the Treasury the authority to dictate to the Federal Reserve to do it for its own account. Then the Federal Reserve would have no influence over the amount of sterilized intervention that took place. Only the monetary policy operations will offset it. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	91	ANGELL	 And certainly we don't want to do that. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198907	92	TRUMAN	 And the next step would be not to use monetary policy operations to offset it. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	93	ANGELL	 Of course, Mr. Chairman, my comments had nothing to do with any displeasure whatsoever in regard to the size of the intervention. Even though I'm willing to talk about Mr. Hoskins' point, I fully support our objectives in the sense that I support them as a part of the market stabilization effort as distinguished from a market disruptive effort. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198907	94	GREENSPAN	 Are there any further questions for Mr. Cross? We need a motion to ratify the transactions since the May meeting. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	95	KELLEY	 Moved. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	48.0
198907	96	JOHNSON	 Seconded. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	44.0
198907	97	GREENSPAN	 Are there any objections? If not, the motion is passed. Joan Lovett could you bring us up to date on the actions of the Desk? 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	98	LOVETT	 Thank you. Desk operations initially sought to maintain the  degree of reserve pressure prevailing at the time of the last  meeting. The path allowance for borrowing was technically  adjusted to $600 million in recognition of increased usage,  particularly for the seasonal program, but Fed funds were  expected to remain in the 9 3/4 - 9 7/8 percent area. The  borrowing allowance was reduced to $500 million following the  Committee's consultation on June 5, with funds expected to  trade mostly in a 9 1/2 - 9 5/8 percent range. The Desk  continued to view the allowances flexibly, given ongoing  uncertainty about the relationship of borrowing and funds rates,  Borrowing ran a bit below expectations in the first  two maintenance periods and somewhat above thereafter,  averaging about $560 million for the full intermeeting period  through yesterday. The higher levels from mid-June on came  primarily from increasing demand for seasonal credit as such  use rose from about $350 million at the period's start to about  $500 million more recently. Meanwhile, reserve overages and  market perceptions of some lessening of reserve pressures  caused the funds rate to trade to the low end of expectations  for much of the period except for some mild firming around the  quarter-end. The rate averaged 9.61 percent for the full  period through yesterday.  The dominant influences on reserve flows over the  period came from the intervention activity just noted by  Mr. Cross and the wide swings in Treasury balances. Fed and  Treasury dollar sales some $10 billion in total elevated  reserve levels considerably over the period. The drop in  Treasury balances from the swollen tax peaks of late April and  early May released a substantial volume of reserves early in  the intermeeting interval before quarterly June tax receipts  caused the balance to bulge back up again later on.  Consequently, the Desk faced increasing needs to drain reserves  over the first 2 1/2 maintenance periods and a temporary need  to add in late June.  Given this profile, most of the reserve adjustments  were made with temporary operations. MSP's were arranged  frequently into the third period, often for several days at a  time. The Desk managed the reserve absorption with particular  care in early June in order to keep signals neutral around the  time of the Committee's discussions and then to let the modest  easing move show through. Some $2.8 billion of permanent  reserve absorption was done earlier in the intermeeting period  through bill redemptions and sales to foreign accounts. The  Desk tempered its use of outright operations so as not to  exacerbate an expected large albeit temporary need to add  reserves in late June. As it turned out, the late-June reserve  shortage was moderated by continued increases in foreign  currency holdings and a few rounds of RPs sufficed to meet the  need. With Treasury balances having now moved back to normal  levels, prospective drain needs loom large, and we started to  meet them by running off bills again in this past Monday's  auction and resuming sales to foreign accounts over recent days.  In light of those needs, Mr. Chairman, I would like to  request Committee approval of a temporary increase in the  intermeeting leeway from the normal $6 billion to $8 billion.  The projected overage is of sufficient depth and duration that  the added leeway will provide greater flexibility should the  need be enlarged beyond the current forecast.  In the market, meanwhile, the climate went from mildly  positive at the outset to positively euphoric at times. Rates  dropped considerably further, though the move down was not  uniform. The interval was marked by periodic sharp rallies and  intermittent give-backs. Given the magnitude and speed of  these moves at times, activity was often choppy and nervous.  The persistent strength of the dollar provided the basis for  early gains, bringing with it a steady flow of foreign buying  and an undercurrent of speculation that the System would ease  to stem the dollar's rise. Such speculation was particularly  pronounced around the time of foreign rate hikes both early and  late in the period. The sharpest rally was ignited in early  June following the report of a 101,000 rise in May NFP, much  less than expected, and by the Purchasing Manager's survey  index for May which edged under 50 percent for the first time  in almost three years. The dollar strengthened despite these  data, lifted in part by the turmoil that erupted in China at  about the same time. Buying of Treasuries became frenzied at  times amid strong foreign demand for dollar assets. Domestic  investors who had held out in hopes for a correction jumped  in too. Some of these participants felt that yields had  declined too quickly to be sustained but, with many portfolios  underweighted relative to performance indices ahead of the  quarter-end and yield retrenchments grudging, they too joined  the buying spree. While the System's move toward ease was  perceived to be modest, the direction of the move was  considered to be more important.  Meanwhile, data on inflation were not positive but did  not present a protracted impediment to the rally, in large part  because participants seemed to hold out hopes that the worst  news on prices was now behind. This was true early in the  period when the market shrugged off the May PPI report, showing  a 0.9 percent rise and later in the period when the May CPI  rose by 0.6 percent. By then, evidence of slowing economic  growth supported hopes for a concomitant easing of price  pressures. A flurry of articles on the P* model tended to be  read in this direction as well.  For the full period, yields on Treasury coupon issues  declined by about 70 to 90 basis points. Though, I should note  that some back up this morning trimmed those declines a bit.  Yield declines in the long end of the market initially outpaced  other maturities but the rest of the curve eventually followed,  and the largest cumulative declines were in the 2- to 5-year  sector. As a result, the yield curve from one- to thirty-years  was again essentially flat by the close, and today's price  action actually gave the curve a positive tilt. The yield on  the 30-year bond approached 8 percent several times toward the  close, a level which many participants see difficulty in  breaking much below. The Treasury raised $7.7 billion in the  coupon market over the period, a modest amount in relation to  market appetite. There is already discussion in the market of  possible constraints on the size of quarterly financing in  August if debt ceiling legislation gets hung up. In terms of  other potential supply, the market has not been able to prepare  for the potential thrift-rescue plan as the ultimate form   off-budget or on remains in the air.  In the bill market, rates were down by 25 to 70 basis  points. The smallest declines were in the very short end of  the market where relatively high day-to-day financing rates had  the greatest impact. But technical conditions remained  relatively good as the Treasury continued to pay down  bills another $11.3 billion over the period. These paydowns  outweighed intermittent foreign sales over the period as well  as Desk redemptions. In the bill auction this past Monday, new  3- and 6-month bills were sold at 7.96 and 7.63 percent,  respectively, down from average discount rates of 8.21 and  8.19 percent just before the last meeting.  As to the market's outlook, participants uniformly  agree that the economy has slowed but there are significant  differences as to the degree. Some see continued weakness  while some still harbor concerns that a potential rebound lies  ahead. Most seem to expect real growth at about 2 percent in  the current quarter, tapering off to around 1 1/2 - 2 percent  over the balance of the year. While inflation fears have  receded, many express skepticism that the rate will drop much  below 5 percent in the foreseeable future. Consequently,  System easing moves are expected to be gradual and cautious.  Participants note that such was the FOMC's approach on the way  up, and they look for a similar response on the way down. Most  expect the next modest move toward accommodation to follow the  Committee meeting, barring any nasty surprises in Friday's  employment report.  JEL/mm  	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0

198907	106	PRELL	" Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Everyone should have found by his seat a copy of this package of charts entitled ""Material for Staff Presentation."" The first chart in the package lays out the basic premises  underlying the staff s economic forecast. At the top of the list is the  assumption that it is the objective of the Committee to bring about a  gradual reduction in the underlying rate of inflation. Next, we have  assumed that fiscal policy will be on a moderately restrictive course  over the next few years. Mother Nature is assumed to provide farmers  with the weather conditions needed to produce normal crop yields later  this year. And OPEC output restraint is assumed to be insufficient to  sustain crude oil prices at the recent high levels.  In part from these assumptions flow the following financial  projections. First, no movements in interest rates of major economic  significance are expected within the forecast period. As we suggested  in the Greenbook, however, we believe that there may be some tendency  for rates, especially in the short end of the market, to move a little  lower next year as inflationary pressures begin to abate. Second, owing  to the easing of rates that already has occurred, monetary velocity is  projected to weaken a bit in the near term, and M2 is expected to  increase around 4 percent this year and 6-1/2 in 1990. And finally, the  dollar is projected to depreciate at a moderate pace.  Chart 2 summarizes the resulting staff forecast. Real GNP  is expected to grow just over 1-1/2 percent this year and next,  abstracting from the rebound in farm output after last year's drought.  The unemployment rate drifts up to just over 6 percent, a level that we  are presuming implies enough slack to put downward pressure on wage and  price inflation. In our forecast, these disinflationary effects begin  to emerge during 1990, but not early enough to show through clearly on  the four-quarter changes shown in the bottom panel. Assuming that the  margin of slack in resource utilization is sustained, however, we would  project a noticeably smaller increase in the price level in 1991.  The next chart presents a tabulation of your own forecasts for  1989 and 1990. We defined the central tendency fairly broadly,  encompassing the middle two-thirds of forecasts. For 1989, the central  tendency for GNP growth, at 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 percent, has slipped down  from what was reported to the Congress in February. The drop would be  less marked if one were to take a narrower cut, as the majority of you  are between 2 and 2-1/2 percent. For inflation, the central tendency  has moved up to 5 to 5-1/2 percent. For 1990, the central tendency view  is that growth will run in the 1 to 2 percent range, with a large group  clustered between 1-1/2 and 2 percent, while the CPI central tendency is  4 to 5 percent, with most in the 4-1/2 to 5 percent range.  As you know, the Administration has yet to announce the  economic assumptions that will underlie the FY1990 budget projections,  and we understand that they will not do so until July 18. The growth  numbers shown for 1989 bracket the three options they've said they are  considering. I think that we can safely predict that their scenario  will remain on the rosy side of yours.  Like your central tendency for 1989, the staff's projection of  real GNP growth this year also has been trimmed. A considerable portion  of this change in our forecast reflects a shortfall already recorded  earlier this year, in which consumer spending played a big part. The  upper left panel of chart 4 shows the deceleration in overall consumer  outlays and the absolute decline of late in real spending on nonauto  goods. Frankly, the drop, especially in some categories of nondurables,  is so sharp as to raise doubts in my mind about whether these numbers  will hold up in future revisions; nonetheless, the breadth of the  softening this year suggests that there has indeed been some pull-back  in consumer demand.  The explanation for that pull-back does not appear to be found  in the behavior of personal income. To be sure, the first-quarter runup in the total, shown at the right, included an assumed jump in farm  income that might not exert much influence on current spending. But,  even if one looks at the weaker increase on net this year in labor  income, the red line, the observed degree of slowing in spending is not  fully explained.  One suspect, of course, is the rise in interest rates. Even  though much of the slackening in demand is indicated to be in what we  normally think of as the less interest-sensitive components of spending,  survey evidence suggests that rising rates did cause people to worry  more about economic prospects. Taking a longer view of spending  behavior, as in the middle panel, however, it is noteworthy that the  slide in the share of income going to consumption since the stock market  peak in 1987 fits rather nicely with the pattern of household net worth.  Partly on the assumption that household wealth will not be  moving radically one way or the other relative to income, we have  projected that outlays will track fairly closely with disposable income  from here on, producing increases of only 1-1/2 percent in real PCE in  1989 and 1990.  Your next chart focuses on an area of spending that clearly is  interest-sensitive: housing. As you can see in the upper panel, we are  expecting to see some pickup in both single and multifamily starts from  the low levels of the spring. Given the size of the decline in long-  term interest rates that has occurred, the projected rise in single  family building is not especially large. Projected slow income growth  and changing demographics are two reasons. A third is the flatness of  the yield curve and conditions in the secondary mortgage market.  As indicated in the middle left panel, rates on adjustable-rate  loans have retraced only a small part of their earlier run-up. Absent a  resurgence of teaser activity, our interest rate path would suggest that  the ARM rates will remain relatively high. The flat yield curve has had  an effect in the secondary market, too, by hampering the underwriting of  derivative mortgage instruments. Meanwhile, the market has had to  operate under the shadow of potential sales of mortgage-backed  securities by troubled thrifts. These tensions are reflected in the  widening spread between GNMA and Treasury rates shown at the right,  which, in turn, has curbed somewhat the decline in rates on fixed-rate  loans in the primary market. Passage of the thrift legislation may ease  the situation a bit, but we shall have to see how the actual resolution  of cases proceeds.  The bottom left panel suggests that the recent drop in mortgage  rates significantly improved the affordability of new homes, but that  there still is a considerable problem in the Northeast.  Regional disparities also exist in the multifamily area, as  reflected in the figures plotted at the right. There has been a  noticeable decline in rental vacancies in the South over the past year  or so. Given the overall supply picture, however, we do not expect to  see booming multifamily construction any time soon.  Nonresidential construction activity also is projected to be  less than booming, as indicated in the top panel of the next chart.  There may be some carry-through of the recent pickup in industrial  building, but given the overhang of office and other commercial space,  total investment in nonresidential structures seems likely to edge off  over the forecast period. Meanwhile, a sharp deceleration is predicted  for equipment spending, which has been quite robust of late. On net, as  indicated at the right, growth in real business fixed investment is  expected to slow to only 2 percent by next year.  On the surface, our projection for BFI in the current year  appears to be appreciably below what would be indicated by the surveys  of spending plans taken in April and May. In nominal terms, we have BFI  rising 7 percent, year over year, 3 percent below the Commerce survey  result reported in the middle left panel. However, given conceptual  differences and other technical considerations, this differential  probably implies only a modest upside risk to our forecast. A  considerable softening in spending would be expected because of the  usual accelerator effects associated with a slowdown in overall output  growth. Perhaps we can already detect some hint of this in the new  orders for nondefense capital goods, plotted at the right, which have  lost a good bit of their upward momentum in recent months.  In contrast to the strength in fixed investment thus far this  year, inventory investment has been surprisingly subdued. Our  impression is that manufacturers have been quick to adjust production to  the weakening in final demand, and that they have kept their stocks  quite lean. At the retail and wholesale levels, the picture is more  mixed. Apart from the well-known predicament of auto dealers, we think  that moderate overhangs may have emerged this year in some other  segments of retailing. However, a drop-back in imports of consumer  goods and a softening in United States production of late suggests again a fairly  prompt adjustment that should head off more serious problems.  As is illustrated at the right, we are looking for rather  moderate rates of inventory accumulation in the period ahead, as  manufacturing activity remains sluggish.  Completing the tour of the major components of domestic  spending, chart 7 focuses on the government sector. State and local  purchases, in the upper panel, are forecast to grow at around a 2  percent rate, matching the current Commerce estimate for the first  quarter. Desires to spend are likely to be constrained in many locales  by budgetary pressures. The operating deficit of the sector, the  national income account measure that excludes retirement trust funds, is  projected to remain sizable.  At the federal level, spending restraint is the order of the  day, with defense purchases likely to remain in a downtrend.  The bottom panel summarizes our fiscal outlook, which  incorporates assumptions in line with the 1990 Budget Resolution. With  the revenue surprise of this past spring, it looks like the deficit for  the current fiscal year may come in at about $148 billion, while our  forecast for FY90 is just within the $110 billion sequestration trigger  for that year. The memo item in the table is our measure of the fiscal  impetus to aggregate demand, and the negative numbers there for 1989 and  1990 imply restraint.  As I indicated earlier, we believe that restraint on economic  expansion is necessary if there is to be a diminution in the underlying  pace of inflation. The top panel of chart 8 illustrates our price  projection, differentiating between the overall CPI and the CPI  excluding food and energy, which is taken here to be a rough proxy for  underlying inflation. In the first half of this year, there was a  marked acceleration in the total index, but the ex.-food-and-energy  portion continued to rise at the same pace as in 1988   assuming that  there was not a major gyration in June that we have missed. We are  projecting some pickup in the rise in this component over the next few  quarters, although we think the worst is past for the CPI as a whole.  I should note that the steadiness of the ex.-food-and-energy  index thus far this year has been something of a surprise to us, and we  have carried through some of that surprise into the forecast. Our  suspicion is that the strength of the dollar has played a significant  role. Import prices are estimated to have decelerated considerably, as  shown in the middle left panel, and this has even greater effects on  expenditure price measures like the CPI than on production price  measures such as the GNP deflator. Given the projected path of the  dollar, import prices should continue to rise relatively slowly and damp  domestic inflation until the latter part of 1990. The behavior of the  dollar and the projected decline in industrial capacity utilization  should help to retard the advance of goods prices in particular, not  only at the earlier stages of processing indicated by the PPI data at  the right, but also at the finished goods level.  As I indicated, energy and food prices leave a considerable  mark on the forecast of overall inflation. The lower left panel shows  our assumption that the average price of a barrel of imported oil will  fall from the second-quarter average of almost $19 to about $17 by the  beginning of next year. The drop in crude prices should show through in  a mild decline in consumer energy prices in the second half of this  year.  As regards food, we expect to see a considerable slackening in  the pace of price increase in the second half of this year and a  relatively moderate rise of 4 percent in 1990. With acreage planted up  considerably, reasonable weather should produce ample crops. However,  for processed foods, rising labor costs will continue to push prices  higher.  Chart 9 addresses the outlook for wages. One element  affecting the outlook is the size of consumer price increases over the  past year and the level of inflation expectations. The Michigan survey  for June showed an average 12-month inflation expectation of 5 percent,  at the low end of the range since last summer. Actual CPI inflation in  the year ended May was 5.4 percent. With a tight labor market and  inflation expectations in that vicinity, history would suggest that  compensation increases ought to be moving toward the 6 percent plus  range   thereby producing a real gain in line with the trend of  productivity. Given the indications from recent experience, however, we  have continued to discount these predictions: abstracting from the  special jolt associated with payroll taxes and a probable hike in the  minimum wage, we have the underlying trend in the Employment Cost Index  peaking at between 5-1/4 and 5-1/2 percent by early next year.  Recent wage data   most notably the monthly average hourly  earnings figures   clearly have suggested that the reported shortages  of workers are not translating into dramatic wage increases throughout  the economy. But the bottom panels reveal a picture that is broadly  consistent with the information on labor market conditions. In the  goods-producing industries, there really isn't much sign of wage  acceleration, which fits with the fact that employment in that sector  has remained below earlier peaks, and with the continuing fear of  foreign competition and potential job loss. But in the service-  producing sector, where employment growth has been tremendous and labor  shortages are most frequently mentioned, the trend of wage and total  compensation increases is quite clearly upward. The less unionized  segments of the work force typically have exhibited the greatest  acceleration of wages as labor markets have tightened cyclically, but we  also may be seeing some correction of wage differentials that became  exceptionally wide in the 1970s.  In any event, we recognize the uncertainties that exist in this  critical area of the forecast, and we have attempted to address them in  the next chart, which reports the results of some econometric model  simulations. The Baseline scenario here is the Greenbook projection  extended judgmentally through 1991 on the assumption that Fed policy  will accommodate enough growth in aggregate demand to hold the  unemployment rate close to its projected end-1990 level of just over 6  percent. Under that assumption, we would project a deceleration of  prices to around 4 percent over the course of 1991   as measured by the  fixed weight GNP price index. (I might note that, because we also have  assumed that the dollar continues to depreciate moderately, the  deceleration in domestic expenditure prices   for example, the CPI    would be a tad less.)  The two alternatives were generated by altering the model to  capture more optimistic and more pessimistic views of prospective wage  behavior. There are many ways of doing this, but the one we chose was  to shift the NAIRU in the model up and down one-half percentage point.  The behavior of wages in the judgmental Greenbook projection may be  interpreted as being consistent with a NAIRU of about 5-3/4 percent. In  essence, the ""less inflation"" alternative assumes that the current,  5-1/4 percent, level of unemployment is one that does not cause wages to  accelerate or decelerate; the ""more inflation"" alternative assumes that  the NAIRU is more like 6-1/4 percent, about the point where wages in  fact began to accelerate noticeably back in 1987. We assumed in both  simulations that M2 follows the same path as in the Baseline.  This experiment indicates that, if we follow the Baseline M2  path and wage pressures are less than embodied in the staff forecast,  inflation could fall to 3 percent in 1991, with the unemployment rate  rising a little less than in the Baseline projection. On the other  hand, if wage behavior is less favorable, even with a higher unemployment rate than in the Baseline, inflation in 1991 would be 4-1/2  percent.  In my mind, the results underscore again the question one faces  in interpreting the wage pattern of the past two years: Namely, should  one read the graphs as showing a general upsweep in wage inflation since  the jobless rate reached 6 percent in 1987, or should one place greater  emphasis on the surprising gradualness of the wage acceleration and the  hints of leveling in the recent period? We believe that our forecast is  a reasonable middle road between the two views, balancing the risks in  both directions.  Ted will now continue the presentation. "	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	107	TRUMAN	" Two opposing elements are expected to exert strong  influences on developments in United States external accounts over the  balance of 1989 and into 1990: first, the strength of the dollar  in foreign exchange markets during the past 18 months, and,  second, relatively faster growth in the major foreign industrial  economies than in the United States.  The top panel in the first chart on international  developments shows that the weighted average foreign exchange  value of the dollar in terms of the currencies of the other G-10  countries   the red line   has appreciated by more than 10  percent in nominal terms since December 1988. The appreciation  since the low of December 1987 has been about 15 percent in  nominal terms and, as shown by the black line, 18 percent in real  terms. As is indicated in the box on the right, the dollar's  nominal appreciation so far this year has been most pronounced  against the yen and pound sterling, while the dollar has actually  depreciated against the South Korean won and the Taiwan dollar.  While the relative rise in United States long-term real interest  rates in late 1988 and early 1989, as measured and depicted in  the bottom panel, probably contributed to the dollar's strength  earlier this year, that rise was apparently more than reversed  during the past three months. Until the past two weeks, the  dollar continued to appreciate on balance in terms of other major  currencies. As the data on nominal interest rates in the box on  the right indicate, German short-term rates have increased significantly since last December, and Japanese rates have increased marginally, while United States rates have eased slightly on  balance. During the same period, long-term rates have risen  substantially in both Germany and Japan while United States rates have  declined markedly.  As Sam Cross has noted, some of the dollar's  appreciation can be attributed to the influence of various  political developments around the world and to short-run  financial-market expectations, developments and uncertainties;  however, much of the dollar's recent strength is at this point unexplained by fundamental factors. Economists are inclined to  label such phenomena as ""speculative bubbles"" that, by  assumption, are destined to burst at some point.  While not quite fully embracing the bubble-explanation,  the staff is projecting that the dollar will depreciate at a  moderate rate for the balance of the forecast period under the  influence of rising interest rates abroad for much of the period,  United States rates that tend to edge off in 1990, and growing United States trade  and current account deficits. However, because of the dollar's  high average level in June, the dollar's average value in the  third quarter may be higher than it was in the second quarter. Thus, in terms of the other G-10 currencies, the dollar is  projected to decline after the third quarter of 1989 by about  6-1/2 percent per year in real terms; in terms of the currencies  of non-G-10 countries, the decline is expected to be about 2-1/2  percent in real terms.  Turning to developments in other major industrial  countries, the next chart indicates in the upper left panel that  growth of industrial production abroad continues to be quite  robust. At the same time, as shown in the right panel, consumer  prices have accelerated under the influence of strong demand,  rising oil and other commodity prices, higher import prices  associated with depreciating currencies, and special factors    such as increases in consumption taxes in some countries.  As is shown in the middle panel, non-oil commodity  prices have been reasonably stable in dollar terms over the past  year or so, but measured in the currencies of other foreign  industrial countries they have risen substantially on average.  Against this background, as noted in the box at the  bottom of the chart, it is hardly surprising that policymakers  abroad continue to be concerned about renewed inflation and  capacity pressures. As a consequence, we expect some additional  monetary tightening in 1989 in most of these countries, followed  by a gradual easing of interest rates in some of them in 1990 as  growth slows and inflation declines. However, the easing is  expected to be confined only to a few of the countries such as  Canada and the United Kingdom; we expect no easing in Germany or  Japan. Fiscal policies abroad are expected to be generally  neutral, though Germany is scheduled to complete the last stage  of its multi-year program of tax reform and reduction at the  start of 1990.  As depicted"" in chart 13, economic developments in the  major foreign industrial countries have been, and are expected to  continue to be, far from uniform. In the United Kingdom and  Canada (the upper left panel), where inflation has risen to a  relatively high level, policy, especially monetary policy, has  been directed for some time at reducing demand pressures. As a  consequence, as is shown in the lower left panel, growth of real  GNP has already begun to slow from the high rates achieved in  late 1987 and early 1988. In contrast, the upper right panel  indicates that the increase in inflation in the other four major  industrial countries has been to a more moderate rate, and action  to resist inflation has been less vigorous and more delayed. As  is shown in the lower right panel, the expected implications for  real GNP in these four countries on average are also more  moderate, with growth slowing but continuing at a higher rate, on  average, than in the United Kingdom and Canada.  For the foreign industrial countries as a group, the  growth rate of real GNP, as shown in the red bars in the upper  left panel of the next chart, is projected to decline somewhat in  the second half of this year but to pick up again in 1990 and to  remain on average above growth in the United States. While, as  shown in the box at the right, a gap between the growth of GNP  and domestic demand is projected to persist through 1990 for the  foreign countries as a group, the gap shrinks because the effects  of the resumption of the dollar's depreciation is offset in part  by the dollar's strength over the past 18 months.  As is shown in the middle panel, the pattern of economic  activity in all foreign countries as a group (developing  countries as well as industrial countries) is projected to follow  that for the major industrial countries alone   slowing this year and picking up a bit in 1990. Taking a United States perspective, slower growth in several key Asian and Latin American markets [China, three of the four Asian NIEs (not Taiwan) and Venezuela]  will tend to hold down demand for our exports.  The lower panel presents our outlook for consumer price  inflation in the major foreign industrial countries compared with  the United States. The influence on foreign inflation of strong  demand, higher oil prices, a rising dollar and special factors, as has already been described, results in some narrowing of the  differential between United States inflation and inflation abroad this  year. Next year, most of the factors pushing up inflation abroad  are likely to be eliminated or reversed, and growth abroad will  slow somewhat from the average pace of 1988 and early this year.  As a result, the inflation differential is projected to widen  again, as is shown in the box at the right.  The outlook for our exports is illustrated in Chart 15.  The top panel shows the recovery in United States agricultural exports  that has been underway for the past three years and continued  through the first quarter, when large shipments to the Soviet  Union and China boosted the totals. For the forecast period, the  quantity of agricultural exports is expected to remain on a high  level, but not to expand substantially further, while prices of  these exports, as is shown in the box at the right, remain  essentially unchanged this year and rise moderately next year.  Several factors serve to hold down the growth in these exports.  One is relatively favorable weather conditions in the Soviet  Union. A second is the outlook for a record world harvest of  soybeans. A third is the strength of the dollar.  After a dip in the first quarter of this year, United States  exports of computers (the middle panels) are expected to recover and then to expand at a somewhat slower pace than in recent  years. Since the prices of computers measured on a quality- adjusted basis are projected to continue to decline at a rapid  pace, increases in the value of such exports should moderate.  The pace of expansion of the quantity and value of other  non-agricultural exports held up well through the first quarter  of this year (the bottom panels); exports of industrial supplies  and consumer goods have performed particularly well. However, we  project that lower growth abroad and the strength of the dollar  will inhibit the expansion of such exports in the future. As  shown in the last line of the box at the right, the pace of  increases in the quantity of these non-agricultural exports  measured in 1982 dollars is projected to slow this year and again  in 1990. Meanwhile, the rise in prices of such exports is also  projected to slow because of the stronger dollar and lessened  upward pressure on prices from petroleum input costs.  Consequently, in value terms, the increases in non-agricultural  exports retreat to the single-digit range.  On the import side, the next chart, increases in prices  of non-oil imports have moderated significantly as the dollar's  depreciation was first stopped and more recently has been  reversed. As is shown in the upper left box, over the four  quarters ending in the first quarter of this year increases in import prices were roughly cut in half in most categories,  compared with increases over the previous four quarters. At the  same time, as is shown in the box at the right, increases in the  quantities of such imports generally have declined or have been  quite moderate.  As Mike noted, in the first quarter of 1989, the  quantity of imports of consumer goods actually declined, after  increasing sharply in the fourth quarter. The timing of imports  of apparel and household goods from Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan  probably reflected the influence of the ending of GSP tariff  benefits for these countries. However, sluggish United States consumer  demand probably also played a part. The number of passenger cars  imported from both Japan and Germany also declined by more than  20 percent in the first quarter.  The box in the middle panel shows that increases in  prices of non-oil imports are projected to moderate further on  average over the four quarters of 1989 before picking up in 199 0  as the dollar resumes its decline. Meanwhile, growth in the  quantity of such imports is projected to be held down by slow  demand and, later, by rising prices.  Mike Prell has already presented our assumption about  oil prices. The bottom panel illustrates the implication for oil  imports. After a dip in imports in the first quarter that  apparently was associated with a drawdown in inventories, the  quantity of oil imports is expected to have rebounded in the  second quarter. It is projected to expand gradually over the  balance of the forecast period under the influence of moderate  increases in consumption and a continued decline in domestic  production. However, as the price of imported oil edges off in the third and fourth quarters of this year, the value of United States oil  imports should decline somewhat before resuming its uptrend.  Chart 17 summarizes the staff's outlook for United States  external accounts. The black line in the upper left panel shows  the estimated sharp improvement in real GNP net exports of goods  and services in the first half of this year. In fact, this was  more than accounted for by the improvement already recorded in  the first quarter since we think that there was a small  deterioration in the second quarter. As the black line in the  chart indicates, there is essentially no further net contribution  to real GNP from net exports over the balance of the forecast  horizon.  Meanwhile, as shown by the red line, the current account  deteriorates after the first half of 1989. The deviation between  the two series reflects primarily the influence of three factors:  First, the resumption of the dollar's depreciation involves at  first the relatively strong influence of J-curve effects; import  prices rise, and quantities of exports and imports are slow to  respond. Second, depreciation tends to depress imports of goods  in real terms over time but has little net effect on such imports  in nominal terms. Third, imports of services in the GNP accounts  exclude interest payments on United States government liabilities. Such  payments are expected to rise rapidly over the forecast period,  and they are included in the current account. However, interest  payments on United States government securities finance only part of the continuing large current account deficits. Growing net  investments in the United States that take other forms must also  be serviced. Both forms contribute to the discrepancy between  the merchandise trade and current account balances shown in the  box at the right.  As you know, the recorded United States international net  investment position turned negative in 1985 as is shown in the  bottom left panel of the chart. Last week, the estimate for the  end of 1988 was released   more than $500 billion. While the  Commerce Department took pains to emphasize the measurement  errors involved in these estimates, they also correctly  emphasized the clear negative trend of recent years   a trend  that is expected to continue. The box at the right illustrates  the fact that, while the United States current account deficit in 1989 and  1990 is expected to remain in the vicinity of 2-1/2 percent of  GNP, our negative net investment position will continue to rise  rapidly as a percent of GNP. In fact, if United States nominal GNP were  to increase at an average annual rate of between 6 and 7 percent,  the ratio of our net external debt to GNP would not stabilize  until it reached about 40 percent. However, if the nominal  interest rate on our external debt were close to the growth rate  of GNP, the trade balance would have to continue to narrow as a  percent of GNP.  The last chart presents an alternative forecast with an unchanged foreign exchange value of the dollar. As Mike has  already stated, for the baseline we extended the Greenbook forecast through 1991, incorporating the assumption of a $25 billion deficit-reduction package in FY1991, M2 growth at 7  percent, and a continuing moderate decline in the dollar. In the  alternative forecast based on the staff's econometric models, we  assumed that the foreign exchange value of the dollar remains  unchanged from its current level because of a stronger autonomous  demand for dollar assets than is implicit in the Greenbook  forecast. However, because the dollar's recent path ended at a  high level in June, this alternative assumption in our simulation produces no effective change in the dollar's value until the  fourth quarter.  We also assumed that monetary policy holds M2 growth on  the baseline path. This would allow interest rates to decline  somewhat relative to the baseline because growth of nominal  spending is lower.  The slower growth of nominal spending is composed of  both slower growth of real GNP and a more moderate rate of  increase in prices. The latter would be fostered by both the direct effects of the stronger dollar and the indirect effects  from less demand.  Real GNP abroad would benefit from the dollar's  stability because the effects of slower United States growth overall would  only partly offset the effects of the different composition of  that growth because of the dollar's strength   less United States demand  for United States production and more United States demand for foreign goods and  services. The counterpart would be found in the United States current  account deficit which would be about $15 billion larger by the  fourth quarter of 1991. Such a reversal of the process of  external adjustment might not be sustainable indefinitely though  it clearly has been for the short run. It is one reason why the  staff's forecast incorporates a resumption of the dollar's  depreciation   at a moderate rate. However, as we have  demonstrated in the past, the timing and speed of that  depreciation, if it occurs, no doubt will differ from what we  have incorporated in our outlook. Moreover, the depreciation  could be larger. As a first approximation, a depreciation of the  dollar at twice the rate in our baseline forecast would produce  outcomes with the opposite signs to those shown   faster United States  GNP growth, more inflation, a modest but discernible improvement  in our external accounts, and slower growth abroad.  Mr. Chairman, that completes our presentation. "	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	108	GREENSPAN	 Questions for our colleagues? Manley. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	109	JOHNSON	 I'd like to follow up with a question I keep asking every time. The interest rate assumptions behind this forecast are generally for higher interest rates into 1990--both short and long rates, but more on the short than the long. Still, if you go back to the February FOMC meeting, I think there was an assumption of a pickup in long rates of up to 1 percentage point from about the 9 percent level then prevailing and of about 1-1/2 percentage points on the funds rate. Since that time interest rates appear to have peaked; long rates are down about 75 basis points from where they were then, instead of up. Short rates appear to be peaking out well short of that range. If the economy has slowed more than anticipated--although I'd have to go back and check that--and if the inflation forecast is maybe even a little lower than anticipated back at that point, what has changed? How do you explain that? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198907	110	PRELL	 In terms of precisely what we were projecting back in February, we did indeed have a rise in short-term rates. We had the federal funds rate moving up to 10-1/2 percent or so. I must say, actually, that the federal funds rate rose more in the first half of the year than we anticipated. At the same time, we had bond yields moving up and approaching 10 percent and on long Treasuries we had some slight movement upward to around 9-1/4 percent in the second quarter of the year. We flirted with that [level]. Clearly, with the recent drop, they dropped below the trajectory we had at that time. We also were not anticipating a dollar on the path that we have seen. My suspicion is that that's an important element in this whole story. Now, we could probably go on for hours trying to dissect what has happened and determine which way causation ran. I personally find appealing the notion that we may have had an autonomous increase in demand for dollars which expressed itself to some degree in depressing bond yields. Be that as it may, the dollar has been on a different path. And as I suggested, we think that has been a significant  element in damping inflationary pressures even though there are some lags in the process, looking at the composition of price movements and so on. We think there is something to be said for the argument we presented in the Greenbook dissecting the price measures. On the demand side, I think we have had a surprise on consumer spending. To an extent we were looking earlier at that pattern of household net worth and discounting it a bit. We could see that there was an argument for a higher saving rate. Maybe that indeed is what has happened. We wouldn't have anticipated the stock market being as strong as it is now but the level, as was already suggested, may be driving [unintelligible] and be a drag on consumption. Where we come out now is that we are looking at short-term rates and long-term rates that will be below our expectations. And we think the dollar's higher level will be something of a drag on domestic production growth over the next few quarters and, therefore, something of a depressant on price inflation. We are interpreting this recent decline as having a significant real element, which will help to boost the interest- sensitive sectors of the economy in the months ahead, particularly housing. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	111	JOHNSON	 On that point: interest rates on the long-end have been trending down for a while, yet the economy hasn't shown any signs of being stimulated by that. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198907	112	PRELL	 I don't see a declining trend in long-term rates, really. I think they fluctuated in the 9 to 9-1/4 percent range for quite a while and then we had a very sharp drop. I don't think we've had enough time to see the response [to that]. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	113	JOHNSON	 Well, I think there's-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198907	114	PRELL	 I will admit that the anecdotal evidence does not suggest a tremendous change in the mortgage market and housing demand at this point--or I should say on the home building side. Clearly, there is evidence of a flurry of refinancing activity. And maybe if people are rushing out to refinance they also perceive rates to be more attractive for buying homes. There is naturally a lag in this process and sometimes a tendency to hold back until one thinks rates have gotten as low as they are going to go. So, we would expect to see homebuilding improving in the next couple of months. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	115	JOHNSON	 Okay. But I think there is some modest downward trend in long rates; if you draw a line through the fluctuations, I think you can see that. The other point, though, is that rates are considerably lower relative to where you were forecasting them and yet you have weaker GNP. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198907	116	PRELL	 I think it's partly because we have had the weaker GNP. I think the markets were surprised, in part, by how quickly the deceleration in the economy occurred. They became less concerned about an inflationary overshoot and I think that has been a factor; that probably has contributed to some diminution in the inflation premium. At the same time, we think that the real rates will come down. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	117	JOHNSON	 That's fine. But why haven't those relatively low interest rates had some stimulative effect, with a lag? They have  been lower than you forecast for a considerable period of time. I assume what you're saying is that the dollar has offset that. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198907	118	TRUMAN	 One way to think about it, Governor Johnson, is that the change of the dollar's forecast--at least over the four quarters of 1989 as now projected--is 12 percent. If you think that somehow the market has changed its assumption by that much, that's considerable; they don't have to even see that. They can see future implications, for both inflation directly and for aggregate demand, that are going to come from a stronger dollar over that period-- especially if you go back near the turn of the year, or November- December, when we were still dealing with a situation in which the dollar was quite soggy. And to the extent that the market at that time was projecting, as we were, a continued decline in the dollar-- which under the conditions of relatively full employment we were going to have to accommodate, if you want to put it that way, by restraining other elements of demand--that was the strength that was then in the system. The dollar turned around and added to that whole process restraint that wasn't in our forecast; but in some sense, it certainly wasn't in the markets' forecast either. So, you have this key change in expectations, which had [effects on the] performance of the economy and on the outlook. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	119	JOHNSON	 So going forward, assuming the dollar is not going to appreciate--you even have some depreciation--are you saying, then, that that represents a decline in real interest rates and some stimulus to the economy? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198907	120	PRELL	 If you look at our housing forecast, particularly this time versus last time, you see a different tilt. To that extent there is some stimulus coming to domestic demand. Since our last forecast, the major change, in a sense, has been that we now have the dollar doing some of the work we formerly thought that interest rates were going to have to do. We've had a shift toward a lower net export contribution to GNP growth than we had previously, which is offset by some contribution from interest-sensitive domestic demand sectors. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	121	JOHNSON	 Okay, I'm having a little trouble assuming-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198907	122	PRELL	 This may be evaporating by the minute. Logically, if we're going to go incrementally from forecast to forecast that pushes one back in the other direction. But I don't want to make that much of a small movement. The level adjustment has been considerable in the picture-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	123	JOHNSON	 I think I understand your logic. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198907	124	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	125	PARRY	 My question has to do with interest rates as well. The financial projections indicate that interest rates will have changed little through 1990. Then in the Bluebook, there's reference to what the impact might be on other short-term and long- term rates. I assume the projection is with regard to the funds rate. If you had the funds rate in particular remaining at its current level for a couple of quarters, it seems to me that the impact on other short-term interest rates would be quite marked as opposed to the 1/4 point change referred to in the Bluebook--which is over a shorter  period I'm sure--and that there could conceivably even be some significant change in long-term rates as well. Is that in the model or in your forecast? I really can't tell. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198907	126	PRELL	 In our forecast there is some backup, for example, in 3-month bill rates and Treasury bond rates but-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	127	PARRY	 Could you tell me how much ? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198907	128	PRELL	 Well, I've written down about 1/4 of a point this quarter. It's not as large as I think you're alluding to. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	129	PARRY	 But if you just let the model run for three quarters how much backup do you think you'd get? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198907	130	PRELL	 Well, I'm not sure I want to let models run on this because, basically, what really has happened, according to our models, is that long-term rates are now where they should be relative to short-term rates given a term structure equation that has its long- term rates determined with a lag by short-term rates. The mystery earlier had been why long-term rates were so high given that we had had the sharp descent of short-term rates. That should have fed through. I don't know that the models capture the forward looking expectations formation that seems to characterize financial market behavior today. I do concede the point that there would be a risk of a bigger backup on this. I was disinclined to be any fancier about this, having made the mistakes in the past that Governor Johnson was so kind to point out again. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	131	JOHNSON	 I just had to, Mike! 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198907	132	GREENSPAN	 If I had asked about this I would have said: Explain to me why your models worked so well so consistently prior to this. This is more like the average [experience]. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	133	PRELL	 The term structure equation has worked remarkably well over-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	134	GREENSPAN	 There is a sense in which the problem is that we were getting [inured] to the outcome replicating the models in a way which we cannot expect them to continue to do. What we're looking at to be explained now is a more average experience than what was to be explained six months ago. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	135	PARRY	 Well, that's just with short-term rates. The relationship between short-term [and long-term] rates is not more traditional. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198907	136	PRELL	 Well, I think the market is expecting further easing in the funds rate; there's no doubt about it. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	137	PARRY	 Okay. All I'm trying to do is figure out the consequences-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198907	138	PRELL	 Indeed.  	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	139	PARRY	 --if you get this level. It seems to me that in the short-term end of the market you'd have a backup of substantial proportions. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198907	140	KOHN	 I think the market probably has about a 50 basis point decline, and maybe more after today-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	141	JOHNSON	 I'd say much more after today. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198907	142	KOHN	 --built into the funds rate over the next 3 months or so. So the question is what their expectations would be if we didn't ease. Would they continue to expect that ease down the pike? And that's not-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	143	PRELL	 That's what Don has argued in the Bluebook: that because that movement in interest rates isn't going to affect the path of economic activity in the next couple of months that path of economic activity is likely to look soft enough that people will probably still be expecting some further ease--unless they take the view that the Fed is really bent on fighting inflation and taking sizable risks on a soft economy, in which case the bond rate rise, if any, might be negligible. So, I think you get into a very complicated kind of guesswork about expectations against various events in the economic news. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	144	PARRY	 But you were saying that the funds rate assumption is what? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198907	145	KOHN	 I think the market has built in about a half point [decline] over the next 3 months or so. Joan [Lovett] has a different view. The bill rates are way down today; they may be a little more after today. But as of, say, Friday or Monday I think that was a fair statement. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	146	JOHNSON	 But all that's within a month. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198907	147	KOHN	 No, no. The way I look at it there's [a decline of] about 25 basis points within a month and the other 25 basis points in another month or so. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	148	JOHNSON	 The one-month forward funds rate is closing in on what? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198907	149	KOHN	 I don't have the most recent table with me but a few days ago it was about 9-1/4 percent. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	150	JOHNSON	 Okay. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198907	151	KEEHN	 For those of us who were on planes today, has something been going on in the market today that is significant? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	35.0
198907	152	KOHN	 Well, bill rates are down about 15 or 20 basis points--or the 3-month bill rate is, anyhow. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	153	PARRY	 And the dollar? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198907	154	TRUMAN	 The dollar has dropped by 2 percent or so since yesterday.  	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	155	CROSS	 It's 1.8815 in marks and 138.30 in yen. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	156	BLACK	 Are they attributing that to what they think we're about to do? What is the explanation? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	7.0
198907	157	JOHNSON	 If you look at the bill market they are. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198907	158	CROSS	 That's certainly part of the explanation. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	159	TRUMAN	 That, interacting with the economy and Friday's reports, right? 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	160	CROSS	 They've been looking at purchasing managers' [reports]. I think there has been a cessation of the things that were driving the dollar up--all these political factors, these portfolio things, that have happened. They have tended to focus on other subjects. They have seen some evidence that the economy appears to be easing, or is at least slowing down a little; and building on these expectations about what's happening to interest rates is certainly part of it, I think. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	161	PRELL	 At the risk of beating this too far into the ground I would just say, given our uncertainties, that if the 3-month bill rate were to go up to 8-1/2 percent or a shade higher versus what we have here we wouldn't regard that difference as all that material for the economic outlook. I don't want to hinge everything on a quarter point or so on the 3-month bill rate. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	162	SPEAKER	 Makes sense. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0

198907	164	SYRON	 Mike, do you have any inkling as to what's going to happen with the GNP revisions? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	51.0
198907	165	PRELL	 We really don't have much to go on. Perhaps Dave [Stockton could address that]. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	166	STOCKTON	 The data that we've seen to date--the retail sales and inventory data--are not suggesting a large revision in GNP. But what we haven't seen is so much larger than what we have that it probably would be dangerous to make any firm statement at this time. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	167	BLACK	 Any guess on the unemployment rate and the figures this Friday? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	7.0
198907	168	PRELL	 Our guess at this point is that the unemployment rate will edge up and that we'll have an employment increase of less than 200,000. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	169	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	170	ANGELL	 Yes, I want to express appreciation to both Mike and Ted for the chart show. Whether anyone agrees or not, I thought it showed very well the total package of what you're expecting. It was particularly helpful to me to have those alternatives that both of you presented. I found it very helpful.  	12	12	1.0	1.0	43.0
198907	171	GREENSPAN	 Any further questions? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	172	GUFFEY	 This question may already have been answered, Mr. Chairman, but regarding the notation in the Bluebook that, given the baseline forecast, you might expect short-term interest rates to tick back up because of overplay by the markets: Is the baseline forecast still consistent with, say, Bluebook alternative B? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	20.0
198907	173	SPEAKER	 [Yes.] 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	174	GUFFEY	 It is. And that contemplates an uptick some time in the future, and probably the near-term future, of short-term interest rates? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	20.0
198907	175	KOHN	 Well, as we were saying to President Parry, a small uptick. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	176	GUFFEY	 A quarter or two up? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	20.0
198907	177	KOHN	 Yes, a quarter. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	178	PRELL	 This is a quarterly-average number that we have in our forecast. One could even reconcile a bigger movement in the near term of some easing. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	179	GUFFEY	 Thank you very much. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	20.0
198907	180	GREENSPAN	 Further questions? If not, would somebody like to start the Committee's discussion? President Parry? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	181	PARRY	 All right, fine. Mr. Chairman, the economy in the West currently is rather surprisingly robust. Although recent monthly employment data for California suggest that the rate of growth is slowing, the California economy will remain at a strong level. Employment growth in Nevada, Washington, and Oregon ranks them among the six fastest growing states in the nation. Outside of Alaska and Arizona real estate markets continue strong. In April, the statewide median home price in California rose above $200,000 for the first time. Home prices also are rising rapidly in Washington and Oregon, but from far lower levels. One curious development comes out of our regular survey of District business leaders. Almost all of those surveyed indicated that they believe that the economy, in general, is slowing and will continue to slow. But when we ask them about their own businesses virtually no one sees any significant slowing in their own businesses, outside the lumber industry. Despite the high level of activity on the West Coast our outlook for the national economy is really quite similar to that of the Greenbook. We believe the economy appears headed for sluggish economic growth but no recession. In fact, we see the possibility of some downside risks for the economy in terms of economic growth. According to our analysis consumption and business-fixed investment have been growing unusually rapidly in the past two years. A reversal of this pattern could mean a weaker economy than now seems likely. Despite slower economic growth the economy remains above its full employment level. Thus, I would agree with the Greenbook's inflation outlook, which shows relatively constant rates of inflation for 1990. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
198907	182	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	183	BOEHNE	 I'd say that in the Mid-Atlantic part of the Third District there's a clear change in the tone of the economy. Almost all sectors are flat to down: residential and nonresidential construction are off significantly; manufacturing is flat; retail sales, while up a touch in dollar terms, are clearly down in volume terms; and for the first time since the expansion began employment, as measured by payrolls, is down a little. Having said that, labor markets still remain tight and the unemployment rate is still below that of the nation. Nonetheless, this is the first time we've seen payrolls down. I would say that attitudes in the business community can be characterized as cautiously optimistic, but I do sense a fragility there. I think that the expansion has gone on for so long that people have gotten in the habit of thinking it will continue. Maybe they believe that that is the most likely outcome. But I think we could see a fairly prompt deterioration in those sentiments, at least as expressed by business people in my District. Looking at the national economy we can't help but be influenced by the people who surround us, and I think the outlook nationally is still most likely to be a soft landing. But the chances of a bumpier landing have increased. As far as the Greenbook forecast goes, I think that the downside risk is greater than the upside risk. There is just very widespread softness in the economic indicators. While there is no evidence of a cumulative downturn, when you see widespread softness you begin to ask questions about whether it might be self reinforcing. So, I would say that, yes, the Greenbook outlook is a reasonable one; but my own sense is that the risks on the down side have increased noticeably over the last six weeks. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	33.0
198907	184	GREENSPAN	 May I ask both you and President Parry whether you sense or know of any marginal inventory backup? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	185	BOEHNE	 No, I have not sensed that. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	33.0
198907	186	PARRY	 No. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
198907	187	GREENSPAN	 The reason I raise the issue is-- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	188	BOEHNE	 Maybe a little in retailing outside autos, but not much. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	33.0
198907	189	GREENSPAN	 In the autos you can see it. But there's just the earliest margin that one senses and I'm curious to know whether or not we pick it up from the data ever so slightly in a couple of other places. I want to know whether or not one senses that as being real, cumulative, or an illusion. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	190	BOEHNE	 Well, I sense the beginnings of a little hesitation in some planned expansions or equipment purchases. Plans are still going forward but you get just a bit of a feeling that people are beginning to wonder for the first time in a long time whether it is the right decision. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	33.0
198907	191	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	192	FORRESTAL	 Mr. Chairman, like much of the rest of the nation, economic activity in the Sixth District has continued to slow somewhat--although I'm getting the sense from people that they don't feel that this slowing is going to continue or, to put it another way, that the deceleration is worsening. The slowing in overall activity basically reflects the balance of very weak construction activity and rather strong growth in international trade. We've seen this translated into rather robust port activity, for example, in the District. As I mentioned last time, it's interesting to note that a lot of this increase in exports and the resultant port activity increases are due to some increase in exports to Latin America. We see the usual continuing sluggishness in housing and auto sales. But this time we took an extra special look at wages and the availability of labor and we still see very little wage pressure, even though in some areas and in some selected industries there is a tight labor market. But wage increases have been remarkably slight. On the inventory question that you raised we don't see much evidence of inventory accumulation in the District--outside of autos, of course. The general tone perhaps coincides with what others have said in that there now seems to be a shift toward some concern about too rapid a deceleration, whereas before in the District people were saying that inflation was a concern. Although I don't think it ever was an acute concern there was more concern about that than about a decline in the economy. I think that has very definitely shifted. And while people will tell you that their own businesses are doing fairly well, there is a cautionary element now that is going to be reflected in business plans in our District at least. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	39.0
198907	193	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	194	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, our projections are very close to those in the Greenbook. We have slightly higher growth in real GNP and a slightly higher inflation rate but the differences here are really minor and not worth mentioning. The overall profile of the forecast is just about the same. More interesting than the projections themselves is the question as to where the risk of error probably lies. If one looks at domestic final demand only, one might conclude that the risk in the case of GNP is definitely on the down side. But, as we all know, the behavior of net exports of goods and services has had a very large impact on our total GNP over the last six years. And the prospects for net exports are something of a wild card in the outlook currently. I think the staff's projected sharp drop in the growth of exports is certainly reasonable, given the strength of the dollar. But the underlying demand abroad is pretty strong in a number of countries and this could buttress our exports for a while, I think, even if the dollar remains relatively strong. On balance, I would say that the risk of error in our forecast and that of the staff's is probably on the down side; but I wouldn't rule out the possibility that the economy could be a little stronger, given this wild card on the export side. When we get to the price issue, I think the risk is about evenly distributed. The staff is expecting that the underlying rate of inflation as measured by the CPI less energy and food will be about 5 percent over the next several quarters. I think a lot of that is going to depend on how strongly these aggregates come back and whether the projection of growth in the aggregates is really going to materialize. On an anecdotal level, at a recent meeting of our board  of directors to which we invited our alumni there were more mentions on the part of both groups about how tight labor really is and the virtual impossibility of attracting labor. Now, we have a pretty prosperous District by and large with the exception of a few parts of West Virginia. But still, it was striking that so many were reporting such difficulty in attracting labor. This leads me to think that we may have more wage/price pressures than some people assume or that these pressures may be around a little longer than some are assuming. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198907	195	FORRESTAL	 Excuse me, Mr. Chairman, could I back up? I neglected to mention our forecast and outlook for the national economy. Our forecast for real GNP is somewhat stronger than the Greenbook's and our forecast for inflation is higher as well. The difference in GNP is almost entirely due to our view of consumer spending; and I gather from what the staff said that perhaps they are a little uneasy about that forecast. We think consumer spending is going to be somewhat higher. If the Greenbook is correct about consumer spending I suspect our forecast would be about the same as theirs. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	39.0
198907	196	GREENSPAN	 Okay. President Keehn. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	197	KEEHN	 Mr. Chairman, with regard to the current situation, at least in a national context, I do think there is a buildup of indicators that suggest fairly specifically that the growth rate is moderating. That's particularly true in the interest- sensitive parts of the economy, notably cars and residential construction. But across a broader spectrum of the current leading indicators I think we do see some tendency for moderation and a trending downward. With regard to the forecast, ours is really very similar to the Board staff's. We have somewhat stronger growth in 1989 and more so in 1990. I doubt it's worth going down sector-by- sector because I think in the main it's a difference in the policy assumption that we use in putting our forecast together. We would expect a more rapid decline in interest rates, particularly short-term rates, than is true of the staff forecast, which accounts for our higher outlook on GNP growth. With regard to the District, what seems to be true in the national level is certainly less true within the District. There are a couple of parts of the District that certainly have peaked and are heading down. Automotive is clearly a part of that, and merchandise sales have been trending down for the last couple of months. But other parts of the District continue to show strength. For example, through May commercial construction contracts were up 1 percent versus a decline for the United States as a whole. That same kind of dichotomy is true for residential construction. We've had a bit of an increase whereas other parts of the country have been down. As a result of that, within the District the demand for building products, specifically gypsum and cement, has been pretty strong. And the demand for business equipment and other categories of industrial equipment continues to be surprisingly vigorous. The steel business has been good though they expect something of a decline in the second half. Nonetheless, the first half has been good enough that for the year as a whole steel in the District will come in pretty well. Employment in the District has shown good gains. We are equal with the national numbers and at this point our unemployment rate for the  District as a whole is under the national average; that's the first time that has happened in a while. On the price and inflation side the situation is a bit more mixed but I think, on balance, it's positive. The reports we're getting from our directors as well as other market contacts would suggest some stabilization in raw material prices. Indeed, a couple are coming down; aluminum and copper have been mentioned as prices that are coming down. And with some minor exceptions there are no stand-outs in the raw material category that are showing great big increases. For finished product prices I understand that market pressures continue very intense. For example, in the paper industry they're operating at higher rates. who runs a company in one part of that industry says they are operating at 93 percent. And though they have had price increases over the last 12 months, looking ahead they think they are not going to get any increases at all. And that's quite unusual to be operating at those higher rates and not getting price increases. On the labor side, despite very tight conditions I'm surprised and impressed by how good at least the organized contracts are coming in. People are still getting 3-year contracts and some are quite low. I heard one comment of an increase in costs of 1-1/2 percent per year but that's unusual. The 3 percent continues to be quite common. On the agricultural side, and here I think the situation is very uncertain, the eastern part of the dDstrict has had far too much rain and the1 western part has not had enough; unfortunately, you can't average that out. We're simply going to have to wait and see how the growing season takes place to determine whether or not we're going to have good yields. But despite that, the demand for agricultural equipment continues to be surprisingly strong. Both tractors and combines are being sold at a higher rate this year than last year. One of the major manufacturers in our District has cancelled a two-week summer shutdown so they can keep up with demand. I think the District doesn't quite reflect the trends we're seeing in terms of the national numbers. But having said that, we lagged the recovery on the way up; and I think it's probably true that we're going to lag this turn on the way down. Pretty shortly some of the moderation trends that we're seeing nationally will show up in the District as well. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	35.0
198907	198	GREENSPAN	 Thank you. Governor Johnson. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	199	JOHNSON	 I'm getting a little more concerned about the economic situation since we met last time. Starting on the same day that we made our modest change in borrowing, June 5th, we got a whole series of data that I think have become a little more troubling. On June 5th auto sales came out and were marked down from May over the previous April by about 2/lOths of a million units. Today when we get the report for June I think the numbers will be down again. And auto production schedules have been cut back some since that time. On June 13th we got reports on real retail sales, which were down 7/lOths of a percent; and that was the fourth month in a row of negative real sales. On June 15th industrial production came out and had increased 0 percent. Capacity utilization was marked down. On June 16th we got housing starts, which were down for May by about 2.1 percent. And permits stayed unchanged at a fairly low level. On the 23rd of June we got new orders for durable goods, which were down 4-1/2 percent for May; nondefense capital goods orders were down 8.6 percent for May, and excluding aircraft they were down about 3.2 percent. Real  personal consumption, which came out the same day, was down 0.3 percent, and real personal income was down 0.2 percent. On June 28th we got leading indicators, which were down 1.2 percent; they were down in three out of the last four months. Then, most recently, we got the purchasing managers' survey, which showed new orders for June actually negative for the first time in a long time. Vendor performance for June for the first time in a long, long time showed actual faster deliveries, not just a slowing in the rate of increase [of backlogs]. Prices paid were also down below the 0 line, showing an actual decline for the first time. That's a whole string of data. And that's starting to look like a deterioration. These data are all just series of information that are incorporated in the financial markets even more. We have seen it build up over the last several weeks. The yield curve has gotten more negative. Bond rates now are down quite sharply; they closed in on the 8 percent rate for a while and for the 30-year bond they're still around 8.12 percent, or something like that. If you put the fed funds rate on a coupon basis, the yield curve is inverted by almost 2 full percentage points. The markets are clearly expecting lower future rates by a considerable amount. The bill market has even started to discount more sizable moves than I would imagine. Now, maybe it's just a lot of noise lately, but the bill market is down 20 basis points today. Looking at the traditional relationship between rates on bills and fed funds, which builds in a spread of about 3/4 of a point, if you take into account where bills are today the market is discounting almost a full percentage point decline in the funds rate. There may be some noise in there, for sure. But the fact is there's a fairly sizable discounting going on in the markets, based on a string of data like this and a lot of information that's coming through. What worries me about it is that once that psychology starts developing--and the longer the short end of the market is held up--the more future interest rate declines are anticipated. Once you get that psychology in the market investors start postponing investment projects expecting rates to go even lower. Consumers quit financing consumption because they expect to finance consumption at an even lower rate in the future. And this situation starts feeding on itself. The postponement of activity due to expected future declines in rates will continue as long as the short end of the market is being shored up so high above the long end. I think that's one of the risks. Now, if nothing happens what worries me is that markets could become disorderly at some point. A string of data like this and a feeling that the market is not realigning itself on the short end with expectations on the long end at some point could make the stock market vulnerable to flight. That's what I worry about. Whether this will continue is not clear. But I see a very troubling series of trends going on. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	44.0
198907	200	GREENSPAN	 President Syron. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	201	SYRON	 Mr. Chairman, the New England District that has led the upturn to some extent is certainly way out front in the downturn. In talking to our directors and other people around the District, I'd say in terms of making their own investment decisions and going forward there is some cautious pessimism on their part. Things seem to be fairly soft over a pretty widespread area. Specific industries such as the high-tech and computer industries are quite soft. Some of that may be related to particular mix factors in that  part of the industry. In the defense sector, which is very important, current work in process is starting to be reduced and they are really concerned going out. Employment has been growing somewhat more slowly than nationally for a while now. Superimposed on all of this, we do have an overhang in the construction industry and in the housing industry; the result of this is that loan demand has softened a bit and we're starting to get a backlog of property on the market and an expansion of auctions. This combines with the fact that we have in Massachusetts, the largest state in the District, very serious fiscal problems--both state and local. People reading about the fiscal problems continuously has led to a broader pessimism, which has been reflected in retail sales. So, inventories are not a problem at this point in time but people are being really quite cautious. Wages have been well behaved, as you might expect in this environment, though the labor market in the services area--particularly the lower-end services sector--is still quite tight. But it's loosening up a fair bit in production levels. As far as the national economy goes, we would generally agree with the Greenbook as it was presented with a couple of caveats. We have somewhat stronger growth in GNP as a result of somewhat stronger consumption growth--obviously in other parts of the country--with the saving rate not holding up as high as the Greenbook has it. We have some concern about higher inflation because of the uncertainty on our part that wages nationally will remain as well behaved as they have in the past, particularly looking at the tightness in labor markets and what has happened to prices in an overall sense--not just excluding food and energy, but all prices. So, I think it's pretty clear that we're in a very difficult period. We don't see a cumulating downturn in the economy. But I think the risks are at least balanced, with probably some more margin on the softer side of the economy. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	51.0
198907	202	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	203	GUFFEY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On the regional side, the Tenth District is continuing to improve. To be sure, it's still lagging the national scene; but given where we started a couple of years ago we're still improving. On the food and agricultural side the outlook is good, notwithstanding all the talk of what has happened in the drought areas. For example, drought has [hit] in Kansas and the northern sector of Missouri and it extends up pretty much across Iowa. But given the additional acreage that has been planted, the outlook for production of agricultural products is really very good in light of the rain that has fallen in a good part of the United States outside of the Tenth District. In wheat specifically, the hard red winter wheat that is principally grown in the Tenth District--in Kansas particularly and in Oklahoma and Texas--that crop to be sure is going to be down considerably because of the drought situation. But overall, it's important to note that the production of wheat on the national level is going to be up about 15 percent above what it was last year. And that's notwithstanding the fact that Kansas, which is one of the biggest producers of the hard red winter wheat, is going to harvest something less than half of the crop harvested just a year ago. Given that kind of an outlook, we would agree with the comments that were made by Mike and others with respect to food prices in the period ahead: that they will be moderate, with about a 4 percent increase over the next year. The energy industry in the Tenth District has not fully participated in the nationwide improvement in  exploration and development. Indeed, in Oklahoma the number of rigs fell substantially over June, for example, whereas nationally that count was up. Manufacturing continues to improve, largely in the export-sensitive aircraft and high-tech areas. And construction continues to improve very modestly in the District. It is above the year-ago level; although commercial construction is down somewhat, overall construction is up. On the national level, I recognize that in all of the numbers that have come in, and that have just been recited for our review, there is a softness that appears to be showing through. I would see that as coming close to achieving the objective that we've been striving for, and that is, to bring the overall growth down. However, we would see growth in 1989 and into 1990 somewhat greater than the Greenbook forecast, largely reflecting a bit stronger consumption than the Greenbook forecast incorporates. Overall, the only real evidence of wage [pressures] and concerns that we have been able to uncover in the Tenth District is in the steel settlement that was announced earlier. There's a real concern that a steel producer in the Tenth District who is in the midst of negotiations now will be badly hurt if that type of settlement is imposed upon them. That's all I have, Mr. Chairman. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	20.0
198907	204	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	205	MELZER	 In terms of the outlook, our money-driven model ends up with a pattern very similar to the Board staff's forecast--in other words, slowing real growth and inflation leveling off over this year-and-a-half period. The main difference is on the real side where we have considerably weaker real growth--roughly 1-1/2 percent for this year as a whole and 1 percent for next year. But in terms of the deflator our numbers are within a tenth or two of what the Board staff has. The only other thing to mention is that our forecast assumes, as does the Board staff forecast, a reacceleration in money growth in the second half of this year and continuing on in the next year. As far as the District is concerned, our numbers show this continuing pattern of slowing that has been mentioned. Non- agricultural employment growth is slower than the national average. It's interesting that even though the unemployment rate is coming down the District rate is still somewhat higher, at around 6.2 percent. But the labor force obviously is growing very slowly. Manufacturing employment, in contrast to the national picture, has really held up with other employment growth. We're not seeing the relative weakness that shows up nationally there. However, there are some industries where there is a slowing or, in fact, declines in employment: in the auto industry employment growth is slow; and there have actually been declines in food processing, electrical machinery, and printing and publishing. The one area of notable weakness is nonresidential construction where in the most recent period for which we have data, the 3-month period ending in May, we have a decline of about 20 percent compared to the prior period. Again, I think we have just gone through this cycle quite a bit later than some other parts of the country in terms of the nonresidential construction. As far as [unintelligible], I don't really detect the same shift in tone as some others have mentioned. Certainly, people will acknowledge that there has been a slowing, but in the contacts I've had I have not picked up this concern about possible cumulative weakness.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	42.0
198907	206	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	207	STERN	 As best I can judge, the District economy is now performing very similarly to the national economy. That is, the pace of the expansion in general has slowed--allowing, of course, for the usual diversity between economic sectors and particular regions within the District. As this has happened it seems that earlier concerns and reports about inflationary pressures have ebbed at the same time; and this has gone on even though for the most part labor markets remain quite tight and we continue to hear reports of labor shortages. With regard to the national economic outlook, our model generates an interest-rate pattern similar to the Greenbook--that is, essentially flat interest rates from here on out--and somewhat more rapid real growth, especially for 1990. I personally am a little more cautious than that, in part from reading and reviewing many of the same statistics we've all looked at and Governor Johnson summarized. But having said that, I would also add that in many respects it seems to me that things have worked out largely as we might have hoped a few months ago, in the sense that I think it was recognized that we needed a slowing in consumer spending and a slowing in the pace of employment gains if we were to arrest what appeared to be building inflationary pressures and some deterioration in the psychology about the price outlook. So, I think in many ways things have evolved about as well as we might have hoped. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	41.0
198907	208	GREENSPAN	 President Boykin. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	209	BOYKIN	 Mr. Chairman, the Eleventh District economy continues to show modest improvement overall. Much as Roger indicated for the Tenth District, we do have to keep in mind that we were coming off a very low growth base of economic activity. Even though we are getting modest improvement we continue to show weakness in construction activity, and I guess that would be expected for us. Single-family housing is the only area of construction that does show some improvement. While the energy sector has shown a little growth in the last few months in response to the higher oil prices, the gains are very small. Drilling and related activity are still below the depressed levels of a year ago. Recent rains have improved the agricultural outlook for this year in some parts of our District. But nonetheless, we still expect farm income to be a little below last year's. We are seeing continuing gains in the manufacturing sector, with nondurable goods showing the greatest strength. The outlook in our area is at best guardedly optimistic as cuts in defense spending, slowing in overall demand nationally, and an inability to expand output in chemicals, petro-chemicals and paper all combine to restrain [the prospects for] growth in coming months. Orders growth has been slowing in several industries. Retail sales, including autos, continue to show year-over-year gains down our way. And Houston continues to be kind of the shining example for us, which is a considerable change over a couple of years ago. Price and wage pressures remain well below the national average in that regard. I am glad to report on the financial side that in the first quarter our District banks just about broke even for the first time in over two years. Nonperforming [loans] and charge-offs continue to move in the right direction; but part of this is a statistical illusion as many of the loans in recapitalized banks are put back to the FDIC. All in all, we think the banking sector is still several quarters away from  supporting business expansion. We haven't noticed or detected any real inventory problems in the District. With respect to the national outlook, the Greenbook [forecast presents a reasonable picture of] what we're going to be facing. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	34.0
198907	210	GREENSPAN	 Governor LaWare. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	211	LAWARE	 Mr. Chairman, I'm delighted to see these indicators showing a significant slowdown in the rate of growth. At the same time, I'm skeptical about whether we have seen the full effect of the inflationary pressures that were there in the past. I believe that we are more likely to see at least a quarter more of some upward pressure on prices as the [past pressures] are reflected. But what concerns me most are the consequences of a more severe slowdown that could be triggered by a failure of the expectations that Governor Johnson was touching on a few minutes ago. I think the markets are extremely skittish. The way the stock market, the foreign exchange market, the bond market, and the money markets have been bouncing around makes me nervous because I think that reflects the nervousness of the markets trying to read things into every bit of information that is published and reacting--or overreacting, in my opinion--to things that are not necessarily indicative of what's going on in the big picture. At the same time, as a backdrop to all of that, I think the financial system is rather narrowly balanced. We have these huge amounts of corporate debt, some of which is based on a very skinny coverage of debt service. We have junk bonds being a significant investment in a number of pension funds. A number of banks are supporting the short-term credits involved here. And we have a lot of S&Ls with a lot of that junk paper as well. So a significant turndown in the economy could cause all that to get out of whack and have a ripple effect throughout the whole financial system that I think could be very severe. A lot of that debt is really based on continued growth at current or immediately past levels rather than on the kind of growth that we're talking about, which I suspect may be a disappointment. We also have an LDC debt situation that is more and more unsettled because of political influences. And the banks, if they are encountering very severe profitability problems in other directions, are going to be in a far less competent position to handle the kinds of pressures that may be imposed either because of the adoption of debt reduction plans or because of simple default. We have a real estate market that is increasingly soft in many parts of the country where it was previously very strong. And that is going to be compounded by the overhang of the RTC disposal situation which is X hundreds of billions of dollars. Whichever strategy the RTC adopts-- whether it is a quick disposal and [a decision to] dump the overhang on the market temporarily and hope the market will come back, or whether it's hold onto it--the overhang is going to tend to depress those prices. It seems to me that anything that could restore some confidence in the markets might have a desirable effect there, because the banks and the S&Ls are the principal ones who are going to get hurt by that kind of a situation. So, I think that in spite of the risk of not achieving further progress on inflation immediately, the effects of a significant recession--if that's what we've tipped into--could be even greater. I'm not at all satisfied that we even have to be in what is  technically a recession in order to have significant changes in business plans and significant consequences in the areas that I'm talking about. I think there are great expectations out there for lower rates, and the disappointment of those expectations could result in an acceleration of the slowdown that could take it out of our hands. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	50.0
198907	212	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	213	HOSKINS	 Well, for the second month in a row, I can report that [businesses in] the Fourth District are less optimistic than they have been for the last 18 months. Having said that, overall they are still operating at pretty high levels of utilization of resources. Nevertheless, there has been a slowing in the pace of sales, new orders, and even production. We have things that were on allocation that are not on allocation now. We have some, at least, not accelerating factors. Overall, people in the District that we've talked to still expect the inflation rate to stay between 4 and 5 percent and to be relatively stable in that range. Among those who are less optimistic, it will be no surprise to you to discover steel. Their concerns may have evaporated in the last two days because they were primarily based on the idea that the dollar staying where it was would impact them--being a commodity-oriented business more than some of the others; they had concerns that the second half would be impacted by that level of the dollar. Capital goods also are softening, but for different reasons. There are cutbacks in auto demand and cutbacks in defense spending and those are cutting into machinery fairly significantly. But the backlogs that are in place will carry people in terms of production and shipments pretty much through the remainder of the year. There is one other point in the capital goods area: [Unintelligible] continues to say that the export side has been very good, that the foreign investment boom is going to continue. So they are looking for continued strength through the year in terms of capital goods. Inventories overall are not a problem, but people are saying that apparel is starting to back up as are home building and materials a little. But it is nothing that they are overly concerned about at this point in time. They think there will be very quick adjustments before the situation could get out of hand. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	49.0

198907	225	GREENSPAN	 What's the strike-hedge buying that the purchasing managers were talking about this year? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	226	HOSKINS	 The strike buying? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	49.0
198907	227	GREENSPAN	 As I recall, the purchasing managers were commenting about strike-hedge buying in steel. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	228	HOSKINS	 I'm not sure which-- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	49.0
198907	229	PRELL	 There have been a couple of negotiations and there is one ongoing, which was referred to earlier. Those may have been what they were looking at--Bethlehem and some others. 	13	13	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	230	GREENSPAN	 Oh no, they weren't referring to Bethlehem or National--well, it may have been National. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	231	STERN	 But I thought National rejected the contract. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	41.0
198907	232	KEEHN	 Inland has been in negotiations but I don't [think] they are a major supplier of the auto companies. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	35.0
198907	233	GREENSPAN	 Yes, it could have been National or Inland that they were commenting on. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	234	PRELL	 Actually, I heard those stories some months back as explaining the strength in steel production, even in the latter part of last year. It has been a pretty murky matter as to what was going on and the timing. 	13	13	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	235	HOSKINS	 In terms of the national outlook, we don't have a quibble, really, with the Board staff's projection. I'm happy to see that we don't have accelerating inflation and I'm not very happy to see that we don't have decelerating inflation. I am concerned that we think we can do more with demand management than we've proven to be able to do in the past through monetary policy. And I continue to think that our long-term objective ought to be to get some more progress on the inflation rate than we're showing in any of the alternative scenarios. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	49.0
198907	236	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	237	CORRIGAN	 Mr. Chairman, I view the staff forecast as basically a reasonable one. My own forecast is probably a bit stronger in real GNP growth terms, as has been the case for a long, long time. We have an inflation rate both this year and next that is still running 1/2 percentage point or more above what is in the staff forecast. I look at the forecast today versus, say, 12 or 6 months ago, and I think there is an important difference in that 12 or 6 months ago I, at least, viewed the situation as being distinctly asymmetric on the side of too much growth and too much accelerating inflation. I would view the staff forecast now as reasonably well balanced. But by definition the forecast that in those circumstances  is reasonably well balanced today is one that does have somewhat greater downside risks than it did before. But that's in the nature of things. That to me says that we've either been lucky or good. Now, on the question of lucky or good-- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198907	238	GREENSPAN	 Or both. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	239	CORRIGAN	 I was about to say I think where I come out is both. I say that because I am hard pressed to convince myself that the rise in interest rates over the past year or so, going back to March last year, has been decisive in causing the slowdown in spending we have seen, except in housing. In other areas in which we have seen a slowdown I think I can convince myself that the slowdown may have as much, if not more, to do with other things than it does with interest rates. Certainly, I think that's true in autos where saturation alone, coupled with the bunching up of purchases of fleets of automobiles by auto rental agencies and others, is producing some anomalies--as reflected in the widening spread between used car prices and new car prices. In the area of nonresidential construction, I think the slowdown is at least as much, if not more, the result of the excesses that took place earlier, in terms of commercial real estate development and shopping centers and other things. Energy I don't think is interest-rate driven. And the slowdowns that we're seeing in both state and local and in Federal government purchases of goods and services clearly are not interest-rate driven. So, I think there has been a combination of some fortuitous developments, rather than luck, and some good policy that has produced the kind of result that I think many of us wanted to see. Although I agree with much of what John LaWare said about all these financial problems, the only problem is that I could make a case that they are an argument for tighter monetary policy rather than easier policy. Be that as it may, on the anecdotal side there is clearly a sense that one picks up, as several others have talked about, of things having slowed down further--especially in May and June. As I mentioned to you earlier today, Mr. Chairman, periodically we have been talking to a group of firms--we can't call it a survey because OMB would get mad at us, but it has certain characteristics in that direction--and I'd like to share with the Committee several features that came out of our talks with these firms in the period of June 19th to June 23rd. We have done this enough so that it has its own little history to it and we can get a sense of what the dynamics are. First of all, in terms of export orders and export growth the [unintelligible] pattern now is that most of them are still seeing export orders running in a range of 10 to 15 percent increases, which is down from 20 to 25 percent last year. But that seems to be largely a kind of a saturation thing. None of the firms, with the exception of one small manufacturer, said that the exchange rate appreciation that we've had in recent months has yet had any impact on their export orders, although several did say that if the exchange rate stayed above 2 marks or 140 yen that they would expect that to begin to show. But it has not shown to date. They also are suggesting that their backlogs of export orders are still high and rising. I'm not going to go through all of this but just on the question that you specifically raised, Mr. Chairman, the second interesting part is on the inventory side. What we see is that the clear majority of firms, especially the big firms, are reporting inventories as quite normal. But again, in sharp contrast with earlier discussions with these people, we now have  something like a third of them expressing a little uneasiness about inventory developments and a couple saying that inventory developments may well prove to require some production slowdowns. Again, it's not precisely [the information] in and of itself; it is that there is a change in the kinds of things that these same firms had been saying to us in the past. The price forecasts are basically, except for certain sensitive commodity price tables of intermediate materials, in the 5 percent range. Capacity investment plans are holding up; there are no major changes. And in some cases these companies are talking about very major investments. The paper company is talking about two new plants coming on stream in the early '90s, and this is big stuff. There is no sign of any retrenchment at all. There is one interesting development. A large chemical company tells us that they are getting ready to build a new plant that won't come on stream until 1991--Mr. Truman, you'll be interested in this--and they went out and hired to assure them that the dollar would come down before they made their decision. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198907	240	TRUMAN	 Did they get their money back? 	13	13	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	241	CORRIGAN	 They volunteered that. The last thing that I think is very telling is in their anticipated wage bill increases for 1989. And here, there is an unmistakable virtually across-the-board acceleration. About a third of the firms are now talking 3 to 4 percent; they were talking 2 to 3 percent. Another third are at 5 percent; they were talking more 3 to 4 percent. And another third had increases ranging as high as 10 percent, but most of them were within the 5 or 6 or 7 percent range. What should one make of this? I'm not sure. But clearly, there are three or four areas-- export orders, inventories, investment, and wages--where [discussions with] this handful of very representative firms do suggest some important changes from what they were telling us a year or two ago. There is one last point I would make at this juncture. I want to say a little more on the inflation issue in the context of the policy discussion tomorrow. If I go to Mr. Truman's chart 17, the external side of our economy still stinks; there's no other way to put it. Nobody else seems to worry about it too much, but I sure do. I don't know what the right exchange rate assumption is, heaven knows. But if you take our forecast--this is a minor thing at the margin--we get back in 1990 to a situation in the United States where domestic demand is growing faster than GNP again. It's not by a lot but that's where we end up. That's not a forecast as much as it is an observation. But if you look at those numbers, you can put whatever margin of error you want around them and they are lousy. That net investment position in 1990 ends up at minus 14 percent of GNP. That is trouble looking for a place to happen; and it's going to come home to roost on us sooner or later. And partly for that reason, that reinforces my own view that I'm quite prepared to accept running some risk of the kind of slow growth that is built into the staff forecast and maybe even growth that is a little slower than that. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198907	242	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	243	ANGELL	 In looking at the current situation, it does seem clear that there has been some change of patterns. Of course, a lot of this is very, very good. Those of us who would like to see the trade balance corrected without a depreciating technique would believe  that that's the only way that we're going to get to our primary [objective] of stable prices. We're going to have to have a stable dollar to do that. And certainly the slowdown in consumer spending is an integral part of that success. The only problem is whether anyone believes that you can take consumer spending from a 3 or 3-1/2 percent range and cut it in half and somehow or other just automatically stop there; I think there's some uncertainty about that. I don't know whether Mike will be pleased to note that there is at least one individual on the Committee who is on the other side in regard to the consumer spending issue. Mike, I'm looking for decidedly slower real consumer spending than the Greenbook. And I note that I'm the only one, I guess, who is on that side. You've heard a lot of others on the other side. So, it helps to get you closer to the middle, Mike, for me to take that position. The reason that I believe consumer spending was slow in the second quarter and had slowed below what we had in the first quarter and below what I think the Greenbook says for the second quarter relates to a very logical follow-up of a set of developments. One is that we have had extremely slow money growth over such a long period of time that there is not the kind of liquidity out there to support what has turned out to be inflation in the discretionary consumer spending area. If you only have 10 to 15 percent of consumer income that is discretionary spending, you don't have to [unintelligible] to begin to make a decided difference. When we have reports that we not only have the unexpected estimated income taxes in April but we also seem to think the money stock was showing that, then that seems to go along also with some adjustments in terms of consumer behavior. It wasn't so long ago that during April tax paying times it was somewhat more noted as to how much borrowing might be utilized to facilitate the income tax effect rather than some sense of drawing down money balances. Stop and think about marginal tax rate changes and the lack of deductibility of some interest rates, including the lack of deductibility of borrowing money to pay your income taxes; that causes the after tax interest rate to be decidedly higher than it had been before. It seems to me quite logical, then, that you'd get some differences in this kind of environment in personal household saving rates. And that, together with certain maybe overpublicized demographic factors, it seems to me leads us to a different kind of behavior--which of course is exactly what we've been wanting. So, I don't think we need to grieve too much about getting the exact same results that we were after. We wanted to slow money growth down because we didn't want to revive the liquidity that would be necessary in a sense to accommodate these inflation pressures that I think all of us knew would be forthcoming--given the import price side and the energy price and the other commodity price effects, some of which stemmed from last year's drought. So all in all, it seems to me it's very logical for consumer spending to be low and for it to stay low. Now, when you add to that what's happening to housing, there are enough communities in the United States where the housing market has changed so that the wealth effect of this change in housing must necessarily, it seems to me, show through in regard to spending patterns for consumers. So, I'm bold enough to have consumer spending growth rates only about half of those the staff is projecting. And yet I end up getting, I think to Mike's embarrassment, almost exactly the same real GNP numbers that Mike had. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0
198907	244	PRELL	 We welcome you.  	13	13	1.0	0.0	999.0
198907	245	ANGELL	 Oh, you welcome me! Well, [unintelligible] we're both probably wrong, but for different reasons. Nominal GNP, it seems to me, is not going to be able to be as expansionary as has been predicted. I just so believe that the monetary slowdown will show [unintelligible] on nominal GNP. So I tend to be optimistic in that regard; that's why I have [forecast] what I would call a rather nice expansion. But if I'm wrong on that and inflation runs about as Governor LaWare thinks it will, then I don't think there's any room, and I think there are considerably more downside risks. But I'm going to remain somewhat optimistic. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0
198907	246	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	247	KELLEY	 Mr. Chairman, we continually and, of course, properly discuss the risks and how they vary--from inflation kicking up as a result of too strong an economy versus making progress on inflation as a result of the slowdown. I find myself very much with Governor LaWare; he really made my speech and I certainly won't repeat it. But one word that I think was in his remarks bears some emphasis, and that's the fragility of this situation. However you assess the risks, it seems to me that the fragility on the down side is quite substantial and should be recognized as an element therein. Another thing that I think was in his remarks that I'd like to emphasize is the consequences of which way these risks fall. If we wind up with a somewhat stronger economy than we think, then inflation will probably carry along for a while and it's hard to say exactly how it will behave. But I don't hear anyone saying that there is any risk of inflation running away from us on the up side. On the other hand, I think the consequences of seeing a downside result could be very severe indeed, in terms of the larger social picture of the country and where we are and what we're trying to do in this country. And I think as we assess the risks, however you come out on where the risks are, it's useful to think in terms of the composition of those risks and the consequences of having the risks fall out in either of the two directions that they could go. So I think it's worthwhile to consider those two aspects: fragility, which seems to me to be wholly on the down side; and the consequences of the result that we might realize in either direction, which also seems to me to be far more severe on the down side, should it work out that way. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	48.0
198907	248	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	249	SEGER	 I've been sitting here thinking that I need a new hearing aid because I can't believe the change in the comments today versus the FOMC meeting in May or, for sure, the one in March. Either I needed the new one then and not now, or vice versa. Anyway, as you know, I've been somewhat concerned about the slowing economy for a fair while. So, it is nice to have some other people who are on board with the same concerns. Where I depart from the staff forecast is over the next six months or so, for a couple of reasons. One is that in the auto industry, I think for the first time in three or four months, we're going to find that the auto manufacturers actually have some latitude to adjust production. As they got into the late stages of this model year they were locked in because they had made commitments to suppliers to take X amount of materials and, therefore, they carried through with their production plans; but now they are reaching the end of that run and we're seeing announcements already of extended shutdowns from model changeovers. And this is sort of the  first round. Then Chrysler, for example, when it starts up the new models at one of its plants, instead of putting two shifts on is going to put one shift on. I think we're going to see a number of these things. Instead of just holding production constant and trying to ram the sales through the system through the use of these various incentives--which made the dealers very, very unhappy--I think we're going to see more and more production cuts. I realize that the auto industry is no longer as important a share of the United States economy as it used to be, but in terms of explaining cyclical wiggles I think it's still rather significant. Therefore, I think over the next two quarters what's going on there may be really rather significant. I got some numbers this morning that I'll just share with you because, on the one hand, they were interesting; on the other hand, they were rather scary to me. Chrysler sent some surveys to their dealerships and what they have discovered is that 60 percent of the people coming into their dealerships were not able to come up with even the downpayment to buy a car. That's sort of scraping the bottom of the barrel, as I see it. One reason, of course, is that used car prices have weakened; and [that hurts] those who, when they had trade- ins, could forget the downpayment. I find the [unintelligible] system working; the others don't necessarily have trade-in difficulty but they just don't have the cash on the barrel head. And this includes, by the way, the opportunities to use cash rebates for downpayments; even with that availability, 60 percent weren't able to get a downpayment together. Also, the number of people actually coming into their showrooms is down about 10 percent from a year ago. And what they call the closure rate is down. So, of the people coming in, the number who actually go through and make a purchase is way down--I don't know by what percentage. Also, 31 percent of their dealers are now losing money versus under 20 percent last year. Those that are still profitable, though, have seen their profits drop to less than half of what they were a year ago. Jerry, you mentioned that tight money hasn't had the impact you might expect; I think you can see it in autos. And it works through the dealers, as the dealers have had to pay 3, 3-1/4, or 3-1/2 percentage points more to inventory this tremendous pile of cars; that's real money to them because they are the ones, as John LaWare knows, who have to pay these financing costs. General Motors doesn't, or Ford doesn't. The dealers have seen these financing costs soar and that has increased their unhappiness with the situation; it has also increased the flow of gripes back to the auto manufacturers. By the way, auto sales picked up in April when these incentives went in but since then, even with the most generous incentives in place--to me these are the most generous incentives since they launched incentives back in '86--sales are viewed by people in the industry as disappointing in both May and in the sneak preview of the figures for June that they had received just before I talked to them. That's one thing that concerns me. The other sector where I'm a little more negative than the staff forecast is in housing; I believe the staff has housing starts hitting bottom this quarter and then starting to percolate up. I would like to think they would turn around that quickly but I'm not really that convinced that they will. Therefore, as I said, my concern is how we are going to make it through the next couple of quarters before we see some of the monetary changes work through, because I think the very slow monetary aggregate growth that we have had is having an impact and, unfortunately, that it is going to  continue to have an impact for a while. Thank you very much; I hope we're lucky. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
198907	250	GREENSPAN	 If there are no further items on this general tour de table, why don't we adjourn until 9:00 a.m. tomorrow morning? [Meeting recessed]  July 6, 1989--Morning Session 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198907	251	GREENSPAN	 We are now up to Mr. Kohn's presentation on the long-term ranges. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	252	KOHN	 As background for consideration of the ranges for money and  credit for 1989 and 1990, the bluebook on page 8 described the results  of three alternative policy strategies. Three areas might be considered  in thinking about these strategies and the choice of money and debt  growth ranges. The first involves the objectives for policy, in terms  of the speed with which price stability is sought; the second, the pattern of money growth most likely to be consistent with achieving those  objectives; and the third, the risks to achieving those objectives and  the choices that might be made if forces in the economy deviate from  expectations.  Strategy I, the baseline forecast, is the same extension of  the greenbook forecast used by Mike and Ted. It represents a monetary  policy designed to achieve a gradual reduction in inflation over time.  The alternative strategies take the basic economic structure and assumptions of the baseline and use model simulations to look at the consequences of alternative monetary policies. Strategy II, which embodies a  tighter monetary policy over the forecast horizon, as indexed by 1 percentage point less M2 growth than in the baseline, would make faster and  more noticeable progress against inflation. But such progress involves  essentially no growth in the economy next year. This result stems from  the judgment embodied in the baseline forecast that the economy is  starting from a position of greater resource utilization than is consistent with containing, much less reducing, inflation. If this judgment  is correct, appreciable progress against inflation within the next few  years requires a marked deceleration in economic growth in order to open  up a margin of slack in the economy fairly promptly, as indicated by the  sizable rise in the unemployment rate. Strategy III, which uses faster  money growth than the baseline, holds the unemployment rate at close to  current levels over the forecast horizon. Given the lags between output  and prices, this strategy results in only a small increase in inflation  through 1991; however, price increases would not only be faster than in  the other two strategies, they would be on an upward trajectory coming  out of 1991.  Under all the strategies M2 grows noticeably more rapidly over  1990 and 1991 than it has in recent years. Over the past few years, the  sizable increases in nominal interest rates required to head off inflation damped money demand and raised velocity. An underlying presumption  of the baseline forecast is that real interest rates already are at  levels that probably are high enough at least to keep inflation from  accelerating, given the outlook for other key factors acting on the  economy notably fiscal policy and the dollar. Consequently, while  interest rates move in different directions in 1989 and 1990 under the  various strategies, the size of the movements is quite moderate by the  standards of the past few years and so are the associated changes in  money velocities. By the end of the simulation period, nominal short-  term rates end up at about the same level under all the strategies   somewhat below their current level. In these circumstances, velocity  will tend to fall a little, so that for a while more rapid growth of  money will be needed to support moderate expansion of nominal income.  Note that velocity declines even under the tighter alternative II  strategy, as nominal interest rates move downward in response to slower  inflation.  Eventually, once we have reached and adjusted to price stability, M2 probably will need to expand much less rapidly around the rate  of potential output growth. But given the inflation already embedded in  the economy and interest rates, keeping money growth at the rate  expected for 1989 or reducing it toward the eventual objective in the  period ahead would likely involve substantial shortfalls in output. In  the transition period, the challenge will be to differentiate declining  interest rates and faster money growth associated with the restoration  of price stability from the even more rapid growth and larger declines  in interest rates that would signal an overly expansive policy.  Not only the pattern of monetary growth consistent with various  long-run strategies, but also the risks to the economy and prices might  be considered in choosing the long-run ranges. Mike and Ted have  already discussed two major areas of uncertainty the behavior of wages  and the dollar. Others include the underlying strength of demand, and  the relationship of money* income, and interest rates. The levels of  the monetary ranges, say relative to expected income growth, would be  one way of communicating to the public the Federal Reserve's view of the  risks in the outlook and something about how we might respond to deviations of results from expectations.  For 1989, the current ranges seem likely to encompass the money  growth consistent with most possible strategies and contingencies. The  staff forecast is that M2, M3, and debt will all grow within their current ranges under the interest rate and income projections of the Greenbook. Debt is now well within its range, and M3 at the lower end of its  range, but for M2, this requires a substantial pickup from the pace of  the first half of the year.  Expectations of such an acceleration rest on two factors.  First, is the behavior of interest rates. The slow growth of money  relative to income since mid-1988 is largely attributable to the rise in  interest rates through the first quarter of 1989. In the projection,  interest rates remain in the neighborhood of current levels over the  balance of the year. These rates and associated opportunity costs are  below those prevailing through most of the first half of the year.  However, some of this decline will offset the lagged effects of previous  increases, and on balance we expect opportunity cost and interest rate  factors to boost money demand relative to income modestly in the second  half of the year. Second, we do not anticipate any special factors that  would damp money demand relative to fundamental trends in the second  half. Indeed, the rebuilding of money balances that were drawn down to  pay taxes in April probably will still be boosting money growth rates a  little, just to restore holdings to desired levels. On net, velocity is  expected to decline somewhat in the second half of the year, with 6  percent M2 growth relative to 5 percent GNP growth. This would bring M2  growth for 1989 to 4 percent. With some of this acceleration showing  through to M3, it too should be well within its range by the fourth  quarter.  We believe the risks to this money projection are fairly evenly  balanced on either side. But because the expected outcome is in the  lower part of the range there is some possibility of M2 coming in below  the range. Whether the range should be lowered to allow for that  possibility depends on whether such a shortfall say to 2-1/2 percent  would be acceptable to the Committee. Growth below the 3 percent lower  end of the range would not be a concern if it reflected only a downward  shift in money demand for given interest rates and income, or if it  resulted from a deliberate tightening of the money supply, for example,  to combat a potential resurgence of inflation pressures. However, a  shortfall in money owing to a weaker economy would not be desirable. If  this were thought to be an important risk, then the Committee would not  want to accept M2 growth below 3 percent, or signal a willingness to do  so.  The choices for 1990 depend more directly on the speed with  which the Committee wishes to approach price stability and the associated trajectory of money. Since under any of the strategies somewhat  stronger money growth is projected to be necessary to support even  sluggish expansion in output next year, the issue raised is whether the  Committee should continue on its course of lowering money ranges each  year.  For 1990, the staff greenbook forecast is thought to be consistent with M2 growth of around 6-1/2 percent. As noted earlier, this  results from the fairly flat pattern of interest rates, and hence velocity, that is projected to accompany nominal GNP growth of around 6 percent next year. The pickup in M3 is expected to be much less to 6  percent, partly in light of downward pressures on thrift asset growth  from new capital requirements and RTC resolutions. Debt growth, on the  other hand, is projected to slow a little further to 7-1/2 percent,  after coming in below the midpoint of its range in 1989. In both years,  lower federal deficits are a key element accounting for more moderate  debt growth. I might note that growth in money and debt along these  lines is likely also to be consistent with your economic projections on  average, since the staff forecast for nominal GNP is approximately in  the middle of the range of projections by board members and presidents.  Three possible alternatives for the ranges for 1990 are  presented on p. 14 of the bluebook. To an extent, the alternatives were  shaped by the staff expectations that M2 growth in 1990 may be near the  upper end of the existing ranges for 1989. If the Committee wished to  pursue a more expansive policy in 1990 than assumed in the baseline, an  increase in the M2 range would seem necessary. Such an increase is  incorporated into alternative I. This alternative carried over the 1989  ranges for M3 and debt, since the ranges for those aggregates already  have ample scope for somewhat faster growth than in the staff projection. Alternative I might also be appropriate if there were thought to  be a risk of significantly weaker aggregate demand in 1990 than in the  staff forecast. In these circumstances, faster money growth would be  needed to get output growth along the lines of the staff forecast.  Thus, alternative I would seem most consistent with a concern about the  pace of economic expansion.  Alternative II retains the current M2 range, while lowering  those for M3 and debt by 1/2 point. Retaining the M2 range, rather than  reducing it further as in the past three years, could be justified on  the grounds that at this time the outlook for velocity in 1990 is  unclear. Assuming no change in velocity, FOMC expectations for income  growth already would place M2 in the upper half of its current range.  With money expected to run well up in the alternative II ranges, this  choice implies a limited tolerance of overshoots of money relative to  expectations. These ranges could be construed as accommodating a moderate  pace of nominal income growth next year, but also as signalling an  intention to lean against a tendency for inflation to strengthen  appreciably, and they would tend to constrain an aggressive move toward  an easier policy.  Alternative III lowers all the ranges, with money ranges being  reduced 1/2 percentage point and debt one full percentage point. This  alternative would seem consistent primarily with an intention to make  more immediate progress on inflation, as under strategy II. Such a  policy need not be associated with as weak output as in the simulation  exercise if underlying demands in the economy were strong or if the  staff's expectations on inflation were thought to be too pessimistic.  In the latter of these circumstances, the reduced ranges of this alternative could be seen as taking the bonus from, say, better wage  behavior more in prices than occurrs under the unchanged policy assumptions used by Mike in his simulations.  Finally, the Committee could opt to simply carry over the  existing ranges. This was not presented as an option in the bluebook,  perhaps because it wasn't sufficiently complicated and conducive to  conveying subtle policy overtones for the gnomes who draft that document . But it might be justified by the uncertainties in the outlook,  some elements of which are likely to be a little clearer next February.  In any case, it may be well to remember that one or another of the  provisional ranges established in July have been changed the following  February in 8 of the 10 years this exercise has been carried out. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	253	GREENSPAN	 Quick question, Don: Of the 8 to 10 revisions, is there any systematic directional change in those? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	254	KOHN	 I don't think so. Remember one year we lowered the bottom end of the M2 range; that was in 1988. Other years we have widened the range. I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman, I'm looking for-- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	255	GREENSPAN	 Actually, Norm has given me a table. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	256	KOHN	 It's the table I'm looking for but am having trouble finding. It's about half and half. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	257	GREENSPAN	 That's what I think. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	258	KOHN	 Yes. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	259	GREENSPAN	 So, there are no systematic indications. Other questions for Mr. Kohn? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	260	JOHNSON	 Don, I need a review; you may have mentioned it but go over it one more time. One of my concerns is that if we are beginning a period of declining interest rates, clearly, we're going to see behavior in velocity symmetric to the increase we've had over the period of rising interest rates; we're going to see a declining velocity growth. Would you review again, just as a rule of thumb, what the lags are on, say, a 100 basis point decline in interest rates? What would that do to M2 growth or to the M2 money demand I guess is the way to put it? What kind of lags are there before they catch up? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	44.0
198907	261	KOHN	 Well, the lags can last four or five quarters before the full effect is felt if you just have a one-time decrease. I'd say about 100 basis points at the current level of rates probably would give you, say, about 1 percentage point or something like that over four quarters. Dave? I'm sorry, it would be more like 2 percentage points in the growth rate over a couple of quarters. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	262	JOHNSON	 So 100 basis points would yield 2 percentage points in growth over a couple of quarters? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	44.0
198907	263	KOHN	 Yes. In other words, if you did it this quarter, in two quarters you'd have a maximum of about 2 percentage points more growth; and then it tapers off after that. The whole effect-- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	264	GREENSPAN	 What we really want to know is the change in the level at the end of the cone. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	265	KOHN	 Right. I would say that's probably about 1-3/4 percentage points in four quarters, judging from this table.  	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	266	JOHNSON	 One of my concerns is that, given the lags, if we started a sustained period of declines in interest rates--even if we were shooting for 5-1/2 percent or so nominal growth next year--we might end up having to absorb 2 full percentage points or more of extra M2 growth because of the effects on velocity just to hit that nominal target. If that's what you think-- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	44.0
198907	267	KOHN	 If you think the economy is going to be weaker-- that its underlying demands are weaker or that inflation will be coming down faster and therefore interest rates will be lower--then I do think that. We have a 6-1/2 percent growth projected for relatively flat interest rates. There's no question in my mind that if you thought rates would be declining significantly and you wanted to get approximately the same nominal income growth, for the same rates then you'd be threatening the upper end of the 3 to 7 percent range. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	268	GREENSPAN	 Which suggests that we may be 9 out of 11 [next February]. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	269	JOHNSON	 That's what I was saying. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	44.0
198907	270	GREENSPAN	 Further questions for Mr. Kohn? If not, I'd like first to discuss whether this Committee desires merely to reaffirm the 1989 ranges and then go on to discuss the 1990 ranges. I would appreciate it if someone would like to initiate a point of view on the 1989 ranges. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	271	JOHNSON	 I'm in favor of extending the existing ranges. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198907	272	GREENSPAN	 Let me put it to you-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	273	ANGELL	 Yes, I would not want to change the '89 ranges. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
198907	274	GREENSPAN	 Let me reverse the question. Is there anyone on the Committee who feels it might be desirable to change the *89 cone? If not, I would entertain a motion to reaffirm it. Do we have one? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	275	JOHNSON	 So move. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198907	276	ANGELL	 Second. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
198907	277	CORRIGAN	 Second. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198907	278	GREENSPAN	 Without objection. Let's now move to the more important issue of views on the tentative ranges for 1990, emphasizing the tentative aspects of this and recognizing that our history is not one in which we have been committed irrevocably to whatever it is that we choose at this meeting. President Black. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	279	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, I think you have taken away the easy part of the problem. The 1990 ranges are really where I suspect we will have most of our differences here. And I think that's the more important part of [our decision]. A lot of this depends on how one views the ranges; there are different ways that one can look at this. To me, the most important thing is that the ranges are our signal to the public, and I hope a reasonable signal, of what we plan  to do over the next four to six quarters to achieve the long-run objectives of monetary policy. Accordingly, I think it's very important that the ranges we select for 1990 make it crystal clear to the public that this current apparent softening in final demand is not going to divert us from our objective of trying to restore price stability over the long run. We have made a lot of progress on this and I think we've had excellent monetary policy for a long time now. But we still have the underlying inflation rate at around 5 percent, so we still have some distance to go on that. All of us, obviously, would like to achieve price stability with a minimum of disruption in the economy. But I think price stability really has to be our primary--and I would say our single overriding--long-term goal. I think the greater the public's confidence in our commitment to that end, the less the short-term disruptions are going to be. So, in my mind, it's highly desirable that we reduce the range for M2 further in 1990 to maintain the credibility that we've won over such a long period of time. So, I strongly prefer alternative III. What that means to me, really, is that we want the underlying rate of growth of M2 to come in somewhere around the 4-1/2 percent midpoint of the 2-1/2 percent to 6-1/2 percent range, which would be consistent with what I think we've been trying to do for a long time. Now, I recognize that the staff's baseline forecast for M2 for 1990 is 6-1/2 percent. That means, of course, that a 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent range doesn't give us a lot of leeway for error on the up side. But frankly, I wouldn't be unduly concerned if interest rate movements or some other temporary factor did cause us to come in above that, as long as we were reasonably confident that that was temporary and it was something that we could explain to the public. If you'd permit me to add one final point, Mr. Chairman: Every time we go through this exercise, I become more and more convinced that we really need to change our targeting procedures to look at this on a multi-year basis. Several of us have made this point in the past; and I'd like to suggest again that we take a look at that because, given base drift, this seems to me a pretty inefficient way to target on the long-run objectives on which I think we all agree. I would like to see us, if we can agree on that, make some kind of move in that general direction. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	7.0
198907	280	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	281	ANGELL	 I'm very sympathetic to Bob Black's perspective for the long run. It seems to me that we do want to get those ranges for M2 down to 1 to 5 percent. A 1 to 5 percent range is where we have to be in order to be even close to credibility in regard to price level stability. If we mean that, it just seems to me that's where it has to be. I do believe, however, that we ought not to back up. That is, I want to see us only lower ranges and never raise them. And, with Don's report, I believe that it would be prudent for us for 1990 to keep the 3 to 7 percent range. It seems to me that we will once again have a period in which the expectation will be for rising interest rates, and that's when we ought to go down another leg to 2 to 6 percent. So, Mr. Chairman, I prefer the long-run strategy II, which is very conservative. But I prefer alternative II for 1990, because I'm not willing to go down and then exceed it on the top side. If there's one thing that I feel very strongly about after 3-1/2 years here, it is that whenever we have erred on the extremes on M2 growth,  with 9 percent M2 growth and 2 percent M2 growth--even though we may say M2 growth, V2 doesn't give us precision--we have been buying a little lack of stability. So, my preference is alternative II with a commitment to getting to 1 to 5 percent before my term is over. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
198907	282	BLACK	 I can't really quarrel with that. I was just hoping, as I was telling Don before the meeting, that he could come up with as good reasons why we ran over the target as he did in his recent memorandum--which I thought was excellent work-- explaining why we ran so low. If he could, then I could be pretty well satisfied with that. He certainly eliminated some of my worries about this unduly slow rate of growth we've had in M2 recently. It has been about 3 percent adjusted. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	7.0
198907	283	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	284	PARRY	 Mr. Chairman, our analysis suggests that M2 and M3 are likely to grow in 1990 at a slightly less rapid rate--5-1/2 to 6 percent--than the Bluebook [forecast]. But even that slower growth would be consistent with not changing the ranges, at least on technical grounds. I do think, though, that it is important that we reduce the ranges because I think it does send a message to the public regarding our resolve gradually to lower the rate of inflation over time. I think the strategy II that was outlined is the one that we ought to be pursuing over the longer term. Therefore, I would support the suggestion of President Black to pursue Bluebook alternative III, which I think would still be at least within the range of what I would expect the growth of the two aggregates to be next year. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	45.0
198907	285	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	286	KEEHN	" Mr. Chairman, given our experience with the aggregates this year, I think it's very difficult to forecast the outcome for the balance of the year, much less for 1990. I think the memo that Don sent out analyzing what has happened so far really was an excellent way of looking at what has happened. But that certainly is after the fact, and it doesn't give me, at least, any real assurance as to how these aggregates are going to perform in the future. But in the interim, it does seem to me that the signal effect of the ranges that we select really is very, very significant. There is an interesting quote in the Bluebook on page 17 which says ""But only alternative III involves a further reduction in all the current money ranges and might seem most in accord with reinforcing the Committee's longer-term commitment to price stability."" I think that is a very significant statement. To say anything else, really, in terms of the choice of the range would be a mistake. Therefore, I would be very strongly in favor of alternative III for 1990. If in fact things work out this year along the lines that Don is suggesting, we do have--as apparently has been the case in the past--the opportunity to change the ranges in February. Clearly, if a change were appropriate at that time, then we would do it. But I think in the interim it would be important to signal our continual commitment to price stability. And I think alternative III accomplishes that. "	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	35.0
198907	287	GREENSPAN	 President Syron. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	288	SYRON	 Mr. Chairman, I think that policy has been a mixture of luck and skill and has been remarkably effective. And I  think the challenge before us is to continue that process. The comments that have been made on signals are highly appropriate in terms of the point that it's certainly necessary that we lower some of the ranges. But I find that I'm somewhat sympathetic to what Governor Angell said, particularly given that we think it is likely, were we to adopt alternative III, that we subsequently would have to raise the range for M2. With that [being] our suspicion-- and it is mine--I would prefer alternative II. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	51.0
198907	289	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	290	FORRESTAL	 Mr. Chairman, I would identify myself with those who think that the announcement effects of these ranges are highly important. At the same time, as a technical matter, I think we need to make these ranges as realistic as possible; and given the staff forecast for growth of M2 and M3, I would favor alternative II. I think there are two signal effects that we need to give out now because of the uncertainty of the economic climate. Clearly, we need to send a signal that we are not letting up on our fight for price stability. But on the other hand, given what not only the staff forecast but other forecasts are showing for the economy, I think we also need to send the signal that we are not altogether tolerant of recession. And I think alternative II gives you the best of both possible worlds in that regard. So, I think we'd be better off at this time tentatively adopting alternative II. Then, if the economy turns out to be stronger, we can move to alternative III for M2 in February. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	39.0
198907	291	CORRIGAN	 [Since the Chairman is out of the room], you're about to witness the first official act of the Vice Chairman of the FOMC in 25 years.

I was about to call on Mr. Stern. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0

198907	298	STERN	 Thank you, Mr. Vice Chairman. I'm sensitive, as I think everyone is, to the emphasis on the long-run objective of price stability. But from my perspective, I think this is the time to acknowledge our uncertainty about 1990. I think it's possible to oversell this signal effect with regard to the ranges. It's more important, in my mind anyway, where we actually come out rather than what our announcement is as to the particular ranges at this point in time. Where my uncertainty about the outlook and the associated growth in the aggregates for 1990 lead me would be simply to adopt the  1989 ranges for 1990. I find it a little awkward to lower, say, the M3 and debt ranges and maintain M2, as under alternative II, for example. It seems to me that that suggests we know more than we do-- that we're in a position where we can lower some ranges and not others. And I find it difficult to go down that path. It just seems to me that at this point in time we don't lose much by simply reestablishing the 1989 ranges for 1990 recognizing, as already has been pointed out, that we're going to get another look, or two looks, at that later this year and in February. I happen to believe that we're certainly going to learn a lot over the next six months about prospects for 1990, and I'd want to use that information. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	41.0
198907	299	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	300	BOEHNE	 Well, I don't think this is the time for a real extended philosophical discussion. But simply to say that our objective is price stability greatly oversimplifies what a central bank is all about. It seems to me that what the central bank is all about is sustainable prosperity. Over the longer pull, probably the most important contribution that we can make to that is price stability. But that to me is a means to an end, not an end in itself. So, in terms of sending out signals, I think that our signal ought to be one that says we are trying to have a sustainable prosperity. To go down willy-nilly in a mechanical way just for the sake of sending out a signal that we're committed to long-run price stability covers over a lot of the uncertainty that we see. If I were in your position, Mr. Chairman, in trying to sell some aggregate measurements I think I would want to stress the uncertainty--that we are committed to bringing inflation down but we also don't want to have a recession; we're committed to a soft landing. And in that kind of environment, it seems to me that tentatively adopting the 1989 ranges for 1990 would make sense. From a technical point of view, I would think that as we go through 1990 we're going to be in the alternative I to alternative II range. I don't see that alternative III is terribly realistic. By simply adopting the 1989 ranges at this point we tend to straddle alternative I and alternative II; and we can then make what modifications we want in February to make them more realistic to the economy at that point.

198907	302	GUFFEY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would join those who agree that the announcement effect is important. But because of the uncertainty about where we're going to end up in 1989, adopting the 1989 ranges for 1990 with the opportunity to look at them again in February makes sense to me. That is not exactly alternative II in the sense that alternative II does drop the ranges of both M2 and debt. That doesn't make much sense to me. I would just adopt the current ranges. I do have some sympathy, however, with the proposal of Bob Black that we move to a multi-year targeting procedure to avoid this base-drift problem that likely will occur at the end of this year and into next year.

198907	304	MELZER	 I think Gary and I were reading off the same sheet of notes. In a long-term sense, I'm in sympathy with alternative III. Eventually, we've got to get those ranges down. But  I don't think this is a time right now when we need that announcement effect. In other words, I don't think our credibility in terms of commitment to price stability is in question now. And, as some people have pointed out, there's a risk: If we take [the ranges] down now and go back up we have actually adversely affected our credibility. Secondly, we have some evidence to indicate that it would be hard to hit them; we may be right at the upper end. And I agree with what Gary said: that's where we really hurt ourselves. If we set the range and then don't meet it, I think that could have an adverse effect. In any case, I come out waffling between alternatives II and III, basically. And I think probably the best answer is to acknowledge that uncertainty just by adopting the '89 ranges and refining them in February. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	42.0
198907	305	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	306	KELLEY	 Mr. Chairman, I find myself very much down the same track as the last several speakers. There is a high degree of uncertainty here that I think we need to recognize. I certainly appreciate Ed Boehne's point that long-run price stability is a means toward the larger end of sustainable prosperity. In terms of signal effect, I think there are other signals that are important to send to the market and to the economy and the most important may be stability of performance on the part of the Fed. Moderation and balance would be some of the hallmarks of achieving that stability signal. As a consequence of all of those things, I would urge that we maintain the current ranges. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	48.0
198907	307	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	308	SEGER	 I would support sticking with the current ranges and carrying them over into next year. I would use the arguments I used last year at this time: that there are uncertainties and that there is no great [harm] in carrying these over because we do have another crack at them. As I think Mike Kelley said, it's better to present the appearance of stability rather than zigging and zagging. However, if we are going to change them, the direction I would go in, frankly, is toward alternative I--for a couple of reasons. One is that I hope we do get some additional M2 growth as interest rates come down. Secondly, talking about base-drift, I went back and looked at this table: in 1987 M2's actual growth was 4.1 percent, which was outside the low end of the range; that was followed by growth last year of 5.2 percent, which was within the range but below the midpoint; and so far this year M2 is growing below a 2 percent annual rate. So, if we look at this over a longer period, it seems to me that there is some point at which maybe we ought to say we should be making up a little of this growth that we haven't achieved in the past and that we did think at the time was a reasonable objective. So, I could go with either carrying the existing ranges forward or alternative I. Thank you. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	40.0
198907	309	GREENSPAN	 Governor LaWare. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0

198907	311	GREENSPAN	 President Boykin.  	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	312	BOYKIN	 Mr. Chairman, I would go with alternative III because if we don't do that I think there could almost be an implied reading that we're willing to accept inflation in the 4 to 5 percent range. And I'm not sure that we want to leave that implication. I think we all are having a bit of a sense of foreboding regarding what the economy is actually going to do. But it's still a little anticipatory. I think to reverse what we have set in place over time is probably going to be read as a little more significant than some of the others think. If it becomes necessary early next year to make an adjustment and to move the ranges up, it seems to me that that would be done on the basis of knowledge in fact existing at that time, as opposed to tone and feel and a suspicion at this point. And I could justify an upward move if circumstances, in fact, were there to dictate that. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	34.0
198907	313	GREENSPAN	 Governor Johnson. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	314	JOHNSON	 I agree with a lot of the other comments. I favor extending the current [M2] range of 3 to 7 percent for 1990. I find that acceptable, although I do think there is some risk that we may test the upper end of that. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198907	315	GREENSPAN	 That is extending the '89 ranges for all three? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	316	JOHNSON	 Yes. I'm just saying alternative II; I can't remember now what the other two were. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198907	317	ANGELL	 Alternative II lowers M3 and debt. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
198907	318	JOHNSON	 Alternative II is what I favor; I can live with that. I agree with Gary that I don't see exactly how we make this twist on M3 and debt but I've never paid any attention to those anyway. I can accept alternative II. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198907	319	GREENSPAN	 But you would take unchanged because you don't care. Is that correct? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	320	JOHNSON	 That's right; I would take that too. I do agree that in the long run the ranges should come down. I think Governor Angell is right that 1 to 5 percent probably makes sense in the longer run. If you're going to have nominal GNP that's consistent with something like price stability, and if the long-run trend on M2 velocity is around 0, then you want an M2 range that has a nominal GNP associated with price stability and you've got to be in that area somewhere. But I think we're a ways from that. And I think, as Ed Boehne said, one of our major functions is to avoid destabilizing the economy in the process of seeking this goal of price stability. So, for those reasons, the 3 to 7 percent range for '90 makes some sense, even though I think we could find ourselves well above that target if we go through a sustained period of declining interest rates. But I think it's a reasonable target and worth trying to hit. I can't help making one last comment, though, on this whole exercise about monetary aggregates. The way in which we conduct monetary policy, these monetary aggregates are simply passive proxies for what the economy generates through money demand. This is not a money supply process. We are setting interest rates and the economy  is reacting to those interest rates and it's demanding money; and that's the way it works. We are not setting any money supply goal and supplying that amount of reserves to make sure [we achieve it]. I'm not saying I disagree with that; I'm simply saying that that's the way it works. And we shouldn't kid ourselves and think that we're supplying levels that are being generated through our policy. I couldn't help that last comment. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0

198907	323	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	324	HOSKINS	 Listening to the discussion, I hear a lot of words about long-term price stability objectives. I could have heard the same thing last year when I sat here. The inflation rate is still up there; it's probably higher than it was last year at this time. If you look at the Board staff's strategies for 1988 through 1991 there's very little difference in the inflation rate. The average is a range of 4.1 to 4.6 percent whether we are tight, easy, or stay the same in terms of the baseline. If you take the Board staff's baseline forecast and try to run it forward to see when we get to price stability, it takes at least a decade to do that under their baseline forecast. Now, if that's the case and that's really what we're looking at, then I think we shouldn't kid ourselves that we're after price stability because we're not. If we follow that path we're after controlling inflation at the current rate. If we're comfortable with that then I think we ought to say that. If we're not then I think we ought to do something more aggressive in terms of moving toward price stability, and that includes [going to] multi-year targeting so that we don't have base drift problems. Otherwise, next year we will be at the same point with a different set of concerns about the short term and pushing off the long term. So, unless we tie our hands somewhat-- like a portfolio manager at a bank might by requiring insurance against stock losses to be put in place--we're going to continue to drift with the economy and with the vagaries of international developments. So it seems to me that, at the minimum, we ought to go to alternative III, 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent, if the signal is important. The idea that we might have to raise it--really, when you take a look at the half point differential, it's relatively small. It's not likely that the difference between 3 to 7 percent or 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent is really going to cause much trouble. But if we put any value on signaling, then we ought to go for 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent, because we're likely to miss that 1/2 point mark anyway and it's not a big problem for us. I think this is a very important session for us every year because it's our only chance to look ahead 18 months. And that's what it's all about. That's the range in which policy is going to impact the inflation rate and the economy. If we've been too tight in the past and we've made a mistake and the economy is already heading down--well, that's history. Rushing into the breach now with lower interest rates is only going to produce more inflation down the road for us. So, I think we ought to tie our hands a little with respect to long-term targets and we ought to have tighter targeting. I'm in favor of alternative III.  	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	49.0
198907	325	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	326	CORRIGAN	 Where I come out is very close to where Gary Stern was--and for the reasons he gave, which are as good as any. That would be the '89 ranges for '90. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198907	327	GREENSPAN	 For all three? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	328	CORRIGAN	 Yes. Having said that, let me just add a comment or two. I have to say that I have become increasingly skeptical, bordering on cynical, about the usefulness or reliability of these money supply measures as targets or indicators of monetary policy, notwithstanding the wonders of P*. In this specific and immediate context I'm not nearly as concerned as I think some are about the slow growth of M whatever over the recent past or, indeed, over several years. I don't want to get into a big discussion of that but I would simply say that one of the reasons I'm not as concerned is that when I look at the very broad measures of credit availability-- credit growth, debt growth, and L growth--all of those things are behaving in quite a satisfactory way. In my mind, at least, all this financial innovation does play a significant role in accounting for the abnormal gap between M growth, however measured, and these broader measures of debt or credit or overall liquid assets, including nonbank liquid assets. So I'm just not quite as concerned. Also, let me make a brief point in the context of Mr. Boehne's comment about a means to an end. I ask myself the question in the context of current policy: Is it possible, first, that the rise in the inflation rate has stabilized--that it's not going up anymore? There's a reasonable chance that that's true, but I don't think it's baked in the cake. But even if you assume it is baked in the cake, then the next question I have to ask myself, which is very relevant to this 18-month period, is: What would it take to buy back the acceleration in the inflation rate that we have had over the past 18 months? Forget about long-term price stability for the moment; just ask yourself what it would take to get back to where we were. Is there any plausible set of reasons to believe that we could recapture what we've lost without a fair amount of slack having to develop in the economy? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198907	329	GREENSPAN	 You're saying excluding the oil price effect? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	330	CORRIGAN	 That's right. Maybe there are some things working in that direction; certainly, international competition is one. But history seems fairly compelling on this point: it's awfully hard to see how you can get a deceleration of the inflation rate, even by a percentage point or so, without some slack in the economy. And I think that is another aspect of this goal of price stability. It's nice to talk about it, but I am very skeptical that we can even achieve that intermediate goal of buying back what we've already lost without having to incur some real costs, much less get back to genuine price stability of 1950's vintage or something like that. So, I think Mr. Boehne*s point is right on the mark, and we have to be realistic about what is feasible and what is not. Anyway, I can certainly live with the '89 [ranges] for '90.  	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198907	331	GREENSPAN	 A lot of issues have been raised here, and I think it's very clear that without exception they are all focusing on some way to eventually bring the inflation rate down significantly below where it is. I think the differences within the Committee are basically tactical rather than strategic. I must admit that I come out in an area which is either alternative II or '89 repeated, largely because--leaving aside the inflationary questions-- the credibility on money supply growth is something I don't think we have a problem with. I think President Melzer [stated] it quite correctly; the ability of this institution to hold money supply at the very nominal growth rates of the last two years I think has put us in a position different from the Bundesbank, for example, which has been having a terrible problem of going off the other end. But however one looks at this, at some point we're going to have to confront the issue of inflation stability or price stability; either the markets are going to do it to us or we're going to have to come to grips with that. I don't think we have to in the immediate period; but we may find, when we're reviewing the '90 targets again in February, that that issue is going to be right in front of us and we're not going to be able to duck it terribly much. Well, as I count up the various views, the critical mass is basically to stay with the '89 ranges temporarily as tentative numbers. I don't know whether or not those who are in favor of alternative II feel comfortable with that or not, but it's sort of half-way there. Because of the comments that I heard, I think it would be [appropriate] for somebody to move the continuation of the 1989 ranges for all three variables--the two Ms and debt--for 1990.

198907	336	GREENSPAN	 Okay. That brings us to the next order of business, which is our standard short-run discussion. Mr. Kohn. 	21	21	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	337	KOHN	 The movements of short-term interest rates over the intermeeting period reflected not only the easing of policy in early June, but  also expectations of further System actions. Following the declines  yesterday, the structure of market rates, along with the commentary  of market participants, now suggest that an additional 1/4 of a percentage  point drop in the funds rate is anticipated shortly after this meeting,  with another decline of 1/4 point or more within the next few months.  From one perspective, the choice facing the Committee can be framed in  terms of whether, or to what extent, those expectations should be  validated.  Given these expectations, holding the funds rate steady would  be expected to result in some increase in short-term interest rates, as  discussed under alternative B in the bluebook. The extent of any  increase, and its transmission to the long end of the yield curve, would  depend importantly on whether incoming information on the economy,  prices and the dollar continued to support the view that aggregate  demand was weak and that policy would be easier before long. To be  sure, if the market became convinced we were not about to ease under any  foreseeable circumstances, short-term rates would backup substantially,  though the effect on long-term rates is unclear. More likely, unless  developments suggest a stronger economy or prices than in the staff  forecast, only a small backup in rates would occur leaving short- and  long-term rates well below levels of a month or two ago.  The rationale for taking something like the initial step  expected by the markets would be a reading of recent data that was  roughly in accord with the market's interpretation that is, at higher  nominal and real interest rates there would be a significant risk of a  weaker economy than needed to achieve the desired progress against  inflation. Such a judgment has been echoed in commodity markets, where  prices on average have lagged the general rate of inflation for a while,  tending to reinforce the notion of sluggish industrial activity and  effectively restrictive real interest rates. Moreover, although reasons  for the dollar's firmness on balance this year may not be fully understood, absent a more complete reversal, the higher dollar will tend to  restrain prices and demand in the United States.  However, market expectations embedded in the downward slope of  the yield curve need to be read with caution. At the very short end,  as noted, they reflect market anticipation of Federal Reserve actions  based on a reading of your objectives. One question is whether such a  reading includes a sustained decrease in inflation. There is little  evidence in recent surveys of consumers or financial market participants  of a significant decrease in inflation expectations in June below the  area of earlier this year. It may be that the drop in rates built into  the yield curve is consistent with the market's view of a policy that  contains, but does not necessarily reduce, inflation rates over time.  Certainly, the behavior of the stock market, even taking account of last  week's correction, does not seem to suggest expectations of as prolonged  a weakness in the economy and profits that, in the staff forecast or  simulations, would be a necessary byproduct of restraining the economy  sufficiently to bring inflation down.  If long-term inflation expectations have not changed much, most  of the decline in long-term interest rates would represent a drop in  real rates. To the extent such a decrease were needed to cushion the  effects of weaker aggregate demand, leaning against it with an unchanged  monetary policy could result in a shortfall in spending. To be sure,  the effects of a stronger dollar, smaller budget deficit, and weaker  spending propensities all argue for lower equilibrium real rates than in  early spring. But asset markets do over-react, and in the recent  period, interpretation of financial price movements is complicated by  complex interactions with the dollar. If some of the demands for dollar  assets represented a shift of desired international portfolios unrelated  to the anticipated performance of the United States economy, say political turmoil abroad or a speculative bubble, then bond yields may have fallen  below levels consistent, over time, with satisfactory economic performance. And the strength of the dollar undoubtedly has held down commodity prices. The interdependencies of the prices of these various  assets and difficulty in predicting how they would react to an easing of  policy was illustrated yesterday. The decline in short-term rates then  was said to reflect more firmly entrenched expectations of an easing of  policy, which contributed to a sharp drop in the dollar and associated  rise in commodity prices, as expected, but also a slight backup in bond  yields.  The behavior of the monetary aggregates does not lend clear  guidance to today's policy choice. M2 remains well below its target  cone, but it appears to be in an upward trajectory. Even under the  slight uptick in market rates under alternative B, M2 is expected to be  within its cone by September. The interest rates of this alternative  would still be well below those of the previous two quarters, and households are projected to continue to rebuild balances depleted by outsized  tax payments in April. However, an early easing of policy, as under  alternative A, could be seen as providing some greater assurance of  acceptable monetary growth for the year.  Whatever alternative is selected, the Committee might want to  consider whether to continue to give a little extra emphasis to money  growth in keying intermeeting adjustments to reserve pressures. If  there were concern about excessive weakness in the economy, a shortfall  in money growth would be inappropriate absent special circumstances. In  the last few years, the Committee has steered a course in which a stabilizing policy was suggested by strong money growth when the economy  seemed weak, and slow money growth when inflation was a threat. The  situation to be avoided would be one in which a very weak economy was  accompanied by weak money growth.  The Committee's intentions will be signalled by its instructions for intermeeting adjustments as well as its decision about the  immediate stance in reserve markets. Asymmetry toward ease would be  appropriate if the Committee felt the risks were heavily toward weaker  activity than was consistent with its longer-run objectives. In this  circumstance, more weight ought to be placed on incoming data indicating  a spending shortfall and policy responses to such data ought to be  prompt. Especially if coupled with an immediate easing in policy, such  a directive would suggest that the Committee viewed the developing situation as likely to call for a series of easing moves. A symmetric directive would suggest a more cautious response to incoming data, and less  of a prejudgment about future policy steps.  With regard to implementing policy, in framing the borrowing  objectives in the bluebook associated with each alternative we attempted  to take account of the continued strength in seasonal borrowing. We had  expected further increases in seasonal borrowing over the last intermeeting period, but the recent rise has been greater than anticipated.  At the same time, adjustment borrowing has been minimal, partly, reflecting the large volume of reserves supplied by the seasonal borrowers. But adjustment borrowing still is surprisingly low given the  federal funds-discount rate spread. The staff made adjustments in the  bluebook borrowing assumptions to take account of the developments at  the discount window. First is an upward adjustment to alternative B to  $650 million; this allows for some additional increase in seasonal borrowing, which has been running around $500 million recently. The second  adjustment is to the borrowing levels associated with a drop in the  federal funds rate under alternative A. Because adjustment borrowing is  close to frictional levels, we presumed that any decrease in borrowing  associated with an easing of reserve pressures would be concentrated in  the seasonal component. Seasonal borrowing responds to the spread  between market and discount rates, but by less than adjustment borrowing. Under these circumstances, a smaller drop in total seasonal plus  adjustment borrowing is likely to be associated with a given drop in the  funds rate; we estimated it at half the usual size, or $100 million from  the upward adjusted alternative B path for a 50 basis point decline in  the funds rate. 	21	21	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	338	GREENSPAN	 Questions for Mr. Kohn? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	339	BOEHNE	 You made the point that the markets have built into current rates a quarter point drop in the funds rate rather promptly. A quarter point from what base? Where do you--  	22	22	2.0	1.0	33.0
198907	340	KOHN	 I think about 9-1/2 percent. We've said 9-1/2 to 9-5/8 percent, but it's averaged closer to 9-1/2 percent and I think that's about where the markets think it is. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	341	GREENSPAN	 Other questions? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	342	HOSKINS	 Let me just follow up on the one Manley asked earlier. If you were to lower rates 50 basis points, you would expect M2 by the fourth quarter, or by December, to be growing at 8 percent? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	49.0
198907	343	KOHN	 That's correct. You can see that in alternative A in the Bluebook. We have 8 percent, actually, from June to September. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	344	PARRY	 June to September? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	45.0
198907	345	KOHN	 June to September. And that would encompass a strengthening pattern of M2 growth over that period. Consequently, by the time we got to the fourth quarter I think it would be in the 8 percent range or [even] higher. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	346	ANGELL	 The fourth quarter to December would be what? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198907	347	KOHN	 Quarter IV to December under alternative A? I don't know. Quarter IV to September is 3.7 percent, so my guess-- 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	348	ANGELL	 Well, it'd probably be about 4-1/2 percent on alternative A to December. Is that about right? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198907	349	KOHN	 Right, something like that. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	350	PARRY	 No, it's 3-3/4. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	45.0
198907	351	KOHN	 That's to September; but then to December-- 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	352	ANGELL	 If you maintain that you're going to get more kick. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198907	353	KOHN	 Yes. My guess is that it may be closer to 5 percent--closer to the midpoint of the range. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	354	MELZER	 Don, in the Bluebook and in some comments yesterday and today there has been a fair amount of discussion about what the market has built in, in terms of expectations. I don't view this as particularly unusual--that at the time policy is perceived to be on the move for the market to get ahead of itself--or particularly damaging if the expectations are not ratified. Would that be consistent with your view of the past? This isn't particularly unusual is it? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	42.0
198907	355	KOHN	 Well, it certainly is not unusual for them to be speculating about a change in monetary policy about the time you folks are sitting in this room meeting. My sense is that the intensity of the speculation and the immediacy and size of the expected rate movement is a little larger than normal. We have had some pretty strong upward sloping yield curves and expectations; one can think back only six months or less about some pretty immediate movements on the other side. I don't have a measure of how intense this is but I  have the sense that the expectations are quite firmly held. It's not totally unusual. And they can go both ways with this. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	356	MELZER	 Well, I'd be cautious about the extent to which we let that influence what we do; that's mainly what I'm saying. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	42.0
198907	357	KOHN	 I think that's right. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	358	GREENSPAN	 Any other? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	359	JOHNSON	 I'll just follow up on that. I agree-- 	22	22	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	360	GREENSPAN	 No, these are questions, not-- 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	361	JOHNSON	 Well, this is a reaction to that. I think it's true that the market is discounting a fairly immediate 25 basis point move. But if you go a little further out--and I agree with what you're saying, Tom--the market is discounting more than a point in the bill market. And I don't-- 	22	22	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	362	KOHN	 Well, it's 3/4 of a point, I think. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	363	GREENSPAN	 It's not more; probably a mechanical estimate of what the bill rate today is implying is 8.8 percent on the funds rate. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	364	JOHNSON	 There is normally about a 3/4 point spread, if you just take the average between the Treasury bill rate and the fed funds rate; and the Treasury bill rate now is about 7.75 percent. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	365	KOHN	 And I think that [translates to] about 8-3/4 percent; the mechanical translation varies with the level of rates. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	366	JOHNSON	 What is the rate? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	367	SPEAKER	 8.8 percent. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	368	GREENSPAN	 8.8 percent. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	369	JOHNSON	 Okay, I'm sorry. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	370	KOHN	 It varies with the level of rates, Governor Johnson, because you have to make some estimate for a marginal state tax rate--since bills are exempt from state taxes--as well as the coupon equivalent kind of [adjustment]. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	371	JOHNSON	 Sure. What I'm saying-- 	22	22	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	372	KOHN	 And the mechanical translation of 7-3/4 percent [on the bill rate] is about 8-3/4 percent [on the funds rate]. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	373	JOHNSON	 Yes, I think that's about right. I'm saying that's what the bill market has built in. Now, it clearly looks like an overshoot to me of where we want to be; but I'm simply saying that's where the market is. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	374	KOHN	 One sense of where this yield curve is you can see on Chart I of the financial indicators that I have; it's really a  minus, as of Friday of last week. But you can see that we have had some upward slopes in yield curves, at least measured this way, that are larger than the downward-- 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	375	GREENSPAN	 Any further questions for Mr. Kohn? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	376	STERN	 Don, are there any reasons why you may be more or less confident about the path of M2 over the next 6 months than usual? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	41.0
198907	377	KOHN	 Well, I'm never very confident; but I must say that the response of M2 in June and over the last couple months was roughly about what we expected. Particularly if I take out the demand deposit component, which has had its own special influences with the compensating balances and whatnot, M2 is running stronger than we projected at the last meeting, and that's consistent with a slightly lower interest rate and a bounceback. The June performance reassures me somewhat that we are on an upward trajectory here and are more likely to come back within that range. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	378	ANGELL	 But, Don, there is a possibility that the sucking down of those balances was abnormal in April and May and that there was some bounceback effect. So, it seems to me that there's some uncertainty as to whether or not that 6-1/2 percent [growth] will be maintained. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198907	379	KOHN	 I agree, certainly. And we have built in a very modest [response]--I think about 1/2 percentage point--just arbitrarily assuming that it would get back in over 6 months into our forecast. On the other hand, as we go forward, even if rates were to stay at this level or something like it, we do have a little more of the influence of the recent decline in market rates coming in. So, we'd expect those two factors together to have a slight downward impact on velocity. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	380	GREENSPAN	 Any questions? Governor Seger. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	381	SEGER	 Since some people outside follow the reserve aggregates--I realize we don't target them but they have [dropped] more than we expected, I believe, since last summer--how would you expect them to perform over the rest of this year? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	40.0
198907	382	KOHN	 We have the monetary base growing at about 3 percent this year, so we have it bouncing back. Because we have Ml essentially unchanged over the last half of the year, that dominates the reserve aggregates; we have them growing from June to December. But on a Q3 to Q4 basis they are essentially unchanged. And we have currency growing at about a 5 or 6 percent pace. So I think the reserve aggregates would tend to flatten out and the base would tend to grow a little faster, the base being 2/3 or 3/4 currency. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	383	SEGER	 But you do think the decline in the reserve aggregates would cease under alternative B? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	40.0
198907	384	KOHN	 That would be our expectation' on the basis that the decline in Ml would cease. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	385	GREENSPAN	 Further questions? President Keehn.  	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	386	KEEHN	 Questions or-- 	22	22	2.0	1.0	35.0
198907	387	GREENSPAN	 We're still on questions. President Black. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	388	BLACK	 Don, in your chart 9 where you have P above P*, is that a significant difference that would [lead] you to think that that's some indication for us that it might not [unintelligible]? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	7.0
198907	389	KOHN	 Well, as noted in the Bluebook long-run strategy section, we have P very slightly above P* here. We would expect this to be roughly consistent with Mike's Greenbook forecast stretching out to 1991, which was a very, very small deceleration of inflation. It was eerily similar to the staff baseline forecast. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	390	BLACK	 I like that adverb. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	7.0
198907	391	KOHN	" I think in the Bluebook we said ""interestingly;"" I wanted to say ""eerily."" "	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	392	GREENSPAN	 Anyone else? Don, am I correct in sensing that this particular period seems to have far more anticipation in it than anything in the recent past? It's not only federal funds expectations but the size of the changes in the long end of the bond market. Are we looking at something which is the result, in part at least, of the increasing size of the financial services industry and the extent to which there is a great deal more activity and anticipation and players in the game? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	393	KOHN	 I think there's a trend over time. One of the questions raised was: Does that trend in the activities of, say, pension funds in the stock market--and I assume in the bond market too--add to volatility? Do people tend to move from one side of the ship to the other-- 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	394	GREENSPAN	 The derivative instruments are also crucial to this whole game. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	395	KOHN	 I think that the academic findings are, as we heard at President Guffey's conference last summer, that volatility is greater than can seem to be explained by fundamental factors in the market. Whether this has gotten worse over time, with the pension funds and financial services--that's the question. I think it's more of an open question. We have had other periods--one can think back to a year ago when we were starting to tighten--in which expectations were very strong and the market bond yields moved up from, say, February through March; we were in this 7-1/2 or 7-3/4 percent area in February of 1988 and we were at 9 percent within a couple of months. So I'm not sure that-- 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	396	GREENSPAN	 Well, at least I remember the bill rate rising really sharply against the funds rate in that period. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	397	JOHNSON	 It did. You've got-- 	22	22	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	398	GREENSPAN	 Not as much as this.  	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	399	JOHNSON	 Well, it closed the spread quite narrowly a couple of times. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	400	GREENSPAN	 Which in a sense was implying another 100 basis points. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	401	JOHNSON	 No, not quite that much; but when we were perceived [as] behind by the market in catching up to inflationary expectations we did get a fairly significant closing of the spread. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	402	GREENSPAN	 I'm not opposing it, I'm-- 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	403	JOHNSON	 I don't think it ever has been discounted a point over the funds rate. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	404	KOHN	 I do think this movement, say, since late '88 has been unusual. I'm looking at a chart of the bill rate and the funds rate now. We had similar kinds of movements in early '85--this sharp up and down. There are some [periods] like that, but in the last two years, say, the size of the movement is fairly unusual. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	405	JOHNSON	 You could argue that that's related to the speed with which the Fed moves with the market. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	406	GREENSPAN	" True enough. Unless there are other questions, I think we can get to the substantive issue. But it does strike me that what is happening here is that the markets essentially have responded very dramatically to the expectation that the economy is turning and that we will respond, with necessity coming in behind. And in an odd way it has made the urgency of our response somewhat muted because the economy doesn't run off the funds rate; it runs off the long-term bond rate and the bill rate and all of the other related instruments. However, the question that I think confronts us is: How do we respond to what the evidence out there shows? I personally am a little concerned, as I indicated yesterday, about whether [unplanned] inventory accumulation will show up. There's no question that the data per se do not show any inventory backing up. But I've been through too many business cycles in my business career to have remembered making exactly that statement just prior to a slip in final demand which all of a sudden is unearthed and backs up a good deal of inventory. And all of a sudden we find ourselves with some general weakness. I wouldn't be particularly concerned were it not for the fact that, at this stage, I do think the money supply data--even though projected with some optimism to strengthen--are really quite restrained. And if there is one thing the central bank has to take due notice of, it is the Vice Chairman's concerns, which I generally share, that it is required of us to maintain financial aggregates in some acceptable pattern. That's really the reason why we have the cones. The question that confronts us is the issue of how we should move. Frankly, I would be inclined at this stage, with the new marginal calculation made by Don Kohn, to move the borrowing; I guess seasonal borrowing requirements are down by $50 million, which would be the equivalent of 25 basis points on the funds rate. I ask myself: Why not more? And I think more [of a move] is potentially risking the type of problem that Governors LaWare and Johnson raised yesterday. I'm concerned that the worst thing that can happen to us, as far as  policy is concerned, is that we are perceived to be easing too fast and in a manner which would open up the possibilities of inflationary expectations. It's hard for me to imagine how we are going to get the long-term bond rate down significantly from here unless the economy eases up quite significantly. But if we are dealing with a situation in which there is a belief that the Fed is opening up the money supply valve and that we're on our way down, I think we are risking the type of instability [we want to avoid]. That really would be quite counterproductive to an endeavor to just come off the pressure we've been imposing because, if we get a major response in inflation expectations, which would drive long-term interest rates higher, rather than soften the weakness in the economy and try to create support, we could inadvertently do precisely the opposite. I can't say to you that I know that, in fact, it would occur that way. But, looking at the way the markets have behaved just in recent days, there is a fragility and an instability out there. And I think the argument that Governor LaWare raised yesterday is one that we should be focused on. I'm not sure I come out exactly where he comes out on policy as a response to that. But the question of not creating instability, I think, is crucial for us. So, I would be reluctant at this stage to try to move all the way to ""A,"" which would be a full $100 million decline in the borrowing requirement, for fear that we might end up doing precisely the reverse of what we would be endeavoring to do--if the Committee decided that it wanted to move somewhat in the direction of ease. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	407	JOHNSON	 How would you feel if we moved 25 basis points and bond rates fell further? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	408	GREENSPAN	 You mean the interest rates? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	409	JOHNSON	 Yes. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	410	GREENSPAN	 I would feel quite comfortable. That would suggest to me that the markets' view of the Fed's anti-inflation credibility remained in place. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	411	JOHNSON	 I think that's right. Maybe it would stiffen it; I think that would be the impression. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	412	GREENSPAN	 Well, let me put it to you this way. Were it not the case, and the economy continued to be soft, I think we could probably safely move another notch. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	413	JOHNSON	 Okay. That's what I'm saying. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	414	GREENSPAN	 But I wouldn't want to prejudge that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	415	JOHNSON	 No, I think that's-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	416	GREENSPAN	" I think it would be dangerous to do so. So, I would like to recommend [borrowing] sort of half-way toward ""A"" with symmetric language, if for no other reason than I can't think of any purpose for using other than symmetrical language. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	417	FORRESTAL	 Sorry. Did you say symmetric or--?  	23	23	2.0	1.0	39.0
198907	418	GREENSPAN	" Symmetric. In other words, I would initiate at this meeting moving half-way toward ""A,"" meaning a decline of $50 million in the borrowing requirement, which in our new calibration is the equivalent of 25 basis points [on the funds rate], and staying with symmetric language. Vice Chairman. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	419	CORRIGAN	 I can support the formulation that you put on the table, Mr. Chairman. But I do think that the body English on it is important. I completely support your suggestion that we've got to be careful here. Therefore, I think the symmetric language is also important for the reasons that you've stated. In terms of the more cautious approach I would simply add: (1) that it still, as I said earlier, is not clear to me that the inflation rate necessarily has stopped rising--and even if it has, I think we still could get a couple of months of lousy numbers; and (2) as an extension of that, and for external reasons as well, I at least am prepared to run some risk of an economy that is on the slow side for some period. But I think the thrust of your prescription is precisely right. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198907	420	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	421	FORRESTAL	 Mr. Chairman, to my mind we're in a very, very difficult period at the moment and I think the formulation of policy is more difficult than usual. If you step back a bit and look at our strategy, the strategy that we formulated a year ago was well conceived and I think it has been well executed. I think we have pretty well gotten the results we wanted--that is, in the sense that we have brought the economy down to a more sustainable level of performance. Unfortunately, inflation is still at too high a level. If I believed my own forecast I would be more apt to stay where we are. But I recognize that my forecast for GNP next year is an outlier; and given that outlier position, I have much less confidence in that forecast than I ordinarily would. So, I think your prescription is the right one. I think we have to be careful not to move too quickly and undo inadvertently what we have achieved through the strategy that we developed last year. I would certainly support your formulation, including the symmetric language. But your point about the comments that were made yesterday concerning fragility and the consequences of policy is very, very important, because I think the consequences of moving too quickly and letting inflation move up would be perverse and would achieve exactly the kind of things that we certainly want to avoid. So, I think going slowly the way you suggested is the proper stance for policy at the moment. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	39.0
198907	422	GREENSPAN	 President Parry, 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	423	PARRY	 Mr. Chairman, I think it's appropriate for us to move very cautiously at this point. It's clear that the current rates of inflation are a problem; and even more of a concern is the fact that underlying inflationary pressures are likely to remain a problem for quite a while, whether you [accept] the forecast of the Greenbook or some of the others that have been talked about around the table. So, it seems to me the biggest mistake would be to move too aggressively and, therefore, I could support the proposition that you put on the table. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198907	424	GREENSPAN	 President Syron.  	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	425	SYRON	 Mr. Chairman, I have a great deal of sympathy for the policy prescription that you advocated for the following reasons: first, given that our long-term goal is price stability, I'm not all that unhappy about where we are right now; and at least for the next couple of quarters I'm not that unhappy with what the Greenbook forecast has embedded in it in terms of the behavior of rates. Knowing the uncertainties that exist in this world, I think it is very important to move gradually, for the reasons that other people have mentioned, and to adopt an approach or continue an approach in which the Chairman has a fair amount of flexibility. There are things that could happen in the intermeeting period that would substantially change how one would read the economy. So, I very strongly support that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	51.0
198907	426	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	427	GUFFEY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I agree, essentially, with those who have already spoken with respect to your proposal. If I were to believe our own forecast for the quarter immediately ahead, quite likely I would opt for alternative B with symmetric language. Essentially, the question in my mind is whether or not we really have the slowing that was detailed yesterday in the numbers that Governor Johnson cited--whether or not that is going to continue throughout this quarter or whether we will pause and get a reacceleration and therefore an inappropriate further dropping of short-term rates at this point. Then we'd have to turn it back around. But given that uncertainty, your proposal to move cautiously seems to me to be appropriate--symmetric language of the directive and between alternatives A and B. One thing that isn't clear to me, however, is how the borrowing level would be treated. I know there has been an explanation; I guess I just didn't understand. It is dropped by $50 million under your proposal, Mr. Chairman. Given that the seasonal borrowing is roughly $500 million or a bit above and we have been at $600 million as a borrowing level, are we talking about $550 million or are we talking about staying at $600 million? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	20.0
198907	428	SPEAKER	600	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	429	GREENSPAN	 What I'm doing is calibrating off what Don Kohn has indicated. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	430	KOHN	 It'd be roughly $600 million. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	431	GREENSPAN	 I think they recalibrated the [current level] to $650, so technically, I guess it comes down to $600 million. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	432	GUFFEY	 600? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	20.0
198907	433	GREENSPAN	 Yes. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	434	JOHNSON	 You recalibrated the $650 million for what alternative? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	435	KOHN	 For alternative B. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	436	GREENSPAN	" For ""B.""  "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	437	PARRY	" And $55 0 million for ""A."" "	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198907	438	JOHNSON	 Okay, right. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	439	ANGELL	 But you expect that to be consistent with [a funds rate of] 9-1/4 to 9-3/8 percent? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198907	440	GREENSPAN	 That's correct. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	441	JOHNSON	 It doesn't sound like the old formula, but that's okay. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	442	KOHN	 No, Governor Johnson, it isn't because of the-- 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	443	JOHNSON	 That's all right. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	444	KOHN	 It [includes] seasonal and adjustment borrowing-- 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	445	JOHNSON	 Yes, okay. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	446	GUFFEY	 Mr. Chairman, I'd just like to add one other caveat. We do have a fairly important number coming out on Friday-- that is, the employment number. Rather than moving to the lower level that you are suggesting before that number comes out, I think I'd wait and take another look before the-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	20.0
198907	447	GREENSPAN	 Let me suggest this: If the number turns out to be a major surprise, on the up side perhaps, we would be well advised to have a telephone conference on the basis of that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	448	GUFFEY	 I would agree; that's very satisfactory. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	20.0
198907	449	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	450	KEEHN	 Mr. Chairman, given the current situation and the accumulation of evidence in the economy, along with the current conditions in the markets, I think the policy prescription that was outlined is just right and I concur with it. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	35.0
198907	451	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	452	ANGELL	 Yes, I concur with that policy; I believe that a borrowing range associated with a 25 basis point move at this point in time is the most prudent. We really have been very fortunate, it seems to me, that the market has given us so much credibility that long-run rates have moved to where they have moved. And it seems to me that we should have the objective of somehow or other getting at least the soft landing in the housing industry and that's most clearly done with long rates, not with short rates. It just seems to me that fixed mortgage rates need to be in the single-digit area in order for us to have the soft landing. Now, for those who may wonder how this fits with price level stability, I will share with you the commodity price annual rates of change charts that I've been following very, very carefully. As you can see, those smooth rates of change have had a very flat top on them; so I've been hesitant to call what I would say is a forecast of a downturn in the CPI year-over-year rate of change. But unless I'm totally wrong, the CPI year-over-year rates of  change between now and October are going to be declining. And it's encompassing that that would permit me to want to-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198907	453	GREENSPAN	 There's a technical reason for that; the gasoline price we know is coming down and we have that refinery adjustment problem, which the seasonal does not pick up. Mike, what is that worth in the PPI? As I recall, it was not small. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	454	STOCKTON	 No. We're expecting that to take about 4 cents a gallon off gasoline prices by the September-October period. So there's about a 4 percent decline just from that as well as some weakening in gasoline margins over and above that. Once that's in place, we're expecting CPI prices to be [rising] 0.2 to 0.3 percent for the summer months of July, August, and September. And for the PPI [we expect a] zero to 0.1 percent rise for a few months in late summer, early fall. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	455	ANGELL	 I'm aware of those technical changes and that's why I have such a low forecast for the CPI in the second half. But I did want [others] to be aware of the fact that some of that is a one¬ time deal and will not necessarily follow through. But the work that Peter Von zur Muehlen has been doing--and he will have a working paper for the American Ag-Econ Association and the United States Department of Agriculture meeting in Baton Rouge, Florida later this month--has shown that these smooth commodity prices have been very significant in regard to forecasting changes or peaks in the CPI. And that's what I guess I'm staking my reputation on that the CPI will respond. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198907	456	BOEHNE	 Be careful, Wayne. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
198907	457	GREENSPAN	 The technical data are supporting that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	458	ANGELL	 I never stake my reputation without some other help like that! 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198907	459	JOHNSON	 But, Wayne, this is ex-oil. Would you be forecasting an ex-oil CPI turning point? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	460	ANGELL	 No, I don't think-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198907	461	JOHNSON	 Well, I think it's reasonable. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	462	ANGELL	 Yes, I feel confident that that will take place. But we have to understand that changing the growth of the money stock does show up in these commodity prices. It took a while for those slow money growth rates to show up but now they are showing up. And I think that's encouraging. What we want to avoid, it seems to me, is the risk of too severe a slowdown, which would then be followed by overdoing it in regard to money growth rates on the up side. So, I think caution is the right word. And I expect the markets to be stabilized somewhat by less than maybe the markets expect. And then I think we need to take another look. Now, I would prefer asymmetric language just because--as you know, in March I thought we should have been symmetric and in May I thought we should have been asymmetric-- remember, these minutes are released 6 weeks from now. So, I think it's better to have the 6-week release make us sound a little smarter than it does when we're so reluctant to move in a direction on the symmetry that I think is needed. It's not going to show up now,  anyway; and if it turns out that we are wrong we will have demonstrated that we didn't make any moves. But I favor your proposal. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198907	463	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	464	SEGER	" I know your preference is to go between ""A"" and ""B"" but I think I would go all the way to ""A."" First of all, I don't think that a 50 basis point change in the fed funds rate is all that startling. Going upward we went 50 and 75 basis points without even winking or blinking at all. Also, I'm not so sure that all the markets have incorporated only a 25 basis point easing by us. This morning I heard the early financial news on TV and some of the stock market commentators were talking about the impact of expectations of lower interest rates on the stock market. Again, I don't know if these folks are right, but they were building the stock market story on substantial declines in interest rates. Secondly, we heard all these pieces of evidence presented yesterday about the slowing in the economy, and I certainly agree with all those. Frankly, I think that there's going to be much more slowing going forward, regardless of what we do today, because I don't think the actions today are going to impact the economy one way or the other for probably the rest of this year. Earlier we were talking about the importance of announcement effects; probably there are a thousand people in the country who know what we do at the FOMC, and maybe 500 of them know what the ranges are for monetary growth. But there are 500 and some people down at the other end of Constitution Avenue who are going to be following what goes on in the real economy. If the economy weakens even further and they start hearing from the folks at home about rising unemployment rates and so forth, then I'm sure our Chairman here is not going to be the man of the hour when he has to go down there and meet with them-- because I think they will wonder why we didn't see what was going on, or if we saw it, why we ignored it and didn't react. So, as I said, I would prefer alternative A. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198907	465	GREENSPAN	 Governor LaWare. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	466	LAWARE	 I support your policy recommendation, Mr. Chairman. I don't think we came out too far apart in our conclusion, because I think destabilization in either direction is bad. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	50.0
198907	467	GREENSPAN	 I said that because you had not commented; it was more omission rather-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	468	LAWARE	 So, I certainly support the 25 basis point change in rate and the symmetric language. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	50.0
198907	469	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	470	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, you made my talk for me except that you made it much better than I would have. But, I would like to suggest one thing. It probably won't meet with a lot of acceptance but I'd like to see the monetary aggregates moved up in that list of things that might temper what we're doing in the intermeeting period. Rather than the unemployment and employment figures [to be released] this Friday or inflation figures coming later on, I think this is  really the crucial thing. And I think it's important that we do keep [money growth] moving up; it has been very weak for a long time and unless we get to change that, frankly, I think we're going to run into trouble before very long. So I'd like to see that moved up to the first place. But otherwise, I'm right with you on this. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198907	471	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	472	HOSKINS	 I'd be very close to Bob Black's position. As I listen to the comments around the table, it seems that there is a view that the economy is softening. Certainly some indicators have [shown] that and some people are arguing that we ought to ease policy on that basis. A one-quarter-ahead forecast for real GNP has an error of plus or minus 2 percentage points around it. If you go out 18 months on inflation you find roughly the same error. The only point I'm trying to make is that we seem to be in the business of fine- tuning; that, I think, has led us into some problems in the past. If one is to support your proposition, I think the reason ought to be to ensure that we get Don Kohn's projected money growth for the second half. While I prefer to stay where we are on the hope and prayer that Don's forecast is accurate, I certainly would be ready to bias [policy] toward alternative A if the aggregates didn't come through. And I'd probably be more aggressive--along the lines of Martha's position. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198907	473	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	474	MELZER	 I agree with what you suggested. I think caution is appropriate for the reasons that Lee expressed before. If we fall into the trap of short-term fine-tuning it could be very disruptive in the long run. So, I think the caution is appropriate and I think the symmetrical language conveys that as best we can. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
198907	475	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	476	STERN	 I support your prescription. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	41.0
198907	477	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	478	KELLEY	 Mr. Chairman, I certainly support your prescription. I would like to suggest when it's in order--now or later--a reordering of the presentation of our list of concerns in the policy directive. Would that be in order now? Or would you prefer to do that later? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
198907	479	GREENSPAN	 Since the issue has been raised late in this go-around, perhaps we ought to complete this and then go back to the question of ordering--unless somebody's vote or view would depend on that [unintelligible]. Governor Johnson. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	480	JOHNSON	 I agree with the Chairman on his proposal, although my preference probably would have been 50 basis points on the funds rate phased in over two periods, because I do think caution is certainly needed in the immediate period. I think we ought to test how the market absorbs 25 basis points before we consider any further moves. As Don Kohn pointed out, if you go further out, the market clearly has discounted well over 50 basis points in terms of what they expect us to do over a period of time, which is certainly within the  period between meetings. So, my preference would have been to plan to take another step based on how the markets developed between here and there. I generally think asymmetric language would be preferable, but I can go with the symmetry. I still want to express a concern, though. I think we always became quite concerned with where we were relative to the markets when we were tightening--when the markets perceived us to be behind on the inflation fight--and we moved fairly aggressively to catch up and even tried to stay ahead at times, which I think was critical to our gaining credibility. I think that problem works in reverse. If we lose the confidence of the markets that we are going to pursue a stable policy and keep up with changes and events, we're going to run the risk on the down side that we were worried about on the up side. I don't think we're there; but I think that problem is simmering out there for us. I don't think we're anywhere near finding ourselves in a situation like this, but the problem I worry about in the back of my head is that the Fed drove interest rates gradually down to 0 in the 1930s and it didn't do a blessed thing to stop the economy's decline. Getting into that kind of a mentality is a risky situation, so I think we need some [asymmetry] both on the down side and the up side. But I can go along with your funds rate. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	481	GREENSPAN	 President Boykin. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	482	BOYKIN	 I would concur. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	34.0
198907	483	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	484	BOEHNE	 I think your suggestion for a 25 basis point drop in the funds rate is exactly what ought to happen. I would, however, take some issue with the [proposed] symmetry. I would prefer an asymmetrical directive for two reasons: first, I think the risk has shifted and there is more downside risk than there is upside risk in the economy and an asymmetrical directive would underscore that; and secondly, given the string of data that we have had in recent weeks that have been on the bearish side, it's difficult for me to imagine that we would tighten in the next six weeks. It would have to be a very dramatic turnaround in the data, and I think the probabilities of that happening are very, very small. On the other hand, what is most likely is that we will see a continuation of the bearish data and it wouldn't take nearly as convincing a string of information in that direction to warrant a further decline in rates. And when I consider the reasons why we usually have had asymmetrical directives, it seems to me that those two reasons have been high on the list. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
198907	485	GREENSPAN	 Can we now get views on the issue of the position of the various elements which affect our directive? At the moment it reads: number (1) inflationary pressures; (2) the strength of the business expansion; (3) the behavior of the monetary aggregates; and (4) developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	486	ANGELL	" Mr. Chairman, before you go to the go-around I'd like to have reactions to another suggestion, and that is: It seems to me that ""indications of inflationary pressures"" is a defensive posture that was appropriate during the period that we knew we were going to be giving ground on inflation. I would rather have a more positive  statement in the wording such as ""progress toward price stability"" rather than ""indications of inflationary pressures."" "	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198907	487	GREENSPAN	 Sounds like a reasonable suggestion. Does anybody object to that? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	488	CORRIGAN	 I have trouble with it because I really have been concerned that we may be projecting this notion to the public and to the Congress--and I hope you're right with your commodity prices, Wayne--that there's a free lunch, or that we can get from here to there without having to incur some real difficulty in the economy. And I think that's very dangerous. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198907	489	GREENSPAN	 Let me suggest, then, that we withhold that until perhaps the next meeting when it would be on the table again--unless there's an objection to that--because that's the type of change which I think is an important change and should largely reflect the views in the Committee generally. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	490	ANGELL	 Well, Mr. Chairman, the reason I raise it now is because you're about to prepare your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony. And I was thinking in terms of that testimony as well as this directive, which is going to be published six weeks from now. At this point in time the chances of our avoiding too significant a turndown, I think, depend upon our credibility; and I think that stronger language to a price level commitment will help the long-bond market more. That's the reason I raise it now. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198907	491	CORRIGAN	 I don't have any trouble putting some words like that in the Chairman's testimony or even in the body of the directive itself. I don't know; maybe I misunderstood. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198907	492	ANGELL	 Well, I guess I don't understand what you object to in terms of progress toward price stability. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198907	493	CORRIGAN	 What I object to is that I think we are running a risk of creating an impression in the Congress and elsewhere that we are going to get to price stability in some easy, painless way. I just am very, very skeptical that that is possible. I'm skeptical that we can even get the inflation rate back down to 4 percent without having to incur some hardship. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198907	494	GREENSPAN	" That's why we do say in the directive, as Norm points out to me, that ""the FOMC seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote growth,"" etc. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	495	CORRIGAN	 We probably should look at these-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198907	496	ANGELL	 Well, can someone think of some other language that somebody doesn't object to? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198907	497	PARRY	 What's your concern? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198907	498	ANGELL	" ""Indications of inflationary pressures"" seems like a resistance approach. In other words, if inflation pressures don't get any worse it seems like maybe that's what we're after. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198907	499	HOSKINS	 Isn't that what we've done?  	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198907	500	ANGELL	 That's exactly what we've done. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198907	501	HOSKINS	 My point earlier was if that's how it is, then we ought to start saying that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198907	502	CORRIGAN	" What if we say ""taking account of progress in resisting inflationary pressures""? "	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198907	503	HOSKINS	" As opposed to continuing to say ""price stability,"" if [our objective] is really to maintain current rates of inflation then we've got to be honest about it and say that. If not, if we really mean price stability, then we ought to take actions to achieve that. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198907	504	ANGELL	 But I would hold that when you look at the M2 growth path over the last 30 months this is an unprecedented M2 growth path for 30 months in the history of M2. We have never had a 30-month period of growth this low and this stable. And we've got time [lags]. So, it seems to me that we are going to have the burdens and the pain is going to show. You don't get there cheap. I guess I'm somewhat more optimistic in regard to what the record is than you are. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198907	505	JOHNSON	 I agree with that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	506	GREENSPAN	 Let me suggest one thing. When we publish any change in words it is going to get really very heavily evaluated at this particular turning point. I feel a certain sympathy for what you're saying, but perhaps what we ought to do is to-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	507	ANGELL	 I'll be satisfied to do it next meeting. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198907	508	GREENSPAN	 Yes. Let's think about that, because I hate to make that type of decision which we don't mean to be all that significant but can be read to be rather significant. Let's try some formulations between meetings and perhaps come up with a better set of language. Let's leave this particular discussion strictly to the repositioning, if any, of what it is that we have in the directive with respect to our indicators. President Parry, 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	509	PARRY	" I'd like to address the repositioning issue. It seems to me that we still ought to keep some statement about inflation up front. I think we ought to remember why we moved ""behavior of the monetary aggregates"" to where it is. We had a lot of research, conducted by the staff, that indicated that the association between the growth of money and the economy was not sufficiently predictable or stable to rely on it to a great extent for use in terms of operating in financial markets. Without taking another look at whether or not the staff has changed their view on that, why should we move it up? In addition, if we do move it up to number 1, should we stop talking about the way we have been formulating our policy in terms of borrowed reserves? "	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198907	510	ANGELL	 You want to take it to two, then? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198907	511	PARRY	 I don't want to change it--not until some work is done that would support such a change. I don't understand what has changed in terms of our perception about the usefulness of money as a guide to the economy since all those studies were done.  	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198907	512	BLACK	 When the federal funds rate comes down a little and the aggregates continue at the rate they have been going, I think the market will be scared very much by those developments. So, the reason I suggested moving that up a little is that they ought to know that we are concerned that the aggregates not stay that low forever, but rather that they should move up a bit from where they are. The work that Don and his associates did alleviates a lot of my worries about it because that work pretty well suggests to me around 3 percent, which might not be too bad. I don't think that [low growth] ought to go on any longer now; and I'd like the markets to know that if it doesn't begin to move a little we'll have to do something. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198907	513	PARRY	 Are you suggesting that we try to monitor it? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198907	514	BLACK	 I always suggest that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198907	515	PARRY	 Well-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198907	516	GREENSPAN	 At this particular point, I have an urgent phone call. I was wondering if we could break for coffee now and come back in a few minutes. [Coffee break] 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	517	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley you have the floor. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	518	KELLEY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I assume we're proceeding to discuss the ordering of our concerns. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
198907	519	GREENSPAN	 Yes. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	520	KELLEY	 I wanted to make a suggestion along that line, if I might. First of all, in the spirit of your comment that anything that goes into these directives that is different from what has been there heretofore is very carefully scrutinized, we should think about it carefully. In that spirit, my suggestion is more in the nature of putting something on the table rather than trying to push for its immediate adoption. I would suggest that we consider reversing the order of the first two of these considerations that appear in lines 63 and 64 of the operational paragraph and give more emphasis to the strength of the economy as opposed to inflationary pressures. This arises out of the notion, discussed here earlier today and before, that in monetary policy price stability is a very important and essential precondition to a larger end--that it's the means toward a larger end of sustainable growth. I think sustainable growth is driven by a wide variety of different factors as well as monetary policy in the interplay of all sorts of things. We carefully tried to assess the risks to our forecast and whether or not the economy might turn out to be stronger or weaker than the forecast. Everybody has slightly different views on that, but it does seem fairly clear and fairly consensual that the risks are for a slower economy than we have seen heretofore. That's not really my point; my point, as I tried to allude to yesterday afternoon, relates to the consequences of events falling out meaningfully on one side or the other of the consensus forecast on the economy. It seems to me that the consequences of the economy being somewhat stronger are not terribly severe. For one thing, it's hard to see the economy being very much stronger than the forecast given the 30 months of aggregate growth history that Governor  Angell alluded to earlier and given the nature of the incoming evidence on what's going on in the real economy. It's very difficult for me to see that inflation could get away from us in some way that we couldn't go back and reassess. On the other hand, if events fall out on the weak side, I think that the consequences are very asymmetrical in the sense that they could be much more severe than if they should turn out to be on the strong side. If we could be confident that we could fine-tune this soft landing and have a period of slow growth that would eventually, at some point down the line, begin to gradually turn up, that would be very nice. But we all know we can't necessarily count on being able to do that. And I am very concerned about the nature of the factors that Governor LaWare discussed yesterday afternoon that have to do with the fragility, particularly of the financial structure, at this time. I certainly don't think I need to go back over that; everybody is aware of that. But there are factors out there of very large magnitude, other than monetary policy, that could put us in a situation where we could have a downturn that could feed upon itself with very severe consequences in the larger picture of the economy and the society. Indeed, should we get into a severe recession with ballooning deficits it could turn out to be very counterproductive in making long-term progress toward price stability. So, it seems to me that largely as a result of the asymmetrical consequences of how events might turn out, this might be a time that we should give more priority overtly to what's going on in the economy relative to what's going on strictly in the narrower consideration of inflation. So I would propose for consideration, either now or later Mr. Chairman, that those first two considerations be reversed. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
198907	521	GREENSPAN	 Well, having heard the beginning of this conversation and doing a little arithmetic, there are eleven members of the FOMC at the moment and five various elements, to which you have just added several more. Since whatever we do will be read very closely, I would feel very uncomfortable crafting that language now; I would suggest for the Committee's consideration that in the period immediately ahead Don Kohn contact not only the Committee members but all the other Presidents as well and see if we can lay before the Committee at our next meeting some alternatives which capture the type of issue you and others have raised to see whether in fact we do wish to make changes. I would think it's probably impracticable to try to make changes now, and I would offer as a consideration that we essentially think about this a little more because there's a lot greater sensitivity to this than we would like. And I think a little thought would be useful. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	522	KELLEY	 Well, as I indicated early on, I entirely subscribe to that notion; but I did want to get that on the table. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
198907	523	GREENSPAN	 Okay. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	524	CORRIGAN	 I would not personally object, Mr. Chairman, if you choose to incorporate the gravamen of what Governor Kelley is saying even in your testimony where you're not as bound-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198907	525	GREENSPAN	 Well, the testimony is on the 20th and by then I think we will have gotten basically the thrust of this.  	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	526	CORRIGAN	 We can leave these words where they are but try and get some-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198907	527	GREENSPAN	" I think it would be worthwhile--if there is going to be a table, as there invariably is, on the Committee members' and the Presidents' forecasts--to bolster that a bit by getting some of the characteristics of what the individual views in that table basically are and put them not only into my testimony but in the document as well. If there are no objections to that as a proposal I would like Norm to read us just the operational paragraph, which captures what I believe is the central tendency of the individual members' decisions. We do have a substantive issue on the language, which is not just arbitrary--whether we say the Committee seeks to decrease ""somewhat"" or ""slightly"" the existing degree of pressure. I would say the presumption is slightly, but is there a strong view either way on that question? "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	528	JOHNSON	" Well, the reality of it is clearly ""slightly."" "	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	529	GREENSPAN	 Well, we ought to be clear on that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	530	BLACK	 [Unintelligible.] 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198907	531	JOHNSON	" I would prefer ""somewhat"" but that would go with a different change. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198907	532	GREENSPAN	" Why don't you use ""slightly."" "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	533	BERNARD	" It would read: ""In the implementation of policy for the immediate future the Committee seeks to decrease slightly the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, somewhat greater reserve restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from June through September at annual rates of about 7 percent. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 7 to 11 percent."" "	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	534	GREENSPAN	 Would you put that to a vote? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198907	535	BERNARD	 Chairman Greenspan Yes Vice Chairman Corrigan Yes Governor Angell Yes President Guffey Yes Governor Johnson Yes President Keehn Yes Governor Kelley Yes Governor LaWare Yes President Melzer Yes Governor Seger No President Syron Yes  	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198907	536	GREENSPAN	 I gather that for those who wish to revise their forecast for submission in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony and report it would be useful to have the revisions, if there are any, by July 12th. That's next Wednesday, I believe. 	1	1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198907	537	ANGELL	 How many did you throw out on both sides to get the central tendency? 	1	1	0.0	1.0	43.0
198907	538	PRELL	 The ones that I showed throughout that range-- 	1	1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	539	ANGELL	 Three on each side? 	1	1	0.0	1.0	43.0
198907	540	PRELL	 We'll have to look at this again and see how the group decision was reached after we've seen the revised numbers. 	1	1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198907	541	GREENSPAN	 The next meeting date is scheduled for Tuesday, August 22. 	1	1	0.0	1.0	47.0
