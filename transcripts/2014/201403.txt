201403	0	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate your making time for this meeting.	92	9
201403	1	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	I would have preferred that we all be together in person for my first meeting as Chair so I could thank you personally for the good wishes you have offered.	92	9
201403	2	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	But let me express those thanks nonetheless.	92	9
201403	3	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Steve Kamin distributed a note on developments in Ukraine, and I would like to defer that until the end of the meeting.	92	9
201403	4	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	But if time permits after we have discussed forward guidance, if you have questions for Steve, I’m sure he would be glad to take them up.	92	9
201403	5	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	The main purpose of this meeting is to discuss our forward guidance so that we are able to reach agreement on how to revise it in March.	92	9
201403	6	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	The unemployment rate, at 6.6 percent, is very close to the threshold in our FOMC statement.	92	9
201403	7	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	And despite the weaker tone of recent data, the threshold could be crossed soon, perhaps even before our March meeting.	92	9
201403	8	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	At a minimum, this means that we may need to remove the threshold language at the March meeting.	92	9
201403	9	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	But many of us have expressed an interest in also providing more information about the post-threshold period.	92	9
201403	10	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	In light of the complexities involved in modifying our forward guidance, I thought it would be useful for us to discuss some options outside the context of a regular meeting where the state of the economy and a policy decision take priority.	92	9
201403	11	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	By way of introduction, I would like to make a couple of general comments about forward guidance.	92	9
201403	12	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	I personally see our forward guidance as having served a very important role in keeping financial conditions accommodative and as having thereby supported the recovery.	92	9
201403	13	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Now that we have finally reached the point when a return to something close to full employment and price stability is in most of our SEP forecasts, issues pertaining to liftoff and normalization will naturally come to play a larger role in our policy communications.	92	9
201403	14	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	I would urge everyone to remain mindful, though, of the numerous “false dawns” the economy has presented.	92	9
201403	15	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	The effective lower bound on interest rates still imposes an important asymmetry on our ability to respond to upside and downside risks.	92	9
201403	16	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	For this reason, and also for purposes of policy continuity, I believe it remains important that our forward guidance continues to convey, in terms that are as clear as possible, the conditions under which policy will remain highly accommodative in order to promote recovery and a lasting end to this lengthy zero- interest-rate episode.	92	9
201403	17	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	We did add some language in December that provided specific information about the Committee’s likely behavior after the 6.5 percent threshold is crossed.	92	9
201403	18	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	And with market expectations now well aligned with both that guidance and our own views, I would personally be quite reluctant to offer less guidance in March than we provided in December and January.	92	9
201403	19	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	There are a number of important issues for us to consider in revising our guidance, and I want to thank the staff for their thoughtful background memo.	92	9
201403	20	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	I appreciate the very useful comments and suggestions that a number of you provided, and they helped shape the memo and the materials circulated for this videoconference.1 For today’s meeting, we have tried to craft a minimal-changes version of our current statement, and it is labeled as option 5.	92	9
201403	21	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	But I asked the staff to focus the memo on changes that go well beyond such a minimal-red-ink approach.	92	9
201403	22	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Because the crossing of a threshold essentially necessitates a nontrivial revision of the statement, many outside analysts are expecting a change.	92	9
201403	23	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	So the present moment could provide an attractive opportunity for more substantial revisions to the statement.	92	9
201403	24	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	1 The memo “Background Documents and Questions for Discussion on Forward Guidance” used at this meeting by participants is appended to this transcript (appendix 1).	92	9
201403	25	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	With many commentators expecting the forward guidance to change, we will of course have the usual difficulties divining just what observers will make of any changes we decide to adopt or, indeed, what they would make of the absence of much change.	92	9
201403	26	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Despite these difficulties, I would encourage us to consider whether we could substantially clarify our intentions, remembering, as always, that some minimalist approach, perhaps along the lines of the one circulated by the staff last Friday, will end up being deemed best.	92	9
201403	27	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Let me highlight four specific issues raised in our prior discussions and in the memo.	92	9
201403	28	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	First, the current guidance is focused on the unemployment rate, but we have consistently communicated that once the threshold is crossed we will be considering a more comprehensive evaluation of the labor market.	92	9
201403	29	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Now may be an appropriate time to signal this shift in the statement.	92	9
201403	30	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Some of the options suggested in the staff memo focused on the state of employment relative to our assessment of its maximum sustainable level.	92	9
201403	31	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	This formulation has the virtue of being taken from our Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, but this approach would bring a new concept into the statement and might itself seem to call for some new, single measure of slack.	92	9
201403	32	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Alternatively, the language circulated last Friday simply makes reference to an assessment of whether the recovery in the labor market is complete.	92	9
201403	33	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	This formulation might accurately bring to mind the broad assessment that we actually engage in.	92	9
201403	34	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Second, over the past several months, the possibility of inflation running persistently and significantly below our objective has become more prominent.	92	9
201403	35	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	It might be appropriate to clarify the role of low inflation in our policy intentions beyond the clause we added in December that specifies that the current target range is likely to be maintained, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal.	92	9
201403	36	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	The first two options in the staff memo refer explicitly to the shortfall of inflation from our 2 percent objective as a condition determining how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate, and option 3 provides one version of an inflation floor.	92	9
201403	37	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Third, some of you have indicated in past discussions a preference to clarify the role of financial developments in the statement.	92	9
201403	38	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	This could be warranted, for example, either to address concerns over financial stability, which may grow as the period of highly accommodative policy continues and the economy strengthens, or, alternatively, to convey a willingness of the FOMC to respond if, say, financial conditions tighten in a way that compromises the outlook for attaining our objectives.	92	9
201403	39	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	The options provided by the staff give an approach that encompasses both of these considerations.	92	9
201403	40	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	And option 4 provides an alternative that focuses directly on financial-stability risks.	92	9
201403	41	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Finally, if the recovery continues as we all hope, we will face an increasing need to clarify how policy will be conducted during the transitional period between liftoff and the time when we settle into some new normal.	92	9
201403	42	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	The current statement mainly suggests that the FOMC will, after liftoff, embrace the balanced approach from the consensus statement.	92	9
201403	43	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	But this is language that sheds little light on policy in the broad range of likely cases in which both employment and inflation are falling short of our objectives, so that any need to balance conflicting objectives remains well in the future.	92	9
201403	44	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	In the new paragraph 6 that is included in the first four options, the staff has provided two sentences pertaining to the post-liftoff period.	92	9
201403	45	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	The first might be viewed as a very general description of the reaction function, whereas the second is focused on the fact that even after we return to price stability and full employment, the appropriate federal funds rate target may remain low relative to what we view as normal in the longer run.	92	9
201403	46	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Let me stop there with those broad comments that are intended to frame the discussion.	92	9
201403	47	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	If you have any questions for me at this point, I would be glad to take them.	92	9
201403	48	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	And if not, we can just begin the go-round.	92	9
201403	49	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	[No response]	92	9
201403	50	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201403	51	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Seeing no questions for me, why don’t we begin the go-round, and let’s start with President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201403	52	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	53	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me be the first, in this group, at least, to welcome you to your new role.	92	9
201403	54	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	I look forward to working with you in your new capacity.	92	9
201403	55	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	I appreciate your framing our discussion as ably as you did.	92	9
201403	56	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	I also found the options and analysis in the memo dated February 21 to be quite valuable, and I want to thank the staff for the great work that was included in that memo.	92	9
201403	57	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	I want to divide my remarks into two parts.	92	9
201403	58	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	First, I’m going to address the question of why we need to provide forward guidance about the future evolution of the federal funds rate.	92	9
201403	59	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	Second, I’ll use the answers to this question to inform my preferred choice among the five options offered to us by the staff.	92	9
201403	60	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	I see two related answers to the question of why we need forward guidance.	92	9
201403	61	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	The first is connected to policy effectiveness.	92	9
201403	62	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	In my view, monetary policy can be effective only if markets and the public have a good understanding of our reaction function.	92	9
201403	63	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	Before the financial crisis, that understanding came from decades of historical experience—historical experience in which the FOMC adhered relatively closely to a well-documented statistical pattern of behavior—that is, something akin to a Taylor rule.	92	9
201403	64	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	In the absence of forward guidance from us, or in the presence of deliberately vague forward guidance like that in option 5, markets are likely to turn back to those pre-crisis historical relationships, like the Taylor (1993) rule or the Taylor (1999) rule, to provide their guide to future FOMC behavior.	92	9
201403	65	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	The problem is that, as the Summary of Economic Projections indicates, monetary policy is likely to be more accommodative than either of these rules for years to come.	92	9
201403	66	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	Given that we are going to deviate from our pre-crisis reaction function, we need to be as informative as we can be about the reaction function that we are actually going to use, and good forward guidance can provide that information.	92	9
201403	67	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	So that’s the effectiveness argument.	92	9
201403	68	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	The second reason why we need to provide forward guidance relates to credibility.	92	9
201403	69	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	Before January 2012, the FOMC did not have an inflation target of 2 percent.	92	9
201403	70	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	Indeed, several FOMC participants, including my predecessor, thought that appropriate policy would be consistent with a long-run average inflation rate noticeably below 2 percent.	92	9
201403	71	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	Against this recent historical backdrop, it would not be at all surprising if the public and markets still saw the new 2 percent inflation marker as being more of a ceiling than a true target.	92	9
201403	72	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	We need to be using our forward guidance about our reaction function to build the credibility of our 2 percent target by assuring the public and markets that we are in fact doing whatever we can to facilitate a rapid return to 2 percent inflation.	92	9
201403	73	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we need to be using forward guidance to do two things:  to make clear that our reaction function over the next few years will differ importantly from what we did prior to the crisis and, relatedly, to make clear that we are purposefully making choices to keep inflation at 2 percent.	92	9
201403	74	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	Those are the reasons why we use forward guidance.	92	9
201403	75	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	Given those reasons, I see option 3 as being a great example of the kind of guidance that we should think about using.	92	9
201403	76	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	I see option 3 as having four desirable attributes.	92	9
201403	77	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	The first is that it assures the public that the FOMC is highly unlikely to raise the target fed funds rate at least until the one- to two-year-ahead outlook for inflation has risen back to 2 percent.	92	9
201403	78	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	Raising the fed funds rate before that point would imply that we don’t see 2 percent as a true target.	92	9
201403	79	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	Rather, such an action would imply that we continue to see sub–2 percent inflation as being an appropriate outcome for monetary policy.	92	9
201403	80	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, I want to be clear:  The need to wait until the inflation outlook has returned to 2 percent isn’t some arcane result from some fancy-pants theoretical framework.	92	9
201403	81	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	It is an actual description of how inflation-targeting central banks operate in practice.	92	9
201403	82	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	For example, the Bank of Canada has a single mandate—to keep inflation equal to 2 percent.	92	9
201403	83	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	Its operating practice is to adjust policy so that inflation is projected to return to 2 percent over some period of time that is close to 8 quarters, ranging from 6 to 11 quarters.	92	9
201403	84	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	It is true that, unlike the Bank of Canada, we also have an employment mandate, but we want to be clear about what that means for policy.	92	9
201403	85	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	It does not provide a rationalization for raising the federal funds rate before the inflation outlook gets back to 2 percent.	92	9
201403	86	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	The employment mandate is fundamentally asymmetric in nature.	92	9
201403	87	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	It does not say that the FOMC is responsible for making sure that employment doesn’t get too high.	92	9
201403	88	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	It says that the FOMC is responsible for making sure that employment doesn’t stay too low.	92	9
201403	89	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	This asymmetry means that the employment mandate can rationalize being more accommodative than a strict inflation-targeting central bank like the Bank of Canada, but it cannot rationalize being less accommodative than an inflation-targeting central bank.	92	9
201403	90	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	Some observers have suggested that waiting until the outlook for inflation has returned to 2 percent is inconsistent with the FOMC’s historical behavior.	92	9
201403	91	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	That may be right, but historically we didn’t have a 2 percent inflation target.	92	9
201403	92	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	That is a very recent development.	92	9
201403	93	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	It goes back to January 2012.	92	9
201403	94	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now that we have a 2 percent inflation target, our actions need to be consistent with that target, not with our past behavior.	92	9
201403	95	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is exactly why we need to include this kind of 2 percent inflation floor in our forward guidance.	92	9
201403	96	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	And we need to underscore the message that our future actions will be consistent with that target, not with our past behavior.	92	9
201403	97	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	The second desirable attribute of option 3 is that it does not have an employment threshold.	92	9
201403	98	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think this is going to be challenging for us, because it may seem that, by not including an employment threshold, we are not putting as much emphasis on employment— whereas in fact the opposite is true.	92	9
201403	99	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	An employment threshold actually works against the promotion of maximum employment.	92	9
201403	100	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	The reason is that such a threshold is designed to give the FOMC an escape clause that lets it raise the fed funds rate even though inflation is under control simply because the unemployment rate has gotten too low or employment has gotten too high.	92	9
201403	101	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	For example, even if the inflation outlook is still at 1½ percent, if unemployment falls below, say, 6½ or 6 percent, that kind of threshold gives the FOMC an escape clause that lets it raise rates even though the inflation outlook is still too low.	92	9
201403	102	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I see adding such a threshold as being inconsistent with promoting maximum employment, and leaving it out also gets around a lot of problems of trying to define how we want to be thinking about the labor market.	92	9
201403	103	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	A third desirable feature of option 3 is that it appropriately allows for the possibility that the FOMC might choose to alter monetary policy in light of financial market developments either because we want to modulate risks or because we want to loosen financial market conditions.	92	9
201403	104	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think option 3 allows for both of those possibilities.	92	9
201403	105	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	Finally, I like both elements of paragraph 6, both the first and second sentence.	92	9
201403	106	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think the second sentence in particular reminds the public and markets that the FOMC is not returning to its historical patterns of behavior.	92	9
201403	107	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll close by echoing some of my opening remarks, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	108	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	We need forward guidance.	92	9
201403	109	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	We need forward guidance to make clear the ways in which our reaction function over the next few years will be different from what we used in the pre-crisis period.	92	9
201403	110	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	And we need forward guidance to make clear to the public that we are fully committed to keeping inflation close to 2 percent.	92	9
201403	111	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think option 3 does a good job on both dimensions.	92	9
201403	112	2014-03-04	confcall	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	113	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Thank you, President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201403	114	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	President Bullard.	92	9
201403	115	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair, and welcome to your new role.	92	9
201403	116	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	I’m looking forward to it, and I see that today we have lined up a mind-numbingly complex discussion for you to navigate, so I think that’s a good way for you to get started in your new role.	92	9
201403	117	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	As I suspect many of you did, I appreciated the staff memos on this topic.	92	9
201403	118	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	They really helped my thinking, and so did the comments on the staff memos from several presidents.	92	9
201403	119	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	I will organize my discussion here around three issues that are key from my perspective, which actually dovetail with what you said, Madam Chair, in your opening remarks.	92	9
201403	120	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	The first question is:  Does the Committee wish to take this opportunity to change out the real variable in the qualitative description of our reaction function from unemployment to employment or, possibly, to some other real variable?	92	9
201403	121	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	The second question is:  Is there a case to be made for making inflation the focus variable and deemphasizing any real variable?	92	9
201403	122	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	And the third question is;  How should the Committee reference financial-stability issues?	92	9
201403	123	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	I’m going to talk mainly about these three issues here and not too much about the fourth issue that you mentioned, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	124	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	I will comment on each of these questions in turn and, along the way, on some of the specific alternatives that were put forward in the memos.	92	9
201403	125	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	Let me just foreshadow my conclusion here.	92	9
201403	126	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	My comments are modestly negative on the options in front of the Committee.	92	9
201403	127	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	My bottom line is that, as a practical matter, the Committee should proceed with changes to the existing thresholds in a minimalist way, relying mostly on simple qualitative language.	92	9
201403	128	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	Attempts to do more in the current circumstances may cause more problems for the Committee than they solve.	92	9
201403	129	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	So let me reach that conclusion by discussing these three questions.	92	9
201403	130	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	Question 1 was, should the Committee take this opportunity to change out the key real variable in the existing qualitative description of our reaction function from unemployment to employment or, possibly, to some other real variable?	92	9
201403	131	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	Several of the alternatives suggest that the Committee no longer refer to unemployment and instead use “the projected shortfall of employment from its maximum sustainable level.”	92	9
201403	132	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	I have several comments on this particular language.	92	9
201403	133	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	First, I think we should keep in mind that it may be a minor shock to financial markets, households, and businesses that we are no longer referring explicitly to unemployment.	92	9
201403	134	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	I am not sure how markets will actually react to this.	92	9
201403	135	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	Many understand that we are unlikely to retain an explicit numerical threshold for unemployment as the economy nears more normal performance, but removing the reference completely may come as something of a surprise.	92	9
201403	136	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	Second, and perhaps more important, I think that considerable uncertainty may attend the very notion of an employment shortfall, as well as how the Committee intends to measure it.	92	9
201403	137	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	I think it would be very hard for financial markets to infer, based on what we have so far provided, what this phrase means for the date of liftoff.	92	9
201403	138	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	One reason for this is that employment projections are not in the SEP, so it seems like we would have to provide information outside the SEP process as to what might be considered an appropriate employment level.	92	9
201403	139	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	On balance, my judgment is that changing the reference from “unemployment” to “employment” in this way may create unwanted uncertainty around future FOMC intentions.	92	9
201403	140	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	This can, of course, be managed, but I think it may be quite difficult.	92	9
201403	141	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	This thought leads to the idea that the Committee might wish to use an alternative real variable.	92	9
201403	142	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	In a comment to the Committee, I suggested real output growth as that alternative variable.	92	9
201403	143	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	This has several advantages.	92	9
201403	144	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	First, unlike employment levels, which are not projected in the SEP, output growth is explicitly in the current SEP.	92	9
201403	145	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	This would give financial market participants and others in the economy a clear indication of what the Committee is expecting with respect to the key real variable mentioned in the statement.	92	9
201403	146	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	Second, in my view, a move toward more emphasis on output growth would move the Committee closer to traditional approaches to monetary policy as the economy continues to normalize.	92	9
201403	147	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	Referencing output growth also has the advantage, according to some studies, of avoiding monetary policy mistakes associated with level-based output or employment gaps.	92	9
201403	148	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	Athanasios Orphanides, in particular, is one author who has emphasized the pitfalls of gap mismeasurement and has suggested that output growth rates might provide better guidance for monetary policymakers.	92	9
201403	149	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	Some of you may worry that output growth today is relatively robust and, therefore, that this might suggest a more aggressive policy than the Committee intends.	92	9
201403	150	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	But, in my view, even with a reference in the statement to output growth as the key real variable, accommodative policy can still be rationalized because of today’s lower-than-expected inflation outcomes.	92	9
201403	151	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	I recognize, Madam Chair, that the Committee may not be willing to go in this direction at this time, but I think that if we want to change out unemployment for a new real variable, this might be a reasonable alternative—if not now, then perhaps at some point in the future.	92	9
201403	152	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	As you suggested, Madam Chair, this meeting is probably a good opportunity to at least consider possible alternatives, and that’s why I’m putting this one forward.	92	9
201403	153	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	This leads to my second question—namely, is there a case to be made for making inflation the focus variable and deemphasizing references to a real variable?	92	9
201403	154	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	This idea is contained in option 3 in the staff memo.	92	9
201403	155	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	I think there is a compelling case for going in this direction, which I would characterize as something closer to strict inflation targeting.	92	9
201403	156	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	This type of option would make clear that the Committee prefers real variables to be as robust as possible, provided that no serious inflation problem develops, and so does not require the Committee to put explicit limits on either levels or growth rates of real variables.	92	9
201403	157	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	Here I am unwittingly echoing some of the arguments that President Kocherlakota just made, particularly the idea that perhaps the Committee would not want to be putting such limits on real variables.	92	9
201403	158	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	After all, we want low unemployment, high employment, and so on.	92	9
201403	159	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	Surely this approach has much to commend it in terms of transparency, simplicity, and—	92	9
201403	160	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	I believe—consistency with what the Committee truly desires.	92	9
201403	161	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	Why should the Committee put limits on what it thinks may be realistic in terms of levels of unemployment, employment, or output growth when those limits are only educated guesses in any event?	92	9
201403	162	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	Would it not be better to react directly to evidence on inflation alone and simply set monetary policy accordingly?	92	9
201403	163	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	If this means that unemployment can move to very low levels, employment levels can be quite high, and output growth rates can soar, is this not all the better?	92	9
201403	164	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	The answer is that, indeed, it would be better, and so, in many ways, I think that promoting inflation as the key variable in our communication has much to recommend it.	92	9
201403	165	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	Still, my sense is that the Committee may not be ready to go in the strict inflation- targeting direction, and, in any event, I think option 3 as written does have one important problem.	92	9
201403	166	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	The problem, at least in my view, is that the text refers to projected inflation between one and two years ahead.	92	9
201403	167	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	I do not think it is credible for a central bank to project inflation over the medium term as being different from target, at least under ordinary circumstances.	92	9
201403	168	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	Indeed, as President Kocherlakota just stressed, the very criterion for optimal inflation-targeting policy in many models would be to set policy exactly so that inflation would be projected to equal the target over the medium term.	92	9
201403	169	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	Any projection that does not meet this criterion would normally be viewed as involving suboptimal policy, because the central bank could increase the amount of accommodation in a way that would make the projection equal to target over the medium term.	92	9
201403	170	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	Because of this difficulty, I see the adoption of the approach in option 3 as problematic from a communications perspective.	92	9
201403	171	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	If the Committee’s inflation forecast does not equal the target over the medium term, why doesn’t the Committee simply increase the amount of accommodation so that the inflation forecast does equal the target over the medium term?	92	9
201403	172	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	This brings me to question 3, which is how to handle references to financial stability in the statement.	92	9
201403	173	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	On this topic, I think a minimalist reference is appropriate.	92	9
201403	174	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	We need to show that the topic is understood by the Committee without overstating how much of a factor this may be in Committee decisionmaking.	92	9
201403	175	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	The “irrational exuberance” speech by former Chairman Greenspan was given in 1996, and since that time, the Committee has struggled with two extraordinary bubbles in the US economy.	92	9
201403	176	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	The debate on monetary policy and bubbles continues to rage.	92	9
201403	177	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	I do not think that anyone inside or outside the Fed has to be reminded that financial stability is an important concern in the making of monetary policy.	92	9
201403	178	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	If we make a minimal reference to financial stability, that will be sufficient to remind everyone that we are fully cognizant of this issue.	92	9
201403	179	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	The considerations I have emphasized suggest that option 5, with its more minimalist approach to changing the language in the Committee’s forward guidance paragraph, is most likely to succeed in delivering the continuity sought by the Committee in contemplating this change of language.	92	9
201403	180	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	This approach simply removes the thresholds and replaces the previous text with references to a wide variety of indicators and a notion of complete recovery in labor markets in the future.	92	9
201403	181	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	This last criterion will cause some uncertainty as to its meaning but at the same time suggest that a judgment call will have to be made by the Committee based on a wide variety of factors.	92	9
201403	182	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	This is a better approach for the time being and, in my view, moves the Committee somewhat closer to normal monetary policy.	92	9
201403	183	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	An oblique reference to financial stability is included through the phrase “readings on financial developments.”	92	9
201403	184	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	On balance, then, Madam Chair, I prefer option 5 of the options presented to the Committee for its use of mostly qualitative language to replace our existing thresholds on unemployment and inflation.	92	9
201403	185	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	The other options suffer from key drawbacks that I think would introduce unwanted uncertainty into financial markets’ understanding of Committee intentions.	92	9
201403	186	2014-03-04	confcall	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	187	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Thank you, President Bullard.	92	9
201403	188	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	92	9
201403	189	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	190	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	It is a pleasure to be serving in the first meeting in your official capacity.	92	9
201403	191	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201403	192	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	My hope is that the forward guidance language we choose does the following.	92	9
201403	193	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	First, as in the memo on the different options for forward guidance, I believe the language should have a neutral effect on expectations.	92	9
201403	194	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	Expectations seem appropriately aligned with the Committee’s thinking at this time.	92	9
201403	195	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	Given the weakness in incoming data, I would certainly not want the language to tighten financial conditions.	92	9
201403	196	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	Second, given the market focus on calendar dates, the language needs to avoid adding to uncertainty around the implications for our current thinking on the likely liftoff date.	92	9
201403	197	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	This is achieved by the statement that the current target range for the federal funds rate will be maintained “for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends.”	92	9
201403	198	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	It is tied to our actions—namely, the tapering program.	92	9
201403	199	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	Since the tapering program can be slowed down or sped up, it has flexibility.	92	9
201403	200	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	However, the modal interpretation of this language will be that liftoff would likely occur in the latter half of 2015.	92	9
201403	201	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	Third, the language should be as simple as possible.	92	9
201403	202	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	The difference between purchases and liftoff and between triggers and thresholds has been surprisingly difficult to communicate, as witnessed both by the rise in short-term rates that followed the announcement of possible tapering in the middle of last year and by the confusion that persists around the 6½ percent threshold.	92	9
201403	203	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	In my view, the option that gets closest to these objectives is option 2.	92	9
201403	204	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	It is designed to have a neutral effect on expectations, provides clarity on likely liftoff, and has a relatively simple construction.	92	9
201403	205	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	However, I think it should be simplified further.	92	9
201403	206	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	For option 2, paragraph 5, I would substitute the first area highlighted in blue with “the Committee will consider the projected pace at which labor markets are normalizing and the projected pace at which inflation returns to the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent.	92	9
201403	207	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	In assessing the improvement in labor market conditions, the Committee will consider a broad range of indicators.”	92	9
201403	208	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	The concept of normalizing seems more consistent with the concept of the long-run unemployment forecast provided in the SEP, although normalizing would incorporate more than just the unemployment rate.	92	9
201403	209	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	For option 2, paragraph 5, I would substitute the second area highlighted in blue with “at least as long as labor market conditions are in the process of normalizing, inflation projected between one and two years ahead does not significantly exceed 2 percent, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.”	92	9
201403	210	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	This refers back to returning to normalized labor markets.	92	9
201403	211	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	It also replaces language that sounds like an inflation ceiling, “does not exceed 2 percent,” with “does not significantly exceed 2 percent.”	92	9
201403	212	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	In terms of the other questions, I would not include language on financial developments at this time.	92	9
201403	213	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	I do not believe we have clarity or consensus on this issue yet, and we probably need to have much more discussion on that topic.	92	9
201403	214	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	I am comfortable with paragraph 6 in options 1 through 3, and I would highlight one concern, which is that some of the SEP submissions may not be consistent with the guidance we are providing.	92	9
201403	215	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	This is likely to provide less clarity than desirable, and it highlights more work that needs to be done on the SEP.	92	9
201403	216	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	Ideally, how we report the SEP should be as consistent as possible with any guidance provided in the statement.	92	9
201403	217	2014-03-04	confcall	ROSENGREN	Thank you very much, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	218	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Thank you, President Rosengren.	92	9
201403	219	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	92	9
201403	220	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	221	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	I would like to comment on broad communications tactics as regards forward guidance as well as the substance of the statement.	92	9
201403	222	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	I will respond to some of the questions as I proceed.	92	9
201403	223	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	First, I would caution against going too far in reliance on the statement alone as our tool to transmit guidance.	92	9
201403	224	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	A point I’ve made before in Committee meetings is that the Committee is designed to arrive at a common decision, not necessarily a uniformly held rationale for decisions.	92	9
201403	225	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	So I prefer an approach to crafting the statement that treats it as a vehicle for communicating a framework, or a general statement, for our determination of the path of policy.	92	9
201403	226	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	I see the statement as a device for implementing forward guidance as having a tactical role within a set of communications alternatives, each with its own array of possible tactical uses.	92	9
201403	227	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	These other communications devices are the Chair’s press conference, the SEPs, the minutes, the Chair’s speeches and testimony, our collective speaking opportunities, and, maybe, other devices to be developed.	92	9
201403	228	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	The use of these alternative communications vehicles can convey more information, appropriately qualified details, and general color or can draw attention to quantification in the SEP of elements of the statement.	92	9
201403	229	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	Proper governance, however, is a legitimate concern.	92	9
201403	230	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	The principle of Committee ratification of the content of formal communications requires, it seems to me, a disciplined process around use of some of the alternative communications devices.	92	9
201403	231	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	As we move ahead to refine our communications strategy, I’d like to see us wrestle in good time with how to do all of this and deal with communications as a package.	92	9
201403	232	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	I can envision a checklist of sorts for composing and updating a statement to convey a framework for policy decisions.	92	9
201403	233	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	It might include elements such as an assessment of progress toward qualitative goals, a projection of progress over a time horizon, a reference to a broad set of indicators, and critical considerations in setting or changing policies.	92	9
201403	234	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	Of the five options presented, option 5 comes closest to what I have in mind.	92	9
201403	235	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	I think it adequately covers the financial developments consideration, and if we view financial stability as a distinct consideration, I would not be averse to language like that in option 4 on financial stability per se.	92	9
201403	236	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	A statement that serves to communicate a framework would almost of necessity rely on qualitative measures of economic conditionality.	92	9
201403	237	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	Reliance in the statement on qualitative measures allows, in my mind, for interpretation elsewhere, particularly in press conferences.	92	9
201403	238	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	I would, therefore, drop the use of thresholds, targets, or triggers.	92	9
201403	239	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	I do not favor linking the timing of the first increase of the federal funds rate to the asset purchase program.	92	9
201403	240	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	I view the wind- down as likely to continue on the current track unless the economy deteriorates markedly.	92	9
201403	241	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	This makes the terminal point of asset purchases fairly predictable.	92	9
201403	242	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	Linking liftoff to the end of the asset purchase program introduces a date feature that I believe the Committee is trying to avoid.	92	9
201403	243	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	I also do not favor introducing an inflation floor, at least not at this time.	92	9
201403	244	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	And I do not think it’s necessary yet to introduce additional guidance on the path of the policy rate post-liftoff.	92	9
201403	245	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	The conditions for liftoff are still down the road, and I would prefer to assess and communicate our exit strategy with a clearer view of what conditions are likely to be at that time.	92	9
201403	246	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	I see potential for misinterpretation of how near the liftoff date might be, so I would hold fire on additional post-liftoff guidance at this time.	92	9
201403	247	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	However, I do not particularly object to the existing post-liftoff language.	92	9
201403	248	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	Those are my comments.	92	9
201403	249	2014-03-04	confcall	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	250	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Thank you, President Lockhart.	92	9
201403	251	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	President Fisher.	92	9
201403	252	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	Well, first, Madam Chair, congratulations and condolences.	92	9
201403	253	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	I take both.	92	9
201403	254	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201403	255	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	Let me just project ahead.	92	9
201403	256	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	I am going to conclude pretty much along the same lines as President Bullard and President Lockhart, with the suggestion of adopting a minimalist approach for the present time—that is, option 5.	92	9
201403	257	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	I suggest that our changes to the statement be minimalist and a little bit more qualitative, and at the same time maintain respect for the 2 percent longer-term inflation goal that we established under your predecessor.	92	9
201403	258	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	In considering all of this, I am very mindful of the fact that, first, we really don’t know— at least, I don’t believe we can successfully articulate with precision—what a maximum sustainable level of employment or of output growth relative to long-term trend actually is.	92	9
201403	259	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	Second, I wonder and would like to discuss with the staff—not now, but later—what our historical record of success is with projecting employment one to two years forward, or even inflation, for that matter.	92	9
201403	260	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	And then, third, I am mindful of the fact that it is very difficult to define financial stability.	92	9
201403	261	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	I suspect that among us we would have different definitions.	92	9
201403	262	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	For example, would financial instability involve a significant correction in equity markets, or would it be a financial development that would upset the development of the real economy?	92	9
201403	263	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	Against that background, I am going to tackle the questions that the staff proposed in the most recent memo, more or less in reverse order.	92	9
201403	264	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	I wish to make the following points and then to make a suggestion, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	265	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	To begin, I believe that it would be ideal for the Committee to decide on a strategy for conducting post-liftoff monetary policy and also on a plan for communicating that strategy to the public—through statements but also through our speeches, and particularly through your press conferences—either before or in conjunction with the new forward guidance on liftoff.	92	9
201403	266	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	I think this is a sensible way to proceed for two reasons.	92	9
201403	267	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	First, private-sector expectations concerning the post-liftoff conduct of policy influence current demand and, hence, the timing of liftoff.	92	9
201403	268	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	And, second, the appropriate economic criteria for removing accommodation in the post-liftoff period logically determine the appropriate criteria for liftoff.	92	9
201403	269	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	I think a statement of broad principles that merely recites the dual mandate or repeats what is said in the Committee’s Statement on Longer-run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy doesn’t contribute much, and it actually adds to what I consider to be an already overly long FOMC statement.	92	9
201403	270	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	With regard to a point made by President Kocherlakota about paragraph 6 in options 1 through 3 and paragraph 7 in option 4, that second sentence is the one that I have trouble with.	92	9
201403	271	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	It states that short-term interest rates are likely to remain unusually low for a time even after employment and inflation return to mandate-consistent levels.	92	9
201403	272	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	Unless we have a consensus as to why short-term rates are likely to remain unusually low, and a consensus that these reasons are important, I don’t think that sentence should be included, and I wouldn’t include the first sentence in paragraph 6.	92	9
201403	273	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	As to my own preferences on post-liftoff forward guidance, I spelled them out in a memo that I sent around to our colleagues.	92	9
201403	274	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	I would prefer a statement along the following lines—I’m just going to repeat what I wrote: “The Committee intends to adjust its policy instruments so as to hold projections of average PCE inflation over the coming three to five years, and beyond, as nearly as possible constant at 2 percent.	92	9
201403	275	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	Realized inflation of a rate modestly higher than 2 percent is acceptable if accompanied by weaker-than-previously-projected real economic activity, and realized inflation at a rate modestly lower than 2 percent is acceptable if accompanied by stronger-than-previously-projected real economic activity.	92	9
201403	276	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	The Committee believes that monetary policy conducted according to these principles will help households and firms plan their purchases and investments and manage their financial obligations in a manner that keeps employment near its maximum sustainable level.”	92	9
201403	277	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	I do believe that financial developments, if not financial stability per se, certainly need to be mentioned in a policy consideration.	92	9
201403	278	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	And I conclude overall, with that background, that we are going to need some additional time to tackle thoughtfully and thoroughly the issues associated with post-liftoff guidance.	92	9
201403	279	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	So for now I’d prefer a statement that meets the following criteria.	92	9
201403	280	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	First, it does no harm.	92	9
201403	281	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	Second, it keeps the door open to my preferred form of post- liftoff guidance—of course, this is my preference.	92	9
201403	282	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	And, third, except as necessary to accomplish those first two points, it keeps close to the existing language until we get this hammered out a little bit more thoroughly than I suspect we are able to do in this phone call.	92	9
201403	283	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	So I come down to option 5.	92	9
201403	284	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	I would make a slight amendment to option 5, Madam Chair, and that is in the second section, which begins with “The Committee anticipates.”	92	9
201403	285	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	I’m just going to read what I would suggest here: “The Committee anticipates, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate at least as long as complete recovery in the labor market appears to be more than a year away, and projected inflation is not above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal”—in other words, I would strike the word “especially.”	92	9
201403	286	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	Those are my changes to that sentence.	92	9
201403	287	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	The key operative changes are inserting “and,” striking “especially if,” striking “continues to run below,” and inserting “is not above.”	92	9
201403	288	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	In keeping with what I think President Lockhart said, I would get rid of the next sentence because it ties liftoff of the federal funds rate to the asset purchase program, and I think President Lockhart made a very good point there.	92	9
201403	289	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	I don’t think that sentence is necessary.	92	9
201403	290	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	And then I would basically leave the last sentence that’s now in blue by itself.	92	9
201403	291	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	So those are the changes that I would suggest we make.	92	9
201403	292	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	Certainly, that’s as much as I could support at this juncture.	92	9
201403	293	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	I think it does provide us a bridge.	92	9
201403	294	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	It’s qualitative.	92	9
201403	295	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	It maintains respect for our 2 percent longer-term inflation goal.	92	9
201403	296	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	And it takes away specific date guidance and also removes the numerical reference to unemployment.	92	9
201403	297	2014-03-04	confcall	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	298	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	President Williams.	92	9
201403	299	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	300	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	I actually find myself in complete agreement with the comments of President Rosengren.	92	9
201403	301	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	Nevertheless, I will make my own comments, and I have my own version of paragraph 5, which is similar in spirit to President Rosengren’s comments but, I think, is something that may be even a little simpler.	92	9
201403	302	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	As we move from the extraordinary times of the past several years to more ordinary times, our policy statements and forward guidance should move away from numeric thresholds, triggers, and floors, as many people have already mentioned.	92	9
201403	303	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	Instead, the statement should provide a more qualitative explanation of our policy reaction function in the context of the economic situation and our goals.	92	9
201403	304	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	Over time, the statement should become shorter and should not try to cover all possible issues and contingencies.	92	9
201403	305	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	In considering the qualitative versus quantitative guidance, I think of the analogy of giving someone instructions on how to get to Disneyland from Northern California—say, from Sacramento.	92	9
201403	306	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	And the first part of it is, get on I−5, go south for several hours, and just keep going.	92	9
201403	307	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	That’s what I see as our threshold language of a 6½ percent unemployment rate, and I think that served us very well.	92	9
201403	308	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	Eventually, you start going over the Grapevine, you come into Los Angeles, and you run into the massive traffic there, road closures, and situations that you did not expect.	92	9
201403	309	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	Obviously, there you have to use judgment, and you have to adapt to a change in circumstances.	92	9
201403	310	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	So any attempt to explain to somebody how you navigate through an area like Los Angeles in a predetermined way is going to fail.	92	9
201403	311	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	I think that, as we’ve gotten closer to our goals, we are facing a choice to either say, “Well, keep going on I−5 at full speed”—the danger with that is, you end up in Mexico—or try to explain all of the contingencies and the factors and the thresholds that you should be following.	92	9
201403	312	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	And it’s better to try to provide more of the framework, the reaction function, and not try to explain all of the conditions and contingencies.	92	9
201403	313	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	I see three primary goals of the March FOMC statement:  first, to reaffirm the public’s understanding of our policy approach and our plans—that is, keep policy expectations basically where they are today; second, to provide a bridge between the end of our asset purchase program and the date of funds rate liftoff; and, third, to provide a general contour of how we expect to see policy in the post-liftoff period.	92	9
201403	314	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	Many of the proposals in the staff memo, in my view, try to do too much, distracting attention from these three basic goals.	92	9
201403	315	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	I think we can be clearer and more effective if we keep the statement language more similar to that of January but, at the same time, importantly, anchor interest rate expectations appropriately.	92	9
201403	316	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	Toward this end, I have my own four-sentence version of paragraph 5, which I will read, and it goes like this:  “To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends.	92	9
201403	317	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	In determining how long to maintain the current range of 0 to ¼ percent for the fed funds rate, the Committee will consider actual and expected future progress of unemployment and inflation toward their mandate-consistent levels.	92	9
201403	318	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including various measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.	92	9
201403	319	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	The Committee currently anticipates it will be appropriate to maintain the current range for the federal funds rate until significant further progress toward its goals is achieved, provided that longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored and risks to financial stability remain contained.”	92	9
201403	320	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	I am also comfortable with including paragraph 6.	92	9
201403	321	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	This approach anchors interest rate expectations in three ways.	92	9
201403	322	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	First, it retains and highlights the “considerable time after the asset purchase program ends” phrasing, which I think is important.	92	9
201403	323	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	Second, it states that we will maintain the funds rate at its current level until significant further progress toward our goals is achieved, and, of course, it makes reference to both of our goals.	92	9
201403	324	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	And, third, the inclusion of paragraph 6 should help anchor expectations about the path after liftoff.	92	9
201403	325	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	Now, regarding the questions in the staff memo, paragraphs 2 to 4 of the FOMC statement already discuss the general principles of our approach to policy, so we don’t really need to restate the general approach in paragraph 5, in my view.	92	9
201403	326	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	I would also mention at that point that it’s important in thinking about paragraph 5 to reread paragraphs 2 through 4.	92	9
201403	327	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	There is a lot of discussion there about objectives or appropriate stance of policy, and, in thinking about paragraph 5, you want to realize that that whole set-up is around asset purchases.	92	9
201403	328	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	So, in my view, you want to start paragraph 5 with a reference to the end of asset purchases.	92	9
201403	329	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	With respect to financial developments, I think the current discussion in the FOMC statement, the very brief mention of it, is appropriate and encompasses consideration of financial-stability issues.	92	9
201403	330	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	And, to repeat a comment that has already been made, we want to be careful to avoid the appearance that we have a particular target for asset prices in mind.	92	9
201403	331	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	Finally, to even better anchor policy expectations during this transition period, we could start publishing the median of the SEP forecasts for the current set of voters on the Committee in addition to what we currently publish.	92	9
201403	332	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	In my view, this approach would preserve the strengths of presenting the full set of SEP submissions, which gives you the full range of views of all of the 19 participants but, importantly, would give a clearer view of the center of the Committee, which would provide hard numbers to reinforce the message in the statement.	92	9
201403	333	2014-03-04	confcall	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	92	9
201403	334	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Thank you, President Williams.	92	9
201403	335	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	President Evans.	92	9
201403	336	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	337	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	The economic and global environments continue to call for strongly accommodative monetary policy in the United States.	92	9
201403	338	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	In this context, it has been extremely important that the public and financial markets understand that the funds rate would remain at zero for a long time.	92	9
201403	339	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	Our threshold forward guidance has worked well to solidify the public’s understanding on this dimension, and the economic conditionality of our guidance has been pretty well understood.	92	9
201403	340	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	Frankly, this has been quite successful to date.	92	9
201403	341	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	Furthermore, as noted by the staff, market expectations currently appear well aligned with the FOMC views on how policy is likely to evolve, and I agree with the principle that we don’t want our new statement to alter that view.	92	9
201403	342	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	So I am in favor of maintaining a form of forward guidance in the statement.	92	9
201403	343	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	It simply is key for maintaining the necessary high degree of monetary accommodation as we go forward.	92	9
201403	344	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	Any changes to the forward guidance in our FOMC statement should be consistent with a number of uncontroversial key elements.	92	9
201403	345	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	First, our guidance should clearly demonstrate fidelity to our January 2012 Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.	92	9
201403	346	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	We should be expressing our clear intention to meet our dual-mandate goals in a timely and balanced fashion.	92	9
201403	347	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	And we should repeatedly ask if our policy formulation is consistent with this important formulation.	92	9
201403	348	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	This takes me to the second element.	92	9
201403	349	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	We should mention both sides of our dual mandate prominently in the guidance—both the real side and inflation.	92	9
201403	350	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	Third, central bankers, in general, have difficulty acknowledging that an inflation objective should be evaluated symmetrically around its long-run goal.	92	9
201403	351	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	I agree with the comments of President Kocherlakota on this.	92	9
201403	352	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	Our policy commentary should be construed with sufficient care to be convincing to the public that 2 percent is not a ceiling for inflation.	92	9
201403	353	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	Fourth, the overall stance of monetary policy is characterized by both the current settings and the entire expected path for our policy tools.	92	9
201403	354	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	This means that our guidance should include commentary that adequately captures our future policy intentions for the funds rate after its initial liftoff from zero.	92	9
201403	355	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	With these elements in mind, and considering the history of the Committee’s discussions on the subject of forward guidance, I’m most drawn to option 5, which contains the smallest changes to the January forward guidance.	92	9
201403	356	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	I find its conditional guidance for not lifting rates, as long as projected inflation is under 2 percent, to be workable and acceptable.	92	9
201403	357	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	With regard to the employment side of the mandate, I personally like using highly explicit conditional criteria in our forward guidance.	92	9
201403	358	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	However, I know that reducing the unemployment threshold is off the table.	92	9
201403	359	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	I also recognize that the somewhat unusual behavior of the unemployment rate of late suggests that it might not be the best marker to use today.	92	9
201403	360	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	Circumstances certainly are different than when we brought it into the statement in the fall of 2012.	92	9
201403	361	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	The other options seem to have more challenges, in my opinion.	92	9
201403	362	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	In the abstract, I am drawn to the threshold for the level of employment in option 2 that is associated with maximum employment.	92	9
201403	363	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	However, I don’t have a lot of confidence that we’re going to be able to operationalize it well.	92	9
201403	364	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	If anyone has more imagination than I do on how to operationalize this, then I’d be interested in marrying it with the explicit inflation objective threshold in option 3.	92	9
201403	365	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	But, in my opinion, option 3 alone lacks sufficient real-side conditionality.	92	9
201403	366	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	That’s still important.	92	9
201403	367	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	I doubt that inflation is going to increase very quickly, and I don’t think it’s going to increase to 2 percent very soon.	92	9
201403	368	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	But if it did and the unemployment rate was at 6½ percent, or just a little bit above, I think a balanced approach calls for patience in adjusting our funds rate, and having both of them in the forward guidance is helpful in that regard.	92	9
201403	369	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	So I tend to prefer option 5.	92	9
201403	370	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	With some very small modifications, I think it could be reasonably workable.	92	9
201403	371	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	The most important attribute in this formulation, for me, is the description of the labor market guideline—that is, “at least as long as complete recovery in the labor market appears to be more than a year away.”	92	9
201403	372	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	This is clever and is broadly consistent with many ways one might want to formulate a labor market threshold.	92	9
201403	373	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	For example, if the unemployment rate fell to 6 percent, or even a little bit below that, I might expect that 5½ percent unemployment is in reach within a year—maybe.	92	9
201403	374	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	It gets closer to my policy intention, as I would expect it to be formulated in line with the January 2012 longer-run goals statement.	92	9
201403	375	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	It also allows for a wide array of labor market data to be included in the conditionality test—employment levels, employment-to-population ratios and labor force participation rates relative to trends, and hiring and quits developments.	92	9
201403	376	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	And the statement could be modified to mention, a little bit more than it does currently, that we will consider a broad array of such indicators.	92	9
201403	377	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	Some other improvement opportunities are the following:  The option should add the horizon for the inflation projections to be one to two years ahead, as in the other options.	92	9
201403	378	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	And President Rosengren had a suggestion that this language could be adjusted a little bit to mention that, as long as inflation didn’t “significantly exceed 2 percent”—I think that would be helpful.	92	9
201403	379	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	That would also demonstrate that our 2 percent longer-run inflation objective is not a ceiling.	92	9
201403	380	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	And the option should append mention of our taking account of financial developments and their implications for attaining the Committee’s dual-mandate objectives, as in the last sentence of option 3, paragraph 5.	92	9
201403	381	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	Lastly, a description of the post-liftoff path for short-term interest rates could be enhanced in one of the various paragraph 6 options, as in paragraph 6 of option 3—that fits nicely.	92	9
201403	382	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	Our  SEP forecasts for 2016 have us at our mandate goals, and the funds rate is about 2 percent.	92	9
201403	383	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	That’s going to be challenging for the public and financial market participants.	92	9
201403	384	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	I think when you go out and talk to people, anybody who is knowledgeable and is aware of that will ask what we mean by that.	92	9
201403	385	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	This paragraph helps address that, and I would support its inclusion.	92	9
201403	386	2014-03-04	confcall	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	387	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Thank you, President Evans.	92	9
201403	388	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Vice President Weinberg, who is substituting for President Lacker.	92	9
201403	389	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	390	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	It’s clearly an opportune and appropriate time to modify forward guidance, given the approaching 6½ percent unemployment threshold.	92	9
201403	391	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	At the moment, there doesn’t seem to be much of a case for trying to significantly shift market expectations for the path of short-term interest rates, as market expectations appear to be pretty well aligned with the Committee’s center of gravity as displayed in the SEP, for example.	92	9
201403	392	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	One of the key questions in thinking about what to communicate is how to describe conditions that would lead to an initial interest rate increase.	92	9
201403	393	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	The Committee has really not spent much time discussing the economic conditions that, for each participant, would likely trigger wanting to raise rates for the first time.	92	9
201403	394	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	On this, there is probably a wide range of views around the table.	92	9
201403	395	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	Accordingly, anything more than a fairly minimalist approach could be premature at this point.	92	9
201403	396	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	Trying to articulate something more precise involves implicitly staking out the conceptual framework, and more discussions about the framework might be useful before doing so.	92	9
201403	397	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	Our preference would be for a streamlined version of option 5 in which the third and fourth sentences are combined to read as follows: “The Committee anticipates, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends.”	92	9
201403	398	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	This eliminates the clause “at least as long as complete recovery in the labor market appears to be more than a year away, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal.”	92	9
201403	399	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	You could call this a “hyper-minimalist approach.”	92	9
201403	400	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	While the “complete recovery” language in option 5 is intentionally less specific, and that is appealing in some regards, I think that people seeing that language are naturally going to want to map it to a specific unemployment rate or an employment-to-population ratio or some other metric.	92	9
201403	401	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	Using a phrase like “complete recovery” or “maximum sustainable level of employment” in this context seems to go beyond the Committee’s consensus statement of 2012, which states that “the maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors” and which emphasizes its variability.	92	9
201403	402	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	Granted, the consensus statement goes on to cite participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, but it never actually equates that concept with the maximum level of employment.	92	9
201403	403	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	In the current context, pivoting from an unemployment rate threshold to a formulation that refers to “maximum sustainable level of employment” risks looking opportunistic, as if the Committee is responding to the fall in the unemployment rate by shifting to other labor market indicators.	92	9
201403	404	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	Finally, we’re against including a reference to financial-stability concerns or financial market developments.	92	9
201403	405	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	Aside from a concern for financial stability, it’s not clear on what basis one would want to single out for special consideration the implication of financial market developments for our goals, compared with the full array of factors taken into consideration.	92	9
201403	406	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	Further, the notion of highlighting concerns about financial stability in a monetary policy context creates some difficulties.	92	9
201403	407	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	Would people conclude that the Committee would compromise on employment and inflation objectives for the sake of financial stability?	92	9
201403	408	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	Or would they conclude that large asset price increases would induce tighter monetary policy, or that large asset price declines would induce easier policy?	92	9
201403	409	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	Might they conclude that the Committee would ease policy in response to distress at one or more large financial institutions?	92	9
201403	410	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	Without a shared understanding of how financial market developments ought to enter into the monetary policy reaction function, communicating to the public about the role of financial-stability considerations could create more problems than it solves.	92	9
201403	411	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	Here again, further deliberations by the Committee on the relevant conceptual framework could be fruitful before expanding the dimensions of Committee communications further.	92	9
201403	412	2014-03-04	confcall	WEINBERG	Thank you.	92	9
201403	413	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	92	9
201403	414	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	President Pianalto.	92	9
201403	415	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	416	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	And I can’t tell you how delighted I am to use those words—“Madam Chair.”	92	9
201403	417	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	I, too, am pleased to be serving under your leadership, although it will be only for a few more months—but thank you.	92	9
201403	418	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Thanks.	92	9
201403	419	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	As today’s discussion demonstrates, the communication challenges before us are significant.	92	9
201403	420	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	In my view, we face two broad challenges.	92	9
201403	421	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	The first, and more pressing, challenge is communicating the conditions that will most likely lead to liftoff for the federal funds rate.	92	9
201403	422	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	The second is communicating the likely pace of adjustment after liftoff.	92	9
201403	423	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	The first challenge is simpler to address than the second, although I’m not sure, after today’s conversation, that it’s going to be quite that simple.	92	9
201403	424	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	But I do believe that our experiences, first with the date-based guidance and then with the unemployment thresholds for the fed funds rate liftoff, highlight the importance of proceeding cautiously with very broad changes to our forward guidance.	92	9
201403	425	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	For now, I suggest that the Committee focus on addressing the first challenge—that is, the timing of liftoff—and then take some time over the spring and summer to study and discuss the efficacy of approaches to guidance on the pace of adjustment after liftoff.	92	9
201403	426	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	To address the communications challenges around liftoff, in my view, it would be most effective to revise the forward guidance to simply refer to labor market conditions in broad terms and to establish an explicit inflation floor.	92	9
201403	427	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	In my economic outlook, the labor market will continue to improve gradually, and the inflation forecast is likely to be the key driver in the timing of liftoff.	92	9
201403	428	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	In addition, since the current statement language has an inflation ceiling and other wording that comes close to an inflation floor, the formal establishment of an inflation floor wouldn’t represent a large change in guidance or a large change in our approach.	92	9
201403	429	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	Of the forward-guidance options circulated to the Committee, I view option 5 as the best starting point because it provides continuity with the current statement and includes the full range of factors that the Committee will consider in deciding on liftoff.	92	9
201403	430	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	However, I believe that the reference in option 5 to “at least as long as complete recovery in the labor market appears to be more than a year away” could prove to be problematic.	92	9
201403	431	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	One reason that it could be problematic is that the Committee is likely to have difficulty in clearly defining a complete recovery in labor markets, just as we had some trouble with the guidance around the LSAP program that referred to a simpler notion of substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.	92	9
201403	432	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	A second reason that it might be problematic is that such guidance would imply that the Committee can accurately predict complete recovery in the labor market at least one year in advance, even though the simpler exercise of forecasting the unemployment rate over the last two years has been difficult.	92	9
201403	433	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	And a third reason is that we haven’t had the time for careful study of the efficacy of waiting to raise rates until just one year before the labor market recovery is complete.	92	9
201403	434	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	For these reasons, I would prefer a version of option 5 modified to drop the reference to complete recovery in labor markets, and, in place of that language, I would insert the inflation floor language that’s provided in the second sentence of option 3.	92	9
201403	435	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	The inflation forecast will capture many of the factors that are likely to determine liftoff, but they are more difficult to spell out in simple terms in the forward guidance.	92	9
201403	436	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	When you look at the December SEP, it suggests that using a 2 percent inflation floor would also be generally consistent with the Committee participants’ forecasts and policy views.	92	9
201403	437	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	Based on the limited information available in the December SEP, it looks as though the liftoff for many participants was being driven more by an inflation forecast than by the unemployment threshold.	92	9
201403	438	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	So, with those general comments, let me very quickly turn to the questions that were posed to the Committee.	92	9
201403	439	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	Regarding whether to include a general statement on policy decisions, I believe that it would be helpful to include the guidance that is provided in the second and the last sentences of option 5.	92	9
201403	440	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	I think any further general statement that the Committee wishes to make would best be presented in the annual Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.	92	9
201403	441	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	As for linking liftoff to LSAPs, I believe that the statement language should preserve the guidance that’s provided in the current statement.	92	9
201403	442	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	To do otherwise might suggest a shift in our policy position.	92	9
201403	443	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	Regarding thresholds, triggers, and floors, as I just stated, I would prefer forward guidance that includes an inflation floor.	92	9
201403	444	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	In response to the second question, I believe that it is best to include financial developments or financial stability in the broader list of indicators that the Committee will be monitoring to decide on liftoff.	92	9
201403	445	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	And, in my view, the wording in option 5 is appropriate.	92	9
201403	446	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	In response to the third question, at this point, with liftoff likely to be some way off, market expectations seem to reflect an anticipation of gradual changes in the fed funds rate target after liftoff.	92	9
201403	447	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	So, at least for now, I don’t believe it’s necessary to add more-explicit language that could, over time, prove to require changes.	92	9
201403	448	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	Instead, as I’ve indicated, I’d prefer to focus now on addressing the challenges of liftoff communications and to use an inflation floor to address that issue.	92	9
201403	449	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	The Committee can take time again over the spring and summer to study and discuss the efficacy of approaches to guidance on the pace of adjustment after liftoff.	92	9
201403	450	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	At this time, in response to question 4, I don’t have any other changes to suggest.	92	9
201403	451	2014-03-04	confcall	PIANALTO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	452	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Thank you, President Pianalto.	92	9
201403	453	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	President George.	92	9
201403	454	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	455	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	Like others, I’ve appreciated the opportunity to discuss the Committee’s forward guidance ahead of our March 18 meeting, and I, too, thank the staff for teeing up the options that we’re discussing today.	92	9
201403	456	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	This exercise highlights, I think, the significant communications challenge that we face in the transition from unconventional aspects of our policy.	92	9
201403	457	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	So, as I thought about the various options and the related implications and consequences, I gravitated to minimal changes at this point, continuing to simplify and clarify where possible rather than introducing new benchmarks or thresholds to describe the Committee’s sense of the future path of short-term rates.	92	9
201403	458	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	To that end, I would support language along the lines of option 5 for our March statement, including the alternative drafted by President Plosser and sent out earlier, while leaning on other communications vehicles to elaborate.	92	9
201403	459	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	And I want to also join in with those who have expressed concern within option 5 about that language of “complete recovery.”	92	9
201403	460	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	I think that will pose some challenges in explaining what we mean by that.	92	9
201403	461	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	In terms of the first and third questions, I would offer two thoughts on forward guidance relative to our existing strategy statement and the SEP.	92	9
201403	462	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	I continue to think the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy provides a good depiction of the Committee’s approach to its policy decisions.	92	9
201403	463	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	The statement is clear, I think, that we account for deviations of inflation from its long-run goal and deviations of employment from our assessment of its maximum level while considering risk to the financial system.	92	9
201403	464	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	It also explains the balanced approach we intend to pursue when these objectives are not complementary and describes that we account for the balance of risk when setting policy.	92	9
201403	465	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	So this statement is an important complement to forward guidance, and I would not muddy future FOMC statements with further attempts to explain our approach to monetary strategy, since it’s likely to be either redundant or confusing.	92	9
201403	466	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	In addition to leaning on our existing strategy statement, we should not underweight the value of the SEP in providing guidance on the path of rates after liftoff.	92	9
201403	467	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	The SEP, despite its noted shortcomings, offers an ongoing and consistent framework that currently communicates the intention of Committee participants to keep the funds rate at an unusually low level to support the economy.	92	9
201403	468	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	Unlike static dates or thresholds or other quantifications, which can move in unpredictable ways that don’t always align well with our policy intentions, the rate projections in the SEP over time will move in response to economic developments, providing information on how policy will vary with economic conditions after liftoff.	92	9
201403	469	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	For this reason, I continue to believe that we could leverage the existing communication provided by the SEP to convey our future intentions by moving median projections of the funds rate into the FOMC statement.	92	9
201403	470	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	One issue, of course, that’s been raised is whether the median should reflect all participants or only voting members.	92	9
201403	471	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	And because the submissions today are not identified, I’m not sure whether this is an issue just in theory or in reality.	92	9
201403	472	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	But a reference by the FOMC to the SEP would not be without precedent.	92	9
201403	473	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	SEP medians are referenced today in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, and they’re visibly attached to and described as part of the FOMC minutes at each submission.	92	9
201403	474	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	Of course, in addition to these two vehicles, the press conferences and FOMC minutes can assist importantly with the heavy lifting of communicating our policy intentions.	92	9
201403	475	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	In terms of question 2, on a more prominent role for financial developments, I tend to think that our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy already references this.	92	9
201403	476	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	But I could support including a sentence along the lines of that offered in option 4.	92	9
201403	477	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	And, finally, I’ll conclude by saying that, in the longer term, I look forward to moving in the direction of statements like those that the staff shared from the Bank of England, whereby we can shift from some of our lengthy, complex statements to something more succinct and straightforward as we communicate our policy.	92	9
201403	478	2014-03-04	confcall	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	479	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Thank you, President George.	92	9
201403	480	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	92	9
201403	481	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	482	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	I’ll make a few comments here.	92	9
201403	483	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	First—and I think this picks up on a theme that Dennis introduced, and several people have echoed it since then—I do believe that, particularly as we pass the 6.5 percent threshold, we’re better advised to have somewhat generally stated standards in the FOMC statement, which can be elaborated upon as circumstances dictate.	92	9
201403	484	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	I might deviate a bit from what Dennis stated in expressing a strong bias in favor of having the Chair do most of that elaboration, particularly, though not exclusively, in the press conferences that she’ll be conducting.	92	9
201403	485	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	To the degree that we think of communication of forward guidance as itself an element of monetary policy, I think it becomes particularly important to have an authoritative voice elaborating that position, and there’s no alternative here, really, but the Chair.	92	9
201403	486	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	A second point is, although I’ve got, personally, a fair amount of flexibility on the specific language that we will adopt, consistent with that notion of general standards, I do think it’s important that we not lose the advantage of what we’ve gotten already in the language that we’ve inserted into the existing paragraph 5.	92	9
201403	487	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	One of those things is the notion that we are likely—not certain, but likely—to stay at the zero lower bound well past the time when we pass a 6½ percent unemployment rate.	92	9
201403	488	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	And, second, as we begin to increase interest rates, we will, to use our euphemism, “take a balanced approach.”	92	9
201403	489	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	It might be advisable to substitute in that “balanced approach” language something that makes mention of—and I’m not sure this is the right term—the headwinds that we’ll be confronting, because those give a justification for why we think the path upward is, again, not likely to be steep, although we’re not prejudging anything.	92	9
201403	490	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	I would just note in passing that, although I’ve got a fair amount of flexibility on the language and, in some respects, I like some of the earlier statements in option 2 rather than in option 5, I really am less concerned with that.	92	9
201403	491	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	I would say, though, that I think there’s a bit of a risk here.	92	9
201403	492	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	Not many people have proposed it, but there’s a bit of a risk that too much reliance on projections as our standard becomes a bit circular.	92	9
201403	493	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	That is, it almost is the conclusion being stated as the standard.	92	9
201403	494	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	If you think inflation is going to be below target and employment is going to be below target, and that’s your projection, then, almost by definition, you’re going to be in favor of a longer period of accommodation, and you’re in favor of it because of your expectation that that’s where we’re going to be.	92	9
201403	495	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	So I’m not sure it communicates an enormous amount of information very effectively, but I say that with the understanding that we already use projections and we’re going to continue to use projections as we go forward here and in other parts of the statement.	92	9
201403	496	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	The next point is that what we’ve got now is, first, some indication of when we’ll begin to raise rates and, second, some indication of how steep a climb we’ll have once we begin.	92	9
201403	497	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	That’s where, I think, we don’t want to lose the benefits of the communications we’ve had to date, and we want to keep market expectations about where they are.	92	9
201403	498	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	We haven’t yet said anything about the endpoint, and this is where I, like several of you, find paragraph 6 in a few of the options attractive, because it does state an endpoint.	92	9
201403	499	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	And it seems to me it’s an endpoint that, while not giving a specific number, communicates something about how we’ll be thinking about policy along the way.	92	9
201403	500	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	Richard is quite right that we haven’t had a debate on that, and it may be that it would be premature to adopt it.	92	9
201403	501	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	But, unlike Sandy, I’m a little bit concerned about taking it one step at a time.	92	9
201403	502	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	Let’s just say when we’re going to begin, and sometime later we’ll talk about how steep a climb, and sometime thereafter we’ll talk about the endpoint.	92	9
201403	503	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	I think it’s preferable to say something about all three—again, in somewhat generally stated standards—and then allow the Chair to elaborate after listening to the whole Committee during the quarterly meetings that are followed by press conferences.	92	9
201403	504	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	With respect to the financial-stability point, I think Jim had it just right.	92	9
201403	505	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	It would be useful to make reference to it, but not to make too big a deal of it.	92	9
201403	506	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	And a simple minimalist reference to financial-stability considerations would be just fine, from my point of view, but I don’t feel very strongly about that.	92	9
201403	507	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	In conclusion, Madam Chair, I would stay away, as much as possible, from projections being the basis for the standards.	92	9
201403	508	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	I agree with what I think is the somewhat emergent consensus, with a lot of variation—that we go with a basic minimalist approach.	92	9
201403	509	2014-03-04	confcall	TARULLO	But with respect to the specific language, this is one for which I happily give you my proxy so that, as you try to allocate the votes, you’ve got an extra one just to lean in whatever direction you think useful.	92	9
201403	510	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Thanks—much appreciated, Governor Tarullo.	92	9
201403	511	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Governor Stein.	92	9
201403	512	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	513	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	Let me start with a few premises—three, in particular—and then I’ll comment on the options.	92	9
201403	514	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	One, as several others have observed, is that we’re basically in a good place.	92	9
201403	515	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	Market expectations are roughly lined up with what I take to be the center of mass of where the Committee sees the appropriate path.	92	9
201403	516	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	Like many others, again, I think it’s good not to “overtinker,” to do no harm, and to remember that we’ve got considerable support—beyond what’s in the FOMC statement—for the guidance, both in your credibility on this issue and in the LSAP timing factor, which is that if we just keep the LSAPs going until roughly the end of 2014, it’s hard for people to envision a world in which we lift off before mid- 2015.	92	9
201403	517	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	This suggests not feeling the need to overdo it in the statement.	92	9
201403	518	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	The second point is, I think we want to begin thinking about all of this in terms of a transition back to a more normal world and asking ourselves how we will want to communicate in that more normal world.	92	9
201403	519	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	Then we should ask, is what we’re setting up now going to converge smoothly to that desired end state?	92	9
201403	520	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	Or are we setting up a bunch of one-offs, tests regarding certain variables, that are helpful and serve a purpose now but we may have to awkwardly dismantle later on?	92	9
201403	521	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	So that’s the second consideration.	92	9
201403	522	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	The third thing—and this is something that Narayana pointed out—is that there’s a clear challenge: The collective view is that the right time-consistent rate is below what a naive application of a Taylor rule would seem to suggest.	92	9
201403	523	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	We may ultimately converge back to doing something like a Taylor rule, but we need a coherent narrative that both takes us there and, ideally, self-liquidates.	92	9
201403	524	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	That is, in the process of getting to where we want to be now, we don’t leave ourselves with a lot of junk DNA in the statement.	92	9
201403	525	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	At the same time, we have to have a strong, coherent explanation—especially if the news comes in a little bit good—when somebody says, “Hey, Taylor says you should be doing this.	92	9
201403	526	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	Why aren’t you doing it?”	92	9
201403	527	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	In this spirit, one observation is the asymmetry induced by the zero lower bound and the fact that, in a world of uncertainty, it’s just time consistent and rational to wait a little bit longer as a result of that uncertainty, because, if you get a little bit behind, you can always raise, but if you raise prematurely, you can’t undo that.	92	9
201403	528	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	This is something that’s missing from all of the options, and it’s something, Madam Chair, that you mentioned at the outset, and it surprises me that we’re not taking a little bit more advantage of it.	92	9
201403	529	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	I think it’s a nice bit of logic.	92	9
201403	530	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	If you lean on it a little bit more, you have to lean less on other special factors and data idiosyncrasies, which may work for now but then may not work later.	92	9
201403	531	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	And I take that to be a little bit of a lesson from Carney’s adventure with 7 percent.	92	9
201403	532	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	It seemed as though it was going to get you somewhere, and then it didn’t.	92	9
201403	533	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	So I like that.	92	9
201403	534	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	I like the fact that it’s a self-liquidating thing.	92	9
201403	535	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	It has a logic now that just pulls away as we normalize.	92	9
201403	536	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	I think one could make more use of this asymmetry.	92	9
201403	537	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	Now, whether it belongs in the statement as opposed to in the press conference, I don’t have a strong view.	92	9
201403	538	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	It may well be that it’s better off not being in the statement.	92	9
201403	539	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	I think it’s worth maybe having folks work up a sentence and see if it writes itself well.	92	9
201403	540	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	I’d just throw out something somewhere in one of these options like “In determining how long to maintain”—blah, blah, blah—“the Committee will take into account the asymmetry created by the zero lower bound and the added motivation this creates relative to traditional monetary policy rules for waiting until the recovery is well established.”	92	9
201403	541	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	So one could use something like that in any option that you like.	92	9
201403	542	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	And again, I think it takes a little bit of the lean, then, off of some of the other stuff.	92	9
201403	543	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	All right.	92	9
201403	544	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	In terms of the options themselves, like many of the others, I’m attracted to the simplicity and continuity of option 5.	92	9
201403	545	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	But, like Sandy and a couple of others, there is a sentence that really concerns me.	92	9
201403	546	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	The sentence contains the phrase “at least as long as complete recovery in the labor market appears to be more than a year away.”	92	9
201403	547	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	I read this as very threshold-like in its language.	92	9
201403	548	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	It has very much the formulation that we used for the threshold—“at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent.”	92	9
201403	549	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	So I worry that if you say that, people are going to ask you to call out what that means.	92	9
201403	550	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	What are the indicators that tell you what “complete recovery” is?	92	9
201403	551	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	And when will you know that it’s a year away?	92	9
201403	552	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	Then we’ll get drawn into a little bit of the same kind of numbers game.	92	9
201403	553	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	I would be quite comfortable with option 5 if we could replace that little clause with something we’ve had before—“for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends.”	92	9
201403	554	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	If one felt that that didn’t do enough or wasn’t strong enough, I would be happy with something along the lines of the zero-lower-bound stuff.	92	9
201403	555	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	But, again, I read that as threshold-like.	92	9
201403	556	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	Even though there’s not a number in there, I feel as though it’ll put you in a position of really having to start ponying up what your metrics are.	92	9
201403	557	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	So that’s my concern.	92	9
201403	558	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	But other than that, I think something along the lines of option 5 works well.	92	9
201403	559	2014-03-04	confcall	STEIN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	560	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201403	561	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	92	9
201403	562	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	563	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	I, too, think that some variant of option 5 is the right place to land, and I’ll talk about that.	92	9
201403	564	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	But I want to talk first about a couple of the other issues that arise in the preceding options.	92	9
201403	565	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	First, I am not attracted to the idea of switching to an employment type of goal.	92	9
201403	566	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	I think it would certainly be perceived by the market as a significant signal, and the signal would probably be along the lines of losing confidence in the unemployment rate as a measure.	92	9
201403	567	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	But we are already saying in the postmeeting statement that we are looking at a variety of labor market measures, and, therefore, I think it might be confusing, and, in the end, doesn’t buy us a lot.	92	9
201403	568	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	So I’m not attracted to that idea.	92	9
201403	569	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	Turning to the pre-liftoff guidance, I am not attracted, again, to the new thresholds.	92	9
201403	570	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	And I take the point of the thresholds that are in option 2 and option 4 to be to set up some brakes on this locomotive against unwanted tightening if the economy does strengthen again.	92	9
201403	571	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	But, in my view, we have already got effective brakes—and, for me, that is in the form of a link to the end of asset purchases.	92	9
201403	572	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	Specifically, monetary policy will remain highly accommodative for a considerable time after the end of asset purchases.	92	9
201403	573	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	I realize we are mixing state dependence and time dependence there, but I think this is really the ballast that is holding market expectations close to where the Committee is.	92	9
201403	574	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	I think this is a very important fundamental aspect.	92	9
201403	575	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	It’s working right now and is central to the market’s understanding, and I think it would be very unwise to change it at this time.	92	9
201403	576	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	I’ll come to this in the end, but complete recovery in the labor market as a threshold, in particular—you know, you think about those words and we may never have that, if you take it literally.	92	9
201403	577	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	Right?	92	9
201403	578	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	If you look at what we know of the Scandinavian countries or the long history of crises, there is permanent damage in some respect to the labor market in a lot of cases.	92	9
201403	579	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	So it’s not a great formulation, in my view.	92	9
201403	580	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	Now, the current formulation of the “considerable time” sentence is linked to the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, which the memo points out is kind of ambiguous on its face.	92	9
201403	581	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	But I strongly suspect that what many in the market interpret that to mean is the current target for the federal funds rate.	92	9
201403	582	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	I’m actually okay with either formulation, and, frankly, I think that either formulation is consistent with and in sync with the December SEP.	92	9
201403	583	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	A final point, and I’m going to put this into one proposed sentence, is that as we pass the 6.5 percent unemployment rate and the threshold language drops away, we lose, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal.	92	9
201403	584	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	I think you can put all of those thoughts in one sentence and come out with something like this, which would land in paragraph 5: “The Committee anticipates that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economy strengthens, particularly if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-term goal.”	92	9
201403	585	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	I think President Williams managed to squeeze “financial stability” into that sentence, too, and I wouldn’t object to that.	92	9
201403	586	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	On a separate point, what’s not in here—and I hate to complicate this even further—is that we have left open the question of reinvestment of the assets on the balance sheet.	92	9
201403	587	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	I don’t think we have said anything publicly about it since 2011, and at that point I think we were saying we would cease reinvestments six months before liftoff.	92	9
201403	588	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	I think in the previous Tealbook, it was actually synchronous with liftoff.	92	9
201403	589	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	So this is the time to think about whether we wouldn’t resolve that question and use this occasion, or an occasion soon, to say what we’re going to do about that.	92	9
201403	590	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	In other words, we would indicate that we will maintain our reinvestment policy and preserve the size of the balance sheet as it exists at the end of the asset purchase program until liftoff, or something like that.	92	9
201403	591	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	If we leave that out, there’s a suggestion that we forgot it.	92	9
201403	592	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	In terms of financial stability, I like the more explicit formulations.	92	9
201403	593	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	I could live with either of the ones in paragraph 4.	92	9
201403	594	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	As far as post-liftoff guidance is concerned, I like paragraph 6.	92	9
201403	595	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	It is pretty much fine with me.	92	9
201403	596	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	What it doesn’t have, of course, is an explanation of why.	92	9
201403	597	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	As someone pointed out, it just flatly states what the SEP already says, which is that we’re going to be at full employment with mandate-consistent inflation, and we are going to have a 2 percent funds rate.	92	9
201403	598	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	That, I think, clearly falls to the press conference, and, therefore, I am going to jump ahead and say what I would say in the press conference.	92	9
201403	599	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	First I’d mention the headwinds, deleveraging, lack of credit availability, that kind of thing.	92	9
201403	600	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	I would also make the risk-management point that Jeremy made, that it’s an asymmetrical situation and we need to get as far away from the zero lower bound as possible before easing off the gas.	92	9
201403	601	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	I would also personally emphasize that the output gap is not directly observable and famously difficult to estimate in real time.	92	9
201403	602	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	And I believe that, today, uncertainty about the size of the gap is unusually high and is probably skewed in a way that indicators, like the unemployment gap, are likely to understate the real resource gap.	92	9
201403	603	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	Finally, I would say that, given the unusually high uncertainty, we will carefully monitor inflation, particularly wage inflation, as well as financial conditions, to tell us how close we are to full employment.	92	9
201403	604	2014-03-04	confcall	POWELL	Thank you.	92	9
201403	605	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Thank you, Governor Powell.	92	9
201403	606	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	And last but not least, Vice Chairman Dudley.	92	9
201403	607	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	Thank you, Chair Yellen.	92	9
201403	608	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	It is great to have the opportunity to work with you as Chair.	92	9
201403	609	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201403	610	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	I want to first start by answering the questions and then I’ll make a few general observations, given the discussion that we’ve had.	92	9
201403	611	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	In terms of the questions, I am very much where most people are.	92	9
201403	612	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	I’d prefer a qualitative approach rather than a quantitative approach.	92	9
201403	613	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	It seems to me that the goal of the statement is to describe our expectations about the outlook and then our likely reaction function not just to that outlook but to other possible outlooks, so people can sort of think along with us.	92	9
201403	614	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	Should we link the liftoff explicitly to the end of asset purchases?	92	9
201403	615	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	I think the answer is yes.	92	9
201403	616	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	There is such a link, and it’s highly unlikely that we are going to start to raise the short-term funds rate before we end asset purchases.	92	9
201403	617	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	So why not be explicit about that?	92	9
201403	618	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	I don’t like thresholds, triggers, or floors.	92	9
201403	619	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	I think they are both too complicated and too specific.	92	9
201403	620	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	They are too complicated in the sense that we then have to articulate why we picked that particular threshold, trigger, or floor; they are too specific in the sense that as the information set changes, we may not want to be governed so specifically by the particular threshold, trigger, or floor that we chose.	92	9
201403	621	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	The world is, obviously, more complicated than that, and we see that in the case of the 6½ percent unemployment rate, and we saw that in the case of the Bank of England’s 7 percent unemployment rate threshold.	92	9
201403	622	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	I particularly don’t like thresholds, triggers, and floors that are tied to forecasts.	92	9
201403	623	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	What happens if the forecasts are wrong?	92	9
201403	624	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	And how does the market react to forecast changes?	92	9
201403	625	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	Say we had inflation on a one- to two-year time horizon of 1.6 percent and then we moved it to 1.9 percent.	92	9
201403	626	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	How would the market respond to that?	92	9
201403	627	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	I also think if we tie our actions to our forecasts, it would make the flawed SEP process even more important and introduce the potential for gaming in terms of SEP submissions where the forecast submissions could actually be used to drive the policy outcomes directly.	92	9
201403	628	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	I think it would be really unfortunate if we got into that sort of situation.	92	9
201403	629	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	I agree that having a sentence referencing financial market developments is welcome, but I strongly prefer financial market developments to financial stability because I think the topic of financial market developments emits two separate issues that are important.	92	9
201403	630	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	The first issue is deviations of financial conditions from what we expect, and the second is financial stability, so it includes two very different concepts.	92	9
201403	631	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	The fact is, if financial conditions are grossly different from what we anticipate, this does have implications for monetary policy, so we need to take that into consideration.	92	9
201403	632	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	I very much prefer providing guidance about the trajectory of interest rates after liftoff, both the gradient and the terminal level of the funds rate, because I think that is an important determinant of financial conditions.	92	9
201403	633	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	Bond yields and equity prices today depend on what is going to happen not just in terms of the time of liftoff, but where short-term rates go over the medium to longer term.	92	9
201403	634	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	Leaving out post-liftoff guidance implies that all that matters is the time you lift off.	92	9
201403	635	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	The other problem, I think, in not including it now is that if we don’t include it now, and liftoff gets closer, then we are going to be in this position of, when do we introduce it?	92	9
201403	636	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	And that is going to be a really big market event.	92	9
201403	637	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	So if we’re going to revamp the statement, now is a perfect time to do it, with a new Chair.	92	9
201403	638	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	Let’s get this into the statement now, because it will make it much easier to keep it in the statement going forward.	92	9
201403	639	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	In general, I think the statement needs to be revamped now for several reasons.	92	9
201403	640	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	The 6½ percent unemployment rate threshold is stale, and I think the timing is right with the new Chair.	92	9
201403	641	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	If we don’t alter it in March, it would just make it a much more significant change if we were to revamp it later.	92	9
201403	642	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	So this is actually a singular opportunity to make meaningful changes to the statement.	92	9
201403	643	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	In terms of what I’m for, I am generally inclined to a more minimalist approach, along the lines of either option 1 or 5.	92	9
201403	644	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	If we went down the route of an option 5, I would want to have two sorts of changes.	92	9
201403	645	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	One, as someone observed, it does seem like it has a threshold in there, and I’m a little uncomfortable with that.	92	9
201403	646	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	And, two, I really do think we need a paragraph 6 to explain what happens to the trajectory of interest rates after liftoff.	92	9
201403	647	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	In terms of other changes, I think President Williams made a suggestion that maybe we should put the punchline up-front, that short-term rates aren’t going to be raised until a considerable time after the end of asset purchases.	92	9
201403	648	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	I like that coming first, rather than burying the lead.	92	9
201403	649	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	I think we should at least consider the idea of being more explicit in the statement by saying that the changes are not designed to shift market expectations.	92	9
201403	650	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	I’m not really sure how to do that.	92	9
201403	651	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	But if you remember, in December 2012 when we shifted to an unemployment rate threshold, we said, “The Committee views these thresholds as consistent with its earlier date- based guidance.”	92	9
201403	652	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	And I thought that was good because it is going to be firmer if you have that in the statement than if you just defer it to the press conference.	92	9
201403	653	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	If you decide not to include it in the statement, I think it is extremely important that it be discussed at the press conference.	92	9
201403	654	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	I think the press conference is extremely important.	92	9
201403	655	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	In addition to making it clear that we are not trying to alter expectations, I think we want to explain in the press conference why the statement needed to be changed, the staleness of the 6½ percent unemployment rate, and the importance of linking the interest rate liftoff to the end of asset purchases because that is how the Committee is thinking about that.	92	9
201403	656	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	I think it’s important to provide guidance.	92	9
201403	657	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	I think we need to explain to people a little bit more that we’re providing long-term guidance on the path of short- term rates because it’s important for financial conditions.	92	9
201403	658	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	I don’t think we have really articulated it to the full degree that we need to.	92	9
201403	659	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	And I think, in the press conference, you could explain a little bit more why financial market developments are important as well.	92	9
201403	660	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	I think Governor Powell made a good suggestion about reinvestments.	92	9
201403	661	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	Our last statement about this in 2011 indicated that we would likely begin the process of normalization by ceasing reinvestments.	92	9
201403	662	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	I feel like that has been hanging out there as something that, you know, clearly doesn’t apply any more.	92	9
201403	663	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	We are not going to want to cease reinvestments six months before liftoff, because we are not going to know when six months before is.	92	9
201403	664	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	So I think we should really try to think about correcting that as well.	92	9
201403	665	2014-03-04	confcall	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201403	666	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Thanks, everybody.	92	9
201403	667	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	I think we’ve had a really rich discussion, and you have made a lot of truly helpful comments.	92	9
201403	668	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	It will be the staff’s task to work with me to see if we can figure out something that takes many of the comments into account.	92	9
201403	669	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	I have heard a considerable amount of interest in something along the lines of option 5, a more minimalist approach building on what we have, but with many suggested changes to what we offered up.	92	9
201403	670	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	We will try hard to think about the valuable suggestions you’ve given and come back to you early next week with some proposals for your reaction to see if we can converge by the time of the meeting.	92	9
201403	671	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	But I appreciate very much everyone’s input today.	92	9
201403	672	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	We are running perhaps slightly earlier than anticipated, so before we conclude—well, first of all, are there any other final questions or comments on forward guidance anyone would like to make after hearing the go-round?	92	9
201403	673	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	[No response]	92	9
201403	674	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Seeing none, then, let me give you an opportunity, if you have any questions about Ukraine and want to take that up and get Steve to opine, I think we have a couple of minutes if anyone wants to make a comment or ask a question about developments there.	92	9
201403	675	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	[No response]	92	9
201403	676	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201403	677	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	Seeing none, I guess it is time to wrap up.	92	9
201403	678	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	We are beating our estimated time by a considerable amount.	92	9
201403	679	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	I appreciate all of you making time to do this.	92	9
201403	680	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	I know it was last minute, but I really thought this is sufficiently complex that having a go-round and hearing your views would really put us in a better place in terms of designing options that could attract support in March.	92	9
201403	681	2014-03-04	confcall	YELLEN	And I think we have learned a lot, so thanks so much for all of your input.	92	9
201403	682	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	All right.	5	5
201403	683	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’re ready to go.	5	5
201403	684	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we start with Simon and the financial developments update?	61	6
201403	685	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201403	686	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	US economic data generally disappointed for much of the intermeeting period and contributed to lower US Treasury yields, as shown in your top-left panel.	61	6
201403	687	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Many market participants attributed the soft data in part to severe winter weather.	61	6
201403	688	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Despite the disappointing data, concerns over China, and escalating tensions in Eastern Europe, US equity prices rose notably, as also shown in the top-left panel.	61	6
201403	689	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	In explaining this increase, market participants pointed to a variety of factors.	61	6
201403	690	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	These include some reversal of the sharp declines in risk asset prices in late January, as feared negative spillovers from emerging markets to domestic financial markets did not materialize and US corporate earnings results were solid.	61	6
201403	691	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Corporate credit spreads also narrowed over the period, and investment-grade and high-yield spreads are near their tightest levels in the past decade, as reflected in the first two rows of the top-right panel.	61	6
201403	692	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Despite continued increases in equity prices, valuations for the broad stock market do not appear overly stretched, with price-to-earnings ratios for the S&P 500 only modestly above their averages over recent years, also shown in the top-right panel.	61	6
201403	693	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	While valuations for some smaller-cap biotech and Internet firms are more elevated, they remain below levels seen prior to the crisis.	61	6
201403	694	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Risk asset prices have been supported by the continued accommodative stance of global monetary policy, which keeps funding costs low.	61	6
201403	695	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	In addition to easing financial conditions, this likely encourages investors to reach for higher-yielding returns, at times in difficult-to-track carry trades.	61	6
201403	696	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Monetary policymakers have kept nominal interest rates low in major developed economies to achieve their policy objectives, though success has varied.	61	6
201403	697	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Indeed, as reflected in the middle-left panel, three-year inflation compensation remains below inflation targets in both Japan and the euro area; notably, at this tenor inflation compensation is now substantially higher in Japan than in the euro area.	61	6
201403	698	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Many market participants still expect the Bank of Japan to take further action to ease monetary policy, though not until after it evaluates the impact of the consumption tax increase.	61	6
201403	699	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	In the euro area, the ECB staff’s March forecast of headline inflation rises from its current level of 0.7 percent to 1.7 percent by the end of 2016.	61	6
201403	700	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Market participants believe that if inflation does not begin to increase as anticipated, the ECB will take further action.	61	6
201403	701	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Actual and expected monetary policy tightening by some central banks appeared to support the reduction in emerging market stresses.	61	6
201403	702	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Tightening actions in Turkey, Brazil, and South Africa were seen as positive steps toward addressing imbalances.	61	6
201403	703	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	These actions resulted in higher short-term interest rates, as shown in the middle-right panel.	61	6
201403	704	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Furthermore, measures to reduce fiscal accommodation in some emerging markets helped to increase policy credibility by reinforcing perceptions of the authorities’ commitment to a timely correction of imbalances.	61	6
201403	705	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Despite these positive steps, market participants remain focused on structural vulnerabilities and risks across emerging market economies.	61	6
201403	706	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Elsewhere in emerging markets, focus has been on developments in Ukraine and their potential impact on global financial markets.	61	6
201403	707	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	While escalating tensions in the region have led to some limited financial market volatility, the impact has been more pronounced on Russian asset prices.	61	6
201403	708	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	To contain pressures on the ruble, the Russian central bank increased its policy rate by 150 basis points in early March—leading to the increase in Russia’s one-year swap rate seen in the middle-right panel—and has been intervening directly in the foreign exchange market.	61	6
201403	709	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	In China, official-sector actions and concerns over a potential moderation in the growth outlook received considerable attention over the period.	61	6
201403	710	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	The bottom-left panel shows the relatively sharp depreciation of onshore renminbi, which followed a depreciation of the official exchange rate fix and reported intervention by the PBOC.	61	6
201403	711	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Although the actions to depreciate the renminbi may be consistent with concerns over recent moderation in the Chinese growth outlook, market participants generally interpret them as reflecting a new effort to stem rising capital inflows, which have contributed to credit growth beyond levels Chinese policymakers appear comfortable with.	61	6
201403	712	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	In particular, the depreciation likely reflects a desire by the PBOC to introduce greater two- way exchange rate risk after a reported buildup of speculative positions in the offshore market and may have been a precursor for the doubling to 2 percent of the onshore renminbi intraday trading band that was announced this past weekend.	61	6
201403	713	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Market participants believe that the interventions were at least partially unsterilized and led to the decline in onshore interbank lending rates shown in the bottom-left panel.	61	6
201403	714	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Chinese credit markets were also in focus as authorities allowed the first domestic bond default since 1997.	61	6
201403	715	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Participants interpreted the lack of a support package from authorities as signaling a greater willingness to allow for a more market-determined financial system and to reduce implicit guarantees associated with investment products and corporate bonds.	61	6
201403	716	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	While the reaction in Chinese corporate credit markets was limited, copper and iron ore prices declined sharply, as shown in the bottom-right panel.	61	6
201403	717	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	The declines were due in part to concerns of higher future credit costs that could constrain Chinese growth and were amplified by weaker-than-expected Chinese production and trade data.	61	6
201403	718	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Steve will discuss revisions to the staff’s forecast for Chinese GDP growth in his briefing.	61	6
201403	719	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	In addition, base metals are widely used in China as a financing vehicle for onshore carry trades that invest in corporate credit or other high-yielding assets.	61	6
201403	720	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Market participants believe that this type of trade is only one of many carry trade strategies present in the Chinese onshore and offshore financial system produced by investors’ attempts to evade regulation and exploit large yield differentials.	61	6
201403	721	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	The top-left panel of your next exhibit reviews the market reaction to the Bank of England’s changes to its forward guidance in mid-February.	61	6
201403	722	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	The BOE shifted emphasis from its 7 percent unemployment threshold to a focus on a broader set of economic indicators.	61	6
201403	723	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	While market participants had generally expected such a shift, following the announcement short-term interest rates rose sharply and broader financial conditions tightened modestly.	61	6
201403	724	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Market participants attributed this reaction to the MPC’s higher- than-expected GDP projections, which accompanied the change to the guidance, as well as to Governor Carney’s emphasis on these projections in the related press conference.	61	6
201403	725	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	The BOE experience may illustrate the heightened sensitivity of market prices to central bank communications about the outlook as quantitative forward guidance is removed.	61	6
201403	726	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	With regard to expectations of FOMC policy, as shown in the top-right panel, respondents to the Desk’s dealer and buy-side surveys assign high odds to the Committee changing its forward rate guidance, with the vast majority expecting a change to be announced at this meeting.	61	6
201403	727	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Dealers and buy-side participants assign the highest probability to the Committee providing additional qualitative guidance relevant to determining the appropriate timing of the first rate hike.	61	6
201403	728	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	They also assign a significant probability to the Committee providing additional information on the path of the target rate after the first hike.	61	6
201403	729	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	The median expectation for the timing of liftoff in both surveys remains the second half of 2015—broadly in line with market-based measures—although the median dealer expectation shifted toward a slightly earlier liftoff relative to the January survey.	61	6
201403	730	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	With regard to economic conditions anticipated at liftoff, a new survey question asked about expectations for inflation in the one to two years following the first hike.	61	6
201403	731	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-left panel, averaging across respondents, both dealers and buy-side participants assign a probability of around 40 percent to inflation over this horizon registering within 1 quarter point of the Committee’s 2 percent objective.	61	6
201403	732	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	The average probability distribution for each group of respondents appears to be roughly symmetric around 2 percent.	61	6
201403	733	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Bill will talk more about respondents’ expectations for economic conditions at the time of liftoff in his briefing.	61	6
201403	734	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	With regard to asset purchases, all survey respondents view a reduction in the pace of asset purchases at this meeting as almost certain.	61	6
201403	735	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Nearly all expect that the FOMC will continue to reduce the monthly pace of purchases by $10 billion at each meeting, split evenly between Treasuries and MBS.	61	6
201403	736	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Additionally, respondents believe that persistently large surprises in top-tier economic data would be required for the Committee to deviate from this “measured steps” path.	61	6
201403	737	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	With regard to the target rate path, the middle-right panel shows that the market- implied path shifted down a bit over the intermeeting period and remains broadly in line with the median of year-end projections from the December SEP.	61	6
201403	738	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	The panel also shows the median expected rates from the Desk’s dealer and buy-side surveys; these lie below the market-implied path through 2015 but above it thereafter.	61	6
201403	739	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom- left panel, most respondents anticipate that the changes to the guidance that they view as most likely would have little impact on market expectations for the timing of liftoff or the subsequent target rate path.	61	6
201403	740	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Among those who do expect a change to the guidance to affect market rate expectations, views are heterogeneous:  Nearly all dealers anticipating a change think that the expected target rate path would flatten, while nearly all buy-side participants anticipating a change think that it would steepen.	61	6
201403	741	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	The bottom-right panel shows the mean dealer expectation for the longer-run target fed funds rate.	61	6
201403	742	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	In the most recent survey, the decline in the mean was the largest since the question was introduced in mid-2012, and the median response also changed for the first time, declining from 4.0 percent to 3.75 percent.	61	6
201403	743	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	The decline may be related to revisions to expectations for longer-run GDP growth, also shown in the bottom-right panel.	61	6
201403	744	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Separate from the survey, market commentary last week highlighted some expectations that Committee participants would revise lower their longer-run target rate forecasts in the SEP.	61	6
201403	745	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Turning to Desk operations, if the Committee continues reducing the pace of purchases, the Desk plans some operational changes.	61	6
201403	746	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	In particular, we plan to adjust the number of Treasury operations if the pace declines below $30 billion while maintaining the current maturity distribution of purchases, shown in the top-left panel of your third exhibit.	61	6
201403	747	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	This approach will maintain the average duration of Treasury purchases at about nine years.	61	6
201403	748	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	The Committee could, of course, consider alternative approaches as it reduces the pace of purchases, including those that would change the maturity distribution and, thus, the duration target of the Treasury purchases.	61	6
201403	749	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	For MBS, the Desk intends to decrease the size of daily operations to meet the Committee’s monthly purchase pace, though actual daily operation sizes will vary based on fluctuations in monthly reinvestments.	61	6
201403	750	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	We will continue to focus purchases in production coupons.	61	6
201403	751	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Additionally, as noted in the memo we circulated ahead of the meeting, we are beginning the process of transitioning MBS purchases to our proprietary FedTrade platform, which will improve the efficiency and transparency of our operations.	61	6
201403	752	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	We anticipate that these operations with FedTrade will begin on April 9.	61	6
201403	753	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Expectations for the path of remaining purchases from the dealer survey imply that the par value of the SOMA portfolio would peak near the end of this year at $4.2 trillion.	61	6
201403	754	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	At that point, SOMA holdings would consist of $2.5 trillion in Treasuries and $1.7 trillion in MBS, as shown in the top-right panel.	61	6
201403	755	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	MBS holdings would represent 41 percent of the outstanding stock of available securities, while Treasury holdings would represent 23 percent of coupon securities outstanding.	61	6
201403	756	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Increases in the size and duration of SOMA holdings have resulted in a substantial rise in the interest rate risk of the portfolio, as was the policy intent in removing duration from the market.	61	6
201403	757	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	The middle-left panel shows the net unrealized gain or loss position of the portfolio, defined as the difference between its market and book values.	61	6
201403	758	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	The net unrealized gain was $38 billion at the end of February—a decline of nearly $175 billion since the start of 2013, but an increase of about $90 billion from the level that was footnoted in the year-end financial statements released last Friday.	61	6
201403	759	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	While market expectations for the path of future purchases show very little dispersion, dealer expectations about the time at which reinvestments would be stopped vary widely, ranging from one year before to six months after the first target rate increase.	61	6
201403	760	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Staff estimates in the middle-right panel show that approximately $250 billion in agency debt and MBS and just $4 billion in Treasury securities would mature between the end of purchases and the fourth quarter of 2015.	61	6
201403	761	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Turning to the overnight RRP exercise, with approval from the Chair, the rate and the allotment cap were increased over the intermeeting period.	61	6
201403	762	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	As seen in the bottom-left panel, market repo rates increased over the period, along with Treasury bill yields and the effective federal funds rate (not shown).	61	6
201403	763	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	According to market participants, these increases were likely in response to a pickup in Treasury bill issuance related to the reinstatement of the debt limit as well as to the higher rate offered in our operations.	61	6
201403	764	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	As illustrated in the bottom-right panel, the majority of Treasury triparty repo transactions have printed within 1 basis point of the operation rate.	61	6
201403	765	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	The anticipated seasonal decline in bill issuance in April is expected to push market rates lower and thus may provide another opportunity to further examine the degree to which the RRP operations influence market repo rates.	61	6
201403	766	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	The take-up in the operations continues to respond primarily to the spread between the rate offered and the market rate for overnight repo.	61	6
201403	767	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-left panel of your final exhibit, when this spread is near zero, take-up appears to be highly elastic; this is particularly true for government money market funds and primary dealers.	61	6
201403	768	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Take-up in the operations averaged around $89 billion during the intermeeting period, and the operations may be having some effect on volumes in other money markets.	61	6
201403	769	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	In particular, as shown in the top-right panel, since the start of the exercise, triparty repo volumes have decreased alongside the increase in take-up.	61	6
201403	770	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Brokered fed funds volumes have recently ticked lower, as shown in the middle-left panel, perhaps partly because of the participation in the exercise by the four FHLB counterparties.	61	6
201403	771	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Overall, we haven’t learned anything yet that suggests overnight RRPs could not be a powerful addition to our toolkit for the control of short-term interest rates.	61	6
201403	772	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	That said, there are additional enhancements we could make to further test the efficacy of the operations.	61	6
201403	773	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Additionally, the seven-day term deposit operations carried out over the period went smoothly.	61	6
201403	774	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	The staff plans to outline testing options for the Committee in April in combination with further discussion of the intermediate and long-run framework options.	61	6
201403	775	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	A quick update about the dollar swap lines:  As shown in the middle-right panel, their usage has declined to very low levels.	61	6
201403	776	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Recall that in January I sent a memo to the Committee informing you of the contingent plans of the BOE, ECB, SNB, and BOJ to discontinue regular three-month and seven-day operations.	61	6
201403	777	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	We expect little market reaction to the phasing-out of these operations after July, as the standing swap lines provide a framework for reintroducing these operations if market conditions warrant.	61	6
201403	778	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	A final note:  If the Committee decides to reduce the pace of purchases at this meeting, we will release a Desk statement at the same time as the Committee statement—the same approach as that taken at the two prior meetings.	61	6
201403	779	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Lorie and I will have copies of the statement available for review.	61	6
201403	780	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201403	781	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	That concludes my prepared remarks.	61	6
201403	782	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for Simon?	62	6
201403	783	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	62	6
201403	784	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	My question is on figure 10.	62	6
201403	785	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	If I’m reading this right, the move from the dark blue to the light blue means that the brokers have been moving down their expectations for the fed funds rate since January.	62	6
201403	786	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	It looks like the December SEP is consistent with that lower rate, and I know we haven’t gotten to it yet, but when we look at our own dots, they’re moving in the opposite direction.	62	6
201403	787	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	They’re moving up quite substantially.	62	6
201403	788	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	Do you see it as a potential problem that the dealers are moving down, while our SEP is going to be moving up fairly substantially?	62	6
201403	789	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	The light blue line is the market-implied path.	62	6
201403	790	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	So it’s not quite what the dealers think.	62	6
201403	791	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Those are the little triangles.	62	6
201403	792	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	We try to look at what the market expects the SEP to look like, in terms of the dots.	62	6
201403	793	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	There are a few market participants who expect the dots to go up.	62	6
201403	794	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	There are more market participants who expect them to stay the same, and I would say there are some market participants, probably more than those who expect the dots to go up, who expect them to actually go down, partly because some people think that the longer-run normal rate of the federal funds rate will be revised, based, I think, on GDP growth—that bottom panel there.	62	6
201403	795	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	The estimates of GDP growth over the long run—for example, the CBO’s—are starting to move down, and that would tend to produce lower estimates of the longer-run federal funds rate.	62	6
201403	796	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	So I would say that some people in the market expect the dots to go up, but it’s a small set of market participants who have that view.	62	6
201403	797	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Most market participants expect them to stay the same or move down.	62	6
201403	798	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	There’s uncertainty because some dots do leave.	62	6
201403	799	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	How they’ll interpret the dot that leaves—it’s a very important one that leaves—I’m not sure.	62	6
201403	800	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	It’s already gone.	62	6
201403	801	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	62	6
201403	802	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	I have two questions.	62	6
201403	803	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	The first one is about the buy-side survey.	62	6
201403	804	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	What’s the sample size of that compared with the dealer survey?	62	6
201403	805	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	It was 25 this time.	62	6
201403	806	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	It was 20 the previous time.	62	6
201403	807	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	The dealer—	62	6
201403	808	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Is it the same group?	62	6
201403	809	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	It’s not quite a balanced panel.	62	6
201403	810	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	We added five.	62	6
201403	811	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	So there’s some issue comparing responses from the January one.	62	6
201403	812	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	For the dealer survey, we went from 21 to 22.	62	6
201403	813	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	We looked at the balanced panel.	62	6
201403	814	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	So the first question I asked my staff was, “Did the median long-run federal funds rate fall because we added someone?”	62	6
201403	815	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	And they said, “We knew you were going to ask that question.	62	6
201403	816	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	No.”	62	6
201403	817	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Okay.	62	6
201403	818	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you.	62	6
201403	819	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Here’s my second question:  Looking at chart 20 on the overnight triparty repo volumes, the picture suggests that volumes have actually stayed pretty stable, and that our reverse RP allotment has just replaced volumes that were occurring by other parties.	62	6
201403	820	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	All we’ve done is change the mix.	62	6
201403	821	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Our involvement hasn’t really changed the volume, it’s just changed the mix.	62	6
201403	822	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Is that a legitimate interpretation?	62	6
201403	823	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	And if it is, what do I take away from this message that the volume has stayed the same?	62	6
201403	824	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	I think volume between private counterparties has definitely gone down.	62	6
201403	825	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	That’s clear from that.	62	6
201403	826	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	But it went down about the same time that we intervened.	62	6
201403	827	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	We can look at the microdata that underlie this from the triparty system, which we get each Tuesday, and you can see that for some funds there’s a 100 percent setoff.	62	6
201403	828	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	For other funds, it’s more like a 50 percent setoff.	62	6
201403	829	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	So you’ll see their volume in triparty go down by 50 percent of what they put into our overnight RRP, and that seems to be because they’re trying to conserve the right to the dealer balance sheet space.	62	6
201403	830	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	We know that the dealers reserve balance sheet for them over a period of time, and the implicit agreement is to keep on using that balance sheet.	62	6
201403	831	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	But what we need to do is look across the counterparties quite carefully.	62	6
201403	832	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	The set of counterparties that move around the most are the primary dealers themselves.	62	6
201403	833	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	So it’s probably in the trades between the primary dealers in which there’s been the biggest reduction in volume, as they will tend to use us more at that point than—	62	6
201403	834	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Is there a message to take away from that in terms of either, perhaps, longer-term market functioning or depth of the market in some way that matters?	62	6
201403	835	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m just curious whether or not—	62	6
201403	836	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	I think if there weren’t a lot of regulatory reform bearing on repo and uncertainty about how short-term funding would be treated, it would be easier to take some type of message.	62	6
201403	837	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	One of the things we’re not sure about is that some of the triparty behavior might be caused by the fact that there are a lot of reforms coming, which will affect that instrument—not as much as people thought before changes were made in the leverage ratio with regard to how it treated repo, but it’s a little bit hard for us to push through that.	62	6
201403	838	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	We hope to send a report to research directors within the next two weeks that looks at some of the microdata, and they could probably tell you what we’ve seen there.	62	6
201403	839	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you.	62	6
201403	840	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	62	6
201403	841	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201403	842	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I have a question, an observation, and two other questions.	62	6
201403	843	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	To follow up on Eric’s question, I wasn’t sure what the answer was.	62	6
201403	844	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Would you expect some kind of market reaction if our dots don’t align with this dealer expectation?	62	6
201403	845	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I’m just curious about that point.	62	6
201403	846	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	I don’t have the chart in front of me.	62	6
201403	847	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	I think, Bill, you’ll have that chart that shows the SEP relative to—	62	6
201403	848	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	You should have it in the—	62	6
201403	849	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Okay.	62	6
201403	850	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Why don’t we let Bill go for this because he’s practiced on this?	62	6
201403	851	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	In front of you there are some charts in the handout with “Summary of Economic Projections” on the cover.	62	6
201403	852	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	As a couple of you have pointed out, the distribution, say, for the end of 2016 has moved up some.	62	6
201403	853	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	The median value for the end of 2016 is 50 basis points higher than the median value in December, at least for the dots plotted here.	62	6
201403	854	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	As somebody pointed out, it’s a different set of people, as one person has dropped out of that.	62	6
201403	855	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	As for whether that will have a market effect, I think it is the case that market participants look at the dot plot and take it as a signal of something.	62	6
201403	856	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	If you go back and you look at the dealer surveys for December and March, you see some upward shift in the expected path of the funds rate.	62	6
201403	857	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	You have to remember that from December to January, things looked a lot better, and then from January to now, they look somewhat worse.	62	6
201403	858	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	The net, I think, is still a positive for the dealer survey projections for the funds rate, but not 50 basis points.	62	6
201403	859	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	And so it certainly is possible that market participants will read this as saying something about the Committee’s intentions that is a little bit more hawkish, a little bit tougher, than they perhaps expected, leading them to mark up the path for the expected funds rate a little bit further.	62	6
201403	860	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Well, it is what it is, whatever we have put down there.	62	6
201403	861	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	So I guess it’s just something that you may be asked, Madam Chair.	62	6
201403	862	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I’m sure you’ll be well prepared for the press conference.	62	6
201403	863	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	No doubt.	62	6
201403	864	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Here’s my observation:  When I signed off on our year-end financial statements under Sarbanes-Oxley at the Dallas Fed, my little Bank, I had an unrealized loss of a little over $2 billion, and I was happy to see on chart 15 that that’s come back up.	62	6
201403	865	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	But over time, if we’re successful and the economy grows, the good outcome is that we will see a depreciation of our portfolio, particularly with the MBS holdings.	62	6
201403	866	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Even if they’re held to maturity, we’re going to see some movement there.	62	6
201403	867	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	As much coordinated guidance as we can have in terms of answering any questions that may arise would be helpful.	62	6
201403	868	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Just an observation, Madam Chair.	62	6
201403	869	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	My question may be a little esoteric, but I want to ask the Desk, since we have the advantage of having you here.	62	6
201403	870	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	In Kurt Lewis’s paper about dealer financing terms that was sent out, there was a reference to synthetic prime brokerage, and even though it was an excellent memo, it didn’t quite explain the significance of this financing technique.	62	6
201403	871	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Here’s the question: Is this simply a way to escape regulators’ notice?	62	6
201403	872	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	What is it, and how is it being utilized?	62	6
201403	873	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	I’m not an expert in that.	62	6
201403	874	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	I don’t know if MA has got a view.	62	6
201403	875	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	I have a modest view.	62	6
201403	876	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	This is something that we’re watching as a potential change in the way that markets operate, in the way that firms take on risk.	62	6
201403	877	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	We want to be sure we’re on top of it because of concern that, over time, this could become a very substantial way to take on risk that isn’t being appropriately managed and measured.	62	6
201403	878	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	We had been hearing from contacts in markets that this was something that was developing, and we wanted to, in some sense, lay down a baseline as to what this looks like, who the participants are, and so on.	62	6
201403	879	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	The basic thought is that, instead of going to a prime broker and engaging in purchases of assets and financing them, instead you can do essentially the same risk- taking by engaging in derivatives transactions and doing those through synthetic prime brokerage.	62	6
201403	880	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	So this was a first foray into this business, to try to understand it better—who are the participants, how big is it—and it’s something that we’ll be monitoring to see if it becomes a really big deal that we should worry about.	62	6
201403	881	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Thank you.	62	6
201403	882	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	62	6
201403	883	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201403	884	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I am going to follow up on President Fisher’s question about chart 15.	62	6
201403	885	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I was interested in the reactions, if any, in the media and in the public to the documentation of an unrealized loss.	62	6
201403	886	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	You have to look hard to find it in the financial statements.	62	6
201403	887	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	I didn’t see any real coverage of it.	62	6
201403	888	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	There was much more interest in the H..1 that came out the night before because of the large drop in Treasury holdings held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.	62	6
201403	889	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I will just note, Madam Chair, that if people are concerned about the SEP, I think we do have an opportunity to resubmit.	62	6
201403	890	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62	6
201403	891	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Good observation.	62	6
201403	892	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	62	6
201403	893	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201403	894	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Simon, on the first page, chart 3, you show three-year inflation swaps.	62	6
201403	895	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	I think you made some comment about these countries and their inflation targets.	62	6
201403	896	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	For the United States, is this CPI or PCE inflation?	62	6
201403	897	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	It is CPI, and I thought of mentioning that it is running below 2.5 percent, but it is not as far below as the red line is.	62	6
201403	898	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	The green line is actually pretty close to that.	62	6
201403	899	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	62	6
201403	900	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	That was really my question.	62	6
201403	901	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	A 2 percent PCE target translates into what for CPI?	62	6
201403	902	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	What is the translation you would suggest—2.3 percent, 2.5 percent?	62	6
201403	903	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	I’m not the expert.	62	6
201403	904	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	We have experts.	62	6
201403	905	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	It probably adds a couple of tenths.	62	6
201403	906	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	So, Simon, your first comment was three- to five-tenths.	62	6
201403	907	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62	6
201403	908	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	But I’m not the expert.	62	6
201403	909	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	62	6
201403	910	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	All right.	62	6
201403	911	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Interesting.	62	6
201403	912	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	One more question, a follow-up on Eric’s, I guess.	62	6
201403	913	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Taking the dealer survey on policy expectations, would you say that the dealers are basically assuming that coming out of this meeting we will be maintaining our stance of accommodation or—or what?	62	6
201403	914	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62	6
201403	915	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Nearly all of the dealers—and we try and ask a question to get at this—think that what you are trying to do with the statement, the SEP, and the press conference is to keep market expectations about where they are.	62	6
201403	916	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Quite a few people think that will be hard to do, partly because changes in the forward guidance are hard to execute.	62	6
201403	917	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	They don’t have access to the SEP right now.	62	6
201403	918	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	You could think that the SEP doesn’t give the same signal.	62	6
201403	919	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Then that would cause issues that I think I addressed with the two questions I got before.	62	6
201403	920	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Madam Chair, if I could, I would like to take the opportunity to ask the staff or someone to write us an opinion on what the appropriate wedge is between PCE and CPI inflation, because I wasn’t actually expecting as low a number as two-tenths.	62	6
201403	921	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	When I have asked before, I was thinking I had heard more like between three- and five-tenths.	62	6
201403	922	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	And I think it’s increasingly important for us to have a better feel for that issue.	62	6
201403	923	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	I think Jeremy Rudd has an update.	62	6
201403	924	2014-03-19	meeting	RUDD	The table that I have shows that the gap between headline PCE and CPI, on a current-methods basis, has averaged about 35 basis points per year for the past, say, 11 or 12 years.	62	6
201403	925	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	62	6
201403	926	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	62	6
201403	927	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Two decimal places.	62	6
201403	928	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Any further questions for Simon?	62	6
201403	929	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62	6
201403	930	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	If not, we need a motion to ratify domestic open market operations since January.	63	6
201403	931	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	So moved.	63	6
201403	932	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	63	6
201403	933	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63	6
201403	934	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s then turn to our briefings on the economic situation, and David Wilcox will start us off.	11	1
201403	935	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11	1
201403	936	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	I’ll be referring to the packet that is creatively titled “Material for Forecast Summary.”	11	1
201403	937	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	As shown in the top-left panel by the gap between the red and black lines, the indicators that have been published since the January Tealbook caused us to revise down our near-term forecast for GDP growth in the March Tealbook by a sizable amount.	11	1
201403	938	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see in the table to the right by comparing the first two lines, the indicators that were published late last week rearranged the quarterly pattern of GDP growth a little further but left the overall profile of activity broadly unrevised.	11	1
201403	939	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	This morning’s report on housing starts and permits was a little weaker than we had expected and would take another tenth out of GDP growth in each of the first and second quarters of this year relative to what’s shown in your exhibit.	11	1
201403	940	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	Meanwhile, in the labor market, payroll employment growth has been roughly in line with our expectations in the January Tealbook after taking account as best we can of likely weather effects, but once again the unemployment rate has come in a little lower than we expected.	11	1
201403	941	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	Finally, there has been essentially no news on the inflation front.	11	1
201403	942	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	As you know from the Tealbook, we spent a great deal of effort this past round trying to discern how much of the downward surprise to our near-term GDP estimates could be traced to the unusually severe weather that several of you experienced firsthand this winter.	11	1
201403	943	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	(As one piece of quantitative evidence, the “W” word appears 60 times in Tealbook A, 25 times in the Beige Book’s national summary, and—at last count—15 times in this briefing alone.	11	1
201403	944	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	I got tired of counting after that.) Our Tealbook assessment was heavily informed by an extensive empirical investigation undertaken by Charlie Gilbert, a member of our Industrial Output section, which is summarized in a box in the Tealbook.	11	1
201403	945	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	For this exercise, Charlie used daily data from roughly a thousand individual NOAA weather stations to construct measures of extreme weather events at the county level; he then aggregated those readings to the national level using customized activity-related weights and used the resulting measures to explain the behavior of four key monthly economic indicators.	11	1
201403	946	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	With these highly detailed metrics, Charlie was able to detect noticeable effects from both cold and snow on housing starts and auto sales and some restraint of extreme cold on retail sales as well.	11	1
201403	947	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	Payroll employment seems less sensitive to snow or cold, though the average length of the workweek seems more so.	11	1
201403	948	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	Adding up all the pieces, and taking account of the possibility that some of the weather-related hit to final purchases was likely buffered by inventories, our best guess—as shown on line 5 of the table—is that bad weather may have held down GDP growth this quarter by about four-tenths of a percentage point; next quarter, we expect spending and production to rebound, with no net effect on the level of output after the third quarter.	11	1
201403	949	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	We also think that adverse weather probably had little effect on the unemployment rate and only a modest effect on payroll employment.	11	1
201403	950	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	Some outside analysts have circulated estimates much larger than ours.	11	1
201403	951	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	While we would be the first to acknowledge that a good deal of uncertainty surrounds any assessment of weather effects, including ours, we are skeptical that recent weather effects could have been as large as some of the more adventuresome estimates would suggest.	11	1
201403	952	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	Our skepticism is born of issues of timing, location, and sector: Some of the unexpected softness in spending predates the period of bad weather; some occurred in areas of the country that did not have bad weather; and some occurred in categories of spending that probably are not very sensitive to bad weather.	11	1
201403	953	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	Thus, in our estimation, even adjusting for weather effects, the recent data point to a somewhat weaker profile of GDP growth than we had expected in January.	11	1
201403	954	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	As is likely more firmly emblazoned in my memory than yours, a rush of stronger data a few short months ago had encouraged us to mark up our GDP projection in the January Tealbook.	11	1
201403	955	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	It now appears that some of this optimism was misplaced.	11	1
201403	956	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	Thus, it is useful to go one step further back and compare the March forecast to the one we made in December, as I have done in the box in the middle-right panel.	11	1
201403	957	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	The first two lines in the box compare our forecasts of GDP growth over the four quarters ending in the second quarter of this year—a period over which weather effects should come close to washing out; our assessment of GDP growth over that period is essentially unrevised relative to the December Tealbook.	11	1
201403	958	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	Nonetheless, as can be seen by comparing lines 3 and 4, the unemployment rate appears on track to come in three- tenths below our December Tealbook projection.	11	1
201403	959	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	As I highlighted in my January presentation, this situation—a downside surprise in the unemployment rate despite real GDP growth about in line with our forecast— has been present to a greater or lesser degree for the past couple of years.	11	1
201403	960	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	In part, we have responded to these forecast errors by trimming our assumption for the growth rate of potential GDP, and we took a further step along these lines in the most recent forecast.	11	1
201403	961	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	Separately and additionally, this time around we took potential GDP growth in 2015 and 2016 down a touch further to reflect our revised—but still provisional— assessment of the effect that the Affordable Care Act may have on labor supply.	11	1
201403	962	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	The bottom-left panel shows the net effect of these latest revisions on the GDP gap.	11	1
201403	963	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	By the end of the near term, the output gap is about unchanged relative to our January projection.	11	1
201403	964	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	Over the medium term, the revisions that we made to potential output growth pass through one-for-one to our projection for actual output; as we made only minor changes to our other conditioning factors—the only one worth noting being a slightly higher path for the dollar—the projected output gap from the middle of this year onward is little revised relative to January.	11	1
201403	965	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	Our unemployment rate forecast is similarly essentially unrevised relative to January.	11	1
201403	966	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	In the past, we have emphasized that we would need to see a pickup in GDP growth in order to be assured that labor market conditions would continue to improve.	11	1
201403	967	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	With the changes to our supply-side assumptions that we have made over the past few rounds, even continued growth along the lines of what we saw, on average, during 2013 would eventually be sufficient to achieve the employment-related goal in the Committee’s dual mandate.	11	1
201403	968	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	It wouldn’t be speedy, but it would ultimately get the job done.	11	1
201403	969	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	Turning to the other component of the dual mandate, the incoming data on core PCE inflation—shown in the bottom-right panel—have been close to our expectations.	11	1
201403	970	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	After the Tealbook was closed, we received the February PPI and—this morning—the February CPI; in terms of their implications for our PCE projections, these releases were also close to our expectations.	11	1
201403	971	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	With slack, inflation expectations, and core import prices all little revised from our January forecast, we have made essentially no change to our core inflation forecast; likewise, our projection for headline inflation (not shown) is also mostly unrevised over the medium term.	11	1
201403	972	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	We therefore continue to expect a modest pickup in inflation over the projection period— though at this point, such a pickup is completely prospective.	11	1
201403	973	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	Indeed, the anticipated increase is modest enough—especially relative to the usual volatility of the data—that I expect it will be difficult to discriminate in real time as to whether we are seeing the slow attainment of the Committee’s 2 percent target, or whether inflation is actually anchored at some slightly lower level.	11	1
201403	974	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	Steve Kamin will now continue our projection.	11	1
201403	975	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	Several weeks ago, I accompanied Chair Yellen to the meetings of the G-20 and the BIS held in Sydney, Australia.	11	1
201403	976	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	Although 20 hours of flying is an awfully long way to go for some meetings, these discussions proved unusually productive.	11	1
201403	977	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	In their lead-up, the media was rife with comments that the Federal Reserve was oblivious to events beyond our borders, that its tapering had contributed to the eruption of financial stresses earlier this year, and that once normalization of monetary policy began in earnest, it would substantially disrupt emerging financial markets.	11	1
201403	978	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	In Sydney, Chair Yellen convincingly pushed back against these assertions, emphasizing the weight that the Committee places on global economic developments and underscoring how, by supporting US economic growth and by clearly communicating its monetary policy intentions, the Federal Reserve will enact policy that should also redound to the benefit of our trading partners, including the emerging market economies (or EMEs).	11	1
201403	979	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	Indeed, that view underpins our staff projection, in which the global economy converges toward normality by the end of the forecast period.	11	1
201403	980	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	In the advanced foreign economies, real GDP growth runs at 2 percent this year, about the same as last year, and rises to 2¼ percent in 2015 and 2016 as the euro-area economy picks up steam.	11	1
201403	981	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	While hardly a boom, this expansion is sufficient to reduce the amount of slack in these economies to below 1 percent of GDP by the end of the forecast period.	11	1
201403	982	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	The emerging market economies, broadly speaking, are already in the neighborhood of full capacity.	11	1
201403	983	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	In both the previous and current quarters, the pace of expansion in the EMEs looks to have been rather subdued at about 3½ percent, nearly a percentage point below its estimated trend pace, as China and Latin America have shown surprising weakness.	11	1
201403	984	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	However, with some bounceback in these economies, we are projecting EME growth to strengthen to roughly 4½ percent in 2015 and 2016.	11	1
201403	985	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	The narrowing of output gaps in the advanced economies, along with the return of inflation back toward targets—which are generally at 2 percent—will naturally imply some normalization of monetary policies.	11	1
201403	986	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	Among the major foreign central banks, we expect the Bank of England to be the first out of the gate, as UK GDP growth has been brisk and the unemployment rate has fallen nearly to the BOE’s 7 percent threshold.	11	1
201403	987	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	In consequence, the BOE has already announced new forward guidance, as Simon has described, and we see it lifting the policy rate starting early next year.	11	1
201403	988	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	The euro-area economy has been weaker and inflation has been lower than in Britain, so we do not see the ECB raising rates until 2016, and it might even loosen further if the recovery flags.	11	1
201403	989	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	Finally, the BOJ is still in the process of easing policy via asset purchases, and, in fact, we expect it to expand that program sometime soon; however, in our projection, the BOJ completes these purchases in 2015 and implements its first rate hike at the end of 2016.	11	1
201403	990	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	As I noted earlier, during our meetings in Sydney, Chair Yellen and I frequently heard concerns that once monetary policies in the advanced economies began to tighten, this could be quite disruptive for EMEs.	11	1
201403	991	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	In the staff outlook, with the Fed and other central banks communicating their policy intentions as clearly as possible, markets are expected to anticipate the rate hikes so that once they occur, they should not exert large and sustained effects on yields, exchange rates, and other asset prices.	11	1
201403	992	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	In this regard, we take some comfort from the relatively tranquil introduction of tapering last December.	11	1
201403	993	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	Of course, the events of the past year underscore how difficult it is to foretell market responses to our policies, and there may well be segments of the markets that are surprised by even the most clearly telegraphed policy actions.	11	1
201403	994	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	But our sense is that, as long as the EMEs are growing solidly—in part because of the recovery in the advanced economies—and as long as the most vulnerable EMEs are making progress toward better fundamentals, they should be able to weather the market volatility that might arise around the time of policy tightening.	11	1
201403	995	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	However, if at the time we start raising rates, EMEs are struggling to maintain economic growth and continue to face concerns about their desirability as an investment destination, the risks are considerably higher that our policy normalization could have adverse spillovers abroad, a scenario we explored in the Tealbook.	11	1
201403	996	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	In light of this concern, a number of developments have been quite worrisome.	11	1
201403	997	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	First, many Latin American economies have been struggling over the past year and, although we are projecting improved performance down the road, the most recent data have not given us much confidence.	11	1
201403	998	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	In Mexico, despite the pickup in US growth, GDP expanded at only a ¾ percent rate in the first three quarters of last year and stayed at that anemic pace in the fourth.	11	1
201403	999	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	A number of factors have been cited for the recent weakness—auto plants that have been shut down for retooling, fiscal policy that has been less expansionary than expected, and confidence that has been damaged by uncertainty over recent tax hikes—but a solidly grounded expansion should have been more resilient to such shocks.	11	1
201403	1000	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	In Brazil, where the economy appears set to flatten out yet again in the current quarter after a very weak 2013, we see more fundamental reasons for a slump:  sharp hikes in policy rates to contain high inflation, structural bottlenecks that are depressing investment and productivity, and the drag from even worse performance in its neighbors, Argentina and Venezuela.	11	1
201403	1001	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	We are anticipating that Mexico and Brazil will shake off their malaise by next year, but if they are still struggling when the Fed and other advanced economies start raising rates, this could weigh heavily on investor sentiment and significantly worsen their economic and financial difficulties.	11	1
201403	1002	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	A second and even more worrisome risk that could intensify any spillovers from policy normalization, and which would be injurious to many economies in its own right, is a substantially sharper slowdown in growth in China than we are currently projecting.	11	1
201403	1003	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	Based on very weak data for January and February released after the Tealbook was finalized, we now estimate that Chinese GDP growth dropped from 8 percent in the fourth quarter to 6¼ percent in the first, well below our January projection.	11	1
201403	1004	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	Our best guess is that the measures the authorities took last year to push up interest rates and rein in lending, especially in the shadow banking sector, led to a greater pullback in spending than we had expected.	11	1
201403	1005	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	With the People’s Bank of China having allowed interest rates to fall back more recently, and also having engineered a depreciation of the currency, we are projecting growth to bounce back from its current low.	11	1
201403	1006	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	However, after reaching 7¼ percent next quarter, our forecast for Chinese growth edges back down as potential output decelerates and the economy rebalances away from investment and net exports.	11	1
201403	1007	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	We had already marked down our medium-term outlook for China a touch for the March Tealbook, and the most recent data leave us less confident still about our projection.	11	1
201403	1008	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	A sharper slowing of the Chinese economy would by itself weigh on global commodity and financial markets, creating problems for many EMEs.	11	1
201403	1009	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	It would be even more injurious if it triggered problems in the Chinese property and financial sectors that, in turn, caused a much deeper downturn.	11	1
201403	1010	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	At this point, I should probably remind you that our baseline forecast for the global economy is reasonably benign.	11	1
201403	1011	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	Moreover, I can even think of some upside risks to the outlook, such as faster growth in the euro area than the tepid recovery we are predicting.	11	1
201403	1012	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	But I would be remiss if I did not mention Ukraine.	11	1
201403	1013	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	With its economy contracting sharply and the government running out of cash, Ukraine is in very dire straits.	11	1
201403	1014	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	Even if Ukraine succeeds in getting an IMF program, fulfilling program conditions and avoiding default on its obligations will be challenging.	11	1
201403	1015	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	As long as its problems stay mainly in the local economic and political sphere, including the spillovers to Russia that are already taking place, effects on the US and global economy should be limited.	11	1
201403	1016	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	However, if the confrontation between Russia and the West intensifies and leads to global financial market disruptions, the risks to the global outlook become considerably more pronounced.	11	1
201403	1017	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	Laura Lipscomb, from Monetary Affairs, will continue with a briefing on the SEP submissions.	11	1
201403	1018	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	Thank you.	11	1
201403	1019	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	I will be referring to the packet labeled “Material for Briefing on the Summary of Economic Projections.”	11	1
201403	1020	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	Exhibit 1 shows the trajectories of your forecasts for key economic variables under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy.	11	1
201403	1021	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	The top panel shows a gradual pickup in real GDP growth this year and next.	11	1
201403	1022	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	Subsequently, in 2016, real GDP growth begins to move back toward its longer-run rate.	11	1
201403	1023	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	Your projections for the unemployment rate, shown in the second panel, decline gradually over the forecast period and, by the fourth quarter of 2016, reach levels that the majority of you view as broadly in line with your individual judgments of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.	11	1
201403	1024	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	The bottom two panels show inflation rising over the next few years; almost all of you see it remaining at or below the Committee’s 2 percent objective.	11	1
201403	1025	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	Exhibit 2 compares your current projections with those in the December Summary of Economic Projections and the March Tealbook.	11	1
201403	1026	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	As shown in the top panel, in general, you made only small revisions to your forecasts for real GDP growth.	11	1
201403	1027	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	Most of you revised down projected growth in 2014 slightly, with many noting that some of the softness in recent data may reflect the transitory effects of unusually severe winter weather.	11	1
201403	1028	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	More broadly, the top ends of the central tendencies for growth in each year and in the longer run all moved down somewhat.	11	1
201403	1029	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	As shown in the second panel, the central tendencies of your forecasts for the unemployment rate shifted down by roughly two-tenths in each year of the projection, likely reflecting the actual decline in the unemployment rate in recent months.	11	1
201403	1030	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	In addition, the central tendency of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment narrowed to 5.2 to 5.6 percent.	11	1
201403	1031	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	In the bottom panels, almost all of you left your inflation projections nearly unchanged.	11	1
201403	1032	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	The Tealbook forecast for economic growth is at or near the upper end of your central tendencies over the projection period, while the Tealbook projections for the unemployment rate move from the middle of your central tendency this year to just below the central tendency in 2016.	11	1
201403	1033	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	For inflation, the Tealbook projections are at the bottom of your central tendencies throughout the projection period.	11	1
201403	1034	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	Exhibit 3 provides an overview of your assessments of the appropriate path for the target federal funds rate.	11	1
201403	1035	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	As shown in the top panel, most of you continue to think that it will be appropriate to begin raising the federal funds rate in 2015.	11	1
201403	1036	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	The middle panel of the exhibit provides your current assessments of the appropriate level of the target federal funds rate at the end of each year of the forecast period and over the longer run.	11	1
201403	1037	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	Although your expectations about the year in which it will be appropriate for the federal funds rate to leave the effective lower bound are little changed, a number of you marked up your target funds rates over the projection period:  The median funds rate projection now stands at 1 percent in 2015 and 2.25 percent in 2016.	11	1
201403	1038	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	This compares with 75 basis points and 1.75 percent, respectively, in your December projections.	11	1
201403	1039	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	On average, the changes to your target federal funds rate projections for the end of 2016 were roughly consistent with the revisions to your unemployment rate projections, assuming a policy reaction function similar to the standard (noninertial) version of the Taylor (1999) rule.	11	1
201403	1040	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	Fourteen of you judge that the funds rate at the end of 2016 will still be below your assessment of its longer-run level.	11	1
201403	1041	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	With regard to securities purchases, almost all of you indicated that your assessment of appropriate policy was in line with the assumption in the Tealbook baseline forecast, which has purchases continuing to slow in measured steps and concluding before the end of this year.	11	1
201403	1042	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	Two of you thought it appropriate to reduce the pace of purchases more rapidly and end the purchase program somewhat sooner than assumed in the Tealbook.	11	1
201403	1043	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	Exhibit 4 depicts the economic conditions that you anticipate at the end of the year in which you judge that it will be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate above its effective lower bound.	11	1
201403	1044	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	Because liftoff likely won’t occur at year-end, the chart shown is only illustrative of the market conditions around the time of liftoff.	11	1
201403	1045	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	Your projections for the unemployment rate at the end of the year of liftoff range from about 5¼ to 6¼ percent, with a median near 5½ percent, while your inflation projections are clustered between 1½ and 2½ percent, with a median of 1¾ percent.	11	1
201403	1046	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	For the 13 participants who view it as appropriate to first raise the target federal funds rate in 2015 (shown by the white diamonds), all project that the unemployment rate will be below 6 percent, and all but one judge that inflation will be at or below the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent at the end of the year of liftoff.	11	1
201403	1047	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	The final exhibit reviews your assessments of the uncertainty and risks surrounding your economic projections.	11	1
201403	1048	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	As shown in the top two panels in the column on the left, nearly all of you judge the current level of uncertainty about real GDP growth and unemployment to be broadly similar to the average level of the past 20 years.	11	1
201403	1049	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	A majority of you also judge the level of uncertainty about inflation, shown in the lower two panels in the column on the left, to be broadly similar to the average over the past 20 years.	11	1
201403	1050	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	As shown in the top two panels in the column on the right, as in December, almost all of you judge the risks to real GDP growth and unemployment to be broadly balanced.	11	1
201403	1051	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	As shown in the bottom two panels in the right-hand column, the majority of you see the risks to inflation as balanced, but five of you now see the risks as weighted to the downside, slightly more than in December.	11	1
201403	1052	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	A few of those who saw risks to growth or inflation as weighted to the downside noted concerns about geopolitical factors or external demand.	11	1
201403	1053	2014-03-19	meeting	LIPSCOMB	That concludes my prepared remarks.	11	1
201403	1054	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	12	1
201403	1055	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for our presenters?	12	1
201403	1056	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	12	1
201403	1057	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	I apologize for my inquisitiveness today, but I have two questions.	12	1
201403	1058	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	The first one is for David.	12	1
201403	1059	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	Your memo on the weather effect, line 5, basically says that it washes out over the course of the year, which was basically my intuition.	12	1
201403	1060	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	So if people look at our SEP median forecast and see real GDP is three-tenths lower in 2015 and four-tenths lower in 2016, do you think they will assume that weather had no effect on that because it would have washed out over the course of the year?	12	1
201403	1061	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	As you think about private-sector forecasts and your own forecast, do you think it’s a standard assumption that it will all wash out over the course of a year?	12	1
201403	1062	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	My second question actually goes to the alternative scenario about emerging markets in the Risks and Uncertainty section in the Tealbook A.	12	1
201403	1063	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	You have the financial crisis in the EMEs, and the result is a leveling-off of the unemployment rate at 6½ percent.	12	1
201403	1064	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	What’s interesting about this one stress is that it’s different from the others, which are getting more at plausible differences that people might have in their baseline forecasts.	12	1
201403	1065	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	This is getting a little bit more at a financial-stability type of stress, for which I commend you.	12	1
201403	1066	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think it’s a good one to be thinking about.	12	1
201403	1067	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	But I do wonder if some of the financial spillovers are incorporated in the modeling that you’re doing.	12	1
201403	1068	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	For example, European banks have a much larger exposure to emerging markets than US banks.	12	1
201403	1069	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	And so if they are having a stress test in Europe at the same time that this emerging market financial crisis occurs, would you see more of a flow coming through Europe?	12	1
201403	1070	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	Would you pick up those secondary factors in the way that you’re doing the modeling?	12	1
201403	1071	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	I’ll go first.	12	1
201403	1072	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	In regard to the EME crisis simulation, we incorporate some types of financial effects on the US economy, but we don’t incorporate others.	12	1
201403	1073	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	Aside from the strictly macroeconomic effects that we incorporate—which are a bunch of shocks to the EMEs themselves that lower their output as well as flight-to-safety shocks that push up the dollar, both of which reduce our trade balance and have a direct impact on US GDP—we do also incorporate a number of financial market shocks in the United States itself, specifically upward shocks to corporate bond spreads and to equity premiums that are in part offset by downward shocks to Treasury yields as part of that flight to safety.	12	1
201403	1074	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	So those are the factors that we do build in, and they are factors that our DSGE model can accommodate.	12	1
201403	1075	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	You mentioned an additional factor, which is the possibility that because European banks are very exposed to emerging markets, and because US banks of course are very exposed to Europe, that could be an additional channel of spillover and contagion, and we have definitely thought of that.	12	1
201403	1076	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	In the QS surveillance report on financial stability that we prepared in December, there is actually some discussion of that, including a table that directly shows that certain economies, particularly the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Spain, have pretty heavy exposures to the five fragile EMEs, and that US banks in turn have pretty heavy exposure to the United Kingdom, less to the others.	12	1
201403	1077	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	So that’s a plausible channel of contagion.	12	1
201403	1078	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	It is not one that we have built directly into our simulation, but we could think about doing that.	12	1
201403	1079	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	I would note, additionally, that if you think about these different channels, the United Kingdom, for example, has somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 percent of capital as exposure to EMEs, and then US banks have something on the order of 10 percent of Tier 1 capital in exposure to UK banks.	12	1
201403	1080	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	Probably that type of channel alone might not be enough to give you too much bang for the buck in terms of an effect of an EME crisis on US banks, although it would be material.	12	1
201403	1081	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	However, noting that the euro-area economy more generally is pretty fragile, and knowing that the situation of European banks in general is fragile and dependent on the outcome for the euro-area economy, if a crisis in EMEs derailed the euro-area recovery, and if it led to the types of fears of meltdown that were so prevalent a couple of years ago, then that could truly be an avenue for deep contagion through Europe back to the States.	12	1
201403	1082	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	I think the answer to your question about weather-related effects is “yes,” in the sense that I think they should wash out within the calendar year 2014.	12	1
201403	1083	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	A convenient happenstance of the timing of the storms was that we basically don’t see any effect in the fourth quarter of last year.	12	1
201403	1084	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	So it all starts in the first quarter of this year.	12	1
201403	1085	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	And then we’ve got some complicated razzmatazz built in with payback, and so forth.	12	1
201403	1086	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	But that all works out within the four-quarter span from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of this year.	12	1
201403	1087	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	I haven’t seen any outside analysis that materially deviates from that.	12	1
201403	1088	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota?	12	1
201403	1089	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201403	1090	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I have a question for David:  The FOMC statement talks about the Committee “monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.”	12	1
201403	1091	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would welcome counsel from the staff about what kind of evidence we should be looking for.	12	1
201403	1092	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t have anything that is not obvious.	12	1
201403	1093	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	Realized inflation would be good to see, inflation projections moving up.	12	1
201403	1094	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	I’m a partisan of ours, so I’d like to see evidence that convinces us.	12	1
201403	1095	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	What would do that would be continued progress on reducing margins of slack.	12	1
201403	1096	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	That will add mechanically, I think, about three-tenths to our projection between now and full attainment of maximum sustainable use of resource utilization.	12	1
201403	1097	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	I think that some acceleration in measures of compensation would be consistent with that.	12	1
201403	1098	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	We’ve had compensation growing at the quite tepid rate of only about 2 percent.	12	1
201403	1099	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	A sort of rough rule of thumb is that something more in the neighborhood of 3½ percent might be consistent in the steady state, with 2 percent inflation and labor’s share holding constant at some level.	12	1
201403	1100	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	Those are a few of the key factors.	12	1
201403	1101	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	Bill, do you have anything material to add?	12	1
201403	1102	2014-03-19	meeting	WASCHER	No, that’s good.	12	1
201403	1103	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	12	1
201403	1104	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	12	1
201403	1105	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201403	1106	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	David, let’s see, today the unemployment rate is 6.7 percent.	12	1
201403	1107	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	The summary table that you put before us reminds us that the Tealbook has the unemployment rate in the second quarter of 2014 at 6½ percent.	12	1
201403	1108	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	In our June meeting, we will have the May employment report in front of us.	12	1
201403	1109	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	In terms of the Tealbook analysis, what would you say the probability is that the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent at that meeting?	12	1
201403	1110	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	For May, which would be the last report we would have in the scenario that you posed, we have penciled in an unemployment rate equal to 6½ percent.	12	1
201403	1111	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	I suppose there is some probability, which I can’t compute in my head, that we might actually be correct.	12	1
201403	1112	2014-03-19	meeting		[Laughter]	12	1
201403	1113	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let’s round that.	12	1
201403	1114	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	We could round that to zero.	12	1
201403	1115	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	That would leave three employment reports to be received between now and the June meeting.	12	1
201403	1116	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t have any reason to believe that the risks are skewed either to the upside or downside importantly over that period of three employment reports.	12	1
201403	1117	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	So I think I’d say that it’s about a 50/50 proposition that unemployment would be either at or above 6½ percent.	12	1
201403	1118	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	12	1
201403	1119	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher?	12	1
201403	1120	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201403	1121	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	To my surprise, I am within the central tendency of all those dots on every front.	12	1
201403	1122	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Truth in advertising.	12	1
201403	1123	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	You can revise, Richard.	12	1
201403	1124	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	12	1
201403	1125	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I don’t plan to revise, but I do want to ask a question of David on the natural rate—the green line on the unemployment rate chart.	12	1
201403	1126	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	CBO projections of the natural rate go back to the historic year of 1949, Madam Chair, and they range between 5 percent in the early 2000s to 6¼ percent in the 1970s.	12	1
201403	1127	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Even though it’s hard to tell from the scale, they average about 5.6 percent over that timeframe, 1949 to now.	12	1
201403	1128	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	On the scale that you have here, it’s hard to see, but basically you have us going from 5½ percent to 5.2 percent.	12	1
201403	1129	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	So my question is, why 5.2 percent?	12	1
201403	1130	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Where does that come from?	12	1
201403	1131	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Why would we be below the historical average and not closer to what we saw in the 1970s?	12	1
201403	1132	2014-03-19	meeting	WASCHER	I think a lot of the variation in the natural rate over time has been associated with demographics.	12	1
201403	1133	2014-03-19	meeting	WASCHER	So when there was the big influx of teenagers into the labor market in the 1970s, that drove up the natural rate because they tend to have high unemployment rates on average or to change jobs a lot and have periods of unemployment in between.	12	1
201403	1134	2014-03-19	meeting	WASCHER	As we saw the aging of the population, the natural rate looked like it was coming down.	12	1
201403	1135	2014-03-19	meeting	WASCHER	In the mid- 2000s, or 2007, say, we thought the natural rate had come down to about 5 percent, and that seemed consistent with what we were seeing in terms of inflation at the time.	12	1
201403	1136	2014-03-19	meeting	WASCHER	The demographics are a relatively neutral factor since then, and so we have it basically going back down to where it was prior to the financial crisis by the end of the medium-term forecast period.	12	1
201403	1137	2014-03-19	meeting	WASCHER	Our assumption is that for the most part labor markets are back to functioning normally.	12	1
201403	1138	2014-03-19	meeting	WASCHER	We are not seeing the types of mismatches and things that we think drove up the natural rate during the financial crisis and the subsequent recession.	12	1
201403	1139	2014-03-19	meeting	WASCHER	So it is basically an assumption that labor markets are going to eventually return to more normal functioning.	12	1
201403	1140	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	The reason I ask is that obviously it’s important if you are trying to get a sense of what the slack is and how far away we are.	12	1
201403	1141	2014-03-19	meeting	WASCHER	Yes.	12	1
201403	1142	2014-03-19	meeting	WASCHER	I don’t want to overstate our confidence.	12	1
201403	1143	2014-03-19	meeting	WASCHER	There is a lot of uncertainty around any estimates.	12	1
201403	1144	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	I would say that that uncertainty is two-sided.	12	1
201403	1145	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Yes.	12	1
201403	1146	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	With regard to the razzmatazz on the weather effect—I love the term “razzmatazz,” by the way—you mentioned automobiles, housing prices and housing activity, consumer activity, and so on.	12	1
201403	1147	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	And I’ll mention this a little bit in my go-round, but I think logistics are also a big part of it.	12	1
201403	1148	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	If you talk to the rails, it is very hard to move trains and trucks, to find drivers, et cetera.	12	1
201403	1149	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	So it may not have affected wages, but in terms of logistics—	12	1
201403	1150	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I’m impressed that Charlie could look at a thousand NOAA weather data points and assemble quite an impressive analysis—but the effect is the same, you expect a snapback.	12	1
201403	1151	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	But I wouldn’t ignore the gearing of the economy and how it was affected, whether it’s river transport, rail transport, air transport, et cetera.	12	1
201403	1152	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I just wanted to make that point.	12	1
201403	1153	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	And then the last point is that I would be very careful not to put Brazil and Mexico in the same basket.	12	1
201403	1154	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I know you didn’t mean to, but they are geared entirely differently.	12	1
201403	1155	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	One is significantly manufacturing-export driven—the northern one—and the southern one is tremendously vulnerable to commodity prices.	12	1
201403	1156	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	You used them in the same sentence.	12	1
201403	1157	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I just wanted to warn you.	12	1
201403	1158	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Both have been underperforming, for sure, but in terms of the potential for recovery, they are geared to different demand functions.	12	1
201403	1159	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	I certainly take that point.	12	1
201403	1160	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	I guess I would just—	12	1
201403	1161	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Plus, they hate each other.	12	1
201403	1162	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	Excuse me?	12	1
201403	1163	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	Oh, yes.	12	1
201403	1164	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	Well, what I would note is that for the past year, I, and I believe you and others, have been very heartened by developments in Mexico, by the many reforms that they have passed—things look very promising.	12	1
201403	1165	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	So I have to say, I view with some disappointment the fact that their economy has been underperforming.	12	1
201403	1166	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	If that’s just due to a series of idiosyncratic shocks, and then the economy picks up, as we have it doing in our forecast, that is all well and good.	12	1
201403	1167	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	But when the economy is doing as relatively poorly as it has been doing for this amount of time, that does lead to concerns that maybe there is something underlying that that we are not picking up.	12	1
201403	1168	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	So that’s the source of my concern.	12	1
201403	1169	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Thank you.	12	1
201403	1170	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	President Fisher, the logistical kinds of bottlenecks that you are talking about are the types of situations that could give rise to a little inventory buffer.	12	1
201403	1171	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	So it’s a different thing, as you are implicitly pointing out, to try to discern a production effect than it is for the absorption, and in between, inventories could be playing an either intentional or unintentional buffering role.	12	1
201403	1172	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	A lot of the trucking and shipping phenomena that you describe could be in the unintentional category.	12	1
201403	1173	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	You saw that, by the way, in the sale of cereals through food retailers.	12	1
201403	1174	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	They were drawing down the inventory because they couldn’t get anything out of Battle Creek, Michigan.	12	1
201403	1175	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	So I think that point is correct.	12	1
201403	1176	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman Dudley.	12	1
201403	1177	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I was going to make an observation on the SEP, and if the staff want to react to it, they are very welcome to.	12	1
201403	1178	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	When I’m looking through the SEP, and I compare the changes in the 2016 numbers in terms of growth and inflation and unemployment, and then I compare those with the change in the interest rate projections, it seems like the change in the interest rate projection is pretty large relative to the change in the central tendency and, in fact, the ranges.	12	1
201403	1179	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	If you look at the unemployment rate, the changes are basically two-tenths at the top end and one-tenth at the bottom end, but the longer run is also being brought down by two-tenths at the top end.	12	1
201403	1180	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	On the range, there is a change of two-tenths at the top end, but that is offset by a one-tenth increase at the bottom end.	12	1
201403	1181	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	So basically you have a net change in the unemployment rate projection from December of, it looks like, one-tenth of 1 percentage point.	12	1
201403	1182	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	And if you look at the inflation numbers, they are basically unchanged for the central tendency, but they are actually lower for the range.	12	1
201403	1183	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	So you get a 50 basis point move in the interest rate projection for what essentially seems like a marginal change in the unemployment rate projection and a change in the inflation projections that actually goes the other way.	12	1
201403	1184	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	If one were looking at this from the outside, would one view this as all fitting together?	12	1
201403	1185	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	In contrast, I think the Tealbook forecast hangs together a lot better, because there you have upward revisions to inflation, downward revisions to unemployment, and then you have an upward revision to interest rates.	12	1
201403	1186	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me like we have a little bit of a challenge as a Committee here because either the SEP doesn’t hang together or there is just unbelievable interest rate sensitivity to incredibly minute changes in the unemployment rate.	12	1
201403	1187	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Well, you would expect, what, one-fourth of a point, two-tenths, on the interest rate for a movement of one-tenth in the unemployment rate with Taylor (1999), right?	12	1
201403	1188	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I certainly wouldn’t expect 50 basis points.	12	1
201403	1189	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	So I just throw that out there as an observation, and I’m curious if you have any reactions.	12	1
201403	1190	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	You don’t have to.	12	1
201403	1191	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	Well, I can’t speak for the 16 of you.	12	1
201403	1192	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	In terms of our forecast, though, just so you know what reflecting glass you are confronting—this situation motivates precisely our modus operandi of adopting a transparent and very mechanical approach to setting the monetary policy assumption.	12	1
201403	1193	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	So what we do, as best we can, is listen very carefully to the guidance that you give us, and we took that on board, for example, with respect to the liftoff date.	12	1
201403	1194	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	We interpreted the second quarter of 2015 as consistent with your statement in January that there would be a period of time between the cessation of asset purchases and the liftoff.	12	1
201403	1195	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	After that, we turn over the setting of the funds rate to the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.	12	1
201403	1196	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	That’s what we did in December.	12	1
201403	1197	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	That’s what we did now.	12	1
201403	1198	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	So, in some sense, the settings on the box that is churning out these results are unrevised.	12	1
201403	1199	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	And what we’re trying to do is project back to you a forecast that is coherent and iterated.	12	1
201403	1200	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	In other words, it takes on board the monetary policy.	12	1
201403	1201	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	So as best as we can, up to the limits of fallibility, the monetary policy assumption goes with the economic projection and the economic—	12	1
201403	1202	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	It feeds through mechanically.	12	1
201403	1203	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	Indeed.	12	1
201403	1204	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	And the economic projection goes with the monetary policy.	12	1
201403	1205	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	But policy in some sense is unrevised, and there is just a mechanical formula that drives the revisions that you are seeing in our funds rate assumption.	12	1
201403	1206	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota has a two-hander.	12	1
201403	1207	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	12	1
201403	1208	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201403	1209	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think the Vice Chairman raises some good points.	12	1
201403	1210	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m not one of the people who revised their outlook for the federal funds rate in 2016, under appropriate policy and all that—but one way to think about this is that participants might be reflecting their view of the headwinds that are prevailing at that time to give rise to those economic conditions.	12	1
201403	1211	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So it’s really about their valuation of what the appropriate intercept is in the Taylor rule, as opposed to anything else.	12	1
201403	1212	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And that’s hard to get at just through these questions.	12	1
201403	1213	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So the reason alternative B talks about the Committee keeping the fed funds rate unusually low, consistent with maximum employment and target inflation, is because headwinds are so strong.	12	1
201403	1214	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But if people change their evaluation of what those headwinds are, that’s going to lead to changes in what they think the appropriate fed funds rate is as well.	12	1
201403	1215	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	If I may, one point that’s worth thinking about is something that Thomas Laubach looked into.	12	1
201403	1216	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	He applied a noninertial Taylor (1999) rule to the SEP contributions for unemployment and inflation in December and in March and found he actually could explain, on average, essentially all of the change in the funds rate contributions.	12	1
201403	1217	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	There was a change in the coverage—who was submitting in December and in March—and that matters some as well, but in fact I think that, looking around the table, on average the people who are here were reflecting something like a Taylor (1999) rule in their contributions for the funds rate.	12	1
201403	1218	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	12	1
201403	1219	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201403	1220	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Steve, you helpfully drew our attention to a couple of potentially significant external risks, and I wonder if you could elaborate on both of them—that is, China and Ukraine.	12	1
201403	1221	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to China, the question is, what’s the magnitude of the risk?	12	1
201403	1222	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	If, for example, we hypothesize that instead of just slipping a bit, growth slipped pretty substantially—say, to And then, with respect to Ukraine—I know anything that’s geopolitical in origin is hard to trace through because in the first instance it’s not an economic event that follows on, but instead a set of reactions to a political event—but how would you see a potential problem in Ukraine spilling over into the rest of the world?	12	1
201403	1223	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Is it principally a geopolitical—that is, a military—conflict, or is it a debt issue?	12	1
201403	1224	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	And if the latter, to whom do they owe money and, particularly, how much do they owe to people other than Russians?	12	1
201403	1225	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	Let me start with Ukraine and I’ll work back to China.	12	1
201403	1226	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	On Ukraine, there are really quite a number of different channels by which a deepening of the crisis there could affect the global economy and the United States.	12	1
201403	1227	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	So let me start with in some sense the most normal channels:  Imagine that Ukraine is just an ordinary emerging market economy, not located where it is but, let’s say, in South America, and is having deep financial problems.	12	1
201403	1228	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	It’s getting an IMF program but is widely expected to have great difficulties.	12	1
201403	1229	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	Probably in that case the effect of its crisis deepening, leading it to default on some of its obligations, would be pretty small because, first, it’s a very small economy.	12	1
201403	1230	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	In terms of global trade, it accounts for less than 1 percent, and in terms of US trade, less than 1 percent.	12	1
201403	1231	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	So on the real side, it wouldn’t have too much of an effect.	12	1
201403	1232	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	On the debt side, it has a weight in the emerging market bond indexes that is probably, I think, in the neighborhood of 1 or 2 percent, and in terms of its weight in US bank exposure, less than 1 percent.	12	1
201403	1233	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	You name it—it’s very hard, when you consider the country by itself, to identify a big effect.	12	1
201403	1234	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	So just by virtue of that, those normal spillovers would not have such a big effect.	12	1
201403	1235	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	Those effects become somewhat more discernible if you want to suggest—now putting Ukraine back where it is—that its economy as it implodes could drag down Russia’s, which would not be that likely, frankly, if only economic factors were present, but could become relevant as the political factors become more present.	12	1
201403	1236	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	Russia, of course, is still not a particularly large world trader.	12	1
201403	1237	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	It probably accounts for somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 or 3 percent of world trade.	12	1
201403	1238	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	It only accounts for about 1 percent of US trade.	12	1
201403	1239	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	So, again, the impacts are not huge, even if Russia is brought into the fray, but they’re getting to be more material.	12	1
201403	1240	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	The impacts that are more concerning are the following:  If the political situation were to deepen such that trade relations between Russia, Ukraine, and Western Europe were damaged, Europe is highly dependent on them for natural gas, and in addition the weight of Russia and Ukraine in European trade is a bit higher—though it’s still not great, around 5 percent.	12	1
201403	1241	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	So that’s one concern, and given the fragility of the euro-area recovery, that’s a material risk.	12	1
201403	1242	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	But the bigger risk really is geopolitical, and that’s the risk that came to the fore a couple of weeks ago, right after the Crimea incursion, when global markets took a dive the following day.	12	1
201403	1243	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	They recovered on Tuesday when it became apparent to most investors that the events probably were not going to trigger a deep standoff, but that’s the risk that I think is most worrisome—that geopolitical problems leading to a real rift between the West and Russia could snowball in some way.	12	1
201403	1244	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	That would be extremely uncertain, and because markets don’t like uncertainty, they could really plunge.	12	1
201403	1245	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	And in that context, the impact on the economic expansion, particularly in Europe, could be quite damaging.	12	1
201403	1246	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	So that’s the Ukraine part.	12	1
201403	1247	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	On China, the scenario that we worry about is that some combination of slower growth in China interacts with the financial fragilities there—the property market, the shadow banking market, the tremendous amount of dodgy loans—and that those two combine to lead to a financial crisis that pushes growth down a lot further.	12	1
201403	1248	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	So then what’s the impact on the global economy and the United States?	12	1
201403	1249	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	It’s pretty hard to tell.	12	1
201403	1250	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	I will note that in the fall we did a simulation in the Tealbook that looked at a China hard landing.	12	1
201403	1251	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	In that scenario, Chinese growth fell to something in the neighborhood of 5 percent, which is considered quite low by historical standards, and aggregate foreign GDP growth ended up coming in some 3 percent below baseline.	12	1
201403	1252	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	That pushed US GDP about 1 percent or so below baseline, which actually seems moderately contained.	12	1
201403	1253	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	I am thinking as I review that simulation that it might not have given enough weight to financial factors that might attend those developments.	12	1
201403	1254	2014-03-19	meeting	KAMIN	I actually think that if Chinese growth fell to 5 percent or below, it would create downdrafts in global financial markets that would lead to further downward pressures on GDP in China, in EMEs, in foreign advanced economies, and in the United States that would make injury greater than the 1 percent in that simulation.	12	1
201403	1255	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12	1
201403	1256	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing no more questions, why don’t we begin our economic go-round?	13	1
201403	1257	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13	1
201403	1258	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1259	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	In California, we’ve had the warmest winter on record.	13	1
201403	1260	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13	1
201403	1261	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Let me say that again.	13	1
201403	1262	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	In California, we’ve had the warmest winter on record—when, in much of the country outside my District, I have been told, the economy has been suffering through winter headwinds, literally.	13	1
201403	1263	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Cold, snowy gales have held back growth.	13	1
201403	1264	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Pinning down the effects of adverse weather on economic activity is always difficult, even well after the fact, but it appears a good share of the recent economic slowdown reflects unseasonable cold and snow.	13	1
201403	1265	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	For example, one of my business contacts, the head of a national freight-trucking company, reported a huge upswing in weather-related disruptions to his operations.	13	1
201403	1266	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	In a typical winter, he reports that about 2 percent of his shipments are delayed by weather, but this winter it has been more than 12 percent.	13	1
201403	1267	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is December through February.	13	1
201403	1268	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, since these trucks generally run at capacity, the commercial business loss is very hard to make up, perhaps even after accounting for inventory adjustments.	13	1
201403	1269	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	A contact at a national retail chain tells a similar story.	13	1
201403	1270	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Although they never like to use the so-called weather excuse for poor sales performance, this time he believes it is appropriate.	13	1
201403	1271	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Still, with some of the lost consumption and output merely postponed, I’ve marked down real GDP growth for the four quarters of this year by only a tenth, to just less than 3 percent.	13	1
201403	1272	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	This modest revision reflects small permanent losses that are due to bad weather and a bit of underlying softening in the data.	13	1
201403	1273	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Looking further ahead, my outlook for growth remains unchanged at just over 3 percent for the next two years.	13	1
201403	1274	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Similarly, after adjusting for weather, favorable labor market trends are continuing, and I expect the unemployment rate to fall to almost 6 percent by year-end and to 5½ percent, close to my estimate of the natural rate, by the end of 2015.	13	1
201403	1275	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Although I view the risks to this projection as balanced, the latest slump in the housing sector is worrisome.	13	1
201403	1276	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even abstracting from adverse weather—I think I’m up to three uses of “weather” so far, David—the single-family starts and permits data are disappointing.	13	1
201403	1277	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	By now I expected housing to be much more of a tailwind for the recovery.	13	1
201403	1278	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Also troubling is the drop-off in existing home sales since the middle of last year, which feeds through to fewer purchases of durable goods like furniture and appliances.	13	1
201403	1279	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	As many in the popular press have suggested, slackening demand from institutional investors appears responsible for some of the decline in home sales.	13	1
201403	1280	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	At a granular MSA level, my staff has found that recent sales have fallen more in those cities with a large investor presence.	13	1
201403	1281	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Furthermore, sales have slowed most in cities in which home prices have risen fastest relative to rents, implying that investors may be running out of attractive buying opportunities to pencil out.	13	1
201403	1282	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I’m skeptical that a decline in investor demand is a significant factor behind the falloff in overall existing home sales.	13	1
201403	1283	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	My staff has found that the timing and the size of the sales decline were very similar across all of the broad regional markets.	13	1
201403	1284	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	So any location-specific factor is unlikely to be the whole story.	13	1
201403	1285	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, their empirical analysis indicates that before the winter weather hit, about half of the drop in home sales can be explained by last year’s jump in mortgage rates.	13	1
201403	1286	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Looking ahead, their models predict that home sales should pick up, boosted by the underlying fundamentals, and this outlook is supported by what some upstream housing- related businesses are telling us.	13	1
201403	1287	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	For example, a major window and door manufacturer in my District reports solid orders and sees a pickup ahead.	13	1
201403	1288	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	This suggests that the latest disappointing housing data are just a soft patch, and that growth in housing will provide greater support for the recovery later this year.	13	1
201403	1289	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Turning to inflation, I continue to expect that it will gradually return to our 2 percent target over the next few years.	13	1
201403	1290	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Admittedly, so far the consumer price data have shown little sign of cooperating with my projection.	13	1
201403	1291	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	The 12-month overall and core PCE inflation rates have stubbornly remained at about 1 percent for almost a year.	13	1
201403	1292	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Furthermore, labor cost growth remains muted, and my business contacts uniformly indicate that they’re still implementing modest wage increases and unchanged merit pools.	13	1
201403	1293	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	On a more optimistic note, financial market participants appear to have become more confident about the return of inflation to our target.	13	1
201403	1294	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	This assessment is based on what financial derivatives, such as inflation caps and floors, are saying about the risks that inflation will move too high or too low.	13	1
201403	1295	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	So my staff has been tracking the implied risk-neutral probability that inflation over the next year will be in a 1 percentage point range around our target.	13	1
201403	1296	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Just to be clear, this is based on CPI data, and we put a 0.3 percentage point gap between rates of PCE and CPI inflation, so we were looking at a 2.3 percent CPI.	13	1
201403	1297	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	They find that the probability that inflation will be in this target range has almost doubled over the past year, moving up from about 20 percent to 40 percent, and financial market participants are putting money on the table that both the upside and the downside tail risks to the inflation outlook are lower than they’ve been in recent years.	13	1
201403	1298	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13	1
201403	1299	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201403	1300	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	13	1
201403	1301	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1302	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Economic activity in the Third District declined modestly in January and February, as—I think I have six uses of “weather” in mine, if I counted correctly—severe weather seems to have interrupted the moderate growth trend.	13	1
201403	1303	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Manufacturing, retail, and construction sectors all felt the cold hand of Old Man Winter.	13	1
201403	1304	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Business contacts who experienced a downturn in activity anticipate a rebound from this as the weather normalizes, whenever that might be, and their outlook remains quite optimistic.	13	1
201403	1305	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Unemployment rates continue to move down in our three states.	13	1
201403	1306	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Early this year employment gains were seen in Pennsylvania, but employment fell modestly in both New Jersey and Delaware.	13	1
201403	1307	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Regional manufacturing activity contracted in February, with moderate declines in our business outlook surveys, indexes of general activity, and new orders and shipments attributed to severe winter weather by the respondents.	13	1
201403	1308	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Many respondents reported that the negative effects included lower demand on sales, disruptions to supply channels and deliveries, fuel shortages and power outages, lost production days, and the cost of snow removal.	13	1
201403	1309	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	The general activity index fell from 9.4 in January to minus 6.3 in February.	13	1
201403	1310	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	It was the first negative reading in over nine months, and this 15.7 percent decline in one month is comparable with the decline we saw in November 2012, when manufacturers noted that two or three days of production activity were lost to Hurricane Sandy.	13	1
201403	1311	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	This is the same sort of magnitude of change.	13	1
201403	1312	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	But despite this weakness in current indicators, manufacturers reported underlying strength in production plans and product demand.	13	1
201403	1313	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	In response to a special question, manufacturers reported that the increase in underlying demand for their products was still strong and continued through the beginning of the year.	13	1
201403	1314	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Only 20 percent reported softer demand.	13	1
201403	1315	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Our March survey results, which aren’t published until Thursday, show a rebound in manufacturing activity, and the indexes of general activity, new orders, shipments, and hours worked are all back in positive territory.	13	1
201403	1316	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	The general activity index jumped from minus 0.63 back up to plus 0.9, which is about where it was the previous month—so there was a complete reversal.	13	1
201403	1317	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Shipments, new orders, and back orders all bounced back to levels we saw previously as well.	13	1
201403	1318	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Retailers in the District were hurt by the weather rebound around Valentine’s Day.	13	1
201403	1319	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	One mall contact reported that they typically do two-fifths of their entire February sales the weekend of Valentine’s Day.	13	1
201403	1320	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	But this year Valentine’s Day was a complete snow-out in the region, and their sales were off 40 percent for that weekend, which was a significant drop in their monthly retail sales.	13	1
201403	1321	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Homebuilders also reported decreased activity.	13	1
201403	1322	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Toll Brothers, a major nationwide builder, reported that it expects first-quarter results to be 4 percent lower relative to expectations, primarily because of weather.	13	1
201403	1323	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Real estate brokers also reported that existing home sales in the region were flat to down in January compared with year-ago levels.	13	1
201403	1324	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	On the other hand, building permits remained solid.	13	1
201403	1325	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Commercial and industrial real estate indicators continued to improve in the region at a modest pace, and commercial construction activity in Philadelphia is at its strongest levels in about five years.	13	1
201403	1326	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Overall, the outlook among Third District businesses remains positive, and I see no particular reason to disagree with them.	13	1
201403	1327	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	The future activity index in our manufacturing survey moved up in February and remained strong in March.	13	1
201403	1328	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	My staff’s leading indicators suggest continued moderate growth over the next six months.	13	1
201403	1329	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Most banking contacts remained optimistic that growth would continue at a moderate but steady pace.	13	1
201403	1330	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	The weather clearly has complicated the national outlook, but at this point I see little reason to change my medium-term outlook from our January forecast.	13	1
201403	1331	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	And I made little change in my SEP submissions from December.	13	1
201403	1332	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	I continue to anticipate growth at or a bit above trend this year, around 3 percent, before returning to its steady state, which I penciled in at 2.4 percent, by 2016.	13	1
201403	1333	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	I project the unemployment rate will continue to decline, reaching 6.2 percent, perhaps a bit lower, by the end of 2014, and 5.8 percent by the end of 2015 through ’16, which I now assess to be roughly the natural rate.	13	1
201403	1334	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	With inflation expectations well anchored and core inflation stabilizing, I project that inflation will gradually move back to our target over the forecast horizon.	13	1
201403	1335	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	My projections incorporate continued reductions in the pace of asset purchases, with the program ending in the third quarter.	13	1
201403	1336	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	I suspect we might be needing to raise the federal funds rate sooner than the Tealbook does.	13	1
201403	1337	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	However, I have taken on board the Committee’s forward guidance on the effect of being at the zero bound, so my policy rate path calls for a slightly more gradual increase of the funds rate than implied by the simple policy rules, with the funds rate returning to neutral, or about 4 percent, by the end of 2016.	13	1
201403	1338	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	While that is my modal forecast, I also think this Committee needs to be prepared for circumstances that might be calling for a more rapid increase in the funds rate—if you will, that headwinds dissipate more quickly than we currently anticipate.	13	1
201403	1339	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	As indicated in Book B of the Tealbook, the prescriptions from four of the six policy rules that we regularly examine are higher than the current target rate for the funds rate today.	13	1
201403	1340	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	By the third quarter, all but the nominal income–targeting rule point to a higher funds rate—above zero.	13	1
201403	1341	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Note that this is also with inflation running somewhat below target.	13	1
201403	1342	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	In addition, the staff’s estimate of the equilibrium real fed funds rate, minus 0.75—r*, in their table—is slightly above the current funds rate of minus 1 percent, as they put it.	13	1
201403	1343	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	While some have advanced arguments as to why these rules in essence may not be applicable in today’s economic environment, prudence does suggest that we shouldn’t be too quick to dismiss the possibility that rates may have to rise at a faster pace and perhaps sooner than we may be currently anticipating.	13	1
201403	1344	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Our policy language has been asymmetric for a very long time.	13	1
201403	1345	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	But as this expansion continues, even though it is at a moderate pace, I believe we will need to move back to more- symmetric language that signals that we are prepared to act either way to achieve our goals.	13	1
201403	1346	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	I am somewhat concerned that by focusing so much on the downside risks we are undercutting ourselves by sending a negative signal to the economy.	13	1
201403	1347	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	We have seen this happen before, and I think we need to be alert to this possibility.	13	1
201403	1348	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	My preference is to try to explain our reaction function in a qualitative way as best we can, so the public will have a better grasp of how policy is likely to react to changes in economic conditions and the outlook, changes that could be either positive or negative.	13	1
201403	1349	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	I wasn’t able to attend the March 4 conference call, but in reading the transcript I was struck by President Williams’s analogy of driving from Sacramento to Disneyland.	13	1
201403	1350	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	As you get closer to your destination, your decisions become more critical as to which turns to make and actions to take.	13	1
201403	1351	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	As we get closer to our goals, our language needs to be more about our policy framework and more detailed about our reaction function.	13	1
201403	1352	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you.	13	1
201403	1353	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201403	1354	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	13	1
201403	1355	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1356	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	My own forecast is quite similar to that of the Tealbook.	13	1
201403	1357	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	I have the economy growing for the rest of this year at roughly 3 percent and then growing slightly faster in 2015.	13	1
201403	1358	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	This growth is sufficient to return the economy to my estimate of the natural rate of unemployment of 5¼ percent by the end of 2016, which, if correct, means that it will have taken nine years to reach full employment from the beginning of the recession in late 2007.	13	1
201403	1359	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because I expect the PCE inflation rate in 2016 to undershoot our 2 percent inflation target by a bit, I have the federal funds rate somewhat lower than the staff assumption at the end of 2016.	13	1
201403	1360	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, almost a decade after the onset of recession, we will still be undershooting the explicit inflation target we have adopted.	13	1
201403	1361	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	Such a prolonged miss on inflation and unemployment is one reason for doing all we can to ensure that the return to full employment occurs as quickly as possible.	13	1
201403	1362	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would note a couple of caveats associated with my forecast.	13	1
201403	1363	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	First, I want to thank the staff for doing an incredibly painstaking job estimating the impact of weather on data for the first quarter of this year.	13	1
201403	1364	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	My own staff did a careful but somewhat less comprehensive appraisal of the impact of weather on recent data and, like the Board staff, concluded that the effect on this quarter’s real GDP would be rather modest.	13	1
201403	1365	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	My estimate of first-quarter real growth, at a bit below 2 percent, implies that growth this quarter likely would have been roughly only 2 percent even in the absence of weather problems.	13	1
201403	1366	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	This makes me worry.	13	1
201403	1367	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	To date, the incoming data provide little evidence of a self-sustaining recovery that attains or exceeds 3 percent growth.	13	1
201403	1368	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I and many others are forecasting such a recovery, tangible support for the forecast has yet to appear in the data, providing ample reason for caution as we consider our policy tomorrow.	13	1
201403	1369	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	A second caveat is that I still believe that the risks to the forecast are slightly skewed to the downside.	13	1
201403	1370	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	My modal forecast assumes that a variety of foreign disruptions do not turn into a much larger headwind.	13	1
201403	1371	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	Were developments in Ukraine or China to take a turn for the worse, the US economy might face more severe headwinds.	13	1
201403	1372	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	In particular, problems in Ukraine have the possibility of being very disruptive to the fragile recovery in Europe.	13	1
201403	1373	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	Furthermore, European banks are much more exposed to Eastern Europe and emerging markets than US banks and are less well positioned to suffer another adverse shock.	13	1
201403	1374	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	Similarly, developments in China have sent reverberations through financial and commodity markets.	13	1
201403	1375	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	More-severe economic problems there have the potential to be disruptive.	13	1
201403	1376	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would note that the 10-year Treasury rate has remained fairly stable, somewhat below 3 percent, since the end of last year.	13	1
201403	1377	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	These sustained low rates in the face of an improving economy suggest to me that investors continue to put significant weight on the possibility that international developments could derail our forecast of accelerating growth.	13	1
201403	1378	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	A third caveat is that I continue to estimate that there is significant slack in labor markets.	13	1
201403	1379	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	Not only is the unemployment rate at 6.7 percent, well above my estimate of full employment, but other indicators of slack tell a similar story.	13	1
201403	1380	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	My staff has been looking at broader measures of unemployment such as U-6.	13	1
201403	1381	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	This broader measure of unemployment rose significantly during the recession and remains elevated relative to historical averages and also relative to our more traditional U-3 measure.	13	1
201403	1382	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	The main driver of the unusual increase is the large number of workers reporting that they are working part time for economic reasons.	13	1
201403	1383	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	Last week’s employment announcement reported that 7.2 million Americans want full-time work but are currently working part time.	13	1
201403	1384	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	This compares with only 4.6 million workers in that situation in December 2007.	13	1
201403	1385	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	Furthermore, of those 7.2 million workers who are part time but seeking full-time work, 4.3 million report that the reason they are part-time is because of slack work or business conditions.	13	1
201403	1386	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	Note that unlike those that are classified as marginally attached to the workforce, there is no doubt that these people are willing to work since they are already working.	13	1
201403	1387	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	While much more work needs to be done on these measures, that these measures remain so elevated appears consistent with the contention that significant slack remains in the labor force.	13	1
201403	1388	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	Whether one looks at the elevated measures of labor market slack or the continued low readings on compensation and PCE inflation, together they provide ample justification for maintaining a highly accommodative monetary policy for a considerable time.	13	1
201403	1389	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1390	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201403	1391	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13	1
201403	1392	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1393	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Since our January meeting, the incoming data on the real economy have been somewhat soft, leading us to mark down our near-term forecast.	13	1
201403	1394	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	However, it seems likely that a good portion of the slowing in activity is the result of an unusually difficult winter combined with a modest inventory swing.	13	1
201403	1395	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	For the moment, it is most likely that the underlying growth trend remains reasonably healthy.	13	1
201403	1396	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	This view aligns well with reports from my business contacts.	13	1
201403	1397	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Among those in the Midwest, all reported some weather-related slowing in their business.	13	1
201403	1398	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Many have national business lines that were influenced beyond simply my frigid District boundaries.	13	1
201403	1399	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Nevertheless, the tone of their reports remains quite optimistic and somewhat better than in January.	13	1
201403	1400	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	They all expect that activity will pick up once the weather improves.	13	1
201403	1401	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Of course, for most of my contacts, these are simply expectations.	13	1
201403	1402	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	While their conversations with customers were encouraging, they have yet to see a sustained increase in actual orders.	13	1
201403	1403	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	And, given the difficulties in assessing the weaker incoming data, it is not surprising that a few reports raise some cautions.	13	1
201403	1404	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	For instance, the auto industry has seen car inventories rise well above desired levels.	13	1
201403	1405	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	So far they have not reduced production, but they may need to do so if they don’t see improving sales in the next couple of months.	13	1
201403	1406	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	On the inflation front, cost pressures remain low.	13	1
201403	1407	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	A number of contacts noted falling input prices, such as those for iron ore, steel, and other metals.	13	1
201403	1408	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	This included some businesses with fairly upbeat assessments on demand.	13	1
201403	1409	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Weakness in China and emerging market economies accounts for some of the reduced demand pressures on materials prices, but a few reports indicated that additional supplier capacity also contributed to reduced materials prices.	13	1
201403	1410	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Most of those reports were related to iron ore mining.	13	1
201403	1411	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Of the largest input cost—labor—I heard no concerns about overall wage cost increases.	13	1
201403	1412	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Sure, some skilled areas continue to be in high demand.	13	1
201403	1413	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	For example, one director cited complaints about shortages of long-haul truck drivers.	13	1
201403	1414	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Another director in the staffing industry added that drivers quitting for better jobs was something that one often sees in the earliest stages of a labor market rebound.	13	1
201403	1415	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	My CDIAC participants, many of whom are located outside of large metropolitan areas, say it is difficult to find more-skilled workers.	13	1
201403	1416	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	But this really is nothing new.	13	1
201403	1417	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	They have been saying this for quite some time, and my agriculture, labor, and small business advisory councils also recount these perennial challenges.	13	1
201403	1418	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Frankly, a lot of what I hear from such groups is really about how difficult it always is to run businesses requiring new technologies in smaller regional markets.	13	1
201403	1419	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Importantly, they don’t appear to be on the leading edge in offering higher wages in order to solve their labor difficulties.	13	1
201403	1420	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	With regard to our national economic outlook, our forecast of GDP growth for this year is down three-tenths since our previous submission, but that is all due to a weaker first quarter.	13	1
201403	1421	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Looking through the inventory swings and the weather-related slowdown, final demand growth appears to be on a rising trajectory.	13	1
201403	1422	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	So for the balance of the year we still expect growth to average 3 percent or a bit more, with similar numbers in 2015 and 2016.	13	1
201403	1423	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	In our forecast, that kind of growth is enough to eliminate almost all the slack in the economy by the end of 2016.	13	1
201403	1424	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	However, the low inflation outlook remains quite a concern.	13	1
201403	1425	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	The numbers haven’t changed for several meetings.	13	1
201403	1426	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	We are still running far below our target.	13	1
201403	1427	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	My SEP submission does envision an eventual increase in inflation, but we expect it to be slow—only getting to 1¾ percent by the end of 2016.	13	1
201403	1428	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	That’s my forecast, but I have to say that my level of conviction isn’t very high.	13	1
201403	1429	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	While diminishing slack plays some role, my forecast relies heavily on well- anchored inflation expectations pulling actual inflation up toward our 2 percent target.	13	1
201403	1430	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	While we’ve been waiting for this reversion to expectation for quite a while now, it would be useful if we, as a Committee, put a time frame on the table for how long we will allow inflation to seriously underrun our 2 percent PCE objective, much as President Kocherlakota was alluding to when he was asking about what the inflation markers are.	13	1
201403	1431	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	I think it would be very helpful for us to have more of a discussion.	13	1
201403	1432	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	The 2 percent inflation floor presented in alternative A is a useful option if we are serious about defending our inflation objective from below.	13	1
201403	1433	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	For the time being, I am sticking to my view that we will get the expectations updraft and that inflation will move slowly back toward our 2 percent target, but I certainly see downside risks to this forecast.	13	1
201403	1434	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1435	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201403	1436	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13	1
201403	1437	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1438	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	Despite the significant impact that adverse weather conditions appeared to have on the Sixth District economy, business optimism is still running high.	13	1
201403	1439	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	For the most part, firms are looking through the weather events and are positive about the economic outlook for the balance of the year.	13	1
201403	1440	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	Firms seem to be operating under the assumption that the business environment for the final three quarters of 2014 will resemble the second half of 2013.	13	1
201403	1441	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	But we did hear an earful about weather effects in our most recent round of contacts.	13	1
201403	1442	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	Per these anecdotal reports, there was virtually no industry in the Sixth District north of Florida and east of Mississippi that was unaffected by bad weather.	13	1
201403	1443	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	Contacts reported large cuts in sales and production in areas that were adversely affected by the weather.	13	1
201403	1444	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	That’s three mentions of “weather” so far.	13	1
201403	1445	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	Are you counting these?	13	1
201403	1446	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	I am.	13	1
201403	1447	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	[Laughter]	13	1
201403	1448	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	The nation’s largest auto retailer said that sales fell abruptly and the decline was felt across all product and service lines.	13	1
201403	1449	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	He pointed out that when underlying demand changes, spending usually shifts between the new, used, and service categories.	13	1
201403	1450	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	In this instance, spending fell across the board.	13	1
201403	1451	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	The Southeast’s largest utility reported that power usage shifted dramatically from commercial and industrial usage to residential in those areas experiencing bad weather.	13	1
201403	1452	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	We also heard expectations of a protracted recovery process, particularly in transportation and the domestic supply chain.	13	1
201403	1453	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	These views run counter to the quick bounceback thesis.	13	1
201403	1454	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	Long story short, anecdotal reports of a sizable weather effect were widespread and consistent with my staff’s estimate that the weather cut first-quarter GDP growth by ¾ percentage point.	13	1
201403	1455	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding the Tealbook’s observation that three inches of snow probably has a different effect in Athens, Georgia, than in Athens, Ohio, we actually checked.	13	1
201403	1456	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	Both the University of Georgia and Ohio University were closed because of bad weather.	13	1
201403	1457	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	[Laughter]	13	1
201403	1458	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	In considering the outlook, even with a different reading of the weather effects in the first quarter, our forecast is virtually identical to that of the Tealbook.	13	1
201403	1459	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	My outlook interprets the softness in the first quarter as a one-off development.	13	1
201403	1460	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	I am looking at the risks around growth as broadly balanced.	13	1
201403	1461	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	In my view, factors external to the United States economy—Ukraine, China, emerging markets imbalances—have gotten louder.	13	1
201403	1462	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	At the same time, I view headwinds coming from domestic sources as quieter.	13	1
201403	1463	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	As regards the balance of risks for inflation, I see those as weighted to the downside.	13	1
201403	1464	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	Recent readings on wages and prices do not hint at a move in any direction from the current low rate.	13	1
201403	1465	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	I am increasingly of the view—very similar to President Rosengren’s view—that a shadow workforce exists that is not adequately captured by the most-used measures of labor market conditions, particularly the U-3 unemployment rate, and that this shadow workforce must be taken into account in determining how near or far we are from full employment.	13	1
201403	1466	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	Low wage growth amid modestly improving productivity trends suggests that there could be continued downward pressure on the inflation rate.	13	1
201403	1467	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	If this risk plays out, I am thinking we may need to consider strategies for increasing accommodation at some point during the current forecast horizon.	13	1
201403	1468	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	I will have more to say about that in the policy round.	13	1
201403	1469	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1470	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201403	1471	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	13	1
201403	1472	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1473	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	To commemorate this being your first formal meeting, I wore the special “Janet Yellen” tie—	13	1
201403	1474	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201403	1475	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	—which shows the donkeys, who are the Democrats, and the elephants, who are the Republicans, just butting heads, and you flying in—I think it’s on the wings of a dove—	13	1
201403	1476	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I believe it is.	13	1
201403	1477	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	—and spreading money around the system.	13	1
201403	1478	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Perhaps if it had you herding cats it might have been a better analogy for this meeting, but anyway, it’s in your honor that I wear this tie.	13	1
201403	1479	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Very quickly, with regard to the Eleventh District, we have continued to expand at what I would call a fortunate pace.	13	1
201403	1480	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Our employment payroll growth has strengthened modestly.	13	1
201403	1481	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	It is running about 2.3 percent.	13	1
201403	1482	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	We expect it to run 2.4 percent.	13	1
201403	1483	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	That’s up from December.	13	1
201403	1484	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Our unemployment rate has dropped significantly, to 5.7 percent.	13	1
201403	1485	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I had our staff do an analysis, and across all of the “U” measures, we’ve seen significant declines to a five-year low.	13	1
201403	1486	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	So we are a fortunate District, and in that little laboratory that we have in Texas and slices of Louisiana and New Mexico, we’ve seen some modest increases in wage pressures and also labor shortages, which I’ve reported on before.	13	1
201403	1487	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	So enough about my District.	13	1
201403	1488	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I want to make just some brief comments, since others have commented eloquently on their corporate contacts—and I’m happy to hear that, although as Governor Tarullo likes to point out, and I think he’s correct, you have to put this all within an anecdotal frame of reference.	13	1
201403	1489	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	A couple of things caught my ear other than weather, weather, weather, which we’ve heard from everybody.	13	1
201403	1490	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	One is the assumption that we will return to normality.	13	1
201403	1491	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	For example, the large shipping company in your District, Dennis—UPS—expects and sees numbers coming back to the 3 to 4 percent range, which is their average, and the homebuilders are telling me pretty much the same.	13	1
201403	1492	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	There are a couple of comments that I think we might want to track over time.	13	1
201403	1493	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I’m hearing from the large homebuilders—and these, again, are not just in my District but are the national builders—that, for the first time, buyers are being priced out of the market or are ineligible to be qualified because of the hangover in terms of qualifications—particularly first- time buyers, because of student loans.	13	1
201403	1494	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	It’s the first I’ve heard of this.	13	1
201403	1495	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Most homebuilders are talking about it, and it’s something we may wish to monitor to see if it’s actually having a real- time effect.	13	1
201403	1496	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	With regard to Ukraine and the disturbances that we’re seeing in Europe, and the concern all of us have about that, it is notable, according to the major oil companies and the independents, that energy prices have remained fairly stable.	13	1
201403	1497	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	And at least among those that provide us energy at the retail level, motor gas in particular, there’s an expectation that we should have relatively stable prices as we go through time with maybe a 10 percent rise or decline from the current pricing level.	13	1
201403	1498	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	So expectations, if anything, do not seem to have been affected by the crisis in Ukraine.	13	1
201403	1499	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I think that’s somewhat noteworthy.	13	1
201403	1500	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	We just have to track it.	13	1
201403	1501	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Most noteworthy of all for me was talking to the semiconductor companies.	13	1
201403	1502	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	As you know, semiconductors are used in everything from electric toothbrushes to automobile manufacturing—in fact, everything that we now use—and this particular data point caught my ear:  The book-to-bill ratio has been running above 1 every day this quarter, which is the first time this has happened in seven years.	13	1
201403	1503	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	That means that what the semiconductor companies are shipping out the door is less than what is in their order book, and that is a significant development—perhaps—if it continues as it has been running for some time.	13	1
201403	1504	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Then lastly, with regard to payroll dynamics, turning to one of the companies in your District, President Evans—in fact, the chairman of your District said—I’ll give you a direct quote:  “Firms have more confidence despite a tremendous amount of uncertainty about regulation and the standard complaints about health care.	13	1
201403	1505	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Wages are being managed quite effectively through IT enhancement and patience.	13	1
201403	1506	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	No one is concerned that demand for labor will develop quickly.”	13	1
201403	1507	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	That underscores what other people have been saying, in terms of concerns about the rapidity of the recovery and employment, with the exception of the Eleventh Federal Reserve District.	13	1
201403	1508	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I do want to take a moment to do something a little bit different from what I’ve done in the past, Madam Chair, and focus on my principal area of concern, which is a byproduct of accommodation.	13	1
201403	1509	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I’ll actually end up on the same point that I raised by exhibiting the tie.	13	1
201403	1510	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I have some concerns about what’s developing in the markets, and rather than rely on anecdotal evidence, I turn to the flow of funds report that was issued two Thursdays ago.	13	1
201403	1511	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	It showed that the market value for all equities traded in the United States soared to a record $34.7 trillion at the end of last year.	13	1
201403	1512	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	That’s up $21 trillion since the start of the bull market, which, if I recall correctly, started on March 9, 2009.	13	1
201403	1513	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Total stock market capitalization as a ratio to nominal GDP rose to 1.25 at the end of last year.	13	1
201403	1514	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	That exceeds the previous peak of 1.12 in 2007.	13	1
201403	1515	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	It’s the highest since the third quarter of 2000.	13	1
201403	1516	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	The price-to-sales ratio of the S&P 500 rose to 1.54 again last year, its highest reading since the first quarter of 2002.	13	1
201403	1517	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	If you look at Tobin’s q, which is an interesting valuation metric and can be calculated using the data from the flow-of-funds report, the ratio of market value of equities to net worth at market value of nonfinancial corporations was 1.44 at the end of last year.	13	1
201403	1518	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	That’s the highest since the second quarter of 2001.	13	1
201403	1519	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I’ve mentioned margin debt, and my concern about it, and I’ve said in speeches that we’re pushing up against historic limits.	13	1
201403	1520	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I have received notes from most of the major financial houses saying that I’m wrong.	13	1
201403	1521	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	It has actually been setting new record highs since July 2012.	13	1
201403	1522	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	It was $451.3 billion during January.	13	1
201403	1523	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	That exceeds the July 2007 peak by 18.3 percent.	13	1
201403	1524	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I’ve expressed concern about the narrow spreads between junk and quality credit.	13	1
201403	1525	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	The spread between high-yield corporates and 10-year US Treasuries was just 280 basis points last Friday.	13	1
201403	1526	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	That’s the lowest since the lows in 2007 just before the financial system began to unravel.	13	1
201403	1527	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	The issuance of bonds by investment-grade corporations continues.	13	1
201403	1528	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Roughly $48 billion was issued the week before last.	13	1
201403	1529	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	That’s the second most ever, and if you take the Verizon transaction out of the week that it was issued, it’s the most ever.	13	1
201403	1530	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Highly rated firms have sold roughly $233 billion in debt so far this year.	13	1
201403	1531	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	That’s a 9 percent increase from the same period last year.	13	1
201403	1532	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	And interestingly, the net issuance of debt is running at about $650 billion for the year.	13	1
201403	1533	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Last year, the net issuance of corporate equities was a minus number, minus $383.7 billion.	13	1
201403	1534	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	In addition, if you talk to the Goldman Sachs desk, they’ll note that on that big rally day we had on March 5, over one-tenth of the equity trading at that desk was related to corporate share buybacks.	13	1
201403	1535	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	So the thing that I wanted to point out is that we are seeing a restructuring of corporate balance sheets.	13	1
201403	1536	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I think this is good.	13	1
201403	1537	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Our corporations are well positioned to take advantage of resumed confidence in terms of growth, and certainly they have the capacity to hire.	13	1
201403	1538	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	But thus far—and I say very specifically “thus far”—the benefits of our accommodation, it strikes me, have been going mainly to enrich corporations and to make them firmer financially and improve their balance sheets.	13	1
201403	1539	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	And even though money tends to burn a hole in anybody’s pocket, including the most responsible CFO or CEO, I conclude that they’re simply not going to hire until they have greater fiscal clarity and regulatory clarity, something that we have a limited ability to affect.	13	1
201403	1540	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I’m fully supportive of alternative B, and I’ll talk more about that tomorrow.	13	1
201403	1541	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I do want to point out one thing that came to mind as I was listening to the discussion about the international situation in particular, and also looking at the chart on copper that was given to us early in the presentation—as you know, people that operate in the markets always talk about Dr.	13	1
201403	1542	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Copper and whether or not it was influenced by China.	13	1
201403	1543	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	However, if you look at the other indicators of the commodities indexes, something has occurred that I find my contacts in the major food industries cannot explain—the Bunges and the Archer Daniels Midlands and so on—which is that, in the past 45 days, the funds that invest in commodities have gone from being record shorts, particularly in the proteins, corns and soybeans, to record longs in extraordinary volumes, and there’s no reason for that shift from a fundamentals standpoint.	13	1
201403	1544	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Wheat, for example, which bottomed on January 29 at 550 cents per bushel, is now trading at 673 cents per bushel.	13	1
201403	1545	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Soybeans have risen dramatically.	13	1
201403	1546	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	So it’s something that I think we might just want to watch.	13	1
201403	1547	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	It could either be a sign of financial excess, which is where my principal concerns lie at present, or it could be a shift that may occur as a result of these geopolitical tensions that you mentioned.	13	1
201403	1548	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1549	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, President Fisher.	13	1
201403	1550	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Pianalto.	13	1
201403	1551	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1552	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	I have not found the recent incoming data overly informative in light of the abnormal winter weather.	13	1
201403	1553	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	Many of my business contacts alluded to the severe weather in their recent reports.	13	1
201403	1554	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	One of them noted that good news that he’s heard is due to good management.	13	1
201403	1555	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	Bad news is weather related.	13	1
201403	1556	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	And my staff also suspects that a fair amount of the recent softness in the data has been weather related.	13	1
201403	1557	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	As a result, I’ve only edged down my near-term growth forecast.	13	1
201403	1558	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	I still see the economy reaching a pace of more than 3 percent output growth in the latter half of this year.	13	1
201403	1559	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	I also continue to expect progress on unemployment, with the unemployment rate reaching 6.2 percent by the end of the year.	13	1
201403	1560	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	While a number of commodity price indexes are up recently, broader consumer inflation readings remain subdued, and I have left my inflation forecast largely unchanged.	13	1
201403	1561	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	I continue to expect PCE inflation to rise from a little more than 1 percent this year to about 1½ percent next year.	13	1
201403	1562	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	Because concerns have been raised about the unemployment rate as an indicator of current labor market slack, my staff reviewed the state of a wide range of labor market indicators.	13	1
201403	1563	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	A good number of these indicators reveal a labor market that has improved substantially and continues to improve.	13	1
201403	1564	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	For example, if we exclude the data affected by the recent severe winter weather, average weekly hours of production and supervisory employees are back to the levels reached midway through the most recent expansion.	13	1
201403	1565	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	The same holds true for the job openings rate from the JOLTS data.	13	1
201403	1566	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	Stronger labor market data like these may lead some to question our extremely accommodative monetary policy stance.	13	1
201403	1567	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	However, as others have pointed out, other indicators suggest that there’s still a lot of slack in the labor market.	13	1
201403	1568	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	For example, wage growth remains tepid and many workers are involuntarily working part time.	13	1
201403	1569	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	These conflicting indicators make it challenging to gain an overall assessment of the state of the labor market, and the lack of clarity in the labor market may add to communications challenges for the Committee as we continue to focus on meeting our maximum employment objective.	13	1
201403	1570	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	The picture is different on the inflation side of the dual mandate.	13	1
201403	1571	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	PCE inflation is running well below our longer-run objective.	13	1
201403	1572	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	While CPI-based measures are higher, research done by my staff suggests that at least part of this difference is attributable to increases in OER inflation, but the ultimate source of these homeownership cost increases is unclear at this point.	13	1
201403	1573	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	I continue to project that our accommodative monetary policy, a strengthening economy, and stable inflation expectations will bring inflation back toward 2 percent.	13	1
201403	1574	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	But I expect that the process will be very slow, a view that is shared by the Tealbook.	13	1
201403	1575	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	Furthermore, my inflation forecasts have tended to creep lower ever so slightly with the passage of time.	13	1
201403	1576	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	Thus, I continue to see this outlook for inflation as my primary motivation for my position on monetary policy, which I’ll discuss tomorrow.	13	1
201403	1577	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	In general, I see the risks to my projections as broadly balanced.	13	1
201403	1578	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	The real economy faces a number of downside risks, including recent geopolitical events and the potential slowdowns in key foreign economies.	13	1
201403	1579	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	But the economy has also shown considerable resilience over the past year, and as the fiscal drag eases and the labor market improves, upside surprises are certainly plausible.	13	1
201403	1580	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	At this point these risks to output growth are also the primary risks to my unemployment and inflation projections, resulting in my assessment of risks to both inflation and unemployment as balanced.	13	1
201403	1581	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1582	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201403	1583	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest we stop now and take a little break.	13	1
201403	1584	2014-03-19	meeting		[Coffee break]	13	1
201403	1585	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, everybody.	13	1
201403	1586	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s continue with our go-round.	13	1
201403	1587	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13	1
201403	1588	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1589	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Economic activity in the Fifth District has continued to improve at a moderate pace since the end of January, but there are clear signs of weakness.	13	1
201403	1590	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Our business surveys for February point to a contraction in the manufacturing and retail sectors and a modest weakening in the nonretail service sector.	13	1
201403	1591	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	At least some of that weakness was attributable to severe winter weather.	13	1
201403	1592	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	The Board staff provided what I thought was a clever analysis showing which counties were most affected by unusually large snowfalls and unusually cold temperatures, and apparently the Fifth and Sixth Districts were the most heavily affected by the snow relative to seasonal norms.	13	1
201403	1593	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Weather effects were evident in comments from our contacts in recent weeks.	13	1
201403	1594	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	We heard widespread reports of weather-related delays in construction and a range of construction-supply industries.	13	1
201403	1595	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Contacts expect activity to catch up in the spring, though, and to add to the typical seasonal pickup in demand.	13	1
201403	1596	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Manufacturing in the Carolinas was affected by widespread power outages as well as shortages of natural gas due to a weather-related surge in demand.	13	1
201403	1597	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	In addition, many plants shut down just for economic reasons, because the utility costs had gotten so high that it made more sense to shut down for a couple of days.	13	1
201403	1598	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Some plants lost as many as 10 days during January and February.	13	1
201403	1599	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Many affected manufacturers were expecting to catch up through overtime and weekend work, and they generally remained optimistic about activity in the spring, as in the Sixth District.	13	1
201403	1600	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Disruptions were also reported in tourism, shipping, nurseries, fishing, and crabbing.	13	1
201403	1601	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	The storms generated some economic winners, though.	13	1
201403	1602	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Grocery stores saw their typical flurry of consumers stocking up frantically on necessities, and the chemical industry benefited from a surge in sales of ice melt and windshield washer fluid.	13	1
201403	1603	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	The net effect of the unusual weather is very difficult to quantify, of course.	13	1
201403	1604	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	My staff evidently wasn’t up to the task.	13	1
201403	1605	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	13	1
201403	1606	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	We will talk about that later, on the way back.	13	1
201403	1607	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	But our information suggests that the weather-related disruptions were large enough to cloud the interpretation of the economic data for our region.	13	1
201403	1608	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Preliminary results from our March survey, which I got this morning, show a slight decline from February to March for manufacturing and a strengthening on the service side.	13	1
201403	1609	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	The weather wasn’t as bad in March as it was in February.	13	1
201403	1610	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	It does suggest that there’s an underlying theme of weakness on the manufacturing side despite the optimism we’ve heard about.	13	1
201403	1611	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	We’ll have to see as the data come in.	13	1
201403	1612	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Turning to the national outlook, neither my forecast nor the Tealbook’s has changed much since the previous meeting, apart from the revisions to the fourth and first quarters necessitated by incoming data.	13	1
201403	1613	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	My projection is for GDP growth to continue at about the rate we’ve averaged since the end of the recession.	13	1
201403	1614	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	I again wrote down 2.2 percent.	13	1
201403	1615	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	The Tealbook is projecting faster growth beginning next quarter driven by strong growth in consumption, supported by strong growth in disposable income, which is, in turn, supported by a pickup in productivity growth.	13	1
201403	1616	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	I don’t really see compelling evidence for either of those two supporting factors at this point.	13	1
201403	1617	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	At the previous meeting the case for a strong pickup in growth was bolstered by an apparent surge in real consumer spending in the fourth quarter of last year, but that surge has been largely revised away since then.	13	1
201403	1618	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	For the remainder of my comments I want to say a few words about labor markets.	13	1
201403	1619	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	We’re about to back away, it seems, from forward guidance tied to a specific numerical value of the unemployment rate.	13	1
201403	1620	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	There’s a narrative that has been circulating that says we’re doing this because the unemployment rate has proven to be an unreliable indicator of labor market conditions.	13	1
201403	1621	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	I think that story is unwarranted, and we should discourage that interpretation.	13	1
201403	1622	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	I think we’re dropping the reference to a 6½ percent unemployment rate because the value has been attained, not because the unemployment rate is particularly unreliable now.	13	1
201403	1623	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	And in particular, I think the evidence supports the view that the measured unemployment rate is not terribly distorted or biased right now.	13	1
201403	1624	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	This popular story about why unemployment is unreliable is that there’s a large pool of workers who are classified as out of the labor force because they did not actively look for work in the past four weeks, but who are likely to flood back into the labor market if conditions improve.	13	1
201403	1625	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	In other words, the labor force participation rate is artificially low right now or will rise—or, more realistically, stop falling—when labor market conditions tighten.	13	1
201403	1626	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	In the past I’ve discussed some of the research that staff economists at the Richmond Fed have done related to labor force participation and labor markets.	13	1
201403	1627	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Some of that work was recently published in our Economic Quarterly, and it’s closely related to this issue.	13	1
201403	1628	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	A paper by Marianna Kudlyak reports on research I mentioned briefly last year.	13	1
201403	1629	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	She estimates a very straightforward model of the impact of demographic change on labor force participation trends.	13	1
201403	1630	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	The model is essentially a parsimonious version of that in the 2006 Brookings Papers article by Aaronson and colleagues that’s cited so often.	13	1
201403	1631	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	It has a set of fixed effects for gender, age, and cohort with an allowance for cyclical variation.	13	1
201403	1632	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	She finds that at the end of 2012, the model prediction for the labor force participation rate is actually a little below the actual labor force participation rate.	13	1
201403	1633	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	In other words, even though the labor force participation rate has been declining in the Great Recession and recovery, all of that decline can now be accounted for by demographic factors, and the cyclical effects have virtually disappeared.	13	1
201403	1634	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	That’s consistent with the pre-recession prediction in that paper by Aaronson and coauthors.	13	1
201403	1635	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Demographic factors point to a continued decline in labor force participation in her model, as in others, and that suggests we shouldn’t expect the labor force participation rate to flatten out and delay further declines in the unemployment rate.	13	1
201403	1636	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Another paper in our most recently Economic Quarterly is by Andreas Hornstein, and it looks at the observed negative correlation between cyclical movements in the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate.	13	1
201403	1637	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	In other words, when the unemployment rate goes up, the labor force participation rate falls.	13	1
201403	1638	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	He finds that the most common interpretation of this correlation, this “discouraged worker” story, seems inconsistent with the underlying gross flows between employment, unemployment, and being out of the labor force.	13	1
201403	1639	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	In the data, a falling unemployment rate is associated with a smaller transition rate from out of the labor force to unemployment, not larger, as the discouraged worker narrative would suggest.	13	1
201403	1640	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Moreover, a falling unemployment rate is associated with larger transition rates from unemployment to out of the labor force, not smaller, as the discouraged worker narrative would suggest.	13	1
201403	1641	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	So if you think of that story in terms of workers drawn from out of the labor force into unemployment as labor markets improve, it seems inconsistent with the data.	13	1
201403	1642	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	On the other hand, a broader version of that story does seem consistent with the data.	13	1
201403	1643	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	It turns out that a falling unemployment rate is associated with larger transitions from outside the labor force directly into employment, and the significance of those flows from out of the labor force to employment supports the broad concern that measured labor force participation doesn’t properly reflect the number of people who might want to work or are available to work at any given time.	13	1
201403	1644	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	In other words, there isn’t a very sharp distinction between the labor-force attachment of those counted as unemployed and those counted as out of the labor force.	13	1
201403	1645	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	In fact, you can decompose those out of the labor force into different groups based on whether they say they want a job, what search activities they report to have engaged in, or what their reasons are for not wanting a job, and if you do that, you find different transition rates for different groups.	13	1
201403	1646	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	So you can document gradations in the degree of attachment to the labor force among those who aren’t employed, but if you look at those groups in recent years, you don’t see evidence of a disproportionate increase in the size of the subgroups that are more likely to return to the labor force.	13	1
201403	1647	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	In ongoing research, my staff is developing a comprehensive index of the employable labor force that covers both the unemployed and those out of the labor force.	13	1
201403	1648	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	It essentially weights those without a job by their likelihood of transitioning to employment.	13	1
201403	1649	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Preliminary results suggest that the behavior of this index is currently in line with the behavior of the unemployment rate.	13	1
201403	1650	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	This has been sort of a lengthy discourse.	13	1
201403	1651	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	To sum up, what I take away from this is that a broad range of measures of labor market conditions are providing signals that are essentially in line with the signal provided by the unemployment rate alone.	13	1
201403	1652	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	So I think we should not communicate that the change in our forward guidance reflects an erosion of our confidence in the measured unemployment rate as a guide to policy.	13	1
201403	1653	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	We’ve always emphasized that we look at an array of indicators of labor market conditions.	13	1
201403	1654	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	I think we should continue to do so, but we shouldn’t suggest that there’s an atypically large overhang of discouraged workers relative to normal times.	13	1
201403	1655	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	13	1
201403	1656	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201403	1657	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13	1
201403	1658	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1659	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Before I start, I would just like to say that during the intermeeting period I gave a speech called “The Rise and Fall of Labor Force Participation in the US,” which actually reviewed a lot of the literature that President Lacker just referred to, and I came away from that with a similar conclusion—that the labor force trend in the United States has a reasonable demographic explanation behind it, and that it rose up during the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s, peaked, and now is on a downward trend.	13	1
201403	1660	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	The models that President Lacker referred to do seem to have predicted, as far back as 2006, that the labor force participation rate would be where it is today.	13	1
201403	1661	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	And so that makes me doubt, along with President Lacker, that there’s a big cyclical component to labor force participation, which there historically has not been in the United States.	13	1
201403	1662	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t think it exists now, and that makes me think that unemployment is, in fact, a good indicator of the state of labor market performance.	13	1
201403	1663	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	But I would finish by saying that I also agree with President Lacker that we should look at a wide variety of labor market indicators.	13	1
201403	1664	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Turning to the Eighth District economy, it continues to expand at a modest pace.	13	1
201403	1665	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Retail sales in the District seem to be holding up rather well, despite the unusual weather patterns during recent weeks and months.	13	1
201403	1666	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Convenience store sales, in particular, were strong during the February time frame after a slowdown in December and January.	13	1
201403	1667	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Both commercial and residential real estate markets continue to show improvement.	13	1
201403	1668	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	The most recent data indicate that home sales have increased over the past year at a double-digit pace in Louisville and Little Rock and at a single-digit pace in Memphis and St Louis.	13	1
201403	1669	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	District labor markets continue to improve but not as rapidly as in the nation as a whole.	13	1
201403	1670	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Labor market outcomes are heterogeneous.	13	1
201403	1671	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	The St Louis zone within the District has an unemployment rate of 6.3 percent.	13	1
201403	1672	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	The Memphis zone has a rate close to 9 percent.	13	1
201403	1673	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	A large logistics firm reported severe weather-related difficulties during February.	13	1
201403	1674	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	This is an anecdote similar to the one President Williams reported earlier in our meeting, but it is actually a different firm.	13	1
201403	1675	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	According to the CEO, “We have really been scrambling to make adjustments.”	13	1
201403	1676	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Intermodal business in particular was down sharply based on volume during February, but the CEO doubted that underlying demand had shifted.	13	1
201403	1677	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Instead, the problems have had a clear tie to the weather.	13	1
201403	1678	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Trains could not move fast enough.	13	1
201403	1679	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Loading and unloading took too much time.	13	1
201403	1680	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Contracting with outside service providers jumped significantly.	13	1
201403	1681	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I took this anecdote as a microcosm of the types of business challenges faced during the intermeeting period.	13	1
201403	1682	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	For the national outlook, I continue to expect that recent disturbances will abate and even reverse during the March–April time frame, and that data reports in April and May will suggest stronger growth for the US economy.	13	1
201403	1683	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Accordingly, I made only small, modest revisions to the St Louis forecast for this meeting’s SEP.	13	1
201403	1684	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I continue to envision real output growth at or above 3 percent during 2014 and 2015.	13	1
201403	1685	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Our empirical macroeconomic model suggests that oscillatory adjustment to the steady state is likely, and accordingly, I have taken this feature onboard in the St Louis SEP submission.	13	1
201403	1686	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I have inflation moving above target in 2015 before returning to the Committee’s 2 percent objective later in the forecast horizon.	13	1
201403	1687	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	You heard it here first.	13	1
201403	1688	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I also recognize that inflation is inexplicably running low in recent years, and I’m not in any way putting that aside, but I did forecast that inflation will be above target in 2015.	13	1
201403	1689	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I continue to expect improving labor market conditions during 2014, with unemployment moving below 6 percent by the end of the year.	13	1
201403	1690	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Overall, I remain optimistic concerning US growth prospects in 2014 and beyond.	13	1
201403	1691	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	My judgment is that many of the drag factors that we have cited in recent years have dissipated considerably, clearing the way for better macroeconomic performance in the period ahead.	13	1
201403	1692	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Having said this, I acknowledge that first- quarter growth looks like it will be sluggish and that we will not have a good read on whether the scenario I’m expecting is playing out until later in the spring.	13	1
201403	1693	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	There are, of course, many risks in any outlook, but I will highlight just two.	13	1
201403	1694	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	One is that the economy returns to historical form and improves more rapidly than currently projected by most on the Committee and by the outside forecasting community.	13	1
201403	1695	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	With all of the accommodation we have in train, the Committee may in that particular circumstance be badly out of position from a policy perspective.	13	1
201403	1696	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	In this respect, I agree with President Plosser.	13	1
201403	1697	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	We are, in effect, calibrated to a mediocre economy.	13	1
201403	1698	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	The second risk is that, while the current accommodative stance of this Committee does not seem to have fomented excessive financial imbalances so far, we may be entering the more dangerous period from this perspective.	13	1
201403	1699	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	In this respect I agree with President Fisher’s comments from earlier.	13	1
201403	1700	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Many of my contacts have in mind the period from 2004 to 2006, during which the FOMC was removing policy accommodation but a major housing price bubble was forming nevertheless.	13	1
201403	1701	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	With respect to this issue, I appreciated the staff memos as offering ways to frame the concern about financial market instability appropriately.	13	1
201403	1702	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	On the plus side, I think the Committee is generally well aware of these two risks, and so I will not go into them in any further detail for today and will wait for the policy round to make further remarks.	13	1
201403	1703	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1704	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201403	1705	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13	1
201403	1706	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1707	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	The Tenth District economy has continued to expand at a modest pace with considerable support from the energy and agriculture sectors, so my comments about the region will focus on those two sectors.	13	1
201403	1708	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	The recent winter weather has been a net positive for the energy industry, as natural gas prices rose considerably and oil prices remained at high levels.	13	1
201403	1709	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	As a result, energy firms in the District are seeing more cash flow from natural gas operations, which will likely be used to invest in further drilling for oil and natural gas liquids over the next 6 to 12 months.	13	1
201403	1710	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	Natural gas inventories are now very low and will need to be replenished ahead of next winter.	13	1
201403	1711	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	WTI crude oil prices benefited from the opening of the Keystone Pipeline’s southern leg, which began shipping crude oil from Cushing, Oklahoma, to refineries in the Gulf Coast on January 22.	13	1
201403	1712	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	This development eased the bottleneck at Cushing, narrowing the spread between WTI and Brent crude oil significantly, from more than $13 per barrel to around $8.	13	1
201403	1713	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	In the agriculture sector, farm income is expected to drop by more than 25 percent in 2014 from last year’s record levels, driven primarily by a sharp drop in expected crop prices.	13	1
201403	1714	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	Strong profitability in recent years should provide some liquidity for the farm sector in 2014, and the recent farm bill appears to have enhanced the safety net for some producers who could begin to face financial difficulties.	13	1
201403	1715	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	However, rural bankers in farm communities have indicated that the negative outlook for 2014 will likely stress the broader economy in their lending areas.	13	1
201403	1716	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	Gains in farmland values have begun to slow, with lower farm income expectations, although demand for quality farmland remains solid.	13	1
201403	1717	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	In the fourth quarter of 2013, District cropland values increased less than 1 percent from the third quarter, but they remain 9 percent higher than a year ago.	13	1
201403	1718	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	My outlook for the national economy is basically unchanged from January, although I did revise down my outlook for the first quarter of this year by ½ percentage point, reflecting slightly more drag from inventory investment and payback for the stronger-than-expected growth in nonresidential fixed investment in the fourth quarter.	13	1
201403	1719	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	Weather-induced shifts in real activity during the winter months should have little impact on 2014 growth, according to analysis by my staff, although weather undoubtedly had some effect on certain labor market indicators, such as the decline in hours worked in February.	13	1
201403	1720	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	Looking through some of these short-term fluctuations, I continue to expect above-trend growth of 2.6 percent this year, rising to 3 percent for the rest of the forecast horizon.	13	1
201403	1721	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	I would also note that over the four quarters ending in 2013:Q3, real GDI continues to grow faster than real GDP.	13	1
201403	1722	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	The drivers for this growth outlook reflect fading fiscal drag and stronger growth in domestic demand.	13	1
201403	1723	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	Business fixed investment also seems poised to move higher as corporate profits remain near record levels, although my business contacts continue to cite uncertainty and regulation as persistent headwinds.	13	1
201403	1724	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	One contact noted that markets have rewarded publicly- traded companies for buybacks versus capital investments, which tend to pressure their margins.	13	1
201403	1725	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	I remain encouraged by the progress in labor markets.	13	1
201403	1726	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	Over the past two years, an index developed by my staff to measure labor market activity shows sustained improvement supported by historically high levels of momentum.	13	1
201403	1727	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	Most of the key variables in that index improved over the past year.	13	1
201403	1728	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	In particular, the unemployment rate fell 1 percentage point and U-6 fell 1.7 percentage points, the largest year-over-year decline in its history, and the number of people working part time for economic reasons also fell substantially.	13	1
201403	1729	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, the NFIB survey indicates that small businesses are close to being more concerned about the quality of labor than about poor sales.	13	1
201403	1730	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	With regard to inflation, with measures of inflation expectations holding steady, the labor market continuing to gradually normalize, and wage inflation moving higher, I expect inflation to firm and move toward 2 percent over the next few years.	13	1
201403	1731	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1732	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201403	1733	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	13	1
201403	1734	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1735	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I will focus my remarks on the national inflation picture, which remains a matter of great concern to me.	13	1
201403	1736	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We adopted a 2 percent inflation target in January 2012.	13	1
201403	1737	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Since that time, PCE inflation has averaged 1.3 percent, and the inflation outlook remains subdued.	13	1
201403	1738	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Tealbook A, doesn’t see inflation returning to target until 2018.	13	1
201403	1739	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Under the formulation in Tealbook A of the FOMC’s reaction function, my own inflation outlook is about the same.	13	1
201403	1740	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I should note, yet again, that my SEP outlook has no connection to reality.	13	1
201403	1741	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	13	1
201403	1742	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It is grounded in the fundamentally unrealistic assumption that I am in charge of monetary policy.	13	1
201403	1743	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This inflation outlook—that is, the one based on the reaction function in Tealbook A—is playing a key role in my thinking about policy.	13	1
201403	1744	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	For that reason it’s important to constantly question the validity of the outlook.	13	1
201403	1745	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	With that in mind, in preparation for this meeting I asked my staff this question: What evidence is out there that would suggest that our inflation outlook is misleadingly low?	13	1
201403	1746	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I could go through the long laundry list of data that we examined on statistical forecasts, model-based forecasts, inflation expectations, compensation data, et cetera.	13	1
201403	1747	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Rather, I will just offer you our bottom line.	13	1
201403	1748	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We found essentially no evidence that suggested a need to raise our baseline outlook for inflation.	13	1
201403	1749	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Indeed, if anything, one could possibly make the case that our inflation outlook and the one that is in Tealbook A, are actually a little optimistic.	13	1
201403	1750	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This characterization was true nationally, but it is also, and a little more surprisingly, true in the Ninth District economy.	13	1
201403	1751	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In our District, compensation and pricing pressures remain muted, even though the unemployment rate is now well below 5 percent.	13	1
201403	1752	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The only significant compensation pressures that we see in the Ninth District are in North Dakota, where the unemployment rate has now fallen below 3 percent.	13	1
201403	1753	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think this inflation performance and this inflation outlook, combined with our recent policy choices, are problematic for the credibility of our 2 percent inflation target.	13	1
201403	1754	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Having an inflation target has two implications.	13	1
201403	1755	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	First, because inflation forecasts are subject to considerable error, successfully targeting 2 percent means that we should typically be facing relatively similar and significant risks of inflation running above or below 2 percent over the medium term.	13	1
201403	1756	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We don’t right now.	13	1
201403	1757	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My staff’s review of the evidence strongly suggested that the risks of running below 2 percent over the medium term were larger than the risks of running above 2 percent.	13	1
201403	1758	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And it’s worth noting that a lot of our public communication continues to suggest that a significant risk of exceeding 2 percent is unwelcome or even unacceptable to the Committee.	13	1
201403	1759	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The second implication of the term “target” is that when we see inflation deviating from 2 percent, we should be purposefully taking steps to redirect the economy toward the level that we find desirable—that is, 2 percent.	13	1
201403	1760	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We’re not doing that.	13	1
201403	1761	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Instead, we’re content to drift below 2 percent for many years at a time.	13	1
201403	1762	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Indeed, the tapering process could be seen by some as purposely steering the economy away from 2 percent inflation.	13	1
201403	1763	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, I’m concerned about low inflation for another reason, and this ties into some of the remarks that Presidents Lockhart and Rosengren made.	13	1
201403	1764	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The FOMC statement refers to persistently low inflation posing a risk to economic performance.	13	1
201403	1765	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would say that differently.	13	1
201403	1766	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Persistently low inflation signals poor economic performance.	13	1
201403	1767	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So when we are struggling with the issue that President Bullard and President Lacker raised—the question of how much slack there really is in the labor markets—persistently low inflation is a signal to us about what kind of slack is out there.	13	1
201403	1768	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Having low inflation relative to long-term expectations for inflation suggests that we as a country are leaving key resources underutilized.	13	1
201403	1769	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, in my view, we can see that large amount of waste in the data from the labor market.	13	1
201403	1770	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The unemployment rate itself remains high—regardless of what you think of U-3, it still remains high.	13	1
201403	1771	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But there are other significant markers of this kind of underutilization.	13	1
201403	1772	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The fraction of people who are working part time for economic reasons remains very high by historical standards.	13	1
201403	1773	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That has been noted by others.	13	1
201403	1774	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One point that doesn’t get as much attention as I think it deserves is that the fraction of people who have been unemployed less than six months who transition into employment still remains quite low by historical standards.	13	1
201403	1775	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And this is true even if one focuses on prime-age workers.	13	1
201403	1776	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What I’m talking about here is the job-finding rate for people who have been unemployed for less than six months.	13	1
201403	1777	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Many have attributed low employment to disability and retirement effects.	13	1
201403	1778	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But if you look at the fraction of people aged 25 to 54 who are classified as nondisabled by the CPS and who also have a job, that remains very low by pre-recession standards.	13	1
201403	1779	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That casts some doubt, I would say, on disability and retirement playing the full role in explaining low employment.	13	1
201403	1780	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I see all of these labor market markers as suggesting a large degree of underutilization of American human capital, and that ties together with the low inflation outlook—it is entirely consistent with that perspective.	13	1
201403	1781	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So putting it another way, by missing our target of 2 percent inflation persistently, we are failing to deliver on the maximum employment part of our mandate as well.	13	1
201403	1782	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would describe my benchmark outlook as one in which inflation returns to target within the next few years.	13	1
201403	1783	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I put more than a little probability on another possible future, in which the inflation rate is around 1½ percent over the next decade.	13	1
201403	1784	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What would this Committee do in response as this scenario started to unfold or did unfold?	13	1
201403	1785	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m highly uncertain about the answer to this question, which means that I’m uncertain about the credibility of the 2 percent inflation target itself in the period ahead.	13	1
201403	1786	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1787	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201403	1788	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman Dudley.	13	1
201403	1789	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1790	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t take much signal from the slowdown in real GDP growth in the current quarter.	13	1
201403	1791	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I agree with everyone that weather played a role.	13	1
201403	1792	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the effect was probably a little bit greater than in the Tealbook, because there are probably some effects that are hard to measure.	13	1
201403	1793	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	So it’s probably a little bit more than ½ percentage point rather than a little bit less than ½ percentage point, but I’m not going to quibble.	13	1
201403	1794	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, I don’t take much signal from the slowdown in real GDP growth because we did expect some payback from the contributions to GDP from inventories and trade in the current quarter, which were important in boosting the economy in the second half of last year.	13	1
201403	1795	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think the fact that the payroll employment growth trajectory has held up makes me a bit more optimistic that this is just a short-lived pause.	13	1
201403	1796	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	To quote that well-known economic prognosticator, Chauncey Gardner, who was the main protagonist of Being There, “There will be growth in the spring.”	13	1
201403	1797	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	13	1
201403	1798	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, I do take some signal from a couple of things.	13	1
201403	1799	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	The first thing from which I take a signal is the downward revisions to consumer spending that we have seen in the fourth quarter of 2013.	13	1
201403	1800	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	That does suggest that there is a little bit less impetus for growth from the household sector.	13	1
201403	1801	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	And I also take some signal from the fact that housing activity seems to have taken a greater hit from the backup in mortgage rates over the past year than I would have expected.	13	1
201403	1802	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	There is also a broader question that I have been grappling with:  What is the impetus to faster growth in a global context?	13	1
201403	1803	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems that several EMEs around the world are going to have to move to smaller current account deficits or to current account surpluses, if capital flows reverse.	13	1
201403	1804	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	China’s growth also seems to be a considerable downside risk.	13	1
201403	1805	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	We talked about that earlier.	13	1
201403	1806	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	And so I asked myself the question, what is the impetus on the other side that would push the global economy along at a faster pace?	13	1
201403	1807	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to Ukraine, I agree that the direct effects on the US economy are pretty trivial.	13	1
201403	1808	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	But if it goes a particular way, one in which there is a big standoff between the West and Russia and there are sanctions, I can imagine pretty sizable effects because there could actually be a disruption to commodity supply, and then you would have a significant supply shock to the global economy.	13	1
201403	1809	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	My bottom line is that I’m more optimistic still than I was a year ago.	13	1
201403	1810	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I still expect the economy to rebound to about a 3 percent growth trajectory over the remainder of the year as the fiscal drag abates and consumer spending and business fixed investment are supported by buoyant financial conditions.	13	1
201403	1811	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	But at the same time, I don’t think a fast recovery is yet “in the bag.”	13	1
201403	1812	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m worried about the downside risks to my forecast, especially given the fact that our forecast errors have mostly been on that side in recent years.	13	1
201403	1813	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	On inflation, I agree with President Kocherlakota that the 2 percent objective is supposed to be a target that you hit over time—it’s not a ceiling.	13	1
201403	1814	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	And so I think we should be trying to spend half the time marginally on both sides of that 2 percent objective.	13	1
201403	1815	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	But I am not as concerned as he is about the fact that we are continuing to track a bit below our target.	13	1
201403	1816	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Inflation expectations are well anchored.	13	1
201403	1817	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	The slack in the economy appears to be gradually diminishing.	13	1
201403	1818	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Compensation trends appear stable.	13	1
201403	1819	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Nominal incomes are rising.	13	1
201403	1820	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	So apart from the core inflation readings themselves, the situation doesn’t seem very dire.	13	1
201403	1821	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, I do think that core inflation will drift up over the next few months for several reasons.	13	1
201403	1822	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	First, some of the softness, as the staff has pointed out over time, is due to special factors.	13	1
201403	1823	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	In addition to the very benign trend for some nonpriced services, health-care price trends have been unusually subdued.	13	1
201403	1824	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	And some of this is due to a one-time shift last April in Medicare reimbursement rates that won’t be repeated.	13	1
201403	1825	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	That is going to fall out of the numbers once we get the April data.	13	1
201403	1826	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, I think the increase in home prices is almost certainly going to feed through more into owners’ equivalent rent and rental prices.	13	1
201403	1827	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I would be very surprised if a year from now we don’t see core inflation higher by at least a few tenths of a percent, if not more.	13	1
201403	1828	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	13	1
201403	1829	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13	1
201403	1830	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1831	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	The first thing I want to say is, if that staff person who did all the weather work has researched and filled out an NCAA bracket, I think he should circulate it [laughter] before the deadline for getting your stuff into the pools.	13	1
201403	1832	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Can we split the profit prize?	13	1
201403	1833	2014-03-19	meeting	WILCOX	He is subcontracted to Nate Silver.	13	1
201403	1834	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	I join what seems to me to be something of a consensus around the table that, although developments since the previous FOMC meeting suggest a little diminution in the momentum of the economy, the basic narrative hasn’t changed.	13	1
201403	1835	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	I also agree that a notable development since then has been a significant increase in externally generated downside risks, although, for some of the reasons that Steve explained earlier, it is hard to quantify those, at least at this point.	13	1
201403	1836	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Like President Lacker, I am going to dedicate most of what I say to labor markets, although probably with a somewhat different direction.	13	1
201403	1837	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	But I do want to begin with a point of agreement with Jeff, which is that in speaking about the anticipated shift in our guidance we should emphasize the fact that we are getting to the 6.5 percent threshold, and of course that is exactly what the language in the proposed paragraph 7 does.	13	1
201403	1838	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	It says, “with the unemployment rate nearing 6½ percent.”	13	1
201403	1839	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	I think it continues to be difficult to reconcile, at least on the basis of past experience and consequent expectations, everything that has been going on in labor markets.	13	1
201403	1840	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	It seems that, for each piece of information suggesting structural change in the labor markets—such as the large number of people out of the labor force who report that they don’t want a job—there is another piece of information suggesting that significant slack remains— such as the continued elevated levels of people who report working part time but who would like a full-time job, which is reflected, of course, in the U-6 number that several people have cited.	13	1
201403	1841	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	We probably are going to continue to have to read most labor market indicators more tentatively than one might have done prior to the recession.	13	1
201403	1842	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Some, like the US Beveridge curve, have only a relatively short history to begin with.	13	1
201403	1843	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	And even those that have been around a lot longer are likely to be of at least somewhat less assistance in interpreting broader economic trends, precisely because the magnitude of the financial crisis and the Great Recession have either delayed the reversion of behavior by employers and workers to pre-crisis norms, accelerated secular changes in the economy, including labor market dynamism changes that were already at work, introduced a new set of changes in labor market behavior that will persist, or some combination of all three of these possibilities.	13	1
201403	1844	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	There are a number of arguments out there now that purport to establish structural explanations based on experience to date.	13	1
201403	1845	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	In each case, there is, or at some point may be, something to these explanations.	13	1
201403	1846	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	But I don’t think that they can be more than hypotheses right now.	13	1
201403	1847	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	I have to confess to some disappointment that nobody has raised some of those yet today, because I had prepared a stunning rebuttal to any such arguments.	13	1
201403	1848	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	13	1
201403	1849	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	So I am going to omit several of them—unless one of you has the temerity next time to mention it, in which case I will still be prepared—and instead just talk about one, which is the argument for less slack based on the fact that the rate of short-term unemployment has returned to pre-recession levels.	13	1
201403	1850	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think this observation tells us too much beyond the fact that the rate of separations has come down substantially, and that there is hiring going on.	13	1
201403	1851	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Since the short-term unemployed become, by definition, long-term unemployed after 26 weeks, the declining rate of separations assures that there is going to be a limited universe of the short-term unemployed.	13	1
201403	1852	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	And, more important, it doesn’t really address the issue that should be central for us, which is how much slack does remain in labor markets.	13	1
201403	1853	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	That is, a lot of these things are interesting intellectual questions, and people will be writing about them for years.	13	1
201403	1854	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	But from our point of view, in making monetary policy, the answer to each of these little conundrums is less important than the ultimate question of how much slack does remain.	13	1
201403	1855	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Now, some have tried to connect the observation on short-term unemployment more directly to slack by arguing either that the long-term unemployed exert little or no downward pressure on wages or that the supposedly stable Beveridge curve relationship between vacancy rates and the short-term unemployed suggests that the long-term unemployed do not represent slack in labor markets.	13	1
201403	1856	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	The Board’s staff circulated a memo last week that addresses the first argument quite well.	13	1
201403	1857	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	On the second, again, I’m not sure the argument adds too much beyond the fact that as a historical matter there are a lot of long-term unemployed relative to short-term unemployed.	13	1
201403	1858	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	And this seems to be the classic case in which it would be a mistake to infer too much from deviations from an observed relationship that was developed over a relatively short time span that did not include anything approaching a disruption in the economy similar to that which we experienced half a decade ago.	13	1
201403	1859	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Given these unusual circumstances, there could be other factors that are both shifting the Beveridge curve and contributing to long-term unemployment.	13	1
201403	1860	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Read anything that Peter Diamond has written, and one will come to your mind, which is that in an environment of uncertain demand growth, firms have made less intense efforts to fill some kinds of vacancies or have awaited the perfect candidate rather than filling the vacancy with a serviceable or less experienced one as they might if demand were rising more quickly and the need were more intense.	13	1
201403	1861	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Going back to the data that we do have, we continue to see that job-finding rates for the long-term unemployed declined during the recession and recovery less than for the short-term unemployed—though of course, in absolute terms, the rates for the former are higher.	13	1
201403	1862	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	It is true that exit rates from the workforce by the long-term unemployed ticked up last year after having remained quite similar to rates for the short-term unemployed throughout most of the recession and recovery, and that is something that might indicate a shift, but to date it is a tentative shift.	13	1
201403	1863	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	I would end by saying, again, that there is almost surely some structural damage here, and it is very unlikely that all of the long-term unemployed represent labor market slack.	13	1
201403	1864	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	But to this point, there really isn’t very convincing evidence for the proposition that they reflect only a very limited amount of slack, which is sometimes the implicit premise of the arguments one hears.	13	1
201403	1865	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	A couple of points on wages.	13	1
201403	1866	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	There has been some evidence of increased wage growth, but I would make two observations.	13	1
201403	1867	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	First, wage growth is hardly generalized or rapid to this point, and I think the anecdotal information that some of you have provided is supportive of that observation.	13	1
201403	1868	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Second, and maybe more controversially, the prospect that wage gains from what have been very depressed levels for some time will be more generalized and sustained in the next couple of years should quite possibly be read not as bad news—the inevitable sowing of undesirable inflationary seeds—but as good news.	13	1
201403	1869	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	That is, you can make the argument that the economy is in need of a wage recovery that will allocate a larger proportion of productivity gains to labor, thereby reversing recent trends, allowing for more sustained increases in personal consumption expenditures, and thus helping to lay the foundations for a firmer demand, production, and investment cycle.	13	1
201403	1870	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Uncertainty around what is going on in labor markets makes it an interesting time to be a labor economist, but it makes it somewhat more frustrating for us.	13	1
201403	1871	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	To the degree that this issue has importance for us in deciding on monetary policy, as I indicated a few moments ago, the mixed signals should be of less concern now than they might have been had we experienced a period of rapid growth during the recovery.	13	1
201403	1872	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Just a couple of years ago, the prevailing view around this table was that eventually we’d see growth rates at an annualized 4 percent or more.	13	1
201403	1873	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	The expectation of rapid growth raised at least the debate as to whether a reasonably rapid tightening in monetary policy might be needed.	13	1
201403	1874	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	But now, probably in part precisely because we have had a modest recovery in place for several years, it seems unlikely that we will experience the sort of spurt in growth that might have engendered concerns about wage pressures and expectations that could get away from us.	13	1
201403	1875	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1876	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201403	1877	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Stein.	13	1
201403	1878	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1879	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Despite some of the ups and downs of the recent data, my overall outlook for the medium term is not much changed and remains very close to that of the Tealbook.	13	1
201403	1880	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	For example, I have GDP growth in the ballpark of 3 percent this year and next, and I also have unemployment coming down to 6.2 percent by year-end.	13	1
201403	1881	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I still expect to see decent growth in consumer spending, supported by wealth effects and stronger consumer balance sheets as well as a pickup in capital spending by businesses.	13	1
201403	1882	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Housing is probably going to become less of an impetus , in part because of mortgage rates and in part simply because house prices are closer to being back in line with fundamentals.	13	1
201403	1883	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I thought I would focus the remainder of my remarks on conditions in credit markets and how things have evolved over the past couple of years.	13	1
201403	1884	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I’m going to cover a little bit of the same ground that Richard did.	13	1
201403	1885	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	In my case, I was prompted by an interesting conversation I had with a market participant who is in the business of packaging and reselling loans to banks and who, as a result, has a good window into the pipeline for various sorts of credit assets.	13	1
201403	1886	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	This particular person expressed some alarm over what he saw as the recent developments just over the past weeks, I guess—maybe months.	13	1
201403	1887	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	He said that the market was in the middle of a “meltup,” and that there had been a capitulation on the part of some lenders and some investors who had been trying to hold out and wait.	13	1
201403	1888	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	At this point, he says, they’re capitulating, feeling that they had no choice but to put their money to work.	13	1
201403	1889	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	He thought a further downward leg in credit spreads of another 50 basis points was coming in the pipeline, although this sounded a little bit uncertain.	13	1
201403	1890	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	There was a lot of talk about covenant stripping and other erosion in nonprice terms, as well as some general sense that this was pretty widespread across a variety of credit assets.	13	1
201403	1891	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	The sense that things were changing rapidly struck me as a little bit dissonant with other stuff, but the broad story didn’t seem unusual.	13	1
201403	1892	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	And if you read the memo by Eichner and Natalucci on market participants, it has a similar feel.	13	1
201403	1893	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	They talk about, again, continual gradual erosion in pricing and terms—that sort of thing.	13	1
201403	1894	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I was trying to think about this.	13	1
201403	1895	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	One issue with all of these anecdotal reports, beyond the fact that they’re anecdotal, is that they give you a better sense of the local rate of change than of where we are in absolute terms.	13	1
201403	1896	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	It’s always like, “This month, there is a gradual erosion in terms,” and I wondered where we were in some absolute sense.	13	1
201403	1897	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	So I did a little bit of what President Fisher did.	13	1
201403	1898	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I just tried to look at data on prices.	13	1
201403	1899	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	It’s not ideal, because the prices are just the prices, and you don’t capture, on a historical basis, the spread stuff.	13	1
201403	1900	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	But, to echo what President Fisher said, I looked at the Markit CDX high-yield index.	13	1
201403	1901	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	It’s around 320 now.	13	1
201403	1902	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	It’s been coming down pretty steadily over the past couple of years.	13	1
201403	1903	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Two years ago, it was in the neighborhood of 700.	13	1
201403	1904	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	A year ago, it was about 430.	13	1
201403	1905	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Again, it’s around 320 now.	13	1
201403	1906	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Its average over the sample period was about 550.	13	1
201403	1907	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	So we’re about 230 basis points below average.	13	1
201403	1908	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I looked at the average during the boom, which I defined as 2006 and the first half of 2007, and it was 290.	13	1
201403	1909	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	So we’re not there yet, but we’re pretty close.	13	1
201403	1910	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	If you look at various high-yield indexes, they tell a similar story.	13	1
201403	1911	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	We’re, simultaneously, not at the lows but a couple of hundred basis points below any historical average.	13	1
201403	1912	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Another take that I like is, these two guys at Harvard Business School, Sam Hanson and Robin Greenwood, have produced a forecasting model whereby you can predict the future returns over the next two years to holding junk bonds, essentially.	13	1
201403	1913	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	The two inputs into that model are credit spreads and the issuance share of high-yield firms.	13	1
201403	1914	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Basically, when a lot of guys are issuing high-yield bonds, it’s because they think that the unobservable terms are pretty attractive.	13	1
201403	1915	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	So there tends to be a lot of issuance.	13	1
201403	1916	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	This model has a remarkable forecasting ability.	13	1
201403	1917	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	It forecasts returns two years ahead with an R-squared of 40 percent.	13	1
201403	1918	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	So you run their model.	13	1
201403	1919	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	It says that expected returns over the next two years on junk bonds relative to Treasuries are about minus 2 percent.	13	1
201403	1920	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	That is to say, junk bonds are expected to underperform Treasuries because of the two inputs into the model—credit spreads are low and the high-yield share is high.	13	1
201403	1921	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	To give you a sense of that, minus 2 percent is about where we were in 2006.	13	1
201403	1922	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	It’s obviously on the low side because, on average, you don’t earn less than Treasuries when investing in junk bonds.	13	1
201403	1923	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	It’s not epically low.	13	1
201403	1924	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I tried to get a sense of it.	13	1
201403	1925	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	It’s probably somewhere between the 20th and 30th percentiles of the distribution.	13	1
201403	1926	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I think all of these things paint that kind of qualitative picture.	13	1
201403	1927	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	It’s low.	13	1
201403	1928	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	It’s come down quite a lot.	13	1
201403	1929	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	It’s not dramatically low.	13	1
201403	1930	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	None of these measures suggest historically low levels.	13	1
201403	1931	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I do think that, if we had another 6 to 12 months of decline like we’ve had, then we’d be flirting with 5th percentile territory.	13	1
201403	1932	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Then we’d be in a situation in which credit spreads are really at or near historical lows.	13	1
201403	1933	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	To me, that would be concerning.	13	1
201403	1934	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I would say that it would be more concerning than the stock market stuff because we have evidence—less so for the stock market, but—when credit spreads spike up 50 basis points, that tends to be associated with pretty bad things happening to GDP and unemployment.	13	1
201403	1935	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I’m not making a causal statement, just a correlational one.	13	1
201403	1936	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	So I would be pretty uncomfortable in that situation.	13	1
201403	1937	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Having said all of that—I thought about this for a long time—I don’t know what the policy implications of that are.	13	1
201403	1938	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	It seems to me that if you worry about financial stability, it makes you want to step more lightly both going in and coming out.	13	1
201403	1939	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	That is to say, you might have added less accommodation on the easing part of the cycle than you otherwise would because you don’t want to let things get too out of hand, but, once you reverse course—and especially if you’re reversing course when you perceive markets to be somewhat overheated— you might want to do so a little bit gingerly.	13	1
201403	1940	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	You’re going to have to tiptoe out of the room to some extent.	13	1
201403	1941	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	In my own mind, some of these financial-stability considerations incline me to be a little bit more “hawked up” on the way in and when we were continuing on with QE3.	13	1
201403	1942	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	It doesn’t get me to that same place now.	13	1
201403	1943	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Right now, it feels to me as though the most important goal is to manage.	13	1
201403	1944	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	We’re on the transition back to normal, and it seems as though the imperative is to manage that as smoothly as possible, whatever that implies.	13	1
201403	1945	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I think you’ve got to be careful here because, of course, you could argue that if we worry too much about smoothness and about not upsetting the markets, we can err on the side of being too slow, and that’s going to kick the can down the road.	13	1
201403	1946	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	So I understand there’s not a clear implication here.	13	1
201403	1947	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	There is a little bit of a sense that the fuse has been lit, and, again, if the trends continue, we’re going to be in a somewhat tricky place, not that I have a clear sense of what to do about it.	13	1
201403	1948	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Thank you.	13	1
201403	1949	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201403	1950	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13	1
201403	1951	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	1952	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	My forecast is not much changed and remains close to the baseline, except that I’ve got a lower path for the funds rate, and I moved up my funds rate from 1.75 percent to 2 percent in 2016.	13	1
201403	1953	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	I’m going to devote the bulk of my remarks to the issue of labor market slack, as several others have.	13	1
201403	1954	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	But, first, I’m going to briefly revisit the SEP issue because I’m sitting here feeling as though we didn’t quite get to the heart of it in our earlier discussions.	13	1
201403	1955	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	The 50 basis point change in our SEP for 2016, in the face of a downbeat paragraph 1 in the statement and market expectations of no change at all, is going to be very hard to explain—more specifically, very hard for you to explain.	13	1
201403	1956	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	[Laughter]	13	1
201403	1957	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	There are three possible explanations, and this is about the disagreement between the new SEP and the expectation of the market.	13	1
201403	1958	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	The first is that we think the economy is better than the market thinks it is.	13	1
201403	1959	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	I don’t think that’s right.	13	1
201403	1960	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	The second is that the market misunderstood our reaction function and has new learning to do on that subject.	13	1
201403	1961	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	First, I don’t think that’s true, but, second, we’re at the beginning of the normalization process.	13	1
201403	1962	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	It’s going really well.	13	1
201403	1963	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	The single worst thing we could do is to send a confusing signal about our reaction function.	13	1
201403	1964	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	So that’s not an answer we want to provide, and, again, I don’t think it’s true.	13	1
201403	1965	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	The third explanation is that the market doesn’t really understand how the SEP works and how it gets put together, and I think that’s where the truth is.	13	1
201403	1966	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	Specifically, what I’m hearing is that—I’m not sure everyone around the room is aware of this—25 of the basis points are due to what we euphemistically refer to as a change in personnel on the Committee since December.	13	1
201403	1967	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	Another 25 basis points are due to the fact that 13 of the 16 members who are in the room now have an increase of 25 basis points or less.	13	1
201403	1968	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	Somehow that works out to be an increase of 50 basis points in a world in which people are going to rip to that page of the SEP, look at the dots, and, in the 30 minutes between the time when the statement goes out and the time when you walk in front of the cameras, some of them are going to land on the second explanation.	13	1
201403	1969	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	Even if they don’t this time, they will some other time.	13	1
201403	1970	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	This is probably stretching a metaphor too far, but it’s like the scene of a nuclear plant that’s blown up, and a series of engineers are all saying, “We did the right thing.	13	1
201403	1971	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	We did exactly what we were supposed to do.	13	1
201403	1972	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	It was right here in the book.”	13	1
201403	1973	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	That is probably not the best metaphor.	13	1
201403	1974	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I guess you’ve been watching too many episodes of The Simpsons.	13	1
201403	1975	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	13	1
201403	1976	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	I think this process needs some reengineering.	13	1
201403	1977	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	There is a significant risk, and if this doesn’t get us this time, we’re going to face it again.	13	1
201403	1978	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	It has to do with medians and all of that sort of thing.	13	1
201403	1979	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	With that said, I will move on.	13	1
201403	1980	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	I want to talk briefly about the question of labor market slack and its implications for the full employment mandate and for the behavior of measures of compensation and broader price inflation.	13	1
201403	1981	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	As the economy recovers, these issues are going to be on the front burner, as they obviously already are.	13	1
201403	1982	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	The baseline estimate of the natural rate is currently 5.4 percent, which leaves an unemployment gap of about 1.3 percent.	13	1
201403	1983	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	To me, there are good reasons to think that labor market slack may be even higher, and I would cite the disproportionate decline of the labor force participation rate below our estimate of trend and the unusually high level of those who are working part time for economic reasons.	13	1
201403	1984	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	Labor flows, as Governor Tarullo pointed out—especially quits and hires—suggest a labor market that’s not fully recovered.	13	1
201403	1985	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	For these and other reasons, my prior is that the unemployment gap more likely understates slack than overstates it.	13	1
201403	1986	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	I also think the level of slack is even more uncertain than usual, so that raises a question:  How do we know?	13	1
201403	1987	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	How will one be able to tell that the economy is getting close to full employment?	13	1
201403	1988	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	To start to believe that the labor market is getting tight, one would want to see some fairly broad confirmation across a range of labor and other market indicators that we look at, and one particularly important metric would be the growth rate of wage and benefits.	13	1
201403	1989	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	As I suggested a moment ago, we care about labor market slack for two closely related but different reasons.	13	1
201403	1990	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	First, the full employment mandate directs us to eliminate it.	13	1
201403	1991	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	And, second, the inflation mandate would be threatened in either direction if the Committee estimated the gap incorrectly.	13	1
201403	1992	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	The excellent memo by Katia Peneva asks whether long-term unemployment exerts less downward pressure on compensation than does short-term unemployment.	13	1
201403	1993	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	But, for purposes of the full employment mandate, I’m not sure that matters.	13	1
201403	1994	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	Unemployment is unemployment.	13	1
201403	1995	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	The fact that some of the unemployed may exert more or less pressure on wages matters for the inflation mandate only.	13	1
201403	1996	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	Even as people fall out of the labor force—for example, after their benefits expire—there’s a reasonable likelihood that their attachment to the labor force would return if jobs were plentiful.	13	1
201403	1997	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	So policy should not be too eager to give up on these people without some evidence that the labor market is actually getting tight.	13	1
201403	1998	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	Moving to wage inflation, the thrust of the memo is that the case advanced by Robert Gordon and others for ignoring long-term unemployment has not been made, and I see the memo as successful in achieving that limited goal.	13	1
201403	1999	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	But it also seems to me that risks remain.	13	1
201403	2000	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	We know that search intensity declines with the length of unemployment.	13	1
201403	2001	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	There’s strong evidence that employers take some signal from the length of unemployment, leading them to prefer candidates unemployed for shorter periods.	13	1
201403	2002	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	The rate of job finding declines with the length of unemployment.	13	1
201403	2003	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	And, finally, longer-term unemployment is so far above normal levels that we should be cautious about relying on relationships in the data that were stable in more normal periods.	13	1
201403	2004	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	With all of that, it seems quite plausible to me that, while Gordon’s case has not yet been made, it may still prove right in the long term.	13	1
201403	2005	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	So I would just put this risk under the category of one to be monitored.	13	1
201403	2006	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	More broadly and more immediately important, is undesirable compensation inflation a risk in the near term?	13	1
201403	2007	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	The evidence suggests to me that it’s not.	13	1
201403	2008	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	In a standard model, real compensation should increase with productivity, which has generally run about 1½ percent over the long run and since the crisis.	13	1
201403	2009	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	So one might say that the normal level of compensation inflation that is consistent with full employment and price inflation of 2 percent is about 3 to 3½ percent.	13	1
201403	2010	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	But compensation inflation as shown by the ECI and other broad measures has been only 2 percent for several years.	13	1
201403	2011	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	The exception is the narrower measure of wages for nonsupervisory employees, which is near 2½ percent.	13	1
201403	2012	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	The fact that this one indicator of wages is beginning to move up is not enough to suggest that the Committee is in danger of falling behind the curve.	13	1
201403	2013	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	Compensation growth is at levels that are well below normal, and a modest increase would be welcome.	13	1
201403	2014	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	In fact, if the Committee is to attain its 2 percent price inflation objective, there will need to be a significant acceleration in compensation inflation toward more normal levels.	13	1
201403	2015	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	Now, I’m not suggesting that the relationship between compensation inflation and price inflation is a tight one.	13	1
201403	2016	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	What I am suggesting is that neither of them is sending any signal like tightness at the moment.	13	1
201403	2017	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201403	2018	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, Governor Powell.	13	1
201403	2019	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	And thanks, everybody, for your observations and comments.	13	1
201403	2020	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	It’s been a very interesting discussion.	13	1
201403	2021	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I want to say that, in terms of FOMC management, I am committed to continuity.	13	1
201403	2022	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	That said, I now intend to depart slightly from previous practice because we’ve reached the point at which Ben would present an encyclopedic summary of our economic go-round.	13	1
201403	2023	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	13	1
201403	2024	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I sat here and marveled at his ability to accomplish that type of summing up, drawing in insights from every single participant during the go-round.	13	1
201403	2025	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I do want you to know that I, too, have listened carefully to what all of you have said, but I am not going to try to provide that kind of detailed summation.	13	1
201403	2026	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Instead, I’m going to do something marginally different.	13	1
201403	2027	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	What I’ll try to do is to summarize what I’ve heard as the main comments and conclusions of this discussion about three questions that I think bear importantly on our policy decisions and that we reference in our statement.	13	1
201403	2028	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	The first question is, Does incoming data pertaining to the labor market suggest that the labor market recovery is still on track?	13	1
201403	2029	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	The second question is, Are incoming data on spending consistent with ongoing improvement in the labor market over time?	13	1
201403	2030	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	And the third question is, Is it reasonable to expect that inflation will return to our 2 percent objective over time?	13	1
201403	2031	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	If you look at what alternative B says on the first question, it summarizes recent labor market developments by saying that “labor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement.”	13	1
201403	2032	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	As I listened to your characterizations of labor market developments, it seemed to me that that statement roughly reflects what I heard.	13	1
201403	2033	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	You talked about a number of different metrics that we can look at to assess what’s been happening in the labor market.	13	1
201403	2034	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	The standard unemployment indicator, U-3, has moved down three-tenths since December.	13	1
201403	2035	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	You pointed out that broader measures, like U-6, have also declined.	13	1
201403	2036	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	And if we look at completely different kinds of indicators of what’s happening in the labor market—for example, those reflecting the job hiring rate, the quit rate, and so forth—while they’re not all exactly consistent in showing the same extent of improvement, it seems to me that, on balance, all of those indicators point in the same direction and suggest that we’ve seen improvement.	13	1
201403	2037	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, it’s also important for us to assess just how much slack there is in the labor market.	13	1
201403	2038	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	And I really didn’t hear anybody give the argument that Governor Tarullo so effectively rebutted.	13	1
201403	2039	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	13	1
201403	2040	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I fully expected somebody to argue that, because the short-term unemployment rate had declined so much, that was suggesting slack in the labor market has diminished.	13	1
201403	2041	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	But I actually didn’t hear that argument.	13	1
201403	2042	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	We have a debate about whether U-3 is a perfect summary statistic or whether other indicators may show more slack in the labor market.	13	1
201403	2043	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	But, certainly, the standard unemployment rate measure suggests that there’s still a lot of slack in the labor market.	13	1
201403	2044	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Broader measures, like U-6, may suggest yet more slack.	13	1
201403	2045	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	The extent of part-time employment is unusually high.	13	1
201403	2046	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	We had a good discussion of trends in labor force participation, but I believe that the staff and participants here think there are cyclical elements to labor force participation.	13	1
201403	2047	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	So if we were running a tighter economy, there may be, as I think President Lockhart called it, shadow unemployment out there—people who would come into the labor force.	13	1
201403	2048	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	The natural place, I guess, to look to decide whether we are running into tight labor markets—many of you referred to this—is the behavior of wages.	13	1
201403	2049	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Wage growth has been, as I believe David described it, tepid.	13	1
201403	2050	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Some of you described it as low.	13	1
201403	2051	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	As Governor Powell just mentioned, we would need to see something like 3½ percent wage growth as being consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective, and, instead, wage inflation is running at something more like 2 percent.	13	1
201403	2052	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	So wage growth seems quite low.	13	1
201403	2053	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Arguably, we should really want to see that come up.	13	1
201403	2054	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	And while there are some arguments about difficulties in hiring certain kinds of workers, as President Evans noted, this is something that’s a perennial.	13	1
201403	2055	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I’ve been impressed with this in the past.	13	1
201403	2056	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	You can’t talk to businesses without hearing about the difficulty of hiring certain kinds of labor, and that may have increased somewhat, but that’s probably not a sign the labor market is really tight.	13	1
201403	2057	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	On the second question of whether incoming data on spending and productivity indicate enough strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in the labor market, basically, what I heard in the discussion is that the answer to that question is “yes.”	13	1
201403	2058	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Obviously, there’s a lot of uncertainty thrown into this assessment by the severe winter weather and by the fact that, in a sense, we got head-faked in January and substantially revised up our outlook.	13	1
201403	2059	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Now the disappointment is not all weather, but part of it is simply saying that what we thought we were seeing in January is strength that wasn’t really there.	13	1
201403	2060	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	But if we compare our thinking in December and now, it seems roughly unchanged in terms of the amount of underlying momentum in the economy.	13	1
201403	2061	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Obviously, waning fiscal drag provides support.	13	1
201403	2062	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I noticed that many of you mentioned reports of positive business outlook and business confidence—the view that businesses are feeling good and may be poised to increase their spending.	13	1
201403	2063	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	An area of concern here is housing, which really has been running slower than I think any of us would have expected.	13	1
201403	2064	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	But again, generally, while it certainly looks as though the increase in mortgage rates we saw last spring and summer has had a very meaningful negative impact on the housing market, still, I heard a general feeling that we’ll get beyond this soft patch and the recovery will come back again.	13	1
201403	2065	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Regarding risks, obviously, there are the geopolitical risks that we discussed having to do with emerging markets:  Ukraine and China.	13	1
201403	2066	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	We had an interesting discussion of potential financial-stability risks, which duly noted developments in credit markets and in equity markets that we really need to pay careful attention to, although, again, as Governor Stein mentioned, it’s subtle as to exactly what the right moral is to take from that.	13	1
201403	2067	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	On inflation, everybody commented on the fact that inflation is low.	13	1
201403	2068	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	We do say in our statement that we wouldn’t want to see it run persistently below our objective, and that that would create risks, including rising real interest rates, that would impede recovery.	13	1
201403	2069	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Most of you seem pretty comfortable with the view—and I think almost all of you have it in your SEP forecasts—that inflation will gradually move back toward 2 percent over time, with diminishing slack and well-anchored inflationary expectations.	13	1
201403	2070	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	But I certainly did hear many notes of caution about this.	13	1
201403	2071	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	We don’t really see evidence at this point that inflation is moving back up over time.	13	1
201403	2072	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	And we have to be very attentive to make sure that that occurs.	13	1
201403	2073	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I’d summarize by saying that most of you seem to see improvement in labor markets with enough momentum to support ongoing improvement over time; and inflation that’s low and no firm evidence—but a reasonable presumption—that the forces are there to raise it over time.	13	1
201403	2074	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I’d just add a couple of comments of my own.	13	1
201403	2075	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I’m not going to add very much.	13	1
201403	2076	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I agree with those assessments.	13	1
201403	2077	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I’d say that one thing I do find sobering is that we’ve seen ongoing improvement in labor market conditions in a context in which growth has been running only around 2 percent.	13	1
201403	2078	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	My forecast, like many of yours, shows growth moving up to close to 3 percent or over 3 percent for the next several years.	13	1
201403	2079	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I think that’s what’s likely to happen.	13	1
201403	2080	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	But, until pretty recently, I thought that that had to happen for us to see continued improvement in the labor market, and I, frankly, no longer think that’s the case.	13	1
201403	2081	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Since 2010, productivity in the nonfarm business sector has grown at an annual average pace of just 1.1 percent.	13	1
201403	2082	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	The Tealbook has once again revised down potential GDP growth to better reconcile the observed decline in the unemployment rate with GDP growth.	13	1
201403	2083	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	And the Tealbook projects productivity to accelerate noticeably.	13	1
201403	2084	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I have to say that I’m not so sure, and I think we need to remain open to the possibility that the trend growth rate may have persistently shifted down.	13	1
201403	2085	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	This is something that would be a substantial negative from the perspective of long-run improvement in living standards, but it could well result in a more rapid return to full employment than in the baseline Tealbook forecast.	13	1
201403	2086	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, on inflation, it seems to me that inflation is now stabilized but at a very uncomfortably low level.	13	1
201403	2087	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	My SEP shows it moving back over time, but I don’t think we fully understand why inflation has been running so low.	13	1
201403	2088	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	And I don’t think that we should take too much comfort from the fact that inflation expectations, whether they’re survey- or market-based measures, seem to be well anchored.	13	1
201403	2089	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	In Japan, inflation has persistently run below the levels that were expected for almost two decades.	13	1
201403	2090	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	A situation in which longer-term nominal rates are boosted by inflation expectations that then run persistently above realized inflation is likely damaging to the economy.	13	1
201403	2091	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	So I will be focused on the behavior of inflation and attentive to the possibility that inflation may not be moving back up to 2 percent in the months ahead.	13	1
201403	2092	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there.	13	1
201403	2093	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I think we have time to turn next to Bill for a discussion and briefing on monetary policy.	21	2
201403	2094	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21	2
201403	2095	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	I’ll be referring to the exhibits that were distributed before this session that are labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21	2
201403	2096	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	The top-left panel of the first exhibit shows the projected path of SOMA holdings under the three policy alternatives described in the Tealbook along with the median dealer expectation (the black solid line), which closely tracks the staff projection under alternative B.	21	2
201403	2097	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	As indicated to the right, all dealers anticipate with virtual certainty another $10 billion reduction in the pace of purchases at this meeting, and almost all expect that the program will be wound down by the end of October.	21	2
201403	2098	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Many dealers commented that they saw the Committee as highly unlikely to deviate from this measured pace of reductions unless economic developments warranted a significant downgrade or upgrade of the Committee’s medium-term outlook for economic growth and the labor market or for inflation.	21	2
201403	2099	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	The table in the middle-left panel summarizes Desk survey results regarding expectations for economic conditions at the time of the first increase in the federal funds rate.	21	2
201403	2100	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Most see the first increase in the funds rate occurring when the unemployment rate has fallen to 6 percent or less.	21	2
201403	2101	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	And most also expect current and projected inflation to be close to the Committee’s 2 percent target at that time.	21	2
201403	2102	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	The panel to the right shows that dealers’ expectations for the path of the federal funds rate moved up slightly since the time of the December meeting (the red lines).	21	2
201403	2103	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	As Laura reported earlier, the medians of your SEP projections for the funds rate (the solid dots) also moved up relative to their December values (the hollow dots).	21	2
201403	2104	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	I’d add, because I may have caused this uncertainty, that the 50 basis point rise in the median funds rate in the SEP at the end of 2016 would be 37½ basis points if the person who left were not counted in December.	21	2
201403	2105	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	So if we dropped the Bernanke observation in December, you’d still get 37.5, but it would be less than the 50 that is shown here.	21	2
201403	2106	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	The basic problem here is that the number of participants is relatively small, the underlying data are discrete in 25 basis point intervals, and, when you take a median, you can get results that are a little bit unexpected.	21	2
201403	2107	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	The medians from the March SEP lie a bit above the March survey paths for both the dealers and those on the buy side.	21	2
201403	2108	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	That said, most of you, as well as most of the survey respondents, anticipate that the funds rate will remain noticeably below its longer-run level— shown in the inset box—for some time after liftoff.	21	2
201403	2109	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	The bottom panel summarizes respondents’ expectations for revisions to the Committee’s forward guidance.	21	2
201403	2110	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Most expect the Committee either to drop the quantitative thresholds or to de-emphasize them.	21	2
201403	2111	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	As Simon noted earlier, the survey respondents place high odds on a shift to qualitative guidance, with the majority expecting that the Committee’s assessment of the appropriate time to first raise the funds rate would be based on a broad set of labor market indicators or that the Committee might suggest greater concern about below-target inflation.	21	2
201403	2112	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Moreover, most anticipate that any new forward guidance would reaffirm the Committee’s current accommodative policy stance and thus would not affect current market expectations for the timing of liftoff or the subsequent path of the funds rate during normalization.	21	2
201403	2113	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Turning to the alternatives for this meeting, alternative B, on page 6, may appeal to policymakers who continue to view the economy as evolving about as they expected at the time of the January meeting and, with the unemployment rate approaching 6½ percent, see this meeting as the appropriate occasion to introduce new forward guidance about the Committee’s intentions regarding the federal funds rate.	21	2
201403	2114	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	The first paragraph updates the Committee’s summary of recent economic developments, attributing part of the recent slowdown in economic growth to adverse weather conditions.	21	2
201403	2115	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	The characterization of the economic outlook in paragraph 2 is relatively little changed from the January statement.	21	2
201403	2116	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	However, rather than pointing specifically to a gradual further decline in the unemployment rate, the paragraph adopts a broader view that “labor market conditions will continue to improve gradually” toward those consistent with the dual mandate.	21	2
201403	2117	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	The risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market are described as “nearly balanced.”	21	2
201403	2118	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Paragraph 3 announces another measured reduction in the pace of asset purchases and states that the Committee continues to judge that there is “sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions.”	21	2
201403	2119	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	The guidance about future purchases, in paragraph 4, is unchanged.	21	2
201403	2120	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	The new forward guidance language in paragraph 5 shifts the focus of the Committee’s decisionmaking from quantitative thresholds to a broader qualitative assessment of “progress—both realized and expected—toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.”	21	2
201403	2121	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	The paragraph continues to indicate that the Committee will assess a “wide range of information” in its policy decisions.	21	2
201403	2122	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	The final sentence states that the current target range for the federal funds rate is likely to be appropriate for “a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.”	21	2
201403	2123	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	While the reference to the end of the purchase program provides an element of calendar dependence, it is also consistent with the state- contingent nature of the forward guidance because decisions about purchases “remain contingent on the Committee’s outlook for the labor market and inflation.”	21	2
201403	2124	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Alternative B then introduces two new paragraphs.	21	2
201403	2125	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Paragraph 6 provides some post-liftoff guidance.	21	2
201403	2126	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	It retains the reference to taking “a balanced approach” to removing accommodation.	21	2
201403	2127	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	It then adds a sentence stating that, “even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping short-term interest rates below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run”—a view that a number of you have expressed, for various reasons.	21	2
201403	2128	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Paragraph 7 is intended to reduce the odds of an undesirable change in financial conditions in response to the new forward guidance by making clear that the new guidance does not indicate a change in the Committee’s policy intentions.	21	2
201403	2129	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	On balance, alternative B seems roughly consistent with market expectations and so should elicit relatively little response in markets.	21	2
201403	2130	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	However, the increase in your federal funds rate projections in the SEP, which will be released along with the statement, may well trigger some rise in rates and perhaps a decline in stock prices.	21	2
201403	2131	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Alternative C, on page 8, may appeal to policymakers who judge that policy normalization should occur more quickly than envisioned in alternative B and that new forward guidance, while appropriate, should avoid making what might be interpreted by some observers as a commitment to keep short-term interest rates low for an extended period.	21	2
201403	2132	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Alternative C begins with a somewhat more upbeat reading of the recent economic news, attributing “much of” the recent softness in the spending data to adverse weather and citing the solid expansion in payroll employment.	21	2
201403	2133	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Paragraph 2 of alternative C expresses more confidence than alternative B that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.	21	2
201403	2134	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Accordingly, paragraph 3 of alternative C announces larger reductions in the pace of asset purchases at this meeting than in alternative B, and paragraph 4 signals the possibility of an earlier end to the program by removing the reference to “measured steps.”	21	2
201403	2135	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Alternative C also incorporates qualitative, state-contingent forward guidance for the federal funds rate.	21	2
201403	2136	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	However, it states that the Committee “now anticipates” that it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range only for “some time” after the asset purchases end.	21	2
201403	2137	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Alternative C doesn’t provide post-liftoff forward guidance.	21	2
201403	2138	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	A decision to reduce the pace of purchases more rapidly, as in alternative C, would surprise many investors and, in combination with dropping “for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends,” would lead them to pull forward the expected timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate and might lead them to steepen the subsequent path.	21	2
201403	2139	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Longer-term interest rates likely would rise, equity prices fall, and the dollar appreciate.	21	2
201403	2140	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Finally, alternative A, on page 4, may appeal to policymakers who are concerned that monetary policy is not sufficiently accommodative to make significant progress toward the Committee’s goals over the medium run and, in particular, want to strengthen the Committee’s commitment to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.	21	2
201403	2141	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Regarding the recent news, paragraph 1 expresses concern that the housing recovery has “slowed further” and that inflation “has continued to run well below”	21	2
201403	2142	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	And, in light of the recent weakness in economic activity, even after accounting for the weather, paragraph 2 indicates that the risks to the outlook are “tilted slightly to the downside.”	21	2
201403	2143	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Given this assessment, paragraph 3 announces a continuation of asset purchases at the current pace.	21	2
201403	2144	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	In its version of revised forward guidance, alternative A retains the statement that the Committee will consider a wide range of information in determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative policy.	21	2
201403	2145	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	It then replaces the earlier threshold language with an inflation floor, stating the Committee’s anticipation that the current target level of the funds rate will be appropriate “at least as long as inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be below 2 percent and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.”	21	2
201403	2146	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Alternative A, like alternative B, describes the Committee’s expectation that it will maintain the current target rate “for a considerable time” after the asset purchase program ends.	21	2
201403	2147	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	A decision to leave the pace of purchases unchanged and introduce an explicit, quantitative inflation floor would surprise investors and would likely lead them to push back the expected timing of liftoff, although the size of that effect would depend on their assessment of the outlook for inflation.	21	2
201403	2148	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Longer-term interest rates would likely decline, and the dollar depreciate; equity prices might rise.	21	2
201403	2149	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Draft directives for these alternatives are presented on pages 11 through 13 of your handout.	21	2
201403	2150	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21	2
201403	2151	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	That completes my prepared remarks.	21	2
201403	2152	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	21	2
201403	2153	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s do questions.	22	2
201403	2154	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	22	2
201403	2155	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	22	2
201403	2156	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Well, I had a question.	22	2
201403	2157	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	I was struck by the dealer survey, in which the dealers seem to have the expectation of liftoff—whatever the right way to say that is—in the second half of 2015.	22	2
201403	2158	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Bill, you mentioned expectations for forward guidance, and that’s to drop or de-emphasize the thresholds.	22	2
201403	2159	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	I guess the imponderable question, if you had any information on this, would be, is this because dealers see 6.7 percent as close enough to the 6½ percent threshold that they came up with this on their own, or is it because the FOMC talk has most recently ceded this expectation, given that we’ve said so many times, “Well, we’re close to this, and so we need to be dealing with that”?	22	2
201403	2160	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	And does the fact that we have a press conference in March have anything to do with this expectation, as opposed to the fact that in April we don’t have one scheduled?	22	2
201403	2161	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	I think that it’s some of both.	22	2
201403	2162	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Market participants have been thinking about this for a while.	22	2
201403	2163	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	If you remember the dealer survey back in January, the dealers were saying they expected changes to the forward guidance.	22	2
201403	2164	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	They didn’t necessarily expect them in January, but they thought they might be coming in March.	22	2
201403	2165	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Here we are in March, and they’re saying, “Yes, we think that’s right,” in part, I think, because there wasn’t really pushback against the thought that there would be a change in March.	22	2
201403	2166	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	So they proceeded with the expectations that they had in January.	22	2
201403	2167	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Simon, do you have any further thoughts?	22	2
201403	2168	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	I think that the expectations in the January survey are not that different than the ones we’ve reported to you today.	22	2
201403	2169	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	That hasn’t changed.	22	2
201403	2170	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	They don’t know the language that you’ll use, and some of the uncertainty is how they might react to those words.	22	2
201403	2171	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	And that’s been—it’s very hard to work out, because you don’t have numbers, you have words.	22	2
201403	2172	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	And how they interpret the words is really hard for us to tell.	22	2
201403	2173	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Very good point.	22	2
201403	2174	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	That’s a good point.	22	2
201403	2175	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m going to ask a leading question.	22	2
201403	2176	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Don’t you think that, as it’s Chair Yellen’s first meeting, people view that as an opportunity to do something more to the statement than if it was just a random meeting?	22	2
201403	2177	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	I think that’s the logic we’ve used ourselves a lot, and, on the margin, they would definitely understand changes that way.	22	2
201403	2178	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	There are lots of other moving parts when it’s the first press conference from a new Chair.	22	2
201403	2179	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	So I’m not sure how to weight those moving parts with the internal logic, which is that it is much easier for us to think of a change at this point.	22	2
201403	2180	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	22	2
201403	2181	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	Governor Powell and President Kocherlakota highlighted the challenge of forward guidance at a time when the SEP is based on a different set of assumptions concerning optimal policy, which may or may not be consistent with the forward guidance.	22	2
201403	2182	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	This is a little bit radical, but I wonder if we should rethink the SEP and not hand out the SEP at this meeting, saying that we are going to revamp the process and think more carefully about how we make forward guidance consistent with what we’re doing for the SEP.	22	2
201403	2183	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	I know that is somewhat dramatic, but I am a little worried that there have been a number of meetings at which the SEP and the forward guidance have been inconsistent.	22	2
201403	2184	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	At some point, we’re going to have to do it.	22	2
201403	2185	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	This is your first meeting.	22	2
201403	2186	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	Saying that we need to revamp it and we’re going to take the time now to do it—judging from the faces, I’m not seeing a whole lot of support, but we should at least think about alternatives.	22	2
201403	2187	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	In effect, you may have to be saying, “I’m disregarding the SEP, and you should focus on the statement.”	22	2
201403	2188	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	That is going to be an awkward conversation, I would think, if the two aren’t congruent.	22	2
201403	2189	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	There’s no expectation of that.	22	2
201403	2190	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	So that would be a big shock, and then everyone would ask the question why—	22	2
201403	2191	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	“How bad was it?”	22	2
201403	2192	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	“..	22	2
201403	2193	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	You could have told us something other than that you didn’t like how the dots looked, so you didn’t want to show them to us,” which might be even worse.	22	2
201403	2194	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Which is pretty much true.	22	2
201403	2195	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	No, that’s even worse, I think, than showing people the dots and trying to explain them, because then they don’t know whether the dots showed 3 percent for the median at the end of 2016.	22	2
201403	2196	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Maybe I’m being a little Pollyanna-ish, but I do think that there is a story behind what’s in the SEP that isn’t so bad.	22	2
201403	2197	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	You have to remind people that we’re looking from December to March, not January to March.	22	2
201403	2198	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	We had a lot of good news from December to January, and we got some not-so-good news from January to March.	22	2
201403	2199	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	But, on balance, you and markets—as this is captured by the dealer survey—see the outlook as a bit better.	22	2
201403	2200	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Our policy is data dependent and should be data dependent, so it’s not wrong that there should be some adjustment to the path of the funds rate, because the outlook is different and is somewhat improved.	22	2
201403	2201	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	The outlook is so marginally different.	22	2
201403	2202	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	Well, and it’s marginally the other way.	22	2
201403	2203	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	GDP for 2015 and 2016 is lower in both, one by three-tenths and one by four-tenths.	22	2
201403	2204	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	Growth—yes.	22	2
201403	2205	2014-03-19	meeting	ENGLISH	But measures of slack, at least as captured by the unemployment rate, are a little tighter.	22	2
201403	2206	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	I think that’s definitely one way that they could take it.	22	2
201403	2207	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	Our experience in June was the other way around.	22	2
201403	2208	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	That’s the issue of what the tendency is, and the tendency might be, a little bit, to read more into the change than is actually there, because we’re at the zero bound.	22	2
201403	2209	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	And there might be some concern that the policy we’ll follow will be a little bit different as things actually do get better.	22	2
201403	2210	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	I think that’s what we saw in June, and you hear that from people in the market just a little bit—that it’s hard to change the forward guidance without sending a slightly hawkish signal, because it’s pretty hard to send a dovish signal from changing the forward guidance in the direction that this is going.	22	2
201403	2211	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	22	2
201403	2212	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes—thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201403	2213	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m going to agree with what Bill English is saying.	22	2
201403	2214	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The question is, how much information do you and the Committee feel is appropriate to reveal?	22	2
201403	2215	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think one thing you could say is that the median can be very sensitive to the behavior of one or two people near the middle of the distribution because it is at the middle.	22	2
201403	2216	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In fact—and this second part is more uncomfortable to reveal, while the first part is obvious—13 of the 16 respondents moved their fed funds rate in 2016 by less than 25 basis points.	22	2
201403	2217	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	By 25 or less, right?	22	2
201403	2218	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	By 25 or less basis points.	22	2
201403	2219	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Revealing that will pretty much say, “Look, the Committee is not moving very much.”	22	2
201403	2220	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And if people feel comfortable with your saying that, I think that will obviate a lot of the concerns.	22	2
201403	2221	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I agree with President Rosengren, by the way, that we should be rethinking the SEP, but I don’t think tonight’s the night.	22	2
201403	2222	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Or you don’t think we’ll finish the task by 2:00 tomorrow afternoon.	22	2
201403	2223	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	How do people feel about my making such a statement in the press conference?	22	2
201403	2224	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	We normally don’t say anything about how individuals have changed their views.	22	2
201403	2225	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it’s okay because you’re characterizing it as a broad group.	22	2
201403	2226	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	But, of course, the downside is, then you’re reinforcing that the SEP has meaning.	22	2
201403	2227	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	So my personal opinion is that there are two messages.	22	2
201403	2228	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	First, don’t overweight the SEP.	22	2
201403	2229	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Pay attention to what the statement is, because the statement is the decision of the Committee.	22	2
201403	2230	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	And second, the SEP overstates the degree of change among the members of the Committee.	22	2
201403	2231	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I think you really want to have both messages.	22	2
201403	2232	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think the way to say that is, actually, this is a great example of how the median of the SEP is misleading because it’s so sensitive to one or two people, and here we have 13 of the 16 not really changing very much.	22	2
201403	2233	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So that could be a way to tell the story that emphasizes both of the messages.	22	2
201403	2234	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	But you might get the question about the person who left.	22	2
201403	2235	2014-03-19	meeting	POTTER	That’s unfortunate in that sense, because that person, I think, was lower than the median.	22	2
201403	2236	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You can’t answer that question.	22	2
201403	2237	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Well, I’m not going to say anything about that person, but I can point out that it’s not the exact same group of people.	22	2
201403	2238	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair?	22	2
201403	2239	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	22	2
201403	2240	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	If it’s any consolation to the group, the mean moved only 24 basis points by my calculation.	22	2
201403	2241	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Can you say that?	22	2
201403	2242	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s better.	22	2
201403	2243	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Now, I’d hate to launch you on a practice of cherry-picking the median and mean from press conference to press conference.	22	2
201403	2244	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	But maybe that’s actually useful.	22	2
201403	2245	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	And, for tomorrow, it’s good.	22	2
201403	2246	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	I’d caution against backing away from the SEP.	22	2
201403	2247	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	It’s well enshrined.	22	2
201403	2248	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	It’s been an institutional practice for a couple of years.	22	2
201403	2249	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Yes, you can complain about what color the dots are and the like and what information isn’t in there, but I think Bill had it right.	22	2
201403	2250	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	The solid way to stand is to say that this is December to March.	22	2
201403	2251	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Things improved and then they didn’t, but this reflects the net reading of various people on the Committee.	22	2
201403	2252	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Almost all of the dots had to move, and, if you assume a similar ordering, all of the dots that didn’t move were at the top.	22	2
201403	2253	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	This is a broad, central move on the bottom end of the curve here, and I’m not sure that putting a fine touch on it—that it’s dependent on one or two people—is going to fly.	22	2
201403	2254	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	I’d prefer to see you rest the case on just the net change in the economic outlook.	22	2
201403	2255	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	And it would be nice to condition markets—and ourselves, I think—to be less paranoid about a tiny hawkish move in our forward guidance or what’s embedded in the SEP.	22	2
201403	2256	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	We’ve been paranoid about that since April 2012, when this came up.	22	2
201403	2257	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	But it did have quite an effect last year.	22	2
201403	2258	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	It sure did.	22	2
201403	2259	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think we can ignore the fact that it did have an effect and that it is in need of remediation of some sort, but I totally agree with everybody else who said we don’t remediate it from tonight until tomorrow afternoon.	22	2
201403	2260	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Yes, I disagree about the remediation, but we can talk about that.	22	2
201403	2261	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman Dudley.	22	2
201403	2262	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the other problem is that the SEP puts too much attention on the modal forecast.	22	2
201403	2263	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	If you actually had people write down their probability distributions and then solve for what the fed funds rate was, who knows what we would come up with?	22	2
201403	2264	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	The other problem with the SEP is, it basically makes people pay too much attention to what the modal forecast is when, in fact, there’s huge uncertainty about what’s going to happen two and a half years out.	22	2
201403	2265	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	So that’s the other problem with it as a device.	22	2
201403	2266	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	I’m wondering if we’d have the same discussion if the outlook had marginally improved but the dots had moved down.	22	2
201403	2267	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	It just seems as though there’s an asymmetry in it, so—	22	2
201403	2268	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I’ve been pretty consistent in saying for some time that I want the SEP back in the repair shop as soon as possible.	22	2
201403	2269	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Agreed.	22	2
201403	2270	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	22	2
201403	2271	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Any further questions for Bill?	22	2
201403	2272	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	22	2
201403	2273	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	2	2
201403	2274	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	So we stand adjourned until tomorrow morning, and dinner is available.	2	2
201403	2275	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	And I have to ask your forgiveness because I am going to skip it, as I am figuratively under the weather.	2	2
201403	2276	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	We will resume at 8:30 tomorrow.	2	2
201403	2277	2014-03-19	meeting		[Meeting recess]	2	2
201403	2278	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	2	2
201403	2279	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’re now ready to go directly into the policy round.	23	2
201403	2280	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	So let me begin with President Rosengren.	23	2
201403	2281	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2282	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B.	23	2
201403	2283	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	The weak incoming data since December certainly justify a continued measured approach to tapering.	23	2
201403	2284	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	There should be a very high hurdle for changing our tapering strategy either up or down.	23	2
201403	2285	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	To date, the incoming data have been weaker than I anticipated in my December SEP.	23	2
201403	2286	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	Adding paragraph 7 to alternative B was an important and useful addition.	23	2
201403	2287	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	It makes clear that the intent of the language changes is simply to reflect the reality that we could well reach our 6½ percent unemployment threshold within a few months, thus requiring an updating of our forward guidance.	23	2
201403	2288	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, it is important to be clear that this is an update in language, not a change in the policy content of the forward guidance from our previous meeting.	23	2
201403	2289	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I would have preferred language that deferred liftoff in short-term rates to when we are within one year of reaching full employment, the language of “a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends” is consistent with my current assessment that liftoff should occur toward the end of 2015.	23	2
201403	2290	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	At that time, I expect we will be approximately one year from my estimate of full employment, and we will still be undershooting our inflation target.	23	2
201403	2291	2014-03-19	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	23	2
201403	2292	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201403	2293	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	23	2
201403	2294	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2295	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	At this meeting, I’m generally supportive of alternative B today.	23	2
201403	2296	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	While I’ve argued for some speedup in the pace of tapering in the past, I want to acknowledge that we’ve not laid the groundwork for that.	23	2
201403	2297	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	With the weather affecting the data, it’s not the right time to initiate such a change unless the forecast begins to change.	23	2
201403	2298	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	But, thinking ahead, I believe we ought to consider what our future options might be if the forecasts play out better than we expect or if the headwinds dissipate faster than, in fact, we anticipate.	23	2
201403	2299	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	And one small correction we can make is to contemplate the idea that, down the road, we change the tapering from $10 billion a meeting to $10 billion a month on a regular schedule and continue to review that at each meeting.	23	2
201403	2300	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	That would allow us to end the program a few months earlier than in the current schedule, but it’s something we might want to keep in mind as a way to tweak the path a little bit should the data suggest we need to do that.	23	2
201403	2301	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	I do think we need to keep in mind that interest rates may need to move up faster than we currently anticipate after purchases end.	23	2
201403	2302	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	The drop in the unemployment rate has been much quicker during the recovery than we had been earlier anticipating, and our language needs to suggest that, even though our current anticipation is that rates will rise very gradually, we are prepared to move them up more quickly, if necessary, to achieve our longer-term goals.	23	2
201403	2303	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	In part, this leads me to favor the suggestion on the language in paragraph 5 in which we insert “current” before “assessment”	23	2
201403	2304	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	And that would necessitate changing—to be a little more precise, in paragraph 5, in which we say, “The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its current assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends.”	23	2
201403	2305	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	So inserting the word “current” before “target range” adds the notion that somehow this is not set in stone, and that this, in fact, can and perhaps will change.	23	2
201403	2306	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	So I’m in favor of that.	23	2
201403	2307	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Again, it emphasizes that the path is not immutable in some sense.	23	2
201403	2308	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	I was gratified with the suggested statement language in alternative B that took what I consider to be a more minimalist approach and excluded numerical thresholds, floors, and triggers.	23	2
201403	2309	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	I also like that we indicate we’re going to “assess progress ... toward” meeting our objectives.	23	2
201403	2310	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	This begins to give a sense of a policy reaction function and that the policy rate will and should change as we get closer to meeting our goals.	23	2
201403	2311	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	However, our communications strategy, I really believe, is a journey.	23	2
201403	2312	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	It’s not a one-time thing.	23	2
201403	2313	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	And we will need to adapt our communications as we go forward.	23	2
201403	2314	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	As I alluded to yesterday, as we get closer to our goals, being more articulate and careful about our reaction function is going to become more important.	23	2
201403	2315	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	As I mentioned yesterday in reference to President Williams’s remarks, as we get closer, being able to refine our reaction function and give more information about it should be important, and we should continue to try to do that.	23	2
201403	2316	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Regarding the other revised language that came out on Monday afternoon, I like the simplification of paragraph 7.	23	2
201403	2317	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	I find that a better way to say what we intended.	23	2
201403	2318	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	I find the first sentence much less confusing than it was as originally written, so I like paragraph 7.	23	2
201403	2319	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	I would prefer one other simplification in the language of alternative B.	23	2
201403	2320	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	In particular, I think we should consider dropping the second sentence of paragraph 6, in red.	23	2
201403	2321	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	This sentence says that we anticipate keeping short-term rates lower than their normal long-run levels, even after our inflation and employment goals are met.	23	2
201403	2322	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	The concern that we’ve not really fully discussed among ourselves is, what are the reasons that we anticipate this?	23	2
201403	2323	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	I think people have different rationales for that, all of them worth considering.	23	2
201403	2324	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	And is this because we expect lower- than-normal equilibrium real rates in the long run?	23	2
201403	2325	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	That could be, except the SEP doesn’t show that we’ve lowered our long-run neutral rate very much.	23	2
201403	2326	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	It’s still very high.	23	2
201403	2327	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	So perhaps those stories need to be reconciled.	23	2
201403	2328	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Are there headwinds?	23	2
201403	2329	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	If so, what are those headwinds, and how will we determine whether they have dissipated or not?	23	2
201403	2330	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Why aren’t those headwinds showing up in the gaps?	23	2
201403	2331	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Or are we simply relying on some estimates of future shocks that we haven’t identified that are leading to this particular outcome?	23	2
201403	2332	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	I think there are lots of different stories one can put together about why we believe as a Committee that this is the appropriate path.	23	2
201403	2333	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	But I suspect that different participants have different views on these things, and I worry about elevating a feature of the SEP into our statement language.	23	2
201403	2334	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	We haven’t done that in the past, and the SEP has shown this phenomenon for some time.	23	2
201403	2335	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	We’ve talked a little bit about it.	23	2
201403	2336	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	But I think we have to be very careful about elevating features of the SEP into our statement.	23	2
201403	2337	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	I don’t mind if Chair Yellen says some of these things in the press conference.	23	2
201403	2338	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	I worry about putting them, in fact, in the statement.	23	2
201403	2339	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	I worry that what we’re doing is misinterpreting the SEP.	23	2
201403	2340	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	We’re slipping into a mode in which we are wanting to use the SEP as somehow a consensus forecast, and it isn’t.	23	2
201403	2341	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	It’s not a consensus forecast.	23	2
201403	2342	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	It’s something completely different.	23	2
201403	2343	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	And I worry that tripping over ourselves to act or talk as if it’s a consensus forecast is perhaps a dangerous place to go, because we may find ourselves subsequently in an awkward position trying to match these two things.	23	2
201403	2344	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	So I think we just have to be very careful about where we go here and that we don’t find ourselves in a spot that we may regret later.	23	2
201403	2345	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Once we’ve had further discussions and there is some consensus on the mechanism that we think is driving this lower path, that’s fine—then we do it.	23	2
201403	2346	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	But I don’t think we ought to feel as though we have to do it until we have those kinds of agreements.	23	2
201403	2347	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	My final comment on language is also with regard to paragraph 6.	23	2
201403	2348	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	If we include the second sentence of paragraph 6, as most people seem to want to do, I would strongly urge us not to use the language referring to “keeping short-term interest rates below.”	23	2
201403	2349	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	I see no reason to say “short-term interest rates.”	23	2
201403	2350	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	I think we should say that we should set our targeted federal funds rate below the neutral rate.	23	2
201403	2351	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	That’s our instrument.	23	2
201403	2352	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	We don’t control all short-term interest rates.	23	2
201403	2353	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	I don’t think we want to convey that, so that’s one reason not to do that.	23	2
201403	2354	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	The second reason not to do that is, some market participants might be inclined to interpret that statement as foreshadowing something about operating procedures down the road.	23	2
201403	2355	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	I don’t think we want to risk doing that.	23	2
201403	2356	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	We haven’t made that decision.	23	2
201403	2357	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	I don’t think we want to be taking the risk of sending that signal and having markets interpret it that way.	23	2
201403	2358	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	We’re referring to the federal funds rate as our instrument, so that’s what we ought to say.	23	2
201403	2359	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	The language should read “The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate- consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the targeted federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.”	23	2
201403	2360	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	So I think it ought to be “the targeted federal funds rate,” not “short-term interest rates.”	23	2
201403	2361	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Those are my comments, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2362	2014-03-19	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you.	23	2
201403	2363	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201403	2364	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23	2
201403	2365	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2366	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	I support the substance of alternative B, so let me just move to offer some thoughts on how to change the forward guidance, starting with paragraph 5.	23	2
201403	2367	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	In my thinking, the tests of changes should be that the new language preserves accommodation at the present level and avoids inadvertent tightening, goes as far as possible to achieve alignment of the FOMC and public expectations, and establishes a durable qualitative framework under the baseline scenario for evolving guidance as needed.	23	2
201403	2368	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	In paragraph 4, I’d support keeping the current “measured steps” and “not on a preset course” verbiage.	23	2
201403	2369	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	I can foresee holding to this language for another couple of meetings, but, at some point in the year, I think it will have to be adjusted.	23	2
201403	2370	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	I also support the transition in today’s statement to reliance on the phrase “wide range of information” in paragraph 5.	23	2
201403	2371	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	Likewise, I would keep the “considerable time after the asset purchase program ends” guidance.	23	2
201403	2372	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	I do suggest, however, that the Committee think about the question of how it wants the words “considerable time” interpreted—that is to say, to map to a specific time frame in the understanding of the public and markets.	23	2
201403	2373	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	Today, based on various communications about the course of tapering and the liftoff projections inferred from the SEP, in my view, expectations are grounded in an interpretation of “considerable time” as meaning six months.	23	2
201403	2374	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	If we want “considerable time” to be more flexible, then this may have to be communicated in some way.	23	2
201403	2375	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding the guidance on the post-liftoff path of policy in paragraph 6, like President Plosser, I have some reservations—not the same reservations—about the inclusion of the last sentence in today’s statement.	23	2
201403	2376	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	I think we could hold this piece of guidance in reserve to use if and when the Committee decides that conditions require augmenting or adjusting accommodation.	23	2
201403	2377	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	The language has stimulus value, and I’m not sure it’s required at this time.	23	2
201403	2378	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m also concerned that introducing at this time the subject of the post-liftoff path of the policy rate might encourage an interpretation that our intent is to be less accommodative.	23	2
201403	2379	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	I would simply append the first sentence of paragraph 6 to the end of paragraph 5 and drop the second sentence.	23	2
201403	2380	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	Beyond today’s statement, I believe that the Committee would be well advised to think ahead a few meetings and envision how guidance might evolve.	23	2
201403	2381	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	So let me offer these thoughts.	23	2
201403	2382	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	As I’ve already commented, I can see the Committee changing the “measured steps” and “not on a preset course” guidance to something more concrete and predictive in the July or September meeting.	23	2
201403	2383	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	By that time, assuming the economy is conforming to the basic outlook, the Committee should be able to either accelerate the end of purchases or say something to the effect that the asset purchase program will end in October, November, or December, and will be wound down in steps of $10 billion.	23	2
201403	2384	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding the “considerable time” guidance, it will be appropriate to drop the reference to “after the asset purchase program ends” once it’s ended.	23	2
201403	2385	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	At that time, the “considerable time” language could be retained as straightforward qualitative guidance about rate policy.	23	2
201403	2386	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m satisfied that today’s alternative B, paragraph 5, language is a sufficiently durable framework within which to make necessary adjustments as time passes.	23	2
201403	2387	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	That is to say, I’m satisfied that the new language does not introduce new elements that might turn out to be awkward or troublesome in future months.	23	2
201403	2388	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding paragraph 7, I was okay with the earlier version, and I support the revised version.	23	2
201403	2389	2014-03-19	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2390	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201403	2391	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23	2
201403	2392	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2393	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	I strongly support alternative B.	23	2
201403	2394	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Data since our last meeting indicate an ongoing gradual recovery and continuing below-target inflation, and this situation calls for maintaining the path for monetary policy that we’ve laid out.	23	2
201403	2395	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I support a further measured reduction in the pace of asset purchases, along with forward guidance that signals a highly accommodative future path for the funds rate.	23	2
201403	2396	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Alternative B provides this continuity in policy, while successfully navigating the transition from quantitative to qualitative guidance.	23	2
201403	2397	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Importantly, the new qualitative language in paragraph 5 is completely consistent with our past statements about forward guidance.	23	2
201403	2398	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	In addition, the wording is robust enough that it can be used for quite some time, under the likely evolution of the economy.	23	2
201403	2399	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Paragraph 6 then provides further clarity about our post-liftoff funds rate expectations.	23	2
201403	2400	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	I see it as consistent with the views expressed by the Committee, and, importantly, it does not commit us prematurely to a particular path or tie us to a specific rationale.	23	2
201403	2401	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	It also makes clear that this is our current assessment, which might change over time.	23	2
201403	2402	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Paragraph 7 guards against the risk that markets may misinterpret the new statement.	23	2
201403	2403	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Any time we modify language, markets have to infer whether we’re signaling a change in policy or simply responding to events.	23	2
201403	2404	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Paragraph 7 takes that inference problem “off the table” by being explicit about continuity in our policy.	23	2
201403	2405	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of the bracketed language in paragraph 5, in my view, it’s not necessary to be explicit that it’s our “current” assessment.	23	2
201403	2406	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that goes without saying.	23	2
201403	2407	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I’d omit that word, and then, in the second bracketed choice, we can continue to refer to the “current” target range.	23	2
201403	2408	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I view this as really an editorial distinction, and I’m actually fine with either way.	23	2
201403	2409	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of President Plosser’s comment about the targeted federal funds rate in paragraph 6, I actually hadn’t thought about that carefully before, and I think it’s a good point that, instead of saying “keeping short-term interest rates,” we should say “keeping the targeted federal funds rate.”	23	2
201403	2410	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I recognize that we are going to have a robust and, no doubt, thorough and comprehensive discussion on this issue of what our future policy framework should be.	23	2
201403	2411	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, at this time, we haven’t had that discussion, and we’ve not expressed to the public what our framework will be.	23	2
201403	2412	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that switching to “short-term interest rates” could be a little confusing at this time.	23	2
201403	2413	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	If we do decide to go to a framework of not using the federal funds rate as our instrument, then, of course, we can change this language to say “short-term interest rates.”	23	2
201403	2414	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t think that would be confusing.	23	2
201403	2415	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	I actually think that there is a potential here for the question “What does this mean?” when, really, what we’re trying to do is to calm down uncertainty at this point.	23	2
201403	2416	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23	2
201403	2417	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201403	2418	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23	2
201403	2419	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2420	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	I support the $10 billion taper today.	23	2
201403	2421	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	We said it’s a high hurdle for altering that path, and I’m fine with that.	23	2
201403	2422	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	My preference today is to retain our January forward guidance with thresholds in paragraph 5 and maintain this policy language until the unemployment rate falls to 6½ percent or inflation rises to 2½ percent.	23	2
201403	2423	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	This statement language remains fully serviceable even if unemployment falls quickly, owing to our additional guidance that the funds rate will remain at zero well past the time that unemployment falls below 6½ percent.	23	2
201403	2424	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Since there appears to be perhaps a 50 percent probability that unemployment will remain above 6½ percent at the time of our June meeting, changing this language today as in alternative B prematurely risks an adverse market interpretation, in my opinion.	23	2
201403	2425	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	My biggest concern today is that alternative B, along with the SEP release, looks like a tightening in our monetary policy stance.	23	2
201403	2426	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	This round’s SEP median federal funds rate dot in 2016 is 50 basis points higher than in December.	23	2
201403	2427	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	From yesterday’s discussion, I accept that the dealers and financial markets are prepared for a change in our forward guidance, but I think the current alternative B language is not enough guidance to validate the dealer survey expectations.	23	2
201403	2428	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	The dealer survey implies that markets have priced in a very strong degree of financial accommodation.	23	2
201403	2429	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	For example, the dealers envision a funds rate liftoff in the second half of 2015.	23	2
201403	2430	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	They also expect the funds rate liftoff to occur four quarters after the end of QE3 purchases.	23	2
201403	2431	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	The survey also suggests that the more likely values of the unemployment rate at liftoff are below 6 percent.	23	2
201403	2432	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	These observations seem important to me.	23	2
201403	2433	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	If our statement is as vague as alternative B and financial markets see the higher funds rate projections in the SEP, they may price in tighter financial conditions.	23	2
201403	2434	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Turning to more-specific elements of alternative B, the qualitative language in the second sentence of paragraph 5 is about as weak as one could formulate for forward guidance.	23	2
201403	2435	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	It repeats that our goals are to support maximum employment and a 2 percent inflation objective, the third sentence says that we will assess a range of labor and inflation data, and that’s pretty much it.	23	2
201403	2436	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Frankly, this formulation is very much like our June 2011 language before we embarked on stronger forward guidance.	23	2
201403	2437	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Maybe that’s the choice.	23	2
201403	2438	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Yes, I can believe that markets are expecting us to change our forward guidance today, but I worry a lot that this guidance is too weak to maintain their expectations, especially given the SEP medians that we’re going to release.	23	2
201403	2439	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	One way to strengthen the forward guidance would be to include the 2 percent inflation floor from alternative A.	23	2
201403	2440	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	In my opinion, this addition would move further toward maintaining our prior stance of accommodation, albeit with a slightly different emphasis on inflation.	23	2
201403	2441	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	In adopting this particular inflation floor following a long period of below-target inflation, the Committee would strongly advance the defense of our inflation objective from below.	23	2
201403	2442	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	This would help remind the public that we have symmetrical preferences for inflation over the long run.	23	2
201403	2443	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	In terms of post-liftoff guidance, I think paragraph 6 helps because it instills a further expectation that any premature policy tightening will most likely proceed only slowly.	23	2
201403	2444	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Without this paragraph, the risk of a tightening inference by the markets is higher.	23	2
201403	2445	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	But I also think the earlier, fuller Tealbook version of paragraph 7 would have helped a lot.	23	2
201403	2446	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	I realize that many participants feel that our statement is long and unwieldy, and, sure, making efforts to streamline the policy description sounds like a good idea if you retain the most important elements.	23	2
201403	2447	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	But, look, once you’re involved in dressing a pig [laughter], no amount of lipstick is going to change the fact that this is a pig we are working with.	23	2
201403	2448	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	The statement is long and ugly, and it will always, almost surely, be that way.	23	2
201403	2449	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	To maintain the link with our prior policy intentions, it seems to me that the important part of paragraph 7 was repeating explicitly our prior commitment that the funds rate would remain at zero well past the time that the unemployment rate goes below 6½ percent.	23	2
201403	2450	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	This would have been separate from our linkage with the end of asset purchases later this fall.	23	2
201403	2451	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	That additional commentary would prove useful if labor market improvement stalls over the next six months.	23	2
201403	2452	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	A labor market stall, combined with a continuation of 1 percent inflation rates, worries me, and hoping that that doesn’t happen involves accepting more risk.	23	2
201403	2453	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	This meeting is one of those opportunities to meaningfully reinforce that we are pursuing goal-oriented monetary policy to reattain both maximum employment and price stability within a reasonably short period of time.	23	2
201403	2454	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Madam Chair, as I said at the outset, my preference today is to simply update our January statement for economic developments and the additional $10 billion reduction beginning in April.	23	2
201403	2455	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	In order to strengthen alternative B enough to reduce the risk of an inadvertent policy tightening, two changes could help.	23	2
201403	2456	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	One change is to adopt the 2 percent inflation floor from alternative A.	23	2
201403	2457	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	This choice would show that we’re defending our inflation objective from below.	23	2
201403	2458	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	The other change is to revert to the original Tealbook alternative B language for the fuller version of paragraph 7.	23	2
201403	2459	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	This choice would include a reference to keeping the funds rate at zero well past the time that unemployment falls below 6½ percent.	23	2
201403	2460	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	In addition, regarding the commentary about the “short-term interest rates” language in paragraph 6, I agree with the suggestion that mentioning the funds rate instead would be better.	23	2
201403	2461	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	After all, that’s what the Committee’s assessment is referring to in the SEP—the funds rate.	23	2
201403	2462	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2463	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201403	2464	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23	2
201403	2465	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2466	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	I support alternative B, although the SEP results do give me some pause, as they did President Evans.	23	2
201403	2467	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	I had thought that, with a set of SEP results that didn’t vary much from last time or from market expectations, the somewhat general language in alternative B would be fine.	23	2
201403	2468	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	And I, on balance, think that’s probably still where we should land.	23	2
201403	2469	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	But there are going to be more difficulties.	23	2
201403	2470	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	To a considerable extent, this is going to fall on the Chair to make the explanations on paragraph 5 and, to some degree, on paragraph 7.	23	2
201403	2471	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	It may be that an explanation or elaboration of paragraph 7 can reinforce the point President Evans made that, at this juncture at least, the guidance we’ve had to date is still operative because we haven’t passed the threshold.	23	2
201403	2472	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	I want to spend most of my comments on paragraph 6, however.	23	2
201403	2473	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	I actually think a case can be made to strengthen paragraph 6.	23	2
201403	2474	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	But, more important, it’s critical that something along the lines of paragraph 6 be included in this statement.	23	2
201403	2475	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	For one thing, without such a provision, we will have identified the factors that will determine when the rate will start to rise, and we’ll have noted some expectations as to how steeply it may rise, but we won’t have identified what we expect the endpoint of that process to be.	23	2
201403	2476	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Now, one might have said that such a specification would be unnecessary if the shared assumption is that our equilibrium interest rate will be the same as it was supposed to be before the crisis—say, 2 percent above the inflation target, for a total of 4 percent.	23	2
201403	2477	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	But such an assumption would be inconsistent with our own stated expectations.	23	2
201403	2478	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Imperfect as it is, the SEP does communicate something about our individual and aggregated expectations.	23	2
201403	2479	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	We’ve just been talking about the difficulties the current results may create.	23	2
201403	2480	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	The results presented yesterday show that the central tendency of the Committee’s projections has the economy at or close to both full employment and 2 percent inflation by 2016.	23	2
201403	2481	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	And yet, with a couple of exceptions, everyone on the Committee expects the federal funds rate to be below 4 percent and, in most cases, well below 4 percent.	23	2
201403	2482	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	So that’s something that needs to be explained to markets and to the public.	23	2
201403	2483	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	The explanation has got to be that, individually and in the aggregate, we think there are various reasons why the equilibrium rate in 2016, and for at least some period thereafter, will be lower than 4 percent.	23	2
201403	2484	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	There are lots of reasons, as people have already mentioned, why one might believe this to be the case.	23	2
201403	2485	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Some, such as incomplete repair of household balance sheets or the effects of fiscal consolidation, can be understood as shocks, or as the lingering consequences of shocks, that will have a restraining effect on growth for a nontrivial but finite time.	23	2
201403	2486	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	In the parlance we’ve been using, these are headwinds.	23	2
201403	2487	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Other factors—such as demographic change, slowing technological innovation that translates into lower productivity gains, or durable changes in preferences manifested in behavior such as saving rates—are more permanent in nature, though, for that reason, observation of these phenomena would presumably need to continue long enough to convincingly make the case.	23	2
201403	2488	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	There’s another explanation, though, which I think falls somewhere between the persistent but ultimately fading character of headwinds and the enduring character of demographics.	23	2
201403	2489	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	That’s reduction in growth potential.	23	2
201403	2490	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Most, if not all, of us have, over the past several years, marked down potential GDP growth.	23	2
201403	2491	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	The Tealbook has, on several occasions, explained why the staff has done so as well.	23	2
201403	2492	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	In some sense, of course, this explanation can draw on several other possible explanations, both secular changes and persistent but ultimately finite factors, but it does capture an important set of expectations on our part.	23	2
201403	2493	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	And I’d note that these expectations are also reflected in various survey data and spreads that we see in markets.	23	2
201403	2494	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Precisely because there seems to be such convergence around this general proposition, even if we differ as to how much potential has decreased, I do think a pretty strong case can be made for the proposition that we don’t need to make the language in paragraph 6 as conditional as it now reads.	23	2
201403	2495	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Indeed, a case could be made that the levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run are themselves lower than assumed on the basis of pre-crisis experience.	23	2
201403	2496	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	I do note in the SEP that six of us have already indicated that we believe the longer-term rate to be below 4 percent, and I suspect at least a few others on the Committee might come to that conclusion as well.	23	2
201403	2497	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	To be clear, I’m not arguing for such a change in the language in paragraph 6, at least not right now.	23	2
201403	2498	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	We would obviously need to analyze and discuss this issue much more before making such a change.	23	2
201403	2499	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	But I mention the case for it mostly to show that the position reflected in the proposed language is actually a good deal softer than the position that might be derived from the Committee’s own projections and stated assessments of growth potential.	23	2
201403	2500	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t disagree with those who have observed that the current language states the proposition without explaining why—President Plosser made this point today, and I think President Fisher made it in the teleconference meeting.	23	2
201403	2501	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	I’ve just explained why I think we could give such an explanation based on what Committee members currently believe.	23	2
201403	2502	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	But my more immediate response is that omission of any particular reason allows a certain optionality for the Committee.	23	2
201403	2503	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	If you think headwinds alone justify such guidance, your position is preserved, even though someone else may feel that the reasons are likely to have greater permanence.	23	2
201403	2504	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	While this may not be ideal, it would be far worse to leave markets and the public with no indication that the Committee has even recognized the issue and with no sense of where the upward trajectory of the federal funds rate would end.	23	2
201403	2505	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	I will end by saying I agree with others that Charlie Plosser makes a good point about the federal funds rate as opposed to short-term interest rates.	23	2
201403	2506	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2507	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201403	2508	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Pianalto.	23	2
201403	2509	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2510	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	With the economy continuing to recover and the outlook little changed since the January meeting, I believe it’s clearly appropriate to continue to slow the pace of asset purchases as laid out in alternative B.	23	2
201403	2511	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	That’s the easy part of today’s decision.	23	2
201403	2512	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	Changing our forward guidance on the fed funds rate is the more challenging issue.	23	2
201403	2513	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	We face a tradeoff between maximizing clarity and maintaining flexibility in our guidance.	23	2
201403	2514	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	I preferred providing more, rather than less, clarity in our guidance.	23	2
201403	2515	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	In particular, as I mentioned in the videoconference, I preferred forward guidance that uses an inflation floor, for three reasons.	23	2
201403	2516	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	First, inflation forecasts can capture many of the factors that are likely to determine liftoff but which are hard to spell out simply in forward guidance.	23	2
201403	2517	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	Second, an inflation floor would refer to the component of our dual mandate for which we have a quantitative goal.	23	2
201403	2518	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	And, third, as liftoff draws nearer, the Committee will probably need to provide the public with further clarifications of its intentions in order to manage interest rate expectations.	23	2
201403	2519	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	All of that being said, I recognize that a majority of the Committee does not support including forward guidance with an inflation floor.	23	2
201403	2520	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	Many on the Committee place a premium on maintaining flexibility about which conditions will warrant liftoff of the fed funds rate and when.	23	2
201403	2521	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	I appreciate that flexibility does have its benefits, and I have argued for flexibility in other situations.	23	2
201403	2522	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	The more qualitative forward guidance that’s laid out in the current alternative B has evolved and has improved considerably since the first draft that we looked at.	23	2
201403	2523	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	So today I do support alternative B.	23	2
201403	2524	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	Like President Plosser and others who have already commented, I do have a strong preference for referring to the federal funds rate in paragraph 6 rather than short-term interest rates.	23	2
201403	2525	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	At this point, it isn’t clear what the future operating framework will be, and referring to short-term interest rates could create confusion among the public and distract from the main message of the statement today.	23	2
201403	2526	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	And, obviously, the SEP also provides projections for the federal funds rate rather than other short-term interest rates.	23	2
201403	2527	2014-03-19	meeting	PIANALTO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2528	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201403	2529	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23	2
201403	2530	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2531	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	I support alternative B, but I do see an opportunity for improvement.	23	2
201403	2532	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	First, I like the less heavy-handed version of paragraph 7.	23	2
201403	2533	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	I think that, combined with paragraph 5, it does a good job of cementing the notion of continuity in the forward guidance that we’re intending to provide.	23	2
201403	2534	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	I join Presidents Plosser and Lockhart, though, with serious concerns about the second sentence in paragraph 6.	23	2
201403	2535	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	There are two main reasons.	23	2
201403	2536	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	First—and I don’t think it’s been mentioned—this would muddy our message today.	23	2
201403	2537	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	This is a new element of forward guidance.	23	2
201403	2538	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Taken by itself, I think it would be viewed as a downward nudge to the yield curve.	23	2
201403	2539	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	But we’ve strived in paragraphs 5 and 7 to emphasize continuity and that we don’t believe we’re changing this net stance of our forward guidance at this meeting.	23	2
201403	2540	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	So I’m concerned about how readers are going to interpret this.	23	2
201403	2541	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Does paragraph 6 convey new information or not?	23	2
201403	2542	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Why did we add it now when, in the next paragraph, we’re emphasizing that our forward guidance is the same?	23	2
201403	2543	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Second, more broadly, I think it’s ambiguous and treads on ground that the Committee has yet to really thoroughly survey and understand.	23	2
201403	2544	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	What time period does this refer to?	23	2
201403	2545	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	You look at the language that says “mandate-consistent levels.”	23	2
201403	2546	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	You look at the SEP for 2016, and it looks as though it lines up near there.	23	2
201403	2547	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	But, on the other hand, paragraph 6 seems to refer to something beyond 2016 as well.	23	2
201403	2548	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	It says “even after” we get to near mandate-consistent levels.	23	2
201403	2549	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	I’d point out that, of course, we haven’t said what mandate-consistent levels are for 2016.	23	2
201403	2550	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	We have the longer-run projections.	23	2
201403	2551	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	We haven’t defined that as congruent with “mandate consistent.”	23	2
201403	2552	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	We never said that.	23	2
201403	2553	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	The January 2012 statement explicitly avoids equating the longer-run values with mandate-consistent levels.	23	2
201403	2554	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	So we’re muddying up that nuance there.	23	2
201403	2555	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Now, I know there’s been discussion, to which Governor Tarullo has alluded, about the possibility that the appropriate intercept term in a Taylor rule—and some people refer to it as the equilibrium real rate—might have fallen.	23	2
201403	2556	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	But it was just a stray comment or two at the last meeting, and I’m not sure we’ve really digested the possibility that that’s going to be the case.	23	2
201403	2557	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Besides, a whole lot of us still have the funds rate in the longer run at 4 percent.	23	2
201403	2558	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	So I don’t think we know enough now, on a sustained basis, about what the trajectory after 2016 is going to look like.	23	2
201403	2559	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	I just don’t think we’ve done our homework to be able to put in something of this specificity about the path after the liftoff.	23	2
201403	2560	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	For those two reasons, the statement would be much better without the second sentence in paragraph 6.	23	2
201403	2561	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	And I share President Plosser’s concern about “short-term interest rates.”	23	2
201403	2562	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	I think this would be new to speak about our keeping short-term interest rates, as opposed to the funds rate, at any particular level.	23	2
201403	2563	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	But, otherwise, I support alternative B.	23	2
201403	2564	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	23	2
201403	2565	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201403	2566	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23	2
201403	2567	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2568	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Basically, I think we’re in good shape for today.	23	2
201403	2569	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	We’re changing the form but not the substance of our forward guidance.	23	2
201403	2570	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	This is an appropriate time to be introducing such a change.	23	2
201403	2571	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	It’s widely anticipated in financial markets and elsewhere because we’re approaching the 6½ percent threshold.	23	2
201403	2572	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	This is making that kind of a number largely irrelevant for monetary policy considerations for the future.	23	2
201403	2573	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Any change, I think, that we make carries potential risk in terms of market reaction, but, on the other hand, any market reaction will likely wash out after a few days because the fundamental policy is not really being altered at this meeting.	23	2
201403	2574	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	So I support alternative B for today.	23	2
201403	2575	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I have two remarks on alternative B and then some reactions to some of the previous comments ahead of me here today.	23	2
201403	2576	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	The first comment is on the wisdom of paragraph 7, and the second comment is on the wisdom of putting too much time dependence into the statement and into the Committee’s thinking.	23	2
201403	2577	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Concerning paragraph 7, this paragraph is meant to reassure markets that nothing has changed in terms of the level of policy accommodation.	23	2
201403	2578	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	In general, I think it’s not good practice to include paragraphs in the statement that purport to explain the meaning of changes elsewhere in the statement.	23	2
201403	2579	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	In effect, we’re footnoting the statement.	23	2
201403	2580	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	One could imagine footnoting other parts of the statement that contain changes.	23	2
201403	2581	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	You could footnote the strength of housing, which is changed in paragraph 1, for example, and you might cite some of the more recent data on housing and indicate why we changed that part of the statement—because the data are a little bit different from what they were.	23	2
201403	2582	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	We might also say in that footnote that this doesn’t necessarily mean that the Committee had changed its policy because we changed slightly our view of the most recent housing data.	23	2
201403	2583	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	This kind of tactic strikes me as self-referential, and it seems circular and somewhat counterproductive to me.	23	2
201403	2584	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Having said all of that, I understand what we’re trying to do here, and I may be persuaded that, just for today, given the somewhat special circumstances—it being the Chair’s first meeting and press conference—it may strengthen our hand.	23	2
201403	2585	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	But I think the more appropriate approach would be just to omit paragraph 7 and use the press conference to communicate more fully the meaning of the statement.	23	2
201403	2586	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	That’s how this is set up, and, for other changes in the statement, we wouldn’t include a special provision at the end to say something about the meaning of it.	23	2
201403	2587	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	All right.	23	2
201403	2588	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Let me turn to time dependence.	23	2
201403	2589	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I’m going to refer here to the “considerable time” phrase in paragraph 5 of alternative B, which is meant to convey a waiting period between the end of the asset purchase program and the date of liftoff.	23	2
201403	2590	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I understand that, in principle, this is a state-contingent object, but I do not think that it conveys sufficient state dependence as written.	23	2
201403	2591	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	For most market participants and maybe most FOMC participants around this table, it means a fixed amount of time without too much regard for what happens in the economy.	23	2
201403	2592	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	In many cases, as President Lockhart noted, it might mean six months.	23	2
201403	2593	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I do not think we can change this today, but I do think the Committee should continually strive to express itself in state-contingent terms.	23	2
201403	2594	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	One of the main dangers of calendar-based thinking is that, when the calendar says that it is time to make a move, the economy may be saying something else, and this Committee has, in several circumstances, run into exactly that kind of problem.	23	2
201403	2595	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	We had a calendar date circled in our minds.	23	2
201403	2596	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	We got to that date, and the circumstances weren’t right.	23	2
201403	2597	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	And that creates a mismatch between what policy should be doing and what it’s actually doing.	23	2
201403	2598	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	The SEP contributes to this problem, especially with the date of liftoff in 2014, 2015, and 2016, a date that receives a laser-like focus in financial markets.	23	2
201403	2599	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I agree completely with Vice Chairman Dudley’s comments yesterday that this needs a revamp.	23	2
201403	2600	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	We have looked at it before.	23	2
201403	2601	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	It’s a difficult issue.	23	2
201403	2602	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I understand that.	23	2
201403	2603	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I do think that there may be a very simple change that we could make in the near term.	23	2
201403	2604	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	As we’re getting closer to the date of liftoff, it might pay to make the SEP more granular with respect to the date of liftoff.	23	2
201403	2605	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	You could have a special question in the SEP that would ask not just “What year are you anticipating liftoff?” but also “What quarter are you anticipating the date of liftoff?”	23	2
201403	2606	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	And you could plot that separately.	23	2
201403	2607	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	It makes a big difference.	23	2
201403	2608	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I was the one who changed from 2014 to 2015, but it was really 2014, fourth quarter, to 2015, first quarter.	23	2
201403	2609	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	So I moved over a bin in the picture, and, the way this gets reported, somebody will say something about that.	23	2
201403	2610	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	But it might be more informative as we get closer if we start talking about the quarter of liftoff currently expected based on the data.	23	2
201403	2611	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	That would be a very simple change.	23	2
201403	2612	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	It might convey a little bit more.	23	2
201403	2613	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Longer term, I do think we need a more substantial revamp of the SEP.	23	2
201403	2614	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I would urge all of you to consider a renewed attempt at a monetary policy report.	23	2
201403	2615	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I know we tried to do that earlier.	23	2
201403	2616	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	It didn’t work out, but I think that maybe the perspective has changed.	23	2
201403	2617	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	We’re a little bit closer to normal policy now, and it might be the time to, again, renew that issue.	23	2
201403	2618	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I know we had thoughts about that at previous meetings, and we probably have plans on the table, but, eventually, I think the future of this Committee is that we’re going to have to have a monetary policy report that summarizes, in some way, the view of the Committee so that markets can absorb what we’re thinking as a group.	23	2
201403	2619	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Concerning the 2016 SEP policy rate, which has moved up somewhat, I guess I’m convinced that what we should do on that is just cite lower unemployment.	23	2
201403	2620	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Unemployment has moved down considerably from where it was at the time of the December meeting.	23	2
201403	2621	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	So, logically, that’s going to cause a few people to adjust slightly the setting they think we’re going to have for the policy rate in 2016.	23	2
201403	2622	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I think that’s the simplest and cleanest thing to say.	23	2
201403	2623	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	We don’t have to talk about changing membership or other things like that.	23	2
201403	2624	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	It’s true that the growth forecast is actually going in the wrong direction.	23	2
201403	2625	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	So I would just cite labor markets and say that that looks better than it did, and that it probably caused some people to move up slightly.	23	2
201403	2626	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I’m going to react to a few things people have said.	23	2
201403	2627	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	In paragraph 6, the second sentence—“keeping ... rates below”—I agree with President Plosser that the story behind this is not clear.	23	2
201403	2628	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	As I have described it here before, there are, in my mind, three explanations for the low policy rate in 2016, which, again, is occurring after output gaps have closed and after inflation has returned to target.	23	2
201403	2629	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	These three explanations, which were touched on by Governor Tarullo here, are as follows:  First, there’s the headwinds explanation, which, in my mind, means that there are some unspecified shocks that are going to hit the economy at this distant date in the future.	23	2
201403	2630	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I think that’s a difficult story to tell.	23	2
201403	2631	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	How could we, sitting here today, know what these shocks are going to be?	23	2
201403	2632	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I also think it sends a pessimistic signal about our view of the future of the US economy, and it’s an unwarranted pessimistic signal.	23	2
201403	2633	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	We don’t really know what the world is going to be like in 2016.	23	2
201403	2634	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	So the headwinds explanation is one possible explanation.	23	2
201403	2635	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	The second is the Woodford explanation, which I see has become less and less popular here.	23	2
201403	2636	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	The Woodford explanation would be that we’re keeping rates low at that point because we’re making up for the time when we were constrained by the zero bound.	23	2
201403	2637	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	The Woodford story, even though it’s become less popular here, has a great aspect to it, which is that it’s an optimistic story.	23	2
201403	2638	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	You say that, yes, the economy will be booming at that time and we’re still keeping rates low, but there’s a good reason why we’re doing that.	23	2
201403	2639	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	It’s because we’re following through on our commitment that we made earlier.	23	2
201403	2640	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I know that that one is not being used, and it’s not that popular.	23	2
201403	2641	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	The third one is that real interest rates are lower and will continue to be lower in 2016 than they have been historically.	23	2
201403	2642	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I would put a global aspect on that.	23	2
201403	2643	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Global real interest rates are lower than they have been historically, and that’s why, when you add the real interest rate to the inflation target, you get a somewhat lower neutral policy rate than you would have when you looked at the 1980s, the 1990s, or the 2000s.	23	2
201403	2644	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Among the three explanations, this one has, I think, the most potential for the Committee to rally around.	23	2
201403	2645	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	It has a pessimistic tinge to it if you think that the real rates are lower because of lower potential growth for the US economy.	23	2
201403	2646	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	If you told it as a global story, which I think is very plausible—as a global saving glut, let’s say, which is keeping real interest rates low—then it would not necessarily have to have a pessimistic signal from the US point of view.	23	2
201403	2647	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	It certainly seems to be true that global real interest rates have been uncharacteristically low for quite a while, that that would persist out into the future, and that that might be an important factor as to why the neutral policy rate won’t be as high as it has been historically.	23	2
201403	2648	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	My own SEP has us back at a 4 percent or 4¼ percent policy rate by that time period because I have output gaps closed, I have inflation back at target, I’m not expecting any special shocks at that time, and I’m not putting that much weight on this story of low global real interest rates persisting that far out into the future.	23	2
201403	2649	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	We’re often using the headwinds explanation in public comments, but I do not think it’s very effective, and that’s why we keep getting a lot of questions about it.	23	2
201403	2650	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	It just raises a lot of questions in the minds of market participants.	23	2
201403	2651	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Somehow shocks are going to be hitting the economy at that time, or shocks that are still around today are superpersistent, and yet persistent in a way that’s not preventing the output gap from closing and inflation from going back to target.	23	2
201403	2652	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	This is a very difficult way to go about telling a story.	23	2
201403	2653	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Why have these shocks not affected the output or inflation gaps?	23	2
201403	2654	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	So I think that the explanation of low global real interest rates is somewhat more effective, and that we should switch to this explanation in the future.	23	2
201403	2655	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	My last comment concerns mentioning “keeping short-term interest rates below”	23	2
201403	2656	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	—I guess there’s a lot of agreement on this.	23	2
201403	2657	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	I’d be for replacing that with “keeping the federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal” in paragraph 6, as noted earlier by President Plosser.	23	2
201403	2658	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	So I favor that particular change.	23	2
201403	2659	2014-03-19	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2660	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201403	2661	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23	2
201403	2662	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2663	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	I generally support alternative B in terms of a further reduction in asset purchases and a pivot from threshold-based forward guidance to a more qualitative approach.	23	2
201403	2664	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	I view these changes as appropriate steps toward gradual policy normalization as the economy continues to expand, with meaningful cumulative gains as well as a positive growth outlook.	23	2
201403	2665	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	As someone noted yesterday, most of the prescriptions from the policy rules on which the Committee has relied over the past five years also have turned positive, in terms of signaling a shift away from zero interest rates starting in the second quarter of this year.	23	2
201403	2666	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	For these reasons, I think paragraph 6, as written, lacks clarity as to why economic conditions warrant keeping rates below normal levels when employment and inflation begin to return to normal.	23	2
201403	2667	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	Further explanation of the Committee’s assumptions about economic conditions in 2016 will be needed, in my view, to be credible.	23	2
201403	2668	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	At last September’s press conference, factors such as continued fiscal drag and the slow recovery of the housing sector were offered as explanations.	23	2
201403	2669	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	The January 2014 minutes point to lingering effects of the crisis.	23	2
201403	2670	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	However, the Tealbook now shows almost no fiscal drag in 2016, with substantial gains in residential construction.	23	2
201403	2671	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	So as the Committee alters its forward guidance, I expect that the public will seek more clarity about the nature of our reaction function, and I look forward to discussing that communication.	23	2
201403	2672	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	That said, I would highlight a few issues that continue to concern me about this policy stance.	23	2
201403	2673	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	First, in thinking about the potential challenges that may lie ahead, I believe that the alternative risk scenarios outlined in the Tealbook are useful.	23	2
201403	2674	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	In particular, I see the “Supply- Side Damage” scenario as one of the more relevant and difficult scenarios to navigate, primarily because it would necessitate policy tightening faster than currently anticipated.	23	2
201403	2675	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	Growth would also likely disappoint in such a scenario, so banks and other financial institutions would be grappling simultaneously with rates that are climbing faster than they had expected and slowing growth.	23	2
201403	2676	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	Aspects of this scenario seem plausible, especially given the downward revisions to potential GDP by the Congressional Budget Office and in the Tealbook.	23	2
201403	2677	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	Second, I remain concerned about the side effects of unusually low interest rates for this extended period of time and the incentives they promote for risk-taking and reaching for yield.	23	2
201403	2678	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	I continue to hear from contacts about fierce competition among lenders resulting in questionable terms and underwriting standards.	23	2
201403	2679	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	And I would note that consumer credit growth is beginning to accelerate, up nearly $300 billion in the second half of 2013, which does not include student loans.	23	2
201403	2680	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	Some of this goes hand in hand with an improving housing market.	23	2
201403	2681	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	If you look carefully at the data, it is the least creditworthy households that are more actively increasing their debt burdens.	23	2
201403	2682	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, I would join others who would prefer that paragraph 6 refer to the target federal funds rate instead of short-term interest rates so that we can continue our discussions about what the policy framework might look like in the future.	23	2
201403	2683	2014-03-19	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	23	2
201403	2684	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201403	2685	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	23	2
201403	2686	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2687	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I want to add to something I said yesterday and explain why I walked through the stock and bond metrics as I did.	23	2
201403	2688	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	The bottom line is that, for those of us who are worried about putting the American people back to work, which is part of our mandate, investment-grade corporate yields have been lower than the S&P’s forward- earnings yield.	23	2
201403	2689	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	And what that does is to provide an arbitrage opportunity, an incentive to corporations to issue bonds and to use the proceeds to buy back shares—not to invest, as yet, robustly in job-creating cap-ex.	23	2
201403	2690	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I think it’s important that we understand that dynamic.	23	2
201403	2691	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	That’s the only reason I go into it in depth.	23	2
201403	2692	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I’m quite sympathetic to Governor Stein’s sensitivity expressed yesterday.	23	2
201403	2693	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	But, in terms of that particular sector of the financial markets—referring, in particular, to junk credits or triple-Cs—you have to remember that the spreads are narrow over historically low nominal rates.	23	2
201403	2694	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	And all of these issues that I mentioned and Governor Stein mentioned and so on—I think the key operative word in his intervention yesterday was “tiptoe.”	23	2
201403	2695	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Like him, I was quite hawkish on the upside—meaning I wasn’t in favor of QE3.	23	2
201403	2696	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	But, having been there, we have to be extremely careful to tiptoe out of this room as we begin to change and provide forward guidance.	23	2
201403	2697	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I continue to support the easy part, as President Pianalto mentioned, which is the reduction in LSAPs.	23	2
201403	2698	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	In fact, I think it’s very important that, as we tiptoe out of that room, we not push much faster than the measured rate at which we’re taking it—even though I respect President Plosser enormously in terms of his suggestion.	23	2
201403	2699	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	We can take a look at that later, but, at this juncture—and I realize he didn’t make the recommendation for now—but just to put it on the table, I would not be in favor of going to more than $10 billion per month.	23	2
201403	2700	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I like the way we’re proceeding presently, even though, again, I was more hawkish on the other side.	23	2
201403	2701	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	But, like Governor Stein, I think we have to be very careful here.	23	2
201403	2702	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	In terms of tiptoeing—and remembering that we don’t have a whole lot of bullets left in our holster—as you know, I recommended that we take out that second sentence in paragraph 6, and I don’t expect us to do so at this meeting.	23	2
201403	2703	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	However, I think President Lockhart made the most convincing argument there.	23	2
201403	2704	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I want to have a little bit of ammunition in case things slip to the downside.	23	2
201403	2705	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Presently, as we put your imprimatur as Chair of this Committee on the statement, without that paragraph, we’re taking a good first step.	23	2
201403	2706	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	It may be that, by including that sentence, we take a step further than we need to take.	23	2
201403	2707	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I don’t know.	23	2
201403	2708	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	In other words, I may want to put that in my holster and save it, because I think President Lockhart made a very good point, which is, it could help us later on should things slip to the downside.	23	2
201403	2709	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I believe that was your point, President Lockhart.	23	2
201403	2710	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	If you’re going to keep it the way it is, like everybody who has talked so far, whether it was Governor Tarullo or the various presidents, I do think we need to change the “keeping short-term interest rates” and reference the fed funds rate.	23	2
201403	2711	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I was somewhat sympathetic to President Plosser’s comment on the word “current.”	23	2
201403	2712	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	But, if you look at it from an expository writing standpoint, whatever we say is current.	23	2
201403	2713	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Also, we say “likely,” which is the conditionality in that sentence.	23	2
201403	2714	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	So I, like President Williams, could go either way.	23	2
201403	2715	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I am getting deeply worried, Madam Chair, that President Williams and I tend to agree almost constantly now.	23	2
201403	2716	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Deeply disturbing.	23	2
201403	2717	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	23	2
201403	2718	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Yes, deeply disturbing.	23	2
201403	2719	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	But, otherwise, I fully support alternative B as stated.	23	2
201403	2720	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Thank you for making the changes that were made, and I am in support of alternative B.	23	2
201403	2721	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I would consider that point, though, on the second part of paragraph 6.	23	2
201403	2722	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	What’s in our holster next?	23	2
201403	2723	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Here’s one last point: I have very strong feelings about shifting from a 2 percent target to a 2 percent floor.	23	2
201403	2724	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	I know we’re not arguing that at the present juncture, but I expect that to be an interesting argument in the future.	23	2
201403	2725	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	And I want to, again, put on the table that I am strongly against thinking of 2 percent as a floor as opposed to a long-term target.	23	2
201403	2726	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2727	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	23	2
201403	2728	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2729	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I see today’s FOMC statement as a significant one.	23	2
201403	2730	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Over the past few months, we’ve had a fulsome discussion about the best way to communicate about the evolution of the fed funds rate target once the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent.	23	2
201403	2731	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks in part to your leadership, Madam Chair, this has been a thoughtful and deliberative process, which is culminating today in alternative B.	23	2
201403	2732	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I have decided to vote against alternative B.	23	2
201403	2733	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I am dissenting because the new forward guidance weakens the credibility of the commitment to return inflation to the 2 percent target from below, and because it fosters policy uncertainty that hinders economic activity.	23	2
201403	2734	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I do strongly endorse the language in paragraph 6, with the emendation that President Plosser offered.	23	2
201403	2735	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But my enthusiasm for that paragraph is not sufficient to change my vote.	23	2
201403	2736	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll briefly elaborate on my dissent.	23	2
201403	2737	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of credibility, the PCE inflation rate has tended downward over the past few years and is currently near 1 percent.	23	2
201403	2738	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Tealbook A does not see the inflation rate returning to 2 percent until 2018.	23	2
201403	2739	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is six years after we publicly committed to 2 percent as our target.	23	2
201403	2740	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The FOMC should communicate the purposeful steps that are being taken to facilitate a more rapid return of inflation to target.	23	2
201403	2741	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The absence of this kind of communication weakens the credibility of the Committee’s inflation target by suggesting that the Committee views inflation persistently below 2 percent as an acceptable outcome.	23	2
201403	2742	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of uncertainty, most labor market metrics imply that the economy is still well short of maximum employment.	23	2
201403	2743	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In its forward guidance in alternative B, the Committee provides little information about its desired rate of progress toward maximum employment.	23	2
201403	2744	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Indeed, the guidance provides no quantitative measure of what constitutes maximum employment.	23	2
201403	2745	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	These omissions foster uncertainty about the extent to which the Committee is willing to use monetary stimulus to foster faster growth, and this uncertainty acts as a drag on economic activity.	23	2
201403	2746	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What could we have done instead?	23	2
201403	2747	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In my view, over the past 15 months, the Committee’s forward guidance about the fed funds rate has been highly effective at managing market expectations.	23	2
201403	2748	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That guidance has relied on an unemployment rate threshold of 6.5 percent and an inflation outlook guardrail of 2½ percent.	23	2
201403	2749	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Because of the effectiveness of this quantitative approach, I would have favored adopting a similar approach for the future.	23	2
201403	2750	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	To be even more specific, my preferred language would have been as follows: “The Committee anticipates keeping the fed funds rate in its current range at least until the unemployment rate has fallen below 5.5 percent, as long as the one- to two-year-ahead outlook for PCE inflation remains below 2¼ percent, longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored, and possible risks to financial stability remain well contained.”	23	2
201403	2751	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This alternative guidance communicates a willingness to use monetary policy to push inflation back up to 2 percent.	23	2
201403	2752	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It reduces macroeconomic uncertainty by being clear about the kinds of labor market and inflation conditions that are likely to be associated with an increase in the federal funds rate.	23	2
201403	2753	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Finally, it deals with what I see as the unlikely possibility of risks to financial stability through an explicit escape clause.	23	2
201403	2754	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Here, I’m going a little bit off my script.	23	2
201403	2755	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	A question that occurs to people, I think, is, will we always need quantitative forward guidance?	23	2
201403	2756	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Aren’t we back to normal now, so can’t we just get rid of this extraordinary tool that we used during extraordinary times?	23	2
201403	2757	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And here, I think, the problem for us is that we can’t go back to normal—as, say, we were doing in 2004 or 2006— because of the fact that we’ve made a change in what our framework is.	23	2
201403	2758	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We now have an explicit number that operates as our target—2 percent.	23	2
201403	2759	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That means we have to communicate numerically about how we’re doing in terms of making progress toward that goal.	23	2
201403	2760	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we had a monetary policy report that was communicating on a consistent basis about what the Committee’s outlook was, depending on its policy, and that described the Committee’s plans on an ongoing basis for how it was planning to ameliorate any gaps between its current outcomes and the target on both the employment and inflation dimensions, we wouldn’t have to have all of this in the statement.	23	2
201403	2761	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It would be, instead, in the monetary policy report.	23	2
201403	2762	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Here I’m fully aware that President Bullard probably disagrees with what I would have in the report, but I think having that kind of communication would eliminate the need to have this in the statement.	23	2
201403	2763	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We’re not at that stage.	23	2
201403	2764	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll close by noting again that I do strongly endorse paragraph 6, with the particular emendation of replacing “short-term interest rates” with “the target for the federal funds rate.”	23	2
201403	2765	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think this paragraph provides information about the Committee’s intentions for the behavior of the fed funds rate once employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels.	23	2
201403	2766	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	From an intellectual point of view, I’m sure it’s very interesting to try to figure out why we’re doing this.	23	2
201403	2767	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s not something we usually insist on—having agreement among the Committee about why we’re doing things.	23	2
201403	2768	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And these meetings will get very long indeed if we try to insist on that.	23	2
201403	2769	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think this is providing the public with the information they need about the covariance structure of the mandate variables and our policy tool:  Employment and inflation are going to be near mandate-consistent levels, and the fed funds rate is going to remain below historical norms.	23	2
201403	2770	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Those intentions are appropriate, and communicating them should help stimulate economic activity by reducing uncertainty.	23	2
201403	2771	2014-03-19	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2772	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201403	2773	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Stein.	23	2
201403	2774	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2775	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I support alternative B as written.	23	2
201403	2776	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I think the statement is very well crafted and does a nice job of making a smooth transition from our prior, threshold-based guidance.	23	2
201403	2777	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I have just a couple of observations.	23	2
201403	2778	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	One observation is about the second sentence in paragraph 6, which I support.	23	2
201403	2779	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I have to say that I agree with a lot of what Dan said here about keeping an open mind on longer-run secular forces.	23	2
201403	2780	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	In that regard, I wanted to draw attention to a slight difference in the current way that the paragraph is written, as opposed to a previous formulation.	23	2
201403	2781	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Now it refers to “below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.”	23	2
201403	2782	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	A previous iteration of it said “below their historical levels for some time.”	23	2
201403	2783	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I actually think the current formulation ties our hands behind our back in a particular way because, in other words, it’s basically fixing some notion of the longer run.	23	2
201403	2784	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Therefore, really, it’s very headwinds- oriented right now.	23	2
201403	2785	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I basically thought that a lot of what Governor Tarullo said was, it’s not just short-run headwinds.	23	2
201403	2786	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	At least in principle, it’s also longer-run, secular forces.	23	2
201403	2787	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	President Bullard alluded to saving, productivity, demographics—all of that stuff.	23	2
201403	2788	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I like the previous historical formulation because it left that a little bit more open.	23	2
201403	2789	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I don’t think we’re going to litigate that now, but if we’re going to have the conversation that Dan encouraged us to have and which I think we should have, then the historical formulation just leaves that open.	23	2
201403	2790	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	So that’s one point.	23	2
201403	2791	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	A second observation—and it’s just an observation—is that we’ve talked a lot about qualitative versus quantitative guidance.	23	2
201403	2792	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Another dimension is, where does the guidance fall on a spectrum, with one end of the spectrum being “Commitment” and the other end being “Well, this is kind of my forecast, but don’t take it too seriously”?	23	2
201403	2793	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I think we’re in the midst of an important evolution on this dimension of the guidance as well.	23	2
201403	2794	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	That is to say, the 6.5 percent threshold was a commitment, or it grew to be pretty close to a commitment.	23	2
201403	2795	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Paragraph 5 has, “it likely will be appropriate to maintain ... for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends”—it’s not a commitment, but it has strong elements of commitment.	23	2
201403	2796	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	We could break the glass, but I think that, in signing on to the statement, it would be a big deal to do something before early 2015.	23	2
201403	2797	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	By contrast, paragraph 6 is very different, and it’s written artfully, but there are words like “currently anticipates” and “may ... warrant.”	23	2
201403	2798	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Basically, we’re saying, “Take the 2015 dot really pretty seriously.	23	2
201403	2799	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Take the 2016 dot as a forecast.”	23	2
201403	2800	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Now, to be clear, both of these formulations are roughly appropriate, but they imply a potentially tricky transition as time passes.	23	2
201403	2801	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	And we implicitly are not giving the market the same kind of definitive certainty as to what’s coming.	23	2
201403	2802	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I just wonder how market participants interpret the dots.	23	2
201403	2803	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	We, I think, struggle among ourselves as to how to interpret them.	23	2
201403	2804	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I saw something in the Financial Times yesterday that gave me a little bit of pause.	23	2
201403	2805	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Somebody wrote, “Well, the dots are becoming the new thresholds.”	23	2
201403	2806	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	That’s not what we have in mind, but we learned this in the taper episode.	23	2
201403	2807	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Different people make different inferences about what we’re doing, and sometimes people who are not necessarily the median person are nevertheless influential for market prices.	23	2
201403	2808	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	So I think it’s just something on which there’s room for heterogeneity.	23	2
201403	2809	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I certainly feel this myself.	23	2
201403	2810	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I feel as though, when I write down my 2015 dot, it feels commitment-like.	23	2
201403	2811	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	For the 2016 dot, it’s just— whatever.	23	2
201403	2812	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	So I wouldn’t have a huge amount of qualms about revising the 2016 dot.	23	2
201403	2813	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I don’t feel as though I’m committing.	23	2
201403	2814	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	There’s a process of weaning market participants off of this, and I don’t quite know how we do it.	23	2
201403	2815	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I think, again, the statement does a very good job.	23	2
201403	2816	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	It’s written very well.	23	2
201403	2817	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	And I’m not suggesting that we go out and beat them over the head.	23	2
201403	2818	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I’m not suggesting, Madam Chair, that you go out and say, “Look, 2016 is really an estimate.”	23	2
201403	2819	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	It’s a gradual process, and we’ve got to evolve there.	23	2
201403	2820	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	We might want to take note of some markers along the way and hope that this sinks in over time.	23	2
201403	2821	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	In my ideal world, if we’re looking at market volatility, it ought to be rising as we move through time.	23	2
201403	2822	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	As we move away from giving commitment and we move toward just giving more traditional guidance, I would hope that, in some controlled sense, volatility would be going up.	23	2
201403	2823	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	That would be a healthy thing.	23	2
201403	2824	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Beyond that, I don’t really think there’s anything prescriptive to do about it now.	23	2
201403	2825	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	Thank you.	23	2
201403	2826	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201403	2827	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23	2
201403	2828	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2829	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	I will support alternative B, and I’ll come to the statement language in the end.	23	2
201403	2830	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	As Stan Fischer suggested five days ago in our confirmation hearing, the process of returning monetary policy to a normal stance has now begun.	23	2
201403	2831	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	Along the way, I expressed a fair amount of concern that the Committee could lose control of the current asset purchase program because of what I saw as the lack of a stopping rule that covered most of the reasonably likely outcomes, and I’m very pleased to note that that didn’t happen.	23	2
201403	2832	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	Instead, the Committee is going to reduce purchases today for the third consecutive meeting.	23	2
201403	2833	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	On net, the market has barely reacted, and market participants seem comfortable with the path.	23	2
201403	2834	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	This is a big win, and it’s a very good start for the normalization process.	23	2
201403	2835	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	But, having been cautious about getting this far in, I’m going to suggest the need for caution on the way out because the process of normalization is itself an important threat to the recovery, and there’s a need to steer a middle course between possible bad outcomes.	23	2
201403	2836	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	Lots of risks are outside our control, but, to control the arguably controllable, I want to talk about two risks in particular.	23	2
201403	2837	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	The first is that, for one of two reasons, the market suddenly pulls forward liftoff and drives up rates across the curve in a way that threatens the economy.	23	2
201403	2838	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	We’ve already seen the large effect on housing from a pretty modest increase in mortgage rates.	23	2
201403	2839	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	Housing finance is still historically cheap, but, nonetheless, we’ve seen the housing recovery really affected by it.	23	2
201403	2840	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	I think it’s important to keep in mind that this is still a fragile recovery, which can be threatened in this way.	23	2
201403	2841	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	Now, the market, of course, is supposed to react to good and bad economic news, and, if that’s the source of the surprise and the source of the reaction, then it’s one that the Committee can and must manage.	23	2
201403	2842	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	I think the way to protect against it is to tie down forward guidance, and that’s one of the reasons I support the last sentence in paragraph 6.	23	2
201403	2843	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	I’ll come to some others later.	23	2
201403	2844	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	But, to me, the idea is to build a framework that will be resilient to the kind of events in which the economy strengthens, and so in the period ahead I’d like to see us tie down guidance.	23	2
201403	2845	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	It’s not going to be perfect, as I’ll get to.	23	2
201403	2846	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	On the other hand, we need to be very careful not to send a signal that our reaction function has changed.	23	2
201403	2847	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	A tightening that’s not based on stronger economic news could stop and reverse progress.	23	2
201403	2848	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	We could find ourselves having to gear up asset purchases again, and that is not a place that I aspire to be.	23	2
201403	2849	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	The second risk is that, even without a sudden reevaluation of the policy, financial instability emerges in the form of unsustainably exuberant financial conditions and the risk of a sudden reversal that stops the economy in its tracks.	23	2
201403	2850	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	I think it’s a very real threat, though perhaps not in the very near term.	23	2
201403	2851	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	And, unfortunately, it’s one that the Committee is not very well equipped to handle except through monetary policy, a famously blunt instrument.	23	2
201403	2852	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	Just a word on today’s conditions.	23	2
201403	2853	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	I would call them mixed but trending toward ebullience.	23	2
201403	2854	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	On the equity markets, I really think that the level of the equity markets is a function of the debate over the sustainability of profit margins at very high levels, and that’s what drives things like valuation-to-GDP, Tobin’s q, cyclically adjusted P/E, and valuation-to-sales.	23	2
201403	2855	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	As yesterday’s staff presentation showed, P/Es are not unsustainably high.	23	2
201403	2856	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	On the question of whether profit margins are at an unsustainable level, I not only don’t know, but also don’t know how to know.	23	2
201403	2857	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	I think we’ll just have to stick around and find out.	23	2
201403	2858	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	As far as leveraged finance markets are concerned, I thought Jeremy covered it well yesterday.	23	2
201403	2859	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	We’re not at peak-level ebullience, but we’re in the same Zip code, and we have rates that are going to remain low for years ahead.	23	2
201403	2860	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	So it’s plausible to me that our policy could push the price of financial assets much higher and set up a reaction that could significantly harm the economy.	23	2
201403	2861	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	It’s not a prediction, but I think it’s a real risk.	23	2
201403	2862	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	And the policy implications of that are difficult as well.	23	2
201403	2863	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	Let me say what I think success would look like.	23	2
201403	2864	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	A successful middle course between those two risks will obviously involve rates moving up and volatility returning to normal levels as the economy improves.	23	2
201403	2865	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	The process is almost guaranteed to be bumpy and jagged and not smooth, and we need to accept and embrace the messiness.	23	2
201403	2866	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	In a way, the kinds of increases in volatility that come with a stronger economy should be welcomed.	23	2
201403	2867	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	If we have the right framework in place—and the markets always overshoot, except when you expect them to overshoot, so we need to embrace that if it happens and let the market get comfortable.	23	2
201403	2868	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	And we need to avoid self-inflicted wounds.	23	2
201403	2869	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	The third potential risk—that of an overheating economy, as I suggested yesterday— seems to me remote.	23	2
201403	2870	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	The economy may very well prove tighter than it appears and tighter than I think it is, but, given the pace at which it’s moving, it’s really hard to see the economy sneaking up on us on this.	23	2
201403	2871	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	It’s a risk that, if it emerges, can be addressed with the standard playbook.	23	2
201403	2872	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	In the meantime, the strategy should be as transparent and predictable as possible to move at a stately pace, and, yes, I’m happy to join Jeremy and Richard in tiptoeing through the tulips and off the field.	23	2
201403	2873	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	In closing, let me say a couple of things about the statement.	23	2
201403	2874	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	I like paragraph 6 for a bunch of reasons.	23	2
201403	2875	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	First, I guess I’d start with the fact that longer-term rates in the SEP are all at 4 and 4¼, so the Committee has, in fact, projected its impression of long-term rates.	23	2
201403	2876	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	But 13 of the 16 participants have rates more than 100 basis points below that in 2016.	23	2
201403	2877	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	So I think the second sentence of paragraph 6 is true on its face.	23	2
201403	2878	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	I also think the analysis that Governor Tarullo and many others have gone through is pretty persuasive.	23	2
201403	2879	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	So I’m comfortable with it as written.	23	2
201403	2880	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	I’m happy to have “short-term interest rates” changed to “the federal funds rate.”	23	2
201403	2881	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	I’m going to take some risk with this, but I’m going to go ahead and say it, and that is, I think a dovish dissent at this meeting does increase the risk of a perception in the market that this is a hawkish surprise.	23	2
201403	2882	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	Therefore, it’s on the Chair even more to hit these points, maybe even harder than you otherwise would, and then lean into that.	23	2
201403	2883	2014-03-19	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2884	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201403	2885	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23	2
201403	2886	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2887	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, I support alternative B.	23	2
201403	2888	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it’s important to revamp the statement before the unemployment rate reaches the 6½ percent threshold, for several reasons.	23	2
201403	2889	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	First of all, it allows us to preempt the question of what happens when the threshold is actually reached.	23	2
201403	2890	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	If we kept the threshold in today’s statement and then the unemployment rate declined, that would raise all sorts of questions about what would happen at the subsequent meeting, and we might not have the press conference scheduled as a vehicle to explain ourselves.	23	2
201403	2891	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	So, doing it preemptively, I think, makes a lot of sense because it just takes it off the table.	23	2
201403	2892	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, I don’t think the 6½ percent unemployment rate threshold adds much value currently.	23	2
201403	2893	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	If you look at the SEP numbers or you look at the market expectations, everyone thinks that we’re going to wait long past the time when the unemployment rate gets below 6½ percent.	23	2
201403	2894	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	So it’s not as though there’s a lot of information content in that.	23	2
201403	2895	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I recognize that removing it does create the question of whether that threshold still applies in terms of our behavior, but I think that’s taken care of by paragraph 7.	23	2
201403	2896	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think it’s essential to add the language in both sentences of paragraph 6.	23	2
201403	2897	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Financial conditions are determined in large part not just by the timing of liftoff, but also by the trajectory of short-term interest rates after that.	23	2
201403	2898	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	So if you omitted the second sentence in paragraph 6, you’re basically not telling people what you think is likely to happen after liftoff, and that’s a very important component of what drives financial conditions.	23	2
201403	2899	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	If you don’t provide that guidance, that implies greater uncertainty, greater volatility, and higher risk premiums, which go against what we’re trying to accomplish.	23	2
201403	2900	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, I think it’s very important not to oversell paragraph 6, and my view here is very close to Governor Stein’s.	23	2
201403	2901	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Our expectations may not be realized.	23	2
201403	2902	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	So there’s still plenty of residual uncertainty about the outlook.	23	2
201403	2903	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	We can’t eliminate the underlying uncertainty about the economic outlook and the path of short-term rates that’s consistent with that outlook, but we certainly can eliminate that portion of uncertainty about our own current thinking about what we’re expecting to do.	23	2
201403	2904	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	We should share our current thinking, recognizing that what we think and how this will translate into our actions will evolve over time.	23	2
201403	2905	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s not much pre-commitment here at all, in my opinion.	23	2
201403	2906	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think adding paragraph 6 today has the benefit of getting the post-liftoff forward guidance into the statement at an early enough stage that it’s not going to be taken as a signal of impending liftoff.	23	2
201403	2907	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	If we didn’t do it today, taking advantage of Chair Yellen’s first meeting as the head of the Committee and the fact that we’re close to 6½ percent on the unemployment rate, then we’d have these questions of when we would add it and how the market would take it as a signal at that time.	23	2
201403	2908	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Looking at the statement, I think that, if we didn’t have the SEP problem, the markets could actually digest paragraph 6 quite easily, especially with paragraph 7 emphasizing that a revamp of the statement does not change the guidance.	23	2
201403	2909	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	The problem is not the statement.	23	2
201403	2910	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	The problem is the SEP dots in 2016.	23	2
201403	2911	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	What about the substance of paragraph 6—that the neutral level of interest rates is likely to be below the historical average for some time?	23	2
201403	2912	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	That can be justified in many ways.	23	2
201403	2913	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	First, if the equilibrium real rate were really close to the historical average of 2 percent, then I would think we’d be growing a lot more rapidly than we actually have been growing, given that the current real interest rate is minus 1 percent.	23	2
201403	2914	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, on the headwinds side, it’s probably important for us to talk a little bit more about this.	23	2
201403	2915	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	What exactly are these headwinds?	23	2
201403	2916	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I see two broad sets of headwinds.	23	2
201403	2917	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	On the investment side, I see lots of reasons why investment is weak— for example, homeowners who don’t have much equity in their houses or are even underwater on their mortgages, so they can’t get new mortgages, they can’t refinance, and they can’t move.	23	2
201403	2918	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, in the mortgage market, you see sharp differentiation on the availability of mortgage credit based on FICO scores, which is very different than what’s applied historically.	23	2
201403	2919	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there are still constraints on credit to small business start-ups.	23	2
201403	2920	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	So a whole bunch of things are constraining the investment side.	23	2
201403	2921	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	On the saving side, there are lots of reasons to think that the crisis has caused a shift in the saving function to greater precautionary saving.	23	2
201403	2922	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	When I started to think of it conceptually, I thought of it as, the IS curve has shifted to the left—you basically have less investment and more saving, and so that’s really pulling down the equilibrium real rate for a period of time.	23	2
201403	2923	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	It would be good for us to try to articulate that a little bit more fully.	23	2
201403	2924	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	The third thing I want to talk about a little bit is something that hasn’t been discussed.	23	2
201403	2925	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I really do think the effect of monetary policy on economic activity depends on both the level of interest rates and the change in the level of interest rates, and I don’t think we’ve had any discussion about that.	23	2
201403	2926	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	We saw over the last year what the effects of the increase in mortgage rates were on the housing market—we saw a pretty significant slowing in the housing market.	23	2
201403	2927	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I would encourage the staff to look at this question—that is, as interest rates rise, how much of a restraint will that change in financial conditions exert on the economy, even if we’re still at an accommodative monetary policy setting?	23	2
201403	2928	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	This is something that, when I worked in the private sector, we really struggled with.	23	2
201403	2929	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Is it the level of financial conditions, or is it the change of financial conditions, that actually affects economic growth?	23	2
201403	2930	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I’d like to see more work done on this so we could understand that a little bit.	23	2
201403	2931	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s relevant now because we’re just so far away from the equilibrium real rate that we think is going to apply over the longer term.	23	2
201403	2932	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Normally, you’re in the vicinity, and so this distinction doesn’t really matter very much.	23	2
201403	2933	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	But when you’re really far away from where you want to end up, it could actually be quite important.	23	2
201403	2934	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	What’s missing from the statement?	23	2
201403	2935	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Frankly, it would still be nice to get a little bit more guidance about the trajectory of our balance sheet.	23	2
201403	2936	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I still think there are two issues there.	23	2
201403	2937	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	The first is the timing of when the reinvestment process ends.	23	2
201403	2938	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Simon talked yesterday about how there was quite a broad range of views about when reinvestment is going to end.	23	2
201403	2939	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Most people probably think it’s close to the time of liftoff, but the fact that there’s still that uncertainty— that’s something that we could clarify and eliminate.	23	2
201403	2940	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	So I’d like to take care of that.	23	2
201403	2941	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	The second thing is, I’d like to be a little bit clearer about not selling agency MBS.	23	2
201403	2942	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that’s what the market expectation is, but it would be nice to just nail that down a little bit more.	23	2
201403	2943	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	What’s happening to the trajectory of the balance sheet over time is also important as a factor influencing financial conditions.	23	2
201403	2944	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	So providing greater clarity about that would be good.	23	2
201403	2945	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m still unhappy about the SEP.	23	2
201403	2946	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we remain overly reliant on it to communicate our forecast expectations.	23	2
201403	2947	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s flawed.	23	2
201403	2948	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	It needs a lot of work, and we have a particular problem today in that the statement signals no change in guidance, but the SEP for 2016 shows an increase of 50 basis points.	23	2
201403	2949	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	And that’s going to be really hard for the Chair to reconcile.	23	2
201403	2950	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	So I, not being the person presiding over the press conference, would offer this advice to the Chair: We need to emphasize the statement because the statement is the action of the Committee, while the SEP is just a collection of forecasts with different assumptions embedded in it.	23	2
201403	2951	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I would emphasize that we should just keep coming back to the statement as the driving thing in trying to discuss the SEP.	23	2
201403	2952	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	But I do expect that the market will react a little bit negatively to what’s in the SEP, and that they will note the tension between the statement and the SEP.	23	2
201403	2953	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Regarding language, I don’t see the change in paragraph 5 in terms of the second “current” as doing very much, so I guess I feel as though, if you make the change, people are going to note the change and they’re going to wonder what the change means.	23	2
201403	2954	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I just don’t feel as though you’ve quite gotten over the threshold to motivate that change.	23	2
201403	2955	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of paragraph 6, on “short-term interest rates,” my personal view is that “short- term interest rates” is a big tent, and that big tent means it includes a lot of different things and gives us complete optionality about where we’re going to go.	23	2
201403	2956	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	If we go to “the federal funds rate,” then, at some future date, we may have to make a change potentially.	23	2
201403	2957	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	But I think the consensus of the Committee is “the federal funds rate.”	23	2
201403	2958	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	So I’m happy to accede to that.	23	2
201403	2959	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201403	2960	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201403	2961	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23	2
201403	2962	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	I want to go back to this issue about the second sentence in paragraph 6.	23	2
201403	2963	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	In describing it, the Vice Chairman did mention, actually, the earlier language, which referred to historical averages.	23	2
201403	2964	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	It doesn’t currently say that, and I think this is a point that relates to Governor Tarullo’s point, too.	23	2
201403	2965	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I want to emphasize that the language in the statement, which I do support, says “warrant keeping short-term interest rates below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.”	23	2
201403	2966	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think the only way you can interpret this is, looking at the 2016 numbers versus the long-run numbers.	23	2
201403	2967	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s not really about the long-run numbers.	23	2
201403	2968	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	A number of the arguments that have been discussed at the table, including Governor Tarullo’s, probably affect the long run more than the difference between 2016 and the long run.	23	2
201403	2969	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Demographic factors, productivity growth—those are all going to show up, presumably, in people’s estimates of the long run.	23	2
201403	2970	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m bringing this up because I think you have to be a little bit careful in talking about what this sentence actually says.	23	2
201403	2971	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	It is talking about the fact that we expect real interest rates to essentially be zero at the end of 2016, even though we think that, in the long run, real interest rates are between 1½ and 2 percent.	23	2
201403	2972	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	I wanted to bring that up because I think there is maybe a little bit of mixing up two ideas here in terms of what the statement’s actually referring to.	23	2
201403	2973	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23	2
201403	2974	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	I think you’re right.	23	2
201403	2975	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	There are two ideas here.	23	2
201403	2976	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	One is that there are these temporary factors that may last a long time because of this extended crisis and that are going to push you down for a while.	23	2
201403	2977	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re not sure how long, but we think several years.	23	2
201403	2978	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	And then there are more persistent factors—demographics, potential GDP growth—that are going to last for a very, very long time, as they’re pretty much baked in the cake.	23	2
201403	2979	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	Those are two separate—	23	2
201403	2980	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Right.	23	2
201403	2981	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	In our previous language, the one you referred to actually covered both of those.	23	2
201403	2982	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	The current language refers only to the difference between “for some time” and “the longer run.”	23	2
201403	2983	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m just bringing that up.	23	2
201403	2984	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	John, you would favor going back to “historical”?	23	2
201403	2985	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	No, I got a little worried that the discussion here was including things like long-run productivity growth or demographics.	23	2
201403	2986	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Those wouldn’t actually fit into this paragraph 6 explanation.	23	2
201403	2987	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	As written.	23	2
201403	2988	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	As written.	23	2
201403	2989	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	No, I agree with that.	23	2
201403	2990	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	So do I.	23	2
201403	2991	2014-03-19	meeting	STEIN	I agree with that.	23	2
201403	2992	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	I was just trying to point that out because it seemed as though it may have been getting a little mixed up.	23	2
201403	2993	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Well, does that suggest we should go back to “historical”?	23	2
201403	2994	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	Well, I think “historical averages” actually allows us to talk about both of these issues—	23	2
201403	2995	2014-03-19	meeting	TARULLO	I agree.	23	2
201403	2996	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	—the 2016 issue, which I agree could be thought of as an IS curve shift or an equilibrium real rate thing.	23	2
201403	2997	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	It also allows us to talk about longer-run issues that we also seem to agree on.	23	2
201403	2998	2014-03-19	meeting	WILLIAMS	If you look at, again, the SEP, flawed as it is, it’s pretty clear there’s a consensus that the long-run value of the real interest rate is significantly below its historical average of about 2½ percent.	23	2
201403	2999	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23	2
201403	3000	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Could somebody give us a table of what the historical real interest rates are?	23	2
201403	3001	2014-03-19	meeting	EVANS	Every time I’ve looked, there’s an enormous disagreement as to exactly how low they are.	23	2
201403	3002	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	That was part of the reason for getting rid of that language, as we would immediately be asked “What period?	23	2
201403	3003	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	What historical average?”	23	2
201403	3004	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	It’s very different over different periods.	23	2
201403	3005	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	If we leave the language as is, it is consistent with what you see in the SEP, and it doesn’t prevent us from, over time, if we decide it’s appropriate, writing down our views as to what is normal in the longer run if demographics and productivity growth end up being important.	23	2
201403	3006	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	But I think it does point more in the direction of headwinds as what this is about.	23	2
201403	3007	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201403	3008	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Well, thanks.	23	2
201403	3009	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I appreciate all of the effort and thought that all of you have put into this.	23	2
201403	3010	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	This is not an easy transition.	23	2
201403	3011	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I agree that this is something we ought to do today.	23	2
201403	3012	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	While I understand we’re not at 6½ percent—and, as President Evans indicated, one could make the case for waiting—I think it’s broadly expected.	23	2
201403	3013	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	And the fact that we are approaching 6½ percent, to me, seems like a compelling reason to move forward today.	23	2
201403	3014	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I know that what we have here is not perfect as revised forward guidance, but it really does bridge a lot of different views on the Committee.	23	2
201403	3015	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I think the most controversial piece of this is the second sentence of paragraph 6.	23	2
201403	3016	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I’ve listened very carefully to what all of you have had to say about it in the go-round this morning.	23	2
201403	3017	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	As I counted, there are certainly a significant number of people who would be more comfortable not including paragraph 6.	23	2
201403	3018	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	If I count numbers, since almost all of you weighed in on this, I would say the “keep it in” camp outnumbers slightly the “take it out” camp.	23	2
201403	3019	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	And I would say that my own personal preference is, I would like to weigh in in favor of keeping it in, for the reasons that many of you have explained, especially since we have the dot plot.	23	2
201403	3020	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	If we don’t speak to this as a Committee, the dot plot will basically be what the world has to interpret our views on this.	23	2
201403	3021	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I’d prefer it if the Committee, when it has a view, articulates that view in the statement.	23	2
201403	3022	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I don’t think the SEP was ever meant to be a statement of this Committee’s policy views.	23	2
201403	3023	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	And, while I agree, I think we have had some analysis of this issue.	23	2
201403	3024	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	The staff prepared a very thoughtful memo—I believe that it was for the meeting before last—looking at alternative reasons why we are projecting low rates for a time, even after the economy is back at mandate- consistent levels.	23	2
201403	3025	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	We include quite a few statements about our collective beliefs.	23	2
201403	3026	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	We believe that inflation is going to be heading back up to 2 percent.	23	2
201403	3027	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	We feel some sense of confidence that the labor market will improve over time, and we don’t exactly agree on precisely what the reasons are.	23	2
201403	3028	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	So, to me, this is a broadly enough shared view that I would like to see it expressed in the statement as a forecast.	23	2
201403	3029	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Clearly, it is something.	23	2
201403	3030	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	It doesn’t have the same status as the thresholds, which, I agree, were more like commitments.	23	2
201403	3031	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	This is a forecast, and I think it’s stated quite conditionally as such.	23	2
201403	3032	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	So, with your permission, I would like to stick with paragraph 6 and ask us to vote on that.	238	2
201403	3033	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to wording, I heard a great deal of support in paragraph 6 to change “short- term interest rates” to “the federal funds rate.”	238	2
201403	3034	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Is there anybody who would be opposed to doing that?	238	2
201403	3035	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I did hear a considerable amount of interest in changing it.	238	2
201403	3036	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Anybody who would have— yes.	238	2
201403	3037	2014-03-19	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair, I think some people expressed the preference for “target federal funds rate.”	238	2
201403	3038	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	238	2
201403	3039	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s try some wording here.	238	2
201403	3040	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	“The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.”	238	2
201403	3041	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Is that okay?	238	2
201403	3042	2014-03-19	meeting	PARTICIPANT	Yes.	238	2
201403	3043	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Then I think the only other open issue here in terms of wording was in paragraph 5.	238	2
201403	3044	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Did we want to include the bracketed “current”?	238	2
201403	3045	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Not everyone weighed in on that.	238	2
201403	3046	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser, I know, supports that.	238	2
201403	3047	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I heard a couple of no’s.	238	2
201403	3048	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Are there other people who would like to support including the bracketed language “current”?	238	2
201403	3049	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	238	2
201403	3050	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing no overwhelming support, I propose we stick with the original language:  “The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate,” et cetera.	238	2
201403	3051	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	238	2
201403	3052	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I think those were the major issues.	238	2
201403	3053	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	So if people are ready, Matt, do you want to read the statement?	238	2
201403	3054	2014-03-19	meeting	LUECKE	Yes.	238	2
201403	3055	2014-03-19	meeting	LUECKE	This vote will cover the statement as written on pages 6 and 7 of the monetary policy briefing package, with the changes to the sentences read by Chair Yellen.	238	2
201403	3056	2014-03-19	meeting	LUECKE	And it will encompass the directive on page 12 of the monetary policy briefing package.	238	2
201403	3057	2014-03-19	meeting	LUECKE	Chair Yellen Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes President Fisher Yes President Kocherlakota No President Pianalto Yes President Plosser Yes Governor Powell Yes Governor Stein Yes Governor Tarullo Yes .	238	2
201403	3058	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Great.	238	2
201403	3059	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	By 10:00.	1	1
201403	3060	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	That may be a new record.	1	1
201403	3061	2014-03-19	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	1	1
201403	3062	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	What do you think?	1	1
201403	3063	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	[Simultaneous conversation]	1	1
201403	3064	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	But, on the other hand, we did take a lot of time during the intermeeting period to ensure that this would be more efficient.	1	1
201403	3065	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I appreciate all of the time you were willing to take in sorting this out so that today didn’t turn into a train wreck.	1	1
201403	3066	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	There’s one more opportunity for a train wreck, which I will try to avoid.	1	1
201403	3067	2014-03-19	meeting	FISHER	Good luck.	1	1
201403	3068	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	I will do my best, that’s all I can say.	1	1
201403	3069	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	It will be a learning experience.	1	1
201403	3070	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, all, for your input and cooperation.	1	1
201403	3071	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	The dates of the next meeting are Tuesday and Wednesday, April 29 and 30.	1	1
201403	3072	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Lunch is going to be available around 11:30 for those of you who can stay.	1	1
201403	3073	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	There are no lunchtime presentations, and there will be a set-up in the Special Library for anybody who wants to watch the press conference.	1	1
201403	3074	2014-03-19	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	1	1
