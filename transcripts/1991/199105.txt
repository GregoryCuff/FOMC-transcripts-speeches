199105	2	GREENSPAN	 Without objection. We have a memorandum from Mr. Mattingly on amendments to the Rules Regarding Availability of Information. Virgil, do you have anything to add at this particular stage? 	9	97	0.0	1.0	47.0
199105	3	MATTINGLY	 No, I think these are technical. The major reason is that the Committee is required by law to have a fee schedule for processing requests under the Freedom of Information Act, so we came forth with these recommendations. Because we had to do so, we suggested certain other changes to the rules to update them. They are all technical; they don't result in any substantive change in any of the disclosure policies of the Committee. 	9	97	0.0	0.0	999.0

199105	9	GREENE	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I hope you can hear me; I'm suffering from the same throat ailment as some others here. The sharp recovery in the dollar that occurred during most of the previous intermeeting period carried over into the first week of the current one, when the dollar temporarily breached Y140 and DM1.72 at the end of March. Thereafter, the dollar's advance lost momentum. Market participants questioned the near-term outlook for the major currencies given a number of uncertainties--first about the timing and the extent of United States economic recovery, second about developments in Germany and Japan, and more generally about official attitudes toward exchange rates. Yet, market sentiment remained biased toward the dollar and market professionals were wary of the possibility that it might renew its advance. Under these circumstances, the dollar fluctuated nervously and at times widely, showing somewhat more strength against the mark than against the yen, but little net change on balance over the period. The United States monetary authorities did not intervene during the period. Other major central banks did intervene, however, to sell a total of $2.6 billion in discrete episodes at the end of March, late April, and early May. A major preoccupation of the exchange markets during the period was the outlook for the United States economy. For a time after the Persian Gulf war, market participants believed that euphoria over the decisive victory would lead to a quick rebound in domestic spending and they shrugged off signs of economic weakness for the early months of 1991. But as data started to be released for the period since the war's end, market participants were anxious to find confirmation of their optimistic assessment of the United States outlook. Although forward-looking indicators improved markedly, other statistics did not suggest a swift recovery was underway. As more data became available, such as the employment data for March, some of the dollar optimism waned. Another factor influencing exchange markets during the period was the continuing uncertainty about developments affecting Germany. Market participants were getting increasingly reconciled to the harshness of the economic adjustments taking place in East Germany. As a result, German economic statistics that were released during the period seemed to have less of an effect on market psychology this time than they had had before. It was, instead, the political manifestation of growing dissatisfaction with the German leadership's handling of unification as well as the possible impact of a deteriorating political situation in the Soviet Union that attracted the market's attention during April. Ahead of a local election in Chancellor Kohl's home state on April 21 and following the defeat of the ruling Christian Democratic Party in that election, there was a particularly pronounced weakening of the mark against both the dollar and other currencies. The situation in Japan, the prospects for monetary policy there, and the outlook for renewed capital outflows from Japan also remained a source of uncertainty. For months market participants had been looking for signs that the Bank of Japan would soon relent from its tight monetary policy. To be sure, few had expected action so early in the new fiscal year that started in April. But the fact that the Bank of Japan officials kept up their anti-inflationary rhetoric and the central bank engaged in money market operations designed to hold interest rates firm kept hopes of some early ease in check and helped support the yen. At the same time, market participants were unsure what new strategies Japan's large institutional investors would be adopting this year and the prospect of some new outflows at times undermined the yen. Meanwhile, exchange market conditions themselves had been a source of uncertainty. Whereas few were surprised that the dollar had strengthened from its lows of mid-February, many questioned the scope for further significant gains from the levels reached in late March. Many market operators had been unprepared for the force of the rate move or the persistence of the dollar's advance. For those that followed so-called technical charts, the fact that the dollar had not fallen back appreciably during the course of the March rise was of particular concern. This lack of a ìtechnical correctionî presented two risks. Either the dollar would soon be vulnerable to a sizeable retrenchment or the dollar's recovery was so exceptional as to defy normal patterns of trading behavior or price movement and the currency would go higher still. It was in this context that the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of the Group of Seven were scheduled to meet in late April. The market's anxieties about developments in the three major industrialized countries and about exchange rates, together with talk of slowing economies elsewhere, gave rise to expectations during April that the G-7 communique would reveal some commitment to stem the dollar's rise, or at least to support the German mark, through intervention, coordinated interest rate moves, or both. One scenario that many market participants imagined might emerge from the discussions was that the United States and Japan would lower interest rates to relieve pressure on the Bundesbank to raise rates. Such an action was thought also to enhance the possibility that other G-7 countries might be able to lower rates to support their own economies. As long as a scenario like this one appeared realistic, bidding for dollars remained subdued. In the event, the G-7 meeting was seen in the market as providing little guidance about exchange rates and to have ended without a coordinated plan for interest rates. In the market's first reaction to the communiques, the dollar spurted up on April 29 to reach its high of the period against the mark at DM1.7835 before beginning to ease back. Then, on April 30, the Federal Reserve moved to lower the discount rate. Although market participants had recognized the possibility that the Fed might move one last time to jump-start the economy, they were surprised by the timing and the fact that a move occurred when there was no evidence of coordinated interest rate cuts abroad. The dollar therefore continued its tumble to DM1.6845. Thus, in just 46 hours the dollar dropped a full 10 pfennigs, or 5-1/2 percent. Since then, the dollar has been holding tentatively about halfway between these two extremes against the mark while starting to creep up again above Y139 against the yen. Japanese officials say they fear the yen to be vulnerable if the dollar were able to move convincingly above Y140. The Bank of Japan intervened in late March and again yesterday, both times when the dollar approached that level, to sell during the period. The Bundesbank continues to prefer to see the mark strong to help finance the reconstruction of East Germany in the most noninflationary way. As the dollar has recovered, Bundesbank officials have been anxious that a weak mark psychology not develop for fear that nominal interest rates might have to move even higher than they are now. For this reason, the Germans intervened in some size, selling in late March and in 3 days in which they operated after the local elections three weeks ago. The Bundesbank invited other European central banks to join and some did, selling an additional in March and in April. In March, we had indicated a willingness to be cooperative in coordinated interventions but these operations occurred during the European mornings, not during our trading session, so the question of our operating did not come up. In the latest episode, the Desk was not explicitly asked to follow up the German interventions with operations of our own in New York, and we did not see any reason to do so. This concludes my report, Mr. Chairman, on foreign exchange market developments. Just one last point, to bring the Committee up to date on other operations: The special swap facility between the Treasury, the National Bank of Romania and the Government of the Republic of Romania expired March 29. Thank you. 	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0
199105	10	GREENSPAN	 Questions for Ms. Greene? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the transactions? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199105	11	KOHN	 There is nothing to ratify. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0

199105	13	GREENSPAN	 No transactions. That's easy. Thank you. In that event, let's move on to the report of the Domestic Desk. Peter Sternlight. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199105	14	STERNLIGHT	 For several weeks.following the March meeting, the Desk sought to maintain the degree of reserve pressure desired since before that meeting, with Federal funds expected to trade around 6 percent. Then, following the April 30 reduction in the discount rate and the decision that half of that 50 basis point cut should be passed through to the funds rate, operations were conducted with an anticipation of funds trading around 5 3/4 percent. Consistent with this move, the borrowing allowance was raised by $25 million to encourage funds to be a shade above the new discount rate. The borrowing allowance was also boosted twice for technical reasons, each time by $25 million, once in mid-April and again in early May, in recognition of the typical rise in seasonal borrowing at this time of year. In all, the borrowing allowance was increased by $75 million to $200 million. Actual borrowing was in fact fairly steady over the period, averaging roughly in the $150 million area for each of the full maintenance periods and close to $170 million thus far in the current period. The funds rate also was fairly steady over the interval, compared with the volatile behavior earlier in the year and certainly as compared with the exceptional volatility around year-end. Following some mild pressures around the March quarter end that saw funds a little over 6 percent, funds then tended during much of April to sag a bit below the expected 6 percent rate. This appeared to reflect a combination of market anticipation of another easing step, and some persistent forecast misses on the reserve-adding side. For the most part, the market retained a clear perception of the central bank's expected equilibrium rate, but at one point when those market perceptions seemed to be wavering, we stepped in with some early-in-the day action to extract reserves and underscore the System's unchanged policy stance. When a policy shift was undertaken at the end of April it was readily communicated to the market by passing through some customer repurchase agreements to the market, just after the discount rate announcement and at a time when funds were trading somewhat below the previous expected equilibrium level. Since the end of April, funds have averaged close to the now desired 5 3/4 percent central point. Outright operations were modest during the period, and were concentrated in the early portion when the Desk arranged to buy about $1.4 billion of notes and $900 million of bills from foreign official accounts. Except for a modest redemption of agency issues, there was no outright transaction for the System after April 4. Reserve needs were more uncertain and changeable than usual, a background that lends itself to very short term injections or extractions of central bank money. Uncertainties about the Treasury balance were a particular source of short-term changeability in the outlook, while the behavior of currency and required reserves also contributed. Relatively heavy use was made of short-term matched sale-purchase transactions to absorb reserves in small measured doses. These were arranged in the market on fifteen separate occasions. Repurchase agreements to provide reserves temporarily were executed on ten occasions, five times for the System, and five for customer related accounts (including an entry today). Short-term interest rates generally declined over the intermeeting period, in many cases by somewhat more than the perceived 25 basis point cut in the expected Fed funds rate. The economy was seen as still declining, though perhaps getting near a bottom, while inflation measures reported during the period moderated considerably from those seen earlier in the year. Against this background, a good part of the rate decline came before the April 30 discount rate cut and perceived Fed funds reduction. Over the period, Treasury bill rates came down by about 20 to 40 basis points, with the larger declines for shorter maturities. In yesterday's auctions, the 3- and 6-month issues sold at average discount rates of 5.50 and 5.63 percent, respectively, compared with 5.86 and 5.84 percent just before the last meeting. The Treasury paid down a net of some $35 billion in the bill market during the period, including the maturity of $12 billion in cash management bills. A paydown is typical at this time because of heavy seasonal tax receipts. About halfway through the period, though, the amount of bills offered at the weekly auctions began to rise steeply as the Treasury needed to recoup its cash in the face of a heavy underlying deficit. There is a widespread expectation that the weekly auction amount will soon be back to the $20 billion level prevailing earlier, and it may have to go considerably beyond that point. Paralleling the decline in bill rates, the rates on commercial paper, acceptances and market-traded CDs fell about 35 to 45 basis points over the period. Meantime, as bank funding costs slipped, major banks lowered their prime rates by 1/2 percent to 8 1/2 percent the day after the discount rate cut. In the intermediate and longer term markets the story was more mixed. Most rates declined, but less than in the short end, and longer term Treasury issues were about unchanged to up several basis points in yield over the period. For much of the intermeeting period, though, long Treasury yields were somewhat lower than at its start, especially after the weak employment report in early April and the improved price numbers toward the middle of that month. There was, in fact, considerable anticipation in the market around mid-April that the continuing signs of recession and better inflation news would spur a further policy easing--and even a little speculation that such a step might be underway as the funds rates tended to sag. The Desk's aggressive reserve draining move on April 15 was seen as a signal that policy was still on hold, and while this tended to back up short-term rates a bit, it had, if anything, a somewhat supportive effect at the long end as it seemed, to some, to underline the Fed's anti-inflationary resolve. Other observers, though, tended to focus on a spate of press articles and market letter commentaries that speculated on differences of views among Federal Reserve officials, suggesting policy gridlock. Meantime, there was also a growing focus on the sheer size of oncoming supply, particularly as the Treasury's mid-quarter financing approached, as these quarterly events generally draw attention not only to the immediate financing need but to over-all needs for the next several months. As these needs were re-evaluated, there was a sense that the recent respite in Treasury needs, thanks to seasonal tax inflows, slack RTC activity, and Desert Storm receipts, was ending--to be followed by reassertion of the heavy underlying deficit. The bond market was surprised by the timing of the April 30 discount rate announcement and accompanying Fed funds reduction, although not really surprised by the substance of the move given ongoing evidence of additional (even if abating) weakness in the economy and recently better price reports. Many observers had thought that after all the articles on policy differences a move would await an accumulation of more evidence on the economy and prices. Some ascribed the timing to the just-concluded G-7 meeting or to Administration pressures. Still, the long end took the news of a move reasonably well in stride, reacting on balance in a mildly positive manner--though without enthusiasm. The System's policy move was followed just a day later by the Treasury's financing announcement which covered not only the record-sized $37 billion May refunding, but also provided official estimates of Treasury net cash needs for the current and following quarters--$40 billion and $110-115 billion, respectively--numbers that were generally to the high side of market expectations. Initially, the market seemed a bit complacent about the heavy needs, but the April employment report released a couple of days later, with its less than expected decline in payrolls and surprising dip in the unemployment rate, reminded participants that heavy financings could be more of a problem in a recovering economy. In the just completed mid-quarter financing, bidding was reasonably good for the 3-year note, very strong for the 10- year note, but weak for the 30-year bond--perhaps because the success of the first two legs generated some complacency or encouraged yields to edge off to a level where underlying retail demand was skimpy relative to the huge size being offered. At first, on being announced last Thursday, the weak bond auction results seemed to be accepted calmly, possibly in anticipation of a good PPI number the next day, but a more negative reaction set in on Friday, perhaps due partly to rumors about an insurance company's junk bond problems, and the new bond's yield rose about 12 basis points on that day alone. After some recovery yesterday, bond prices are down again today, apparently in reaction to a sizable upward revision in March retail sales. The new long bond now yields about 8.35 percent compared with its 8.21 percent auction average. For the full period, as noted, yields on long-term Treasury maturities were about unchanged to up several basis points, the 5-year area was about 5 basis points lower and the 2 to 3 year range about 20-25 basis points lower. In all, the Treasury raised about $37 1/2 billion in coupon issues over the intermeeting period, about half of that in the mid-quarter financing that settles tomorrow. Away from Treasury issues, other long-term markets tended to fare somewhat better, with quality spreads continuing to narrow from the high levels encountered late last year and through the year-end period. A number of bank holding companies have been able to float debt on much more favorable terms than seemed possible just a couple of months ago. In general, the corporate supply has been fairly brisk, but it appears that much of the new issuance is for refinancing of various sorts while net new capital demands remain slack. As for current market expectations about policy, with the latest move still so recent, few if any observers look for a further step very soon. Some would suggest that with recovery likely to show up within a few months there may be no need for additional stimulus. Others, probably a little larger group, would still anticipate a modest further easing, either because an upturn is still so uncertain or because they believe it will be relatively feeble, and price pressures sufficiently quiescent as to justify another step. 	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0

199105	17	STERNLIGHT	 It was quite strong in the 3-year, rather modest in the 10-year, and about average in the [30-year] bond. The bond had really light coverage. I think the major deficiency there was domestic demand; customer demand was really on the light side. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0

199105	20	STERNLIGHT	 There was, as you note, a botched bid; but it still would have been quite light coverage. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0

199105	31	STERNLIGHT	 I'm a little surprised at the extent of it. I think the big widening of spreads occurred, and particularly got exacerbated, during that somewhat scary year-end period when some genuine systemic concerns were beginning to emerge. As it was clear that we were getting through that period and that the economy was, though in a downturn, not in utter collapse, I think there was reason to expect there would be some narrowing. So, the fact of some narrowing shouldn't be any surprise; but the extent of it has been a little more than I would have predicted. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199105	32	KOHN	 On the index I'm looking at, which is the Merrill Lynch index, although the spreads have narrowed by 4 percentage points from their highs around the end of the year, as Peter said, they are ﻿ back to where they were in the first half of 1990.

199105	33	KEEHN	 Peter, the 30-year Treasury rate, which seems to be going in the wrong direction, is hard to judge. What is the market's view on this? Is this a supply issue--just a very heavy volume of financing coming to market for [unintelligible]--or is this inflationary expectations? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	35.0
199105	34	STERNLIGHT	 It's very hard to sort out. I think both of those factors are there. President Keehn. Recently the most potent concern has been just the sheer supply. But lurking in the background there is concern not so much about a lot of inflation expected but of recovery expected and concern that there will be more competing demands for long-term financing. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199105	35	GREENSPAN	 Any other questions for Peter? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199105	36	HOSKINS	 I just have a short one for Peter. The Bluebook indicates that the [funds] rate traded low because of market expectations. And I was wondering if you were having trouble signaling to the market. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
199105	37	STERNLIGHT	 There was that one occasion when the funds rate was sagging in mid-April and there was even some speculation beginning to build up that we were deliberately being tolerant of lower rates, and we thought it was good just to clear up those misperceptions by going in early one day. And I think the market got that message quite clearly on that occasion. Through virtually all the rest of the period the market seemed pretty clear in its perception of what they thought we basically were aiming for. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0

199105	42	GREENSPAN	 Without objection. Let's now move on to Mike Prell. 	11	11	1.0	1.0	47.0
199105	43	PRELL	 Thank you. Mr. Chairman. The most obvious change in the staff's forecast since the last meeting is that we've cut our prediction of second-quarter GNP growth from 2 percent to zero. I want to focus my remarks on where we think we went wrong in our earlier projection and why we still think a solid, if unspectacular, recovery is imminent. I perhaps should say that it isn't entirely clear that we were wrong about the second-quarter upturn; information on the current quarter is scant, and GNP yet could turn out to be as strong as we forecast in March. But that certainly didn't look like a good bet to us last week, and it still doesn't, given the latest data. This morning's retail sales report was stronger than we anticipated, with April showing only a slight decline and March being revised upward by a substantial amount. But when we scrutinize the details and consider possible offsets through higher imports, lower inventories, or weaker sales reports in later months, the surprise doesn't appear great enough to nudge us up by more than a few tenths of a percent on GNP growth. A conservative reaction to these data in assessing consumption trends may also be suggested by the figures for auto sales in the first 10 days of May. We don't have all the data yet, but it looks like sales of new domestic cars and light trucks were in line with our expectation of only a moderate rebound from the April's low pace. In the March Greenbook, we anticipated that employment would be bottoming out about now and that industrial activity would be rising-- not rapidly, but still significantly. The question is whether we were just off by a month or so in our timing or whether something has gone off track more fundamentally that has important implications for the outlook over the next few quarters. One approach to answering that question is to pinpoint some of the key factors that led us to lower our near-term forecast. A significant part of that markdown story clearly is the lack of a pickup in auto sales. The consequent more moderate rise in motor vehicle assemblies has chipped almost a percentage point from our prior second-quarter GNP gain. The sluggishness of auto sales may, in turn, be related to the disappointing performance of personal income. Weak employment data cut into estimated labor income in the first quarter, and with interest rates falling, interest income has fallen, too. Consumers actually spent more in the first quarter than we had expected they would, but in doing so they left themselves with less savings than we anticipated and thus with less wherewithal for second-quarter spending. Moreover, the decline in hours worked in April means that wage and salary income probably didn't improve much in that month. So, even with today's retail sales report, we'd expect a much smaller gain in consumer spending than we projected in March. On the business side, also, near-term spending prospects look weaker than we expected they would at this point. To be sure, capital outlays usually lag turns in overall economic activity, but in this instance there were were reasons for thinking that the revival might come a little sooner than usual--outside of commercial construction, that is. For one thing, we don't have to unwind a late-cycle surge in spending of the sort we've seen in some earlier expansions and, for another, there is a sense among businessmen that investment in up-to-date equipment is essential for survival, especially in the tradable goods sector. Moreover, there was the thought that the uncertainty associated with the war had led to a temporary postponement of orders-- orders that would flood in shortly after that special uncertainty lifted. These notions still have their adherents among industry analysts, but the fact is that the March figures for nondefense capital goods were, to use a technical term, crummy, and the more recent anecdotal and survey information has not pointed convincingly to any big bounceback. Things thus seem to be proceeding in a fairly normal cyclical fashion in the equipment sector. While we expect real fixed investment to fall less than it did in the first quarter, outside of computers and motor vehicles the decline is still very sizable. So, given these disappointments with respect to the second quarter, why do we still think that substantial growth in economic activity is just around the corner? The story is in large measure a familiar one in terms of traditional business cycle reasons. The first point is that housing seems to be turning around, in response to lower interest rates. The data could be clearer on this score, and perhaps they will be in the next week or two. But the overwhelming impression is that home sales are up, stocks of unsold homes are dwindling, and starts are beginning to rise. The second reason for looking for a firming in activity is the inventory cycle. Our assessment is that, unless final demand for goods turns out appreciably weaker than we've already built into the forecast for the current quarter, we're going to see a third straight quarter of substantial inventory liquidation--all of this coming despite what appeared to be relatively lean stocks when the recession began. It's been said many times that lean inventories can suddenly look less so when there is an unanticipated drop in sales, and the drop since last summer has pushed stock to sales ratios in a few sectors up to uncomfortable levels. But our view is that these excess inventories are being cleaned out, and at some point production must move back in line with final sales. We think that will happen gradually over the coming months, with a slower pace of inventory decumulation in the third quarter and a modest accumulation in the fourth; however, we can already see some of this occurring now in motor vehicles, with lower stocks permitting a step-up in production that is having positive side-effects on a broad range of supplier industries. There may also be some hints of a similar process beginning in the industries associated with housing. Stronger homebuilding and an end to inventory decumulation have been key factors in past recoveries and we expect they will be this time. With those drags on activity removed, employment and income growth should resume, and this should support expanded consumer spending. In due course, we expect to see equipment spending turn around as well. These domestic demand forces should more than offset the projected loss of impetus from the external sector. What could go wrong? There is no shortage of candidates around today. Financial constraints loom large in many minds, and we do not take them lightly. Monetary policy, despite the easing steps to date, conceivably could still be too tight. For those so inclined, the April money stock deceleration might be a worrisome sign, and real interest rates certainly have been lower in the past. In addition, one cannot dismiss the concerns that neither households nor businesses, in the aggregate, are well positioned in terms of their balance sheets to spend freely. And, of course, there are the unusual problems of financial intermediaries, which may limit their capacity to provide credit. I won't take the time to offer the counterarguments to these points. I think that we have given them their due in this forecast; along with the commercial real estate overhang and the limits on government spending, they have played a role in our projection that the recovery will be rather subdued by historical standards. Our forecast contains risks on the upside, too. As we've noted before, unanticipated areas of strength have a way of cropping up in cyclical recoveries. It is still possible, for example, that business investment will turn around more quickly and strongly than we have anticipated. Or it may be that our trade position will continue its pattern of surprisingly strong improvement, owing to long-lagged effects of the earlier dollar depreciation on the location of facilities, or on the development of export programs and marketing channels. All things considered, even though our forecast for the next year or so probably is to the high side of the current consensus, we do think it reflects a reasonable balancing of risks. Finally, a word about the inflation outlook. This morning's 0.2 percent increases in the overall CPI and in the ex food and energy component were close to what we were expecting and provide further confirmation of our view that we are experiencing a significant disinflationary payoff from the slack that has emerged in the labor and product markets. We see employment rising only gradually this summer, as businesses attempt to meet additional demand at first through longer workweeks and greater productivity; consequently, unemployment is likely to remain in the high 6s for some months. If growth moderates in 1992, as we've projected, it should be possible to sustain a clear downtrend in inflation through the year. 	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
199105	44	GREENSPAN	 Questions for Mr. Prell? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199105	45	SYRON	 Mike, on inventories: What do you make, if anything, of these stories that we have a smaller number of retail outlets for any given volume of sales and that there is a secular downtrend in this? Is that something worth paying attention to? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	51.0
199105	46	PRELL	" Well. I've made the argument for a long time now as I've looked at the trend of inventory-sales ratios in retailing. I've looked at the enormous growth in floor space in retailing and the many shopping malls that have opened up. We have developed an awful ﻿ lot of stores. Each one of them has some inventory. They have clearly moved beyond the point of adequate returns and we're seeing an industry shakeout. And in the course of that shakeout we probably will have some consolidation over time and some movement down in inventory-sales ratios. That's a very macro sort of view of the process. But clearly retailers have moved to try to capitalize on computerization and some of these other [techniques] such as ""just-in- time"" deliveries. They should be doing better on inventories than they seem to have done, and maybe this is part of the story. "	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199105	47	SYRON	 What makes it a little hard to tell exactly is the lack of some abstract notion that targets what the inventory-sales ratio is and how far we are-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	51.0
199105	48	PRELL	 We still don't hear a lot of complaints that inventories are uncomfortably heavy. On the other hand, the profits aren't there. Something is out of kilter. I think this excess capacity in the industry is reflecting part of the excess stock of consumer goods on the shelves. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199105	49	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199105	50	PARRY	 One of the reasons for weakness in the second quarter is the pickup in nonfarm inventory liquidation. If you look at what we know in terms of sales and industrial production, which is admittedly very sketchy, do you think it's possible or would you say more likely now that we could actually see the pattern that seemed to be developing in the first quarter continuing in the second? That is, could actual inventory liquidation turn out to be less in the second quarter than in the first? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
199105	51	PRELL	 Well, I think you put your finger on the problem in saying anything with any great conviction at this point: We don't have much data. We've looked at orders to try to see beyond the data for recent months that we have on industrial production. We don't know a great deal about the flow coming in from abroad or going out from current production; that's an unknown. We basically reached this conclusion as one that was consistent with what we thought plausible as a final demand picture and what we sensed was going on in terms of production. Also, I think there is certainly in some sectors a desire to achieve lower inventory levels. And, as I've noted, this is the third successive quarter of substantial inventory liquidation. For a recession that we entered with supposedly pretty lean positions, we're ending up in total absolute dimensions with an inventory liquidation that's pretty much in the ballpark of previous cycles--not relative to GNP but simply in '82 dollar terms. So, maybe there is some upside risk, but I don't think there's a great desire to accumulate inventories at this time. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199105	52	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199105	53	STERN	 Is there something unusual in what we're seeing in personal income? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	41.0
199105	54	PRELL	 I don't think this is greatly atypical. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199105	55	SLIFMAN	 Relative to what is happening to GNP, this is not atypical. In other words-- ﻿ 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199105	56	PARRY	 But GNP has been strong. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
199105	57	SLIFMAN	 The falloff in GNP. assuming our forecast is right, would be about half the typical peak-to-trough decline in GNP. But if you look at the ratio, say, of personal income to GNP. that ratio has its own cyclical pattern. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199105	58	PRELL	 And we may not be getting, overall, the kind of cushion we did in some cycles in terms of the government sector. But I don't think there's a gross disparity here. We were disappointed, as I noted, in the first quarter; much of the surprise was in data revisions. Some of it seems quite plausible to us. Previously, the interest income figure seemed to be holding up more than appeared reasonable in light of what was happening to interest rates. So now we've had a significant reduction in interest income in the figures for the early part of this year. It's reasonably sensible. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199105	59	GREENSPAN	 They calculate that interest income in a very simplistic manner. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199105	60	PRELL	 Well, of course, they use the very best data that are available: our flow-of-funds accounts! 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199105	61	GREENSPAN	" Any further questions for Mike? If not, can we have our ""tour de table""? Who wants to start off? Si. "	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199105	62	PRELL	 Let me correct something. We did have some numbers and I blanked out on this. We're getting more DPI decline in this recession than on average in prior recessions. That's what I had in the back of my mind, but then I was thinking no other data I had seen looked different from that. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199105	63	PARRY	 Again, is that relative to the GNP decline? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
199105	64	PRELL	 Yes, especially since this is a lesser GNP decline, 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199105	65	GREENSPAN	 Who would like to start? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199105	66	KEEHN	" Mr. Chairman, conditions in the District remain unchanged from the last meeting. You will remember that having come through the early phases somewhat better than other areas of the country, the data have now caught up with us, and the current level of activity in the Midwest, I think, is very much reflective of national conditions or already perhaps even a little weaker. There may be some tentative signs of improvement, but nothing specific to suggest that we have reached a turning point. I think you can tell from Mike's comments, and it's certainly true in the District, that the critical area of focus is the auto industry. Our District will not show a real-side improvement until we see a sustained pickup in the level of retail auto sales. With the first and second quarters essentially complete now, the 1991 model year really has been a big disappointment. The forecast of total sales for the full year was being pulled down to 12-1/2 to 13 million units and even that reduced level is quite dependent upon having a good improvement in sales in the third and fourth quarters. And though car inventories at the retail level are really quite low at ﻿ this point, the dealers are still reducing their orders substantially. At the time of the last meeting I reported that orders by retail dealers were in excess of or within the sales level. That has turned around. The dealers have turned quite negative and are ordering cars at about 80 percent of the current sales level, and that's, of course, very unusual for this time of the year. In part, the dealer attitudes are based on the fact that many of them are losing money; at this point something like 50 percent of the dealers are in loss positions. Despite this, given the seasonal factors of course, production in the second quarter is going to be up quite a bit from the very depressed levels in the first quarter. Still, that higher level of production will be substantially under the production levels of the second quarter of last year. But because of this shift between the first and second quarters, in a production sense the industry is going to be less of a drag on GNP than it was in the first quarter; indeed, it might have something of a positive effect. As a final comment on the auto industry, I certainly would say that the enormous first-quarter losses that the Big Three experienced have cast a big pall on the Detroit area. Many of the other sectors of the District are impacted by the auto situation. In the steel business, for example, one of the CEOs was telling me that his business was, in his term, ""rotten."" They currently are operating at about 70 percent of capacity. The forecast of shipments for the year has been reduced from 85 million tons last year to 76-77 million tons this year. And of that reduced level, about 20 percent is going into the export markets; of course, those sales have very little margin, so there's not very much profit there. Other suppliers of the auto industry are equally hard pressed. Some of the other parts of the District also are having a fairly weak time of it. Construction activity, for example, continues to fade. Construction contract awards are off very substantially from last year; through March the awards level is something like 26 percent under last year's level. And people in the concrete business say that they are experiencing something of a free fall. More positively [for prices], though, the news in the agricultural sector is really quite good, mainly because of a reduced level of exports. Corn and wheat prices are under [downward] pressure; that's going to hold down farm income. Nonetheless, I think in an inflationary sense that ought to be good. Due to heavy rains-- we have had a lot of rain in the Midwest--planting is about 10 days late'. But this is really a good problem, not a bad problem. People I talk to say that the planting conditions really are excellent. And while it's certainly far too early to judge the outlook for crop production, at least at this point it looks pretty good. Also positively on the inflation front, based on my talking to people, I think the price outlook is continuing to improve. Competitive conditions in the marketplace are awfully tough. Price increases are just very, very difficult to sustain. And people who keep track of their raw material purchases say that they are experiencing very little price increases on raw material purchases . The CEOs, looking ahead, still don't have any expectations that they're going to experience a very big price escalation. Net, while in a national context we may well be reaching a turning point, certainly we don't yet see it in the District. From ﻿ our perspective within the District an improvement is going to be very dependent on the auto sector--an improved level of sales following the end of the model year production--and also an increase in exports. Certainly at this point both of these objectives seem agonizingly elusive. "	13	13	1.0	1.0	35.0
199105	67	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199105	68	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman. I think the staff's downward revision in their projection of real GNP for the second quarter makes sense in light of the incoming information. More generally, the overall profile that they've predicted for the next three or four quarters strikes us as eminently reasonable given the staff's policy assumptions, the behavior of most of the leading indicators, and the pattern of recent anecdotal information. It's interesting to me how close the projections of the staff are to those of the private economy. Mike suggested theirs were a bit stronger, but it seems to me they are remarkably close, which is something that many people might view with alarm given the record of forecasters in the past. I might be one of those except that I believe they're about right on this. And I believe that the risk of error is about equal on the up side and on the down side. I guess the most important question we ought to ask ourselves is: How great is the risk that we will have a big error on the down side? In other words, how likely is it that we will get a significantly greater decline in the current quarter than the staff expects and that this will be followed perhaps by a greater decline in the third quarter? Obviously, we can't rule that out entirely; but in the absence of some totally unlikely, unexpected negative supply shocks such as we had last August, the probability of that kind of decline seems to me to be pretty low. We've already taken out a lot of insurance to prevent such a thing happening, with the cumulative policy actions over the last six months or so. And beyond that, we're now seeing new signs of life in residential construction, strength in the stock market and some of the other leading indicators, and a recent upturn in the National Association of Purchasing Managers' index, which was higher in April than it was in the lowest quarter trough of any previous full economic upturn. So, those all suggest to me that we are probably now very near the bottom of a recession. Whether it's going to be longer or whether it's a near trough, I don't know. But it seems to me that a significant further weakening is decidedly unlikely. I was particularly glad to see that the staff has reduced its inflation forecast because I have felt for some time that we had followed a very wise policy [course of] action and that it would pay off in terms of inflation numbers. The staff has cut a couple of notches off the inflation projections for both this year and next year and they're now predicting a core rate of inflation of about 3 percent at the end of 1992. And I think we ought to have at least that degree of progress against inflation. But it is important that we keep in mind what the staff has assumed when it made these projections, and that is that we'll come very close to achieving the midpoint of our target range for M2. I think it's critically important that we take whatever steps are required to keep M2 somewhat in that range in case the recovery and consequently the money demand turns out to be somewhat stronger than it now appears to us that it might be. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
199105	69	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. ﻿ 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199105	70	FORRESTAL	 Well, Mr. Chairman, activity in the Atlanta District is generally the same as in the rest of the country as a whole, although I must say that the business people I've spoken to recently are somewhat less pessimistic than they were six weeks ago. In the immediate Atlanta metropolitan area, the sentiment has gotten a big boost by the announcements from UPS and Holiday Inn that they are moving corporate headquarters there as well as the awarding of the fighter aircraft contract to Lockheed. The most positive event that has happened is that there have been significant increases in sales of single-family homes in the last several weeks. On the retail side, consistent with the report we had this morning, retailers in the District are reporting a pickup in sales in March but activity in April fell off and was below their expectations. Tourism, too, has picked up as well as convention bookings in the District, and that is interesting to note, too. Foreign visitors are beginning to come into the area again after the Persian Gulf situation; that's particularly true in Florida. In the manufacturing area, orders are still fairly weak, employment levels continue to be reduced, and capital expenditures are still being postponed by most business people that we talk to. Exports from the District have also been weak; some are attributing that to weaker growth abroad. But I think another factor to be taken into account is that military shipments from the District ports displaced regular shipments; that probably accounts for some decrease in that export activity. The agricultural area is quite mixed. Crop production probably will be lower this year but fruit, vegetable, and livestock should be higher. Si mentioned the rains; we've also had heavy rains almost throughout the entire District and that has delayed planting in practically every state. All of the states in the District have been hit, as have many others of course, by revenue shortfalls. Up until now in our District the legislatures have resisted any major tax increases. But if we don't get a turnaround in the economy fairly soon, I think most of the states in our District are going to have to look at major tax increases next year. The credit crunch seems to be about the same as it was at the time of our last meeting; that is to say there really doesn't seem to be much change in the standards that the banks are applying. The problem, according to most bankers, is on the demand side. There just isn't a great deal of demand for loans. Price increases, as someone else mentioned, are minimal if not nonexistent; and that seems to be what is expected over the next several months. Looking at the national economy, we've lowered our forecast since the last meeting. We're somewhat weaker in both '91 and '92 compared to the Greenbook, but not appreciably. We have both consumption and exports weaker and as a result our unemployment is a bit higher. But we also show a little better success on the inflation side; our inflation number is a bit lower. I think the risks in the forecast are more symmetric now than they were several weeks ago-- certainly more symmetric than they were earlier. I have been saying right along that I thought the risks were on the down side; I'm not so sure that they're completely on the down side now. But, and I think Bob Black was alluding to this, the costs of missing are really not symmetric at all. That is to say, it seems to me that the costs involved in overshooting the forecast are not very high, given the present levels of capacity and unemployment. But if the economy turns ﻿ out to be weaker than the forecast, then I think the costs would be very, very high indeed. Obviously, we need to take that into account as we set our policy recommendations. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	39.0
199105	71	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199105	72	PARRY	 Mr. Chairman, the Twelfth District employment statistics have become a bit weaker since our last meeting, although the District as a whole continues to outperform the rest of the nation. In March only the state of Arizona reported a month-to-month gain in employment in our District. However, the declines in the District's other states follow several months of relatively robust employment growth. Employment levels still are between 1.6 and 4.8 percent higher than they were a year ago in District states other than California. And that would compare, I think, to a fall of about 1.2 percent in the rest of the nation. California's economy has slowed with the nation. Since last July employment has fallen nearly every month; in April the state posted its first year-over-year decline in the level of employment which was down 0.4 of a percent. Durable goods employment continues to fall, led by declines in aerospace and electronics. I think some of our losses were gains in the Atlanta District. Construction employment has fallen to a level about 8 percent less than it was a year ago but, interestingly, real estate sales and prices have picked up. As a matter of fact, the median price of residential real estate in California is now above its previous peak. The effects of California's economic slowdown, combined with growing structural problems in the state's budget, have resulted in a projected $12.6 billion deficit by the end of the next fiscal year. Tax receipts have been low for rather obvious reasons: weak sales, weak consumer spending, and also unexpectedly low corporate and bank profits. At the same time, case loads in the health area, welfare, and especially at prisons have risen sharply, and mandatory cost-of- living adjustments have further increased required expenditures. At the same time Governor Wilson has proposed [reducing] the deficit through a 1.5 cent sales tax increase--the tax right now is 6 percent or higher based upon some local initiatives--elimination of all COLAs on programs, and shifting some state services to the counties, although no one can figure out where the counties are going to get the money to finance this. Where this will all end up is difficult to say because the governor is adamant about not changing income taxes. As far as the national outlook is concerned, our view is not very different from that of the Greenbook. We have slightly slower economic growth and a bit less inflation. We expect the economy to be roughly flat in the current quarter and then we think real growth probably will average somewhere in the 3 to 3-1/2 percent range in the second half, which is a little weaker actually than the Greenbook. Next year, we look for growth to slow a bit to 2-1/2 to 3 percent. It's clear that the main sources of expansion should be the easing of monetary policy, which President Black referred to, a gradual improvement in consumer and business confidence, and a pickup in inventory investment. It also seems quite obvious that the recent rise in the dollar and slower economic growth abroad are going to limit the contribution to growth that will be coming from the foreign sector. In view of the slack in the economy and also the lower oil ﻿ prices and the higher dollar, we would expect inflation as measured by the CPI to decline next year to about the 3 to 3-1/2 percent range. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
199105	73	GREENSPAN	 President McTeer. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199105	74	MCTEER	 With regard to the national economy, we have no quarrel with the Greenbook forecast. For the Eleventh District, we have been right at the top of the Districts in terms of maintenance of employment levels. As a matter of fact, we were probably number one until a couple of months ago; I believe about a month ago the Kansas City District overtook us. But now we're beginning to experience a decline in employment and a rise in unemployment rates. Many of our local unemployment rates are now at or above the national average. The strongest data in our District are in Texas, particularly the Houston and the Gulf Coast areas. Petrochemicals and energy seem to be helping them a little. The impression we get from our directors is that growth is positive but barely so. Borrowers in our District believe that the credit crunch is very real; they always have and still do. Generally, bankers have been telling us that there is just not good credit demand. The Texas Bankers Association did a poll the other day and the majority of them said there was a credit crunch and that it was all the regulators' fault that it existed. State finances are tight, too, and Texas is beginning to talk about an income tax. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	53.0
199105	75	GREENSPAN	 President Syron. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199105	76	SYRON	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The economy in New England is very poor, with few spots showing improvement; [there are some exceptions], primarily housing. Perhaps most disturbing is that I think this may have to do with just getting further into a recession; an enveloping feeling of gloom has affected everything. And I see that it spreads further down in the Northeast, actually. As other people have noted, we too have continued problems with state and local governments. If anything, the estimates of the deficits on a state-by-state basis are increasing and increasing in a fairly significant way. which will absolutely necessitate significant tax increases. The retail situation, however, is a little mixed. Durables are not good; autos in particular are very soft, although nondurables have picked up somewhat. Some mail order houses particularly have noted a pickup in demand; a lot of that is probably [goods] sold out of the District. Interestingly, consistent with improving their margins, some [chains]--and we still have to see how this will work out --actually are charging for postage on catalogues. Commercial real estate continues to decline. As I mentioned, housing has picked up a bit for first-time [buyer] units, which in our District at this stage of the game are homes whose prices total less than about $200,000. Manufacturers seem to have become quite pessimistic even in the computer area where things have picked up a little nationally. Suppliers to the auto industry and to the aerospace industry are quite pessimistic. Interestingly, we have several defense contractors some of whom--for example, ﻿ --also have a significant part of their business in the commercial sector, and they have said that on balance any improvement they got on the defense side was washed away by the regular civilian side. They still see this long-term reduction in restructuring on the defense side. Prices, consistent with all this, continue to be pretty well behaved. Our lenders are quite cautious. Even a couple of our largest banks will say, essentially, that they are not lending unless it's extremely good credit. Others that are in a little better shape will tell you that they just are concerned about the loan quality coming in. But universally they are seeing very, very little in loan demand. As a consequence, they just don't want money. I think this is related to what is going on in the monetary aggregates. Some institutions that have had potential customers come to them are really lowering their offering rates quite a lot. Those are people coming from institutions that are closing or have capital [problems] and from others that don't feel they need any money. I'm not quite sure how one factors this into evaluating the situation, but at least in New England--and I suspect more so nationally as well--this issue of restructuring that we've talked a lot about both in financial services and manufacturing, and what is happening in inventories and in state and local governments, does make a situation in which one has to look at the employment numbers at least somewhat skeptically as we go forward. Once managers get into this process of feeling that they can have the same level of output and maintain their margins by reducing costs if not increasing sales, they discover all kinds of opportunities that I think they're going to exploit for some time to come. I was struck by talking to several people who were saying that there's still more to do here and that they are discovering new opportunities. One interesting story that fits with what is going on in inventories--showing that this is again a two-sided sword--is that we talked to an off-price discounter who indicated that business was horrible but the reason business was horrible wasn't so much that the demand in the stores was horrible; it was because manufacturers had maintained their inventories more carefully and he wasn't able to pick up the volume of distress sale goods that he could before. Nationally, I find the Greenbook forecast very plausible on a center-weighted basis. One would really have to nitpick to find fault with it. It is more useful to ask what the risks are. I would think that in a very, very marginal sense the risks might be slightly on the down side; I see the third quarter falling into the same pattern as the second quarter conceivably, typically because of concerns about exports. But I do think--and this goes back to what Bob Forrestal said--that one needs to look at the risks of the outcome, if you will, not just the risk of something happening. If we were to get much further deterioration than we expect, that could be fairly difficult to deal with given the problems that we have in some sectors. On the other hand, one has to be very encouraged by at least the forecasted improvement in prices that we see. It really would be tragic to throw that away. So, I think it's very hard to be sure of the outlook at this point, which makes it extremely important to follow the data that continue to come in very, very closely. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	51.0
199105	77	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. ﻿ 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199105	78	STERN	 Mr. Chairman, I would continue to characterize conditions in the District as mixed, but overall not bad. Agriculture is looking pretty good. The key word there, as usual, is moisture, and in much of the District it now appears to be adequate this year. The livestock sector is really doing very well, as it has over the past several years as well. In the paper industry and the forest products industry, again, conditions are mixed. There is a lot of excess capacity at the moment in paper and even more coming on [stream], but the profits aren't there. But that's a business where they tend to run at capacity almost no matter what, and they're still running at capacity, at least in our District. The wood products business has come back a bit, and that's probably a consequence of an inventory cycle and maybe some optimism about the outlook for homebuilding. Clearly, housing sales have picked up substantially, certainly in the Twin Cities. It's my understanding that not only are houses selling but they are selling at pretty close to asking prices without any fancy financing so far as I can tell. On retail sales, once again I haven't heard any horror stories. Some people say business is tough and some say it's satisfactory, and that seems to be about the way that has been holding. Only one state in the District has a significant budget problem with which they have not yet come to grips. I don't know at this juncture what the pieces of that resolution might turn out to be. With regard to the national outlook, I'm pretty comfortable with the Greenbook forecast. I also think, as several people have commented, that it pays to reflect on the risks a bit at this juncture. The risks are probably symmetric in the sense that while a recovery by midyear is likely. I do think we're going to need to see a good deal more consumer spending. In that regard, I have been under the impression, and Mike confirmed it, that perhaps disposable income has been somewhat weaker than I would have expected throughout this contraction, and that is certainly a source of concern in my mind. On the other hand, as to the risks on the inflation side, I find the recent data encouraging and most of the anecdotal reports I'm getting encouraging as well. But I must say I'm not persuaded yet that we have nailed down a significant reduction in the core rate of inflation. I'm a little puzzled as to why the bond market has not responded at this juncture, not just to the inflation news but to the overall picture of what is happening domestically and abroad. And I wonder if we don't have to be a little sensitive to that. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	41.0

199105	82	BOEHNE	" In the District, the signals are mixed but on balance I think the overall District economy is still down like that for the nation. As in the nation, commercial real estate and retail sales are generally negative. There are some indications that manufacturing is beginning to bottom out. The only clear area of upturn is in home sales. Loan demand is still weak. Bankers say that there isn't demand; the business people--or some of them, anyway--say that the bankers won't lend. With regard to state and local ﻿ governments, Philadelphia is about to go broke; the states have deficits. So, I think that situation is fairly general. I would say the attitudes vary from cautious optimism, with more emphasis on ""cautious"" than ""optimism,"" to a lot of concern on the part of business people about when a recovery will occur and what kind will occur. I find more people who are just about writing off 1991 as a bad year and they are beginning to look to 1992. I sense, and I don't think it's particularly unusual at this stage of the business cycle, a dichotomy now between those who analyze the economy and those who manage it. I think most of those who analyze the economy see signs that the economy is beginning to pick up, whereas those people who have annual meetings to chair--whether they want to downsize the company another notch or they are going to meet the financial analysts--want to be reassured that there really is a recovery out there; they don't really yet feel it in their bones. We're at a fairly critical period in that, if we don't begin to see some tangible evidence on a broader base that we are indeed going to get a recovery, we could see confidence really drop off and we might have a double-dip in terms of the downturn. I do subscribe to the notion that the economy is going to pick up, but I think we're playing with some tender attitudes out there. I would say that the risks are probably even to maybe marginally on the down side. But I [agree with] those who are concerned about the outcome. If we don't get a recovery or if it's postponed. I think there will be some real costs and it will be quite difficult to try to get the economy turned around. On the inflation side, my sense is that financial markets may be somewhat behind in appreciating what is going on in most of the economy. We're making better progress on inflation than I would have expected a few months ago and that's positive. I think the long bond market has some catching up to do there. As for the Greenbook forecast, I think it's reasonable. I would probably have more of a saucer shape kind of recovery--perhaps a little weaker--but it's hard to quarrel with the basic analysis there.

199105	84	GUFFEY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In the District itself we continue to see some modest pickup in economic activity. In manufacturing, for example, the auto plants are not back full out, but the Ford plants are running two shifts and a large General Motors plant in Kansas City itself is beginning to put people back on [the payroll]. It also has raised a problem in that they simply have begun to use overtime rather than put a second shift back on. And the unions have become very upset because auto manufacturers haven't put the second shift people back to work. As a result, I think they're trying to manage [unintelligible]. It does seem quite clear to me that although the auto makers' projections are not strong, there will be some positive impact on our output in the period ahead simply because they are starting from a very low base and they are at work and are producing. In the aviation area, general business aviation-- the small jets, for example--is still very good. They had very good bookings and sales in the first quarter and that is projected to continue. Construction remains sluggish, particularly in the commercial area, but in the residential and other nonresidential areas some pickup is evident. ﻿ Th e agricultural area has already been discussed. The winter wheat crop looks to be fairly good and is spotty only in the sense that we've had some fairly severe weather come through the Midwest and that could be devastating to wheat at this stage in its development simply because of the hail and strong winds. But by and large there is a fairly optimistic view of that crop. The problem, obviously, is the weak commodity price for wheat. Nonetheless, it's better to produce than not to produce. Cattle producers, as I've indicated before, are doing very well, and that's projected to continue. In the energy area, drilling has slacked off I think simply because the stability of the imported oil prices at $20 a barrel or thereabouts does not encourage very much exploratory drilling. There has been some development drilling. That is, after a field is discovered, it has to be developed, and there is some modest activity going on in that area. The other area of optimism in the energy field is the oil field suppliers who take some encouragement from the Gulf contacts that they established as a result of the Persian Gulf oil catastrophe. With regard to the national picture, I have no great quarrel with the Greenbook forecast. As a matter of fact, I think it's a good deal better than it has been in the past. We believe that the staff is a little over-optimistic on the timing in that their second-quarter forecast is considerably stronger than we have, although the second half of the year really comes out about the same. So, it's simply [a difference in] timing. When we scaled back the second quarter we scaled back a bit from where we were before. But, on balance, it's as good a forecast as I think one can make, and it's a believable forecast. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	20.0
199105	85	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199105	86	CORRIGAN	 Well, Mr. Chairman, on the forecast first: We have a profile at least that is similar to Mike's, although not quite as strong--especially in the second half of the year. But certainly [we expect] a respectable recovery over this six-quarter period. Mike did mention several areas of uncertainty. One of the reasons why our recovery is less robust than the staff's is net exports; the staff essentially has net exports plateauing and we have a $20 billion deterioration built in over the entire forecast period. I don't have a lot of confidence in that forecast and I think Mike made the point earlier that it could go the other way. But it is in marginal terms an area of great uncertainty in this forecast period. And the difference between 0 and +20 or 0 and -20 in terms of the kind of growth rates we're talking about here is not inconsequential. Another point I'd just mention about the forecast-- several people have mentioned it--is the state and local sector in a context in which the underlying thrust of fiscal policy is probably on the restrictive side as well. The state and local [data] have all kinds of smoke and mirrors in them and it's hard to know what the real picture is. But it's hard to dismiss the possibility that there could be a greater measure of difficulty there, especially because these problems are so pervasive. There are darn few states and certainly few major cities that don't seem to have pretty hefty fiscal problems. Again, the smoke and mirrors makes it a lot harder to judge how difficult that may be. But, as I said, I would associate myself with those who feel ﻿ the risks in the forecast probably are more symmetric than they were, in part because of the changes in policy that have been made. On the anecdotal side, we clearly hear report after report to the effect that the residential construction market is looking much better. In your old neck of the woods of [northern] New Jersey, Tommy, one of the thrift people was telling me the other day that in the first three months of the year the stock of existing unsold houses in Summit was cut in half. That's one little community, but that community is not a trivial piece of the puzzle up there in northern New Jersey. The commercial side is lousy. And in the industrial sector, the comments that I get from big manufacturing companies continue to be sour across the board. Of course, a lot of these guys are sour all the time so you don't try to make [much] of that. But one comment you do get from these guys who are sour all the time is that there is a higher sense of anxiety about the outlook for their exports over the next four to five quarters. It's also important at this point to note--and several people have touched on various facets of this--that we can now see several areas in which some good things are happening that are not entirely unrelated to the kind of policy that we've been following. For example, balance sheet rebuilding even in the face of the decline in the saving rate in the household sector is making some real progress. And what we're beginning to see in the corporate sector is also noteworthy. Indeed, if you look at some of the things that were going on in the second half of the '80s, particularly for the companies that aren't already bankrupt, this reverse of the old phenomenon is not entirely inconsequential. Taking a longer view, I think this balance sheet rebuilding, while it may temper the recovery, could turn out to be a very healthy development for the intermediate term even though it may dampen things a bit in the near term. Somebody mentioned--Dick Syron, I guess--that restructuring is taking many forms and includes state and local governments. I think that is now more than straws in the wind and that's beginning to pay off. I'm trying to remember, Mike, when the last time was that we had a 2.8 percent decline in GNP and a 1 percent rise in productivity; I'm sure it has happened, but not very often. And that in itself may be symptomatic of some of those things. A number of people have mentioned the inflation situation, and I have to say that in this area there has been a change in my thinking. For the first time since the so-called core inflation rate plateaued at around 4 to 4-1/2 percent in 1984, I think we have a pop at penetrating that 4 to 4-1/2 percent core inflation rate. I've never felt that in this entire period. Now, like Gary Stern, I'm not ready to bet the ranch on it, but I do think that the inflation outlook is distinctly better. I still have to wait a little to see if we can get through that threshold. My hunch is if we can get through it, we might have a reasonable chance of staying through it. So, I think the outlook is still murky; there are plenty of uncertainties. But on the other side of the coin, I can see in a number of areas things that might bode well for the intermediate term. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
199105	87	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199105	88	MELZER	 I haven't heard much change in the kind of anecdotal information we've been hearing for the last couple of ﻿ months, though there is a somewhat more positive tone to it, with strength in the obvious places but no evidence in those comments of new areas of strength and no new areas of concern. One other comment on the anecdotal side I would make is that Jerry mentioned the sour comments from manufacturers and I wonder--and it's too early to tell now because I suspect their orders are still pretty lousy--whether they're going to be expecting too much out of this recovery. They may be thinking of more traditional recoveries. My guess is that it's still going to be a very difficult environment in which to do business. On this point I was amused that when Alan was in St. Louis a month ago we heard one manufacturer who heads up a very well-managed company fussing about the margin pressures. He said he hadn't seen anything this bad since '74-'75. But subsequently, having seen their first-quarter earnings, there was another increase--maybe a record. So, there are some people who like to tell us how tough it is. As for the numbers themselves, as was noted before, the positive information we're receiving is mostly anecdotal and it isn't there in the numbers. In our District it's starting to show up in the numbers through the first quarter. We actually had nonagricultural employment growth at about--not quite--a 1.5 percent annual rate. Manufacturing is still weak; that's primarily in transportation, autos and aircraft. And in nonmanufacturing and services, there was strength across the board with most of the contribution being from wholesale and retail trade and services. We also had growth in the construction sector. The previous four quarters all had declines, so this was the first positive quarter in nonresidential construction contracts in over a year. On a broader basis, one comment I want to make is on this inflation question. I'm somewhat troubled the more I hear comments about and see in the press good reported inflation numbers. When I say in the press, I mean comments from market observers--I don't associate this with what Jerry was saying before about better reported price numbers in the short run--that somehow that gives policy room to move. I have two reactions to that. One is that I think the numbers we're seeing now are the result of actions taken many months ago, if not years ago. And in that sense I don't think they justify any action on our part in the short run if policy is in the proper position. The second aspect of that, and the more important, is that these are declines from unacceptably high levels to somewhat lower but I think in a longer-term context still unacceptably high levels. What I'm saying is that if the policies we've put in place over a long period of time are working, we're going to go through a fairly long period where we're going to see better price numbers, but that in and of itself shouldn't be a justification for easing. There is this rather simple-minded concept sometimes in the financial markets that somehow that gives the Fed room to ease and I just don't buy it. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	42.0
199105	89	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199105	90	ANGELL	 There are indeed mixed signs out there. But I think we should note that the three major forces that took us into a downturn are no longer there. We no longer have any energy/oil price escalation that is eating up purchasing power; most of that price increase is now out of the system, as we've seen. The housing price situation, whether it's deflation of disinflation, has changed; whatever it is has slowed down. We're in an environment in which we ﻿ have improved affordability of housing, and I think that going from a minus to a plus is a rather significant factor. And we're already seeing what is happening in regard to the autos--at least the inventory adjustments that already are there. That leaves us, then, with [a question of] what it might be that would take the economy another leg down. And I frankly do not believe that the risks of that happening are symmetrical. I suppose it certainly is true that if net exports were to falter, having been as strong as they've been, that would be an offset to some of these other areas of improvement. But it seems to me rather unlikely that we'd get that much movement in net exports with the time lags that generally exist in the net export sector. Now, I think we should note that bond supply always tends to increase during a periods of downturn, which impacts government revenues. But what happens to the financial markets is that loan demand generally falls off as much; so during most recessions we get a typical downward movement of long-term interest rates that exceeds what we've had this time. We can do all the talking we want about why it is that the financial markets do not see the improvement that we see; and yet there are people who are making bets with real money and I don't think they have any reason to want to be biased. As long as we maintain money growth above the [bottom of the ranges] that we have adopted--and certainly we've maintained it around the midpoint--it would be conducive, it seems to me, to an increase in nominal GNP, if not quite as robust as you have it, Mike. Nevertheless, I would expect nominal GNP to increase rapidly enough that this improvement in inflation that everyone is anticipating thereby provides that kind of growth. It may very well be time for us to be patient with regard to being willing for that phenomenon to take place. What is wrong with nominal GNP growing 1 percent less than we have projected if that means that we're going to make that much more progress on price stability? When the bond market really sees that [progress] , then I think we'll get the additional stimulus that will come from a normal cyclical decline of long-term interest rates. That has not happened in this cycle. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0
199105	91	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199105	92	HOSKINS	 Not a lot has changed around the District since the last meeting. There has been no drastic drop-off in anybody's order book that I can find and no drastic increase either. Really, very little has changed. We're running at an unemployment rate somewhat higher than the nation. And the same comments that others had ab'out pessimism apply to the District. In terms of the national outlook, I have some discomfort perhaps even with the way we structure the meeting. We talk in these meetings about the forecast as if it's something that we can control; we can control the forecast but not the outcome very well. There are a number of real events that we simply are unable to anticipate that will change the actual outcome from the forecast. So, we almost set it up in some sense to lead us toward more of a fine-tuning approach than I think is warranted by the knowledge that we have as policymakers or as economists. That leads me back to Tom Melzer's and Wayne Angell's comments in terms of what we ought to be thinking about in the future, and that is not to be making tradeoffs for inflation and employment. It seems to me that that's nothing but a potential problem for us. Because the inflation rate is low by the standards of recent history that is no reason not to continue to press forward with ﻿ what I think is the right thing for a central bank to do, which is to eliminate inflation. We can look at long-term interest rates all we want but there's not much we can do about them unless we get rid of the uncertainty about inflation. And the way to do that is to have a credible and predictable policy. I think at this point the Federal Reserve's credibility will be tested and it's very important for us not to err in that test. I'll save the rest of my comments for the [policy discussion]. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	49.0
199105	93	GREENSPAN	 Governor LaWare. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199105	94	LAWARE	 Mr. Chairman, I have been very disappointed in the fact that a rather aggressive pattern of moves toward ease over the past several months has not really resulted in much more stimulus to the economy than the refinancing of existing debt. That leads me to the conclusion that perhaps we have a somewhat different kind of phenomenon here, namely that we have a real crisis of confidence that doesn't necessarily get cured by repeated signals of monetary ease. I guess I'm convinced that the number of things that are acting against renewal of confidence in the economy is very significant. First of all, we have genuine concerns about the health and the future of the banking system, which I think are very widespread. We have corporate profits that are very disappointing. We have a very heavy debt burden remaining for consumers, for businesses, and for governments--to the extent that the fiscal problems of state and municipal governments really have taken away their ability to have any stimulating effect on the economy. In fact, there's an overhang of apprehension on the part of both businesses and consumers that these problems of state and local governments can only result in higher taxes or reduced services or a combination of both. We have press reports of layoffs and restructurings and bankruptcies; we have lackluster performance in new orders that certainly has damped business enthusiasm for expansion. And the stubborn resistance of long rates to respond to lower rates on the short end is a reflection, I think, of inflationary expectations on the part of the public. I believe that, until confidence picks up in some fashion, the economy is likely to remain sluggish. Therefore, that leads me to conclude that the risks in the forecast really continue to be on the down side. But for the life of me I don't have a good solution as to how to stimulate that recovery in confidence. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	50.0
199105	95	GREENSPAN	 Governor Mullins. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199105	96	MULLINS	" I'm hopeful that the economy is pretty much on track for bottoming out this summer or in the third quarter. The evidence does suggest that it is contracting at a slower pace. We see that in the industrial production numbers, employment data, the purchasing managers' report, and maybe even in the retail sales numbers. There continue to be things that bother me. Paralleling what Mike did, I have a list of moderating influences on the strength of the upturn; it started out with only the debt overhang and commercial real estate as the two factors. I've added financial fragility--although maybe I can retire that one--higher unemployment, state and local government problems, the higher dollar, weaker foreign economies, and now some inventory concerns in some sectors. So, the weight of these moderating influences is becoming a bit heavier. It also seems to me that the Greenbook story this time in May versus March is a little less satisfying; it may be more accurate. ﻿ But it is unlike the old story, which had a starring role for the consumer to lead us out of the recession--propelled by increases in real income as oil prices dropped, a wealth effect out of the increase in stock prices, and a rebound in consumer confidence. It has been four months since the market rebounded, four months since oil prices collapsed to pre-war levels, and two-and-a-half months since consumer confidence rebounded. And now in the May Greenbook we're projecting consumer spending to grow not nearly so fast as we were projecting it in the March Greenbook. Obviously, consumer spending grew a bit faster in the first quarter. The saving rate remained low but personal income didn't grow. Governor Angell asked what will take the economy a leg down; I guess I'm wondering what will take it a leg up. I wonder if there's enough impetus in this new story to get us moving. In the new recovery script, the consumer takes a less prominent role and we project these three factors to lead to the recovery: homebuilding, inventory accumulation, and capital spending. It seems to me that each one is promising and each one has some question marks. There's every reason to be optimistic that the housing rebound is real. The issue remains that of translating housing sales into housing construction. I think there's reason to be optimistic when one sees the volume of debt and equity issues by commercial banks bolstering their capital positions. It is clear that banks are going to apply higher standards in lending to homebuilders, but maybe with improved capital conditions they will not extinguish the housing upturn. I'd say there are still some questions, though, on the translation of the home sales into homebuilding. On inventory accumulation, I wonder how much we're going to get out of this. Companies either have moved or are in the process of moving to a fundamentally different philosophy of inventory management; they now have improved information technology to implement a philosophy involving very tight management of inventories. I think businesses will seek to maintain very lean inventories when the economy turns up. There has to be some contribution from inventory accumulation when they stop cutting inventories, but even when there's a little wind in the sails from some other source, I wonder how much contribution we're going to see out of inventories. I feel about the same with respect to capital spending. I see little in the orders data to suggest optimism or little from talking to the sour executives that Vice Chairman Corrigan talks with. I think we're more likely to see capital spending in response to a recovery lag the recovery rather than lead it or be coincident with it. It is encouraging to see the volume of stock and long-term debt issues by corporations. Most of that, though, is going into shoring up balance sheets, which is a good thing; not much of it is getting through to capital spending. Still, the availability of ample long- term funds on good terms should encourage some capital spending for the competitiveness reasons that Mike alluded to, or at least limit the decline in capital spending. I tend to think we'll have to see a pickup in demand first before we see much [impetus from] capital spending. So, it does seem to me that the story is a little less convincing than last time. I have a little less confidence in the upturn since we have no reliable lead actor to replace the consumer. Again, it may be more accurate, but it's not quite as simple a story. ﻿ And I think waiting around while the consumer flunked his screen test for this recovery may be one of the reasons why there is some increased gloominess, at least in the business community. It may be just the executives of large companies that Governor Seger mentioned at lunch on whom the international situation--the higher dollar and weaker foreign economies--is having an impact. I think there continues to be the worry that as we wait around for this [upturn] there will be some atrophy in consumer confidence as it retreats toward the real numbers rather than spending rising to meet confidence. The discount rate move a couple of weeks ago was useful in injecting a little optimism into the picture and in demonstrating that the Federal Reserve is still in the game. And I think precipitating the prime rate reduction was a help. Still, when I look at the markets, I'm pretty reassured. The markets still seem in pretty good shape, although they may be down a bit. And they represent not only a forecast of recovery but a contributor to it--not only with the elusive wealth effect but also, as Jerry mentioned, we see them freeing up debt capacity, including short-term debt capacity. That means companies will be in good shape to respond to increased demand, should that demand ever arise. We've also absorbed a fair amount of bad news in the market: another round of bank insurance fund bad news and some insurance company bad news among those companies that specialize in high-yield bonds. There continues to be some skittishness in the long-term bond market. It made some progress and then drifted back some, although it is still off a bit, obviously, from the peak of over 9 percent in the fall. I tend to think that if you invest in 30-year bonds, you need some real convincing on the inflation side. The people who bought 30- year bonds in 1965 at 4 percent own them today or were fired and the new portfolio manager owns them. So. it's not surprising that after seven years of core inflation at 4-1/2 percent it will take some time. I agree with the sentiments expressed that we have the potential for substantial progress in reducing core inflation and that we should be careful on that front. There has been some deceleration in the monetary aggregates, which Don was talking about. Some of that was warranted to bring them more in the middle of the ranges. When I look at the interest-sensitive components of M2--money market deposit accounts and savings accounts--they are still growing at a very rapid clip and, if anything, at a too rapid clip. Of course, time deposits have been dead in the water ever since I've been here. The deceleration in Ml is accounted for by currency and demand deposits and there are plausible explanations-- special factors associated with April. I don't see at this stage a serious risk of M2 growth decelerating to an unacceptably slow rate, but in this environment we ought to keep that in mind just as we should the other side as well. We still have a good bit of stimulus in the pipeline. We see its effects in the buoyancy of markets and the rebound of residential housing. And as the prime rate has been reduced, I think we may see it more broadly. Overall, I guess I'm a little more concerned than last time about the path of the real economy; I swallowed the March Greenbook whole and this one is a little less digestible. However, the markets look pretty good and I think the policy looks pretty good, despite my queasiness. This is probably a time for patience, but it's also a time for vigilance as well. I think we should stand prepared to keep ﻿ things moving in the right direction if necessary. The lengthening list of moderating influences--the reduced forecast of consumer spending, somewhat slower M2 growth-- suggest to me less risk of an overshoot in the current environment. And the current environment reminds me of a sailing analogy: When you're sailing and you try to tack, which means to turn in a very light wind, what you do is push the tiller over to the other side of the boat and you shout as confidently as you can ""hard-a-lee."" which means ""we are turning."" Then you wait and wait and hope a little puff of wind comes along and grabs the sails and moves you off in the right direction. I think we have pushed the tiller and we are in the waiting phase. The only reason I hesitate to use the sailing analogy is that I'm a notoriously poor sailor and. when I try to tack in light wind, about half the time I end up dead in the water drifting backward. But we have a much more experienced crew on this ship, I'm sure! "	13	13	1.0	1.0	52.0

199105	99	KELLEY	 Well, Normand, will you please make a note for the next meeting that whenever Governor Mullins signals he wants to speak, put me down immediately ahead of him! There's isn't much left to say, Mr. Chairman. As I read the statistics that are available to us, and more particularly as I listen to the reports from the Districts, it may well be that the bottom and the recovery are at hand, but they sure aren't in hand. I'm confident that they will be and that we are reaching the bottom. I'm not that confident about the outlook thereafter. I'm not sure what kind of strength we're going to get out of a recovery or how sustainable it's going to be. I don't think those are sure things. I continue to have considerable concern about the drag that's going to be present with us for a while from balance sheets. I'm sure Jerry is correct that balance sheets are beginning to recover both at the household and the corporate level. But I also wonder if that doesn't have a long way to run yet. And I wonder, as that process does run its course, what the implications are more broadly. I don't see where our real strength is going to arise from. There are some good straws in the wind but none of them look to me as if they're of the nature that they have the strength to push or that we can be very confident as to their sustainability. The exception to that is probably the inflation outlook, which I think ought to help in a lot of ways that are both visible and invisible. And, of course, there is a natural buoyancy to this economy that, as Mike and others have pointed out, usually leads to better results than one can see at any given point in time. But I continue to think that perhaps the risks are not yet symmetric. For the short term at least, they do seem to me to continue to be on the down side. Confidence is the biggest fragility I see. As John LaWare said just a moment ago and as Ed Boehne said earlier: If confidence doesn't continue to improve and begins to deteriorate, it could lead to some potential real problems down the road. But as far as our work goes, I do think that policy has provided us with a good deal of insurance against these gloomy possibilities. It seems to me from a policy standpoint that it's a time to wait and see how things develop. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	48.0

199105	101	KOHN	 As background for the Committee's discussion, I thought it might be useful to look at recent and possible future policy decisions in the context of policy around previous business cycle troughs. In the process, I will be referring to the last three charts in the financial indicators package. Chart 10, the third from the end, shows movements of the federal funds rate. The lower panel isolates developments around cycle troughs. Data are presented for cycles beginning in 1961, with the exception of the credit controls cycle of 1980. Each plot is the difference in basis points of the federal funds rate from its value at the trough of a given cycle. To facilitate comparisons, the current cycle, the thicker line in the lower panel, was drawn assuming a May trough and a 5-3/4 percent federal funds rate this month. Several characteristics stand out from the lower panel. One is that the decline in the federal funds rate this time has been less than in the later stages of most other cycles. Of course, unlike most other cycles, the rate had been falling earlier, before the cycle peak. Still, the impression from this as well as other measures of monetary policy, which we will be looking at in a few minutes, is of a relatively modest policy ease this time, appropriate to a shallow recession whose expected end is ascribed in part to an unwinding of oil and war-related effects. The second notable aspect of the patterns in the lower panel is that in every business cycle charted, the funds rate has continued to fall for a few months after the trough. The policy strategy followed in the past, in effect, has been one of easing until there were fairly definitive signs of a recovery--the extension beyond the trough perhaps representing a recognition lag stemming from the timing of data availability. From one perspective this policy strategy might seem to be less than optimal, since, given the usual lags, the decline in rates around the trough would have minimal effect on the actual bottoming out of the economy or its performance early in the recovery. However, ex ante, one can never be certain when the trough will be or how strong a recovery is in train. Easing as long as the economy may be declining guards against the possibility of a considerably delayed trough and substantial further shortfalls in output and employment, even when the most likely forecast is for a reasonably healthy near-term recovery. Easing into a trough also may make sense if the Committee had in mind some level of nominal spending in the intermediate run that balanced considerations of longer-run inflation objectives and shorter-run output constraints; under these conditions, the further the economy falls relative to expectations, the further must interest rates also decline to induce a return to desired nominal spending within a given period. At this meeting, with signs of an actual upturn still mixed, such a strategy might be characterized as something like alternative A, or at least a directive biased toward ease with a presumption of some further action as long as the indicators suggested on balance that activity wasn't picking up. In the current situation, this approach might be seen as particularly appropriate if there were concerns that financial constraints, the high dollar and slow growth abroad, and fiscal restraint on the federal and state and local levels raised unacceptable risks of prolonged weakness or an unnecessarily slow rebound. This strategy implies the need to be ready to tighten early in the recovery once a solid expansion is established. Although this was done in some past cycles, it is also true that many of these cycles come from a period--1965 to 1979--in which inflation accelerated, implying that on average policy was too easy. It is not possible to pinpoint where policy mistakes were made--that is, at the trough or in the recovery. Nonetheless, that experience does suggest that if policy is eased into and beyond the trough, the Committee should be alert to the potential need for fairly prompt and substantial tightening early in the expansion to contain subsequent inflation. In a sense, alternative B could be seen as an attempt to reduce the need for what could be a difficult decision to tighten significantly relatively early in an expansion. Especially with continuation of the symmetrical language in the directive, alternative B would represent a more cautious approach to policy around the trough than has been followed in the past. I might note, parenthetically, that the absence of an alternative C in the bluebook resulted from a judgment about an immediate tightening at this meeting, reversing policy unusually quickly after a discount rate cut and at a time when money and credit was sluggish and the economic upturn uncertain; it was not a comment on the desirability of a symmetrical approach to intermeeting adjustments. The alternative B approach implies some confidence that the turnaround is indeed at hand, or at least that the risks of further decline on the one hand or excessively strong rebound on the other are evenly balanced. A cautious approach to easing, even as indicators may be suggesting the possibility of continuing economic weakness, could be seen as helping to insure that the disinflationary forces of the current downturn are not soon dissipated in the expansion. As noted, such a policy course would take some pressure off the need to tighten soon after the trough to sustain a downward trajectory of inflation. Indeed, as Mike has indicated, in the greenbook forecast, a flat federal funds rate through the forecast horizon is thought sufficient to produce lower levels of core inflation, given the outside forces expected to be restraining aggregate demand and cost pressures. Judgments about policy strategy over coming months need to consider not only incoming data on the economy and the current level of nominal interest rates, but other possible indicators of the thrust of policy. The next two charts depict the behavior of two of these--real short-term interest rates and real M2--in a cyclical context. Real interest rates, as calculated for the next chart, fell early in the recession, as a result of the surge in near-term inflation expectations that followed the oil shock. The reductions in nominal rates since then seem primarily to have kept pace with the drop in inflation expectations accompanying the weak economy and the reversal of the earlier surge in oil prices. The recent level of real short-term rates, shown in the upper panel, is estimated to be well below that of late 1982 and somewhat under 1986 and early 1988, all of which were followed by rapid economic expansion. Still, these rates are above some earlier cycle troughs, though this may be appropriate in light of the inflation acceleration that followed in those earlier expansions, as well as the shallowness of the current recession. With regard to long-term real rates, which are not shown, the corporate rate appears to be a little below the level estimated as consistent through the 1970s and 1980s with output at the level of its potential, and so should imply a recovery in the economy toward its potential level. Restraint on fiscal policy and credit supplies might argue that lower short- and long-term real rates are needed this time to foster adequate expansion. However, there are forces tugging in the opposite direction as well, including the demands for financial and physical capital in eastern Europe and the Middle East. The last chart shows the behavior of real M2 around cycle troughs. This chart was constructed somewhat differently from the others in that it is in growth rate terms, was not indexed to equal the same value at the trough, and shows, by the dashed thick line, the staff projection of future real money growth consistent with the greenbook forecast. As in other cycles, real M2 has accelerated in advance of the putative cycle trough, but it has slowed most recently and its growth rate generally has been on the low side of other recessions. Real M2 growth in the recovery is projected to be unusually modest, in part as the counterpart to the relatively slow recovery in the forecast. Damped money growth also is consistent with continuing restraint on inflation, and this is indicated by the P* model as well. In this model, P* is below P at the current time and throughout the forecast period, producing an inflation forecast quite similar to that of the greenbook. The real M2 growth shown and the P* simulations were based on a projection of 5 percent nominal M2 growth for this year. M2 and M3 growth in April were appreciably weaker than we had anticipated. April is always a difficult month in which to separate cyclical from seasonal or noise elements in money supply data, given the huge but irregular volume of tax-related transactions flowing through household accounts. The various documents prepared for this meeting attempted to throw some light on this shortfall, emphasizing elements of uncertainty and of possible variations in money demand not closely related to the economic outlook. Moreover, fragmentary data for early May, including information becoming available this morning, suggest a rebound this month, tending to reinforce our assessment of the transitory nature of the April shortfall. If the projected pickup in May and June does not occur, however, and M2 is on a trajectory that suggests growth appreciably below the midpoint of its range, the contrast with previous cycles would be even more marked. Indeed, such a path for M2 might signal that interest rates or other elements related to credit conditions were inconsistent with the desired turnaround in the economy. On the other hand, especially if additional easing were undertaken in the near-term, money growth could rebound sharply over coming months with the lower interest rates and stronger economy. Monetary expansion toward or above the upper end of the range later this year might signal the Committee that a tightening was needed to preserve the long-run anti-inflation thrust of policy. 	21	21	2.0	0.0	999.0
199105	102	GREENSPAN	" Thank you. Are there questions for Don? If not, let me get started with an anecdote that I was confronted with at the meeting of the Business Council last Saturday. They had me on a panel on Saturday morning with the Chairmen of IBM, Penney, Morgan Guaranty, Chemical, and Monsanto. And a gloomier set of forecasts you will scarcely hear. It makes the most dour view of this afternoon [that of] a raving optimist. At the end of the discussion, it finally got to me. They all looked at me as if to say: ""Well, what are you going to do about this?"" And I turned to the audience and said ""This sounds the way it always sounds right at the bottom of the business cycle."" And the truth of the matter is, it did. Now, that is not the same thing as saying that if that's what it sounded like, therefore, it is the bottom of the business cycle! But it is true that when the economy is at the bottom of the business cycle that is what it sounds like. In a sense I think the evidence is very clearly falling gradually into place in that respect. The problem that we're having in evaluating it is in part the consequence of two things that have occurred, and they have been mentioned previously. One is the structural change in inventory policy, which has limited the extent that inventory accumulation is followed by massive liquidation, with production levels substantially under consumption levels. The total system finally drains out and pops back. The second is the issue that Don was raising: namely, that as far as monetary policy and the credit aggregates are concerned, we didn't have the counterpart to the tightening as the economy since the peak [turned] into the break, the liquidation, and the reversal. What we're seeing at this stage is a far slower [than ususal process of adjustment], where in effect the contraction follows the very heavy and excessive debt creation of the 1986-87 period, the subsequent gradual retrenchment of debt growth and M2 growth, and basically, deleveraging beginning to occur, arriving at a point where I gather we had record equity issuance in April. And the effects of this are very obvious. We're seeing that the quality of balance sheets, as Mr. Corrigan points out, is improved. Despite the fact that the banking sector is still fragile, there is no question that the difference between the banking sector today and the banking sector six months ago is really quite stark. The structural weaknesses that we saw back then and the yield spreads and the difficulties to borrow relative to what we have today I think indicate that we have a much sounder [banking] system now. I think the inflation numbers at this stage are really credible. If you look at them in detail, if you look at them in an historical context and in an overall credit sense, unless inflation has ceased to become a monetary phenomenon, something fundamental is happening. And I think it is extremely unlikely to reverse. We're picking up the benefits of several years of fairly substantial improvement in all relationships of money, debt, and prices. But in that context I think monetary policy gradually defused the overheated economy and slowed it down to a point that in effect what I was hearing at the Business Council was not that their orders were deteriorating but that they were absolutely dead. Nothing was moving; everything was just absolutely frozen. The only problem with that is ﻿ that it appears, unless our data are just all wrong, to be allegedly freezing at a point in which production, fortunately, is well below consumption levels. And that has to run out. It's not a question of an inventory pickup; it's basically the end of inventory liquidation, which has been the classic element to turn around the economy in every pickup after recession that we've seen in the post World War II period and I'm sure earlier. So, when somebody says ""What's the spark? What's going to move us?"" the implication is that everything is in balance. The problem at this stage is that it's not in balance. Unless the data are all just wrong, we are undergoing a rate of liquidation at this particular stage, despite the fact that we have this structural change [in inventory management], that cannot persist very much longer because businesses are running out of stocks. And at that point production begins to move, real income begins to move--the classic Keynesian stuff, to whatever extent it works--and that's when it works. We get the multipliers working and the whole economy begins to move. The problem is that it's happening very slowly. I think John LaWare raised the relevant question here. This is a confidence issue. We can sit at this level for quite a while and eventually everyone will get discouraged and pull the plug on the capital goods market. Even though the capital goods markets have come in below our forecast, it does not appear from talking to a lot of people that what we are seeing are cancellations and major contractions. What we're seeing fundamentally are stretch-outs in the capital goods markets because we can see the appropriations backlogs are holding. Everything is holding. The only thing„that has changed is the fact that instead of doing it today, it's ""manana;"" but it's still there. The danger is that they will become so discouraged that eventually everyone will start to contract and pull in their horns; and then we will get a secondary double-dip in the recession. At this stage, even listening to all the gloom that I did on Saturday, I don't get the impression that there is a widespread initiation of cancellations of projects, as distinct from stretch-outs. So, I think we have a little time. The trouble is that everything is going in such slow motion because of the inventory and the credit [situations] that it may be too slow to get us out of this in time. But the elements are here. The basic [issue] is that we cannot sit with everything as it is now because the levels of production are too low relative to consumption, and something has got to give. One thing that disturbs me, which disturbs a lot of you, is that we are uncomfortable about where long-term rates are. Obviously, should bond rates back up, then the mortage market will back up and we could abort [the recovery] in the residential real estate markets, which are still healthy. But I suspect that the difference between the analysts and the managers, as Ed Boehne called them--and it was the managers that I ran into on the Business Council--is that the managers are operating as though they are serving the level of demand; the analysts are saying they're not. And we're about to find out whether or not the data really tell us anything. All this suggests to me that we probably just ought to xerox the last directive and rerun it, because I can't see any argument that I at least find plausible to push us on one side or the other. So, I would just put out as an initial recommendation, ""B"" symmetric. Governor Angell. ﻿ "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199105	103	ANGELL	 Mr. Chairman, I agree. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
199105	104	CORRIGAN	 So do I. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
199105	105	GREENSPAN	 Okay. That's two. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199105	106	SPEAKER	 I do too. Three. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
199105	107	SPEAKERS	 Four. Five. Six. Me too. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
199105	108	KOHN	 Norm, it will be fun writing the policy record on this one! 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
199105	109	GUFFEY	 I have just one [comment]. I happen to agree with what you said with the exception that if the aggregates--in particular M2--do not come in as projected over the next couple of months. I would have some concern about the outlook. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	20.0
199105	110	GREENSPAN	 You know, Roger, I would suggest that that is probably telling us that the capital goods markets are beginning to fade. It may be one of the early signals the Committee gets about the need to be very watchful. Who was it who said we ought to be vigilant? Was it Governor Mullins? I think the money supply may be a very weak tool, but I suspect in the current period it may be far more serviceable than it has been in a very long time. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199105	111	GUFFEY	 I think there's some informational value over the next couple of months. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	20.0
199105	112	GREENSPAN	 Yes. And we also need to take a look at the weekly asset side of the intermediary system, which reconciles to the money supply--disaggregate it into real estate loans, business loans, [and so forth] and in a sense try to see what the obverse of money supply elements is. Right now the data indicate a definite weakening in business loans, but I suspect that's being offset by issuances of securities in the long end of the market, so it's not a contraction. But if we get what you're concerned about, I think we're going to see it on the asset side of the intermediary balance sheet and it would be quite suggestive of the type of problems we worry about. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199105	113	FORRESTAL	 I'm perfectly willing to xerox the last directive, Mr. Chairman. But for the record I'd like to indicate that while I believe the risks are somewhat more symmetrical than they were, I would still prefer an asymmetric directive simply because I think that if we do move between now and the next FOMC meeting, it's going to be a move toward ease. And I think we ought to have that reflected, but I don't feel that strongly about it. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	39.0
199105	114	GREENSPAN	 That's probably factually correct, but I think the tone of the balance of risks is symmetric. In fact, I think you put it exactly right: The balance of the risks is probably symmetric even though the policy risks may be asymmetric. Si. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199105	115	KEEHN	 I agree exactly with what Bob Forrestal has said. I have a slight preference for asymmetric language, but I don't feel strongly about it. And I do absolutely agree with both the current situation and with [policy] as you see it. It's a fairly long time ﻿ between now and the next meeting, and a question comes up in my mind. Presumably, we have now established that you have the right to move policy, and by that I mean the fed funds rate, by some amount. I don't want to get into that but what would cause you to make a change as you look at the data that may be coming up in the next few weeks? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	35.0
199105	116	GREENSPAN	 Well, do you mean on the down side or the up side? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199105	117	KEEHN	 The down side. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	35.0
199105	118	GREENSPAN	 I would say on the down side that the major issue would be the money supply. If it's beginning to show a kickback from the weak April and all of a sudden it starts to dip down again, I think we had better be careful. Don did mention that. I think the data had been [unintelligible] but in the last loan officer survey even though the rate of tightening is much less it is still tightening. And in a sense there are liquidity questions because it's very hard to figure out how in the world we would get significant interest rate reductions in the context of very subnormal money supply growth and an exchange rate that is firming not only against the European currencies but against the yen as well. In other words, there are some people, and I have a certain sympathy for this, who are saying in effect that those are indications that monetary policy may be too tight. However, if the money supply is moving adequately, I would say it's a hard argument to make. But if we end up with a situation in which the money supply is beginning to shrink and/or the dollar is beginning to firm very extraordinarily, or if we get some really weak [economic] numbers--and that I would say at this point is unlikely unless something cracks--we need something. I think the Committee has actually created enough of a bottoming here that some new force has to come on stream to knock the economy down. As I said here the last time, the danger is really the capital goods markets. If the capital goods markets hold up, I think we're out of the woods. But as I think all of us are saying--that's right, Jerry raised it and I forgot all about it--the real issue here is that if all of a sudden the stock market falls on its face and breaks business confidence, then we ought to be prepared to move pretty quickly. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199105	119	CORRIGAN	 [Then] we've got problems. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
199105	120	KEEHN	 Well, I haven't looked at the calendar of the data that will be coming out over the next three or four weeks, but I'm simply saying that if there were some indication of basic weakness, I would hope there would be an opportunity to move. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	35.0
199105	121	GREENSPAN	 If it is of the form that's cumulative. But if it merely reflects what anecdotally already is in the system, that probably is not new information. Look, durable goods orders for April I assume are going to be down. If they're down by huge amounts, then we've got to look at it; but if they're just moderately down, I don't see that that is telling us anything new. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199105	122	CORRIGAN	 I think what President Keehn is hinting at, if I may, is that it might not be a bad idea to have rather firmly in mind a consultation in the first week in June or something like that. ﻿ -26- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
199105	123	KEEHN	 Thank you! 	23	23	2.0	1.0	35.0
199105	124	GREENSPAN	 Why didn't he say that! It's inconceivable to me that we can get through the next three weeks without something happening that is not important to talk about. I would assume, even if there's nothing to say, that we ought to meet. Does anybody else want to comment? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199105	125	MELZER	 I just want to explore the stock market issue. We talked to some investment managers a week or so ago and my sense is that some are expecting some sort of a correction. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
199105	126	GREENSPAN	 We just got it today. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199105	127	MELZER	 Oh, we did? How much? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
199105	128	GREENSPAN	 Down 37. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199105	129	MELZER	 Well, I'm not sure that's what they had in mind! [Laughter] 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
199105	130	KELLEY	 Are you talking about 2600 to 2550 on the Dow? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
199105	131	MELZER	 Maybe this is a peculiar circumstance at this time, but I think it's a little tricky to tie monetary policy into a stock market predictor. I just don't know what the linkages are. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
199105	132	CORRIGAN	" Don't misunderstand; I wasn't suggesting that kind of rigid linkage. What I was saying is that if we had a major ""tanking"" in the stock market, I think that would rather quickly show through to other things. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
199105	133	GREENSPAN	 Suppose the market goes down 180 points? Isn't that what monetary investors have in mind? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199105	134	SYRON	 In one day or over, say, a period of a week? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	51.0
199105	135	GREENSPAN	 No, in one day. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199105	136	CORRIGAN	 Tommy, if we had a very substantial correction in the stock market, I think it would feed right into the kinds of things that Don was talking about in terms of the confidence factor and the double-dip factor. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
199105	137	ANGELL	 I guess I'm a little uncomfortable with the conversation. The bulk of the conversation is agreement over the M2 growth and that seems to me a very good thing for us to be watching. Quite frankly, the stock market has behaved rather robustly and we didn't say that that means the recovery is going to be robust. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
199105	138	GREENSPAN	 I would bet you that it had an effect in stabilizing this. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199105	139	ANGELL	 Oh, I think it did, too. That's why some of us were pretty confident about it. Clearly, there would be a change in confidence in our [unintelligible] if the stock market turned up at 2450. ﻿ 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
199105	140	MELZER	 Well, for the record, I would be in favor of what you proposed as the policy prescription. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
199105	141	GREENSPAN	 Anyone else before we vote? If not, there is a correction. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199105	142	BERNARD	" Yes. to catch up with what has been happening in the foreign exchange markets, the staff is proposing a change in lines 35-36 from ""increased somewhat further on balance"" to ""show little change on balance over the intermeeting period."" "	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
