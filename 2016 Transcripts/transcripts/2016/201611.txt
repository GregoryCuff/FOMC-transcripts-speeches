201611	0	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	50.0	65.0
201611	1	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	As usual, this meeting will be a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board of Governors.	50.0	65.0
201611	2	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I need a motion to close the Board meeting.	50.0	65.0
201611	3	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	50.0	108.0
201611	4	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	50.0	65.0
201611	5	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	50.0	65.0
201611	6	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And, as many of you know, Nellie Liang and Mike Leahy have announced that they will be retiring, and this will be their last FOMC meeting.	50.0	65.0
201611	7	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Nellie began her career at the Board in 1986 when she joined the Division of Research and Statistics as an economist, and she worked on a variety of financial issues over the course of her career.	50.0	65.0
201611	8	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Nellie was a key participant in crafting the Federal Reserve’s response to the financial crisis.	50.0	65.0
201611	9	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	She helped lead a number of crisis-era programs, including the 2009 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, or bank stress tests, which played an important role in increasing public confidence in the banking system and set the template for our ongoing CCAR program.	50.0	65.0
201611	10	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	In 2010, she was appointed founding director of the newly created Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research, which went so well that it is now the Division of Financial Stability.	50.0	65.0
201611	11	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	As director, she led the effort to establish our new financial stability monitoring and policy framework.	50.0	65.0
201611	12	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Nellie started attending FOMC meetings in 2005 and has attended a total of 53 meetings.	50.0	65.0
201611	13	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Mike first joined the Board as a research assistant in the Division of International Finance on a break from his PhD work.	50.0	65.0
201611	14	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	After returning to graduate school and completing his studies, he rejoined IF and then rose steadily through the ranks, becoming deputy director in 2012.	50.0	65.0
201611	15	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Along the way, Mike made innumerable contributions to the work of the division, the Board, and the FOMC as one of our leading experts on exchange rates and monetary policy.	50.0	65.0
201611	16	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Including today’s meeting, Mike has attended 55 FOMC meetings since his first meeting in 2004.	50.0	65.0
201611	17	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Nellie and Mike, we are all truly grateful for everything that you have done for the Federal Reserve, and we wish you the best in your well-deserved retirements.	50.0	65.0
201611	18	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	[Applause]	50.0	65.0
201611	19	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Before turning to the first agenda item, I would like to recognize Governor Fischer as chairman of the communications subcommittee.	95.0	65.0
201611	20	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	108.0
201611	21	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I would like to provide some advance notice on changes to the policy on external communications that the subcommittee on communications will be proposing when we conduct our annual review of FOMC organizational documents in January.	95.0	108.0
201611	22	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	In particular, we would like to align the start of the blackout period more closely with the start of our serious discussion of the monetary policy alternatives.	95.0	108.0
201611	23	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Under our current practice, Committee participants receive the first draft of the alternative policy statements on the Friday 11 days before the beginning of the FOMC meeting.	95.0	108.0
201611	24	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	That is assuming the usual Tuesday–Wednesday meeting schedule.	95.0	108.0
201611	25	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	But our blackout period on external communications commences at midnight eastern time 7 days before the beginning of the meeting.	95.0	108.0
201611	26	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The circulation of the draft policy statements marks the start of our deliberative process for the coming FOMC decision, a process that the blackout period is intended to foster and to protect.	95.0	108.0
201611	27	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	That means that we currently face a gap between the time our deliberations begin and the start of the blackout period.	95.0	108.0
201611	28	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And we are investigating ways to close this gap.	95.0	108.0
201611	29	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	In the meantime, I urge all of us to be very careful in our public communications—which I’m sure we all are most of the time—particularly during the time period in question.	95.0	108.0
201611	30	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	In addition to this modification, in January we will also be suggesting some clarifications of the blackout policy, particularly as it relates to the staff and their possible participation in conferences and during the blackout period.	95.0	108.0
201611	31	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The subcommittee will circulate a memo describing all proposed changes sometime before the December meeting.	95.0	108.0
201611	32	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	95.0	108.0
201611	33	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Any questions or comments for Governor Fischer?	95.0	65.0
201611	34	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	95.0	65.0
201611	35	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Then let’s turn to the first item on our agenda, which is “Long-Run Framework for Monetary Policy Implementation.”	93.0	65.0
201611	36	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Troy Davig is going to start off our presentations.	93.0	65.0
201611	37	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	Thank you Madam Chair.	93.0	999.0
201611	38	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	We will be referring to the materials titled “Material for Briefing on Long-Run Monetary Policy Implementation Framework.”	93.0	999.0
201611	39	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	The briefings today summarize the work of the latest phase of the long- run framework project.	93.0	999.0
201611	40	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	As you are aware, this has been a Systemwide project featuring contributions from the Board and all Reserve Banks.	93.0	999.0
201611	41	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	In addition to the presenters at the table, there were several additional coauthors on the main memos, including Ron Feldman, who is also present and available to answer questions.	93.0	999.0
201611	42	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	Following on the foundational work presented at the July meeting, which covered money markets, foreign experiences, and lessons from the crisis, this phase of the project focused on issues related to possible policy rate targets and operating regimes as well as considerations regarding the balance sheet.	93.0	999.0
201611	43	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	In general, the combination of these elements comprises the key aspects of an operating “framework.”	93.0	999.0
201611	44	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	The scope of this project was outlined now over one year ago, with three broad objectives listed on page 3 of your briefing packet.	93.0	999.0
201611	45	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	The first project objective was that any framework needs to achieve an appropriate degree of short-term interest rate control, including in periods of financial distress and in a manner robust to structural changes in the financial system.	93.0	999.0
201611	46	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	As the briefings by Jane Ihrig and Antoine Martin will highlight, this objective can be achieved using different policy rates and with a range of operating frameworks, which could vary in the use of ceiling and floor facilities, the level of reserves, and the breadth of counterparties.	93.0	999.0
201611	47	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	The second objective was that a framework should enhance the ability to achieve macroeconomic and financial-stability objectives at the effective lower bound.	93.0	999.0
201611	48	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	Here the work reveals that the ability to effectively respond to the effective lower bound does not create sharp distinctions across operating regimes, though some operating regimes would require adjustments at the lower bound.	93.0	999.0
201611	49	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	In addition, maintaining operational readiness is important, particularly if the Committee intends to possibly use asset purchases or other tools that are not used routinely as part of the day-to-day operational framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	50	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	In terms of balance sheet policy, Deborah Leonard and David López-Salido will discuss how the balance sheet can be used to support interest rate control as well as macroeconomic goals and financial stability.	93.0	999.0
201611	51	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	The third objective was that a framework should support the System’s ability to address liquidity strains in money markets and support overall financial stability.	93.0	999.0
201611	52	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	Regarding liquidity strains, the work suggests there may be advantages to having separate lending facilities for different types of liquidity provision as well as a broad set of counterparties.	93.0	999.0
201611	53	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	Tradeoffs often exist when decisions about one aspect of the framework can have implications for others, though there are exceptions.	93.0	999.0
201611	54	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	For example, the briefings will discuss arrangements that allow for some separation between decisions about the balance sheet and the policy rate, such as in the current framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	55	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	Decisions about various aspects of a framework, of course, can also have important implications from a political economy perspective.	93.0	999.0
201611	56	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	In addition to the three project objectives I just discussed, there was a set of additional objectives listed on the top of page 4 of your packet that are addressed in today’s briefings.	93.0	999.0
201611	57	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	Finally, the Committee’s normalization principles and plans provided an additional set of criteria, also listed on page 4.	93.0	999.0
201611	58	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	In general, the issues discussed in the memos do not necessarily call for any near-term decisions about a long-run framework or for a need to make decisions about changes to the existing framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	59	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	Looking ahead, today’s discussion will help inform any additional staff work or dimension of the project that warrants further analysis.	93.0	999.0
201611	60	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	Thank you.	93.0	999.0
201611	61	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	With that, I will now turn the briefing over to Jane.	93.0	999.0
201611	62	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Thanks, Troy.	93.0	999.0
201611	63	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	As noted on slide 6, the memo titled “Interest Rate Targets and Operating Regimes” analyzes several interest rates that you may wish to consider using as a policy rate and analyzes operating regimes designed to promote money market conditions consistent with the target policy rate.	93.0	999.0
201611	64	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Antoine and I would like to thank Ron Feldman—our co-lead—and many staff from around the System who helped develop the ideas we are about to discuss.	93.0	999.0
201611	65	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	The memo’s goal is to illustrate tradeoffs across a variety of policy implementation frameworks with respect to a few considerations, including the objectives Troy just outlined, to help the Committee begin evaluating features that it may want in a long-run framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	66	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	To start, on slide 7 we review some choices of policy rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	67	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	The policy rate serves the function of communicating the stance of policy as well as supporting transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.	93.0	999.0
201611	68	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	The memo considers several overnight rates that can be grouped into money market rates and administered rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	69	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	In terms of an unsecured rate, the Committee could continue with the federal funds rate as the policy rate or move to the overnight bank funding rate, or OBFR, which the Federal Reserve began to publish in March.	93.0	999.0
201611	70	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	A secured rate could be a general collateral Treasury repo rate, and the administered rates could be interest on reserves, such as excess or required, or an overnight reverse repurchase offering rate, an ON RRP rate.	93.0	999.0
201611	71	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	The choice of the policy rate is an important factor affecting the selection of operating tools and the counterparties with which the Federal Reserve interacts to achieve interest rate control.	93.0	999.0
201611	72	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	This point can be seen by looking at the three illustrative frameworks presented in the memo.	93.0	999.0
201611	73	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Your next slide summarizes case 1, in which the policy rate can be an unsecured market rate or the interest rate on excess reserves, and a key feature of the operating regime is that the Federal Reserve operates on the flat portion of the reserve demand curve.	93.0	999.0
201611	74	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	This case encompasses the current framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	75	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	In this regime, floor tools, such as interest on excess reserves and the overnight RRP facility, are the main mechanism through which the framework influences the level of market interest rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	76	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Ceiling tools could be useful to contain rate volatility, should it emerge, although a high level of excess reserves would put downward pressure on market rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	77	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Reserve requirements and fine-tuning open market operations would be unnecessary in this framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	78	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	A question, though, is: What is the appropriate level of reserves?	93.0	999.0
201611	79	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Policymakers would need to evaluate tradeoffs with relatively large and small balance sheets with respect to issues such as financial stability and macroeconomic objectives that Debby and David will soon discuss as well as payment system efficiencies and political economy risks.	93.0	999.0
201611	80	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Case 2, described on your next slide, has similarities to the pre-crisis system.	93.0	999.0
201611	81	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	The policy rate can be an unsecured market rate or the interest rate on required reserves.	93.0	999.0
201611	82	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	The Federal Reserve would operate on the steep portion of the reserve demand curve and actively manage the supply of reserves to control interest rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	83	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	A key tool in this type of framework is reserve requirements, either mandatory or voluntary, to establish a fairly stable and predictable downward-sloping reserve demand curve.	93.0	999.0
201611	84	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Discretionary open market operations would also play an important role in offsetting volatile autonomous factors affecting the supply of reserves.	93.0	999.0
201611	85	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Ceiling and floor tools can play important roles in this framework to limit the volatility of interest rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	86	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Indeed, operating on the steep portion of the reserve demand curve could lead to greater interest rate volatility than in the previous case.	93.0	999.0
201611	87	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Historically, the discount window was intended to limit upward spikes in the policy rate, and Antoine will discuss a possible variant of the discount window that could help establish a more effective ceiling.	93.0	999.0
201611	88	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	In terms of a floor, interest on excess reserves would be the primary tool in the framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	89	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	In times of stress, the Federal Reserve could use sterilization tools to remain in this regime or use interest on excess reserves, or possibly an overnight RRP facility if the tool was in the regime, to transition to a floor system.	93.0	999.0
201611	90	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Case 3, which is noted on slide 10, focuses on the repo market.	93.0	999.0
201611	91	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	The policy rate in this case could be a measure of the general collateral Treasury repo rate or the overnight RRP offering rate.	93.0	999.0
201611	92	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	The operating regime would focus on the supply and demand conditions in the repo market.	93.0	999.0
201611	93	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	As discussed in some of the staff memos, the quantity of reserves and the setting of interest on excess reserves would remain important factors influencing repo market conditions.	93.0	999.0
201611	94	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	In this framework, an overnight repurchase facility may be desirable to limit unwanted upward spikes in money market rates, and an overnight reverse repurchase facility would be desirable in order to limit downward spikes in repo rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	95	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	The number and type of counterparties as well as the cap and offering rate settings on an overnight RP and overnight RRP facility would affect the interest rate control.	93.0	999.0
201611	96	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	If the objective was to maintain the policy rate within a reasonable broad range, the framework could function very much like the current one, but if, instead, you wanted to target a much narrower range, or a point target, then fine-tuning open market operations might be desirable.	93.0	999.0
201611	97	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	It would be important to consider how the use of standing and discretionary open market operations affect the level of reserve balances, which influence the effect of unsecured rate volatility.	93.0	999.0
201611	98	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Policymakers may prefer to operate with abundant reserves in this regime for this reason, and, in this situation, reserve requirements and discretionary open market operations may not be necessary.	93.0	999.0
201611	99	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Your next three slides evaluate the three cases with respect to the long-run framework objectives.	93.0	999.0
201611	100	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	As mentioned by Troy, one key conclusion is that, in normal times, interest-rate control can be achieved in the case of a wide range of potential policy rates through the appropriate choice of operating regime tools, and the policy rates will likely also effectively transmit the stance of policy to broader financial conditions and the real economy.	93.0	999.0
201611	101	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Interest rate control would be maintained at the effective lower bound as well, although it might require some changes in operating regimes in some cases.	93.0	999.0
201611	102	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Turning to your next slide, the memo highlights a difference between the regimes with respect to how they mitigate liquidity strains.	93.0	999.0
201611	103	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Regimes that operate on the flat part of the demand curve for reserves, such as in case 1, can easily accommodate liquidity injections, as the increase in the level of reserves does not affect money market rates much.	93.0	999.0
201611	104	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	In contrast, when operating on a steep portion of the demand curve for reserves, as in case 2, interest rate control can be maintained by using reserve sterilization tools.	93.0	999.0
201611	105	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Alternatively, this framework could transition to case 1 by raising the level of interest on excess reserves.	93.0	999.0
201611	106	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	In a repo regime, you could rely on the overnight RRP facility and interest on excess reserves to support the policy rate.	93.0	999.0
201611	107	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Other long-run framework objectives are mentioned on the next slide.	93.0	999.0
201611	108	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	In all cases, burdens of mandatory reserve requirements could be reduced or eliminated.	93.0	999.0
201611	109	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Reserve requirements could be set to zero in case 1 and possibly case 3, while voluntary reserve targets could be considered in case 2.	93.0	999.0
201611	110	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	All regimes support active money markets, although only regimes that operate on the steep portion of the demand curve for reserves would support an active interbank market.	93.0	999.0
201611	111	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Finally, payment system efficiency is achieved in different ways across the regimes.	93.0	999.0
201611	112	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	In particular, frameworks featuring high levels of reserve balances facilitate early payment settlements, a state of affairs that delivers this objective directly.	93.0	999.0
201611	113	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Meanwhile, regimes characterized by low levels of reserve balances would rely on the Board’s existing payment system risk policies to achieve payment efficiencies through the provision of free collateralized daylight credit.	93.0	999.0
201611	114	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	I will now turn the presentation to Antoine to summarize the key considerations across the cases.	93.0	999.0
201611	115	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Thanks, Jane.	93.0	999.0
201611	116	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Slide 14 provides a summary of some of the salient considerations associated with each of the three cases.	93.0	999.0
201611	117	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	The first two rows concern the policy rate.	93.0	999.0
201611	118	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	As noted in row 1, the choice of policy rate would be familiar in cases 1 and 2, particularly if the Committee chose to continue targeting the federal funds rate or move to the closely associated overnight bank funding rate.	93.0	999.0
201611	119	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	The interest rates paid on reserves, both required and excess, have been used in FOMC communication, so they are also familiar.	93.0	999.0
201611	120	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	In case 3, a market repo rate or the overnight RRP offering rate, which represent risk-free rates, would be less familiar to market participants and a more significant change.	93.0	999.0
201611	121	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Row 2 notes that case 1, using the federal funds rate as the policy rate, would not be robust to a significant reduction in federal funds lending by Federal Home Loan Banks.	93.0	999.0
201611	122	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Those concerns would be mitigated by the OBFR, particularly if that rate could be broadened to include onshore wholesale deposits.	93.0	999.0
201611	123	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	These concerns would be lessened in case 2, as an interbank market would likely reemerge.	93.0	999.0
201611	124	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	There are few robustness concerns associated with a repo rate.	93.0	999.0
201611	125	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	The next three rows concern properties of the operating regime.	93.0	999.0
201611	126	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	In row 3, case 1 would be particularly simple to operate in normal times, even if the Committee wanted to supply a smaller quantity of reserves than at present.	93.0	999.0
201611	127	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Case 2, while familiar from the pre-crisis experience, is more complicated.	93.0	999.0
201611	128	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Case 3 would be least familiar, although the experience of the last few years suggests that it could work like the current operating regime.	93.0	999.0
201611	129	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	As noted in row 4, since the level of reserves doesn’t affect interest rates much in case 1, injecting liquidity in times of market stress would not be an issue.	93.0	999.0
201611	130	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	In contrast, sterilization tools would be needed in case 2, or the regime would have to transition to case 1.	93.0	999.0
201611	131	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Liquidity provision may not be an issue in case 3 if this framework operated with the supply of reserves intersecting the flat part of the demand for reserves.	93.0	999.0
201611	132	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	For similar reasons, cases 1 and 3 could remain unchanged at the effective lower bound, as noted in row 5, whereas case 2 would likely have to transition to a framework like case 1 in instances of large-scale asset purchases.	93.0	999.0
201611	133	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Row 6 concerns reserve requirements.	93.0	999.0
201611	134	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	These requirements could be set to zero in case 1, as they would not play any role in a regime that operates on the flat portion of the reserve demand curve.	93.0	999.0
201611	135	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	To operate on the steep part, as in case 2, reserve requirements could be maintained, or you could consider voluntary reserve targets, which would reduce some of the costs associated with reserve requirements.	93.0	999.0
201611	136	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Reserve requirements could also be set to zero in case 3 if operating with abundant reserves.	93.0	999.0
201611	137	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Finally, row 7 discusses political economy risk.	93.0	999.0
201611	138	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Some risks are associated with having a relatively large balance sheet, as could happen in cases 1 and 3.	93.0	999.0
201611	139	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Case 2 likely represents the lowest amount of political economy risk, because it could be accompanied by a smaller balance sheet and money market rates would be above IOER.	93.0	999.0
201611	140	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Slide 15 discusses considerations for a ceiling tool that may be relevant for any of the cases Jane reviewed, with some focus on the discount window.	93.0	999.0
201611	141	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Historically, the discount window has been used for three purposes:  to help support interest-rate control, to provide liquidity to address broad-based market funding pressures, and to provide liquidity to individual firms facing idiosyncratic liquidity shocks.	93.0	999.0
201611	142	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Stigma— the reluctance of an institution to access a central bank’s standing lending facility out of concern that, if detected, it could be interpreted as a sign of financial weakness—is perhaps most closely related to the third role.	93.0	999.0
201611	143	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	But because use of the discount window does not distinguish the motivation, the presence of stigma for that one purpose likely prevents the discount window from performing all roles effectively.	93.0	999.0
201611	144	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Policymakers may want to consider options to reduce stigma.	93.0	999.0
201611	145	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	One approach, as Troy mentioned, is to establish separate facilities, one for each role, which may allow some tools to work more effectively.	93.0	999.0
201611	146	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	The memo provides two examples of facilities that may act as a more robust ceiling for interest rate control.	93.0	999.0
201611	147	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Policymakers could consider introducing a depository institution repo facility (DIRF) or a financial institution repo facility (FIRF).	93.0	999.0
201611	148	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	These facilities would be established under Section 14 authority for open market operations.	93.0	999.0
201611	149	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	More work could be done on considering the effectiveness of these facilities and other options could also be considered.	93.0	999.0
201611	150	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	These ceiling tools could be used alongside the discount window, which would only address individual liquidity needs, and a version of the term auction facility, or TAF, which could be considered for broad-based liquidity needs.	93.0	999.0
201611	151	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Slide 16 considers the degree to which these types of liquidity backstop might be incorporated into the framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	152	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	For example, the discount window and swap lines are “integrated” into the current operating regime—that is, they are continuously available as part of the monetary policy implementation framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	153	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	A potential drawback of integration is that integrated tools are more likely to lead to moral hazard compared with other approaches.	93.0	999.0
201611	154	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	The degree of integration could range from fully integrated tools to those that are less integrated and made available only under some preannounced conditions.	93.0	999.0
201611	155	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Or, tools could be left inactive, such as the TAF is now, with no specific preannounced conditions under which it would be used again.	93.0	999.0
201611	156	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Slide 17 discusses the breadth of the counterparty framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	157	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	In normal times, a narrow set of counterparties may reduce the risk of distorting markets but could be seen as providing privileges to a few institutions.	93.0	999.0
201611	158	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	A broader set of counterparties for liquidity provision tools could be viewed as more inclusive but might also increase the risk of moral hazard or of political scrutiny.	93.0	999.0
201611	159	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	However, in times of stress and perhaps in normal times, it might be advantageous to have broader reach in markets, for both OMO and liquidity facilities, to help with interest-rate control and transmission.	93.0	999.0
201611	160	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	These tradeoffs would need to be considered as the Committee moves forward with building a long-run framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	161	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	I will now turn the discussion over the David to begin the presentation of the balance sheet workgroup’s findings.	93.0	999.0
201611	162	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Thank you, Antoine.	93.0	999.0
201611	163	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Debby and I will now present findings made by the balance sheet workgroup, which we co-led with Fabio Natalucci.	93.0	999.0
201611	164	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	As noted on slide 19, we were tasked with exploring a range of issues that are relevant in determining the longer-run size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.	93.0	999.0
201611	165	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	I will start with a discussion of the roles that you might want the balance sheet to play in the long-run framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	166	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	These roles include interest rate control, achieving macroeconomic objectives, and supporting financial stability.	93.0	999.0
201611	167	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Debby will then discuss the implications that choices about the balance sheet objectives may have for the design of the System Open Market Account as well as the fiscal and political economic considerations related to use of the balance sheet as an active policy tool.	93.0	999.0
201611	168	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In slide 20, if effective interest rate control is the only role assigned to the balance sheet, its size would likely be determined primarily by currency in circulation, other autonomous factors, and the level of reserve balances associated with the central bank’s operating regime.	93.0	999.0
201611	169	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	As Jane and Antoine illustrated, interest-rate control can be achieved with either a small or a large balance sheet.	93.0	999.0
201611	170	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Just as the choice of the operating regime can influence the size of the balance sheet, decisions to use the balance sheet as an active policy tool to achieve macroeconomic goals or promote financial stability may also have implications for the operating regime.	93.0	999.0
201611	171	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	For instance, if policymakers wished to maintain elevated levels of reserves to foster financial stability, they would need to rely heavily on policy tools such as IOER, overnight RRP, or voluntary reserve targets to control interest rates effectively.	93.0	999.0
201611	172	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Slide 21 addresses the balance sheet’s use to support macroeconomic objectives.	93.0	999.0
201611	173	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	A large research literature has documented the point that, through a number of channels, large-scale purchases of longer-term assets can lower term premiums and long-term bond yields and boost prices of various other financial assets.	93.0	999.0
201611	174	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	These changes in financial conditions support stronger economic growth and higher inflation.	93.0	999.0
201611	175	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	The experience of central banks since the crisis suggests that asset purchases have appreciable macroeconomic benefits when the effective lower bound binds, especially in the event of stressed market conditions.	93.0	999.0
201611	176	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Economic theory would suggest using all available tools, especially in the presence of multiple goals.	93.0	999.0
201611	177	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	However, policymakers would have to coordinate the use of multiple policy tools.	93.0	999.0
201611	178	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Communicating the nature of the central bank’s multidimensional “policy reaction function” could be challenging.	93.0	999.0
201611	179	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Moreover, the ongoing use of asset purchases could affect financial markets in ways that are difficult to anticipate.	93.0	999.0
201611	180	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Policymakers may therefore assess the tradeoffs between the benefits and costs of active use of the balance sheet differently at the effective lower bound versus away from it.	93.0	999.0
201611	181	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	One possible approach would be to use the changes in the size and the composition of the balance sheet to achieve macroeconomic objectives only when the policy rate is constrained at the effective lower bound or during periods of stressed market conditions, and then revert to its passive role and prior structure at other times.	93.0	999.0
201611	182	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	This strategy would seek to preserve space that permitted future use of expanding the balance sheet by holding a relatively small balance sheet and a low level of duration risk outside the effective lower bound episodes.	93.0	999.0
201611	183	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	There may also be benefits of using the balance sheet actively away from the effective lower bound, although the case may be less clear.	93.0	999.0
201611	184	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In a post-crisis “new normal” characterized by a low equilibrium real rate, there will be less room than in the past to cut the policy rate in response to a recessionary shock, and there may be more frequent, and potentially longer, spells at the effective lower bound.	93.0	999.0
201611	185	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	An open question is whether a permanently large balance sheet would permanently reduce the risk premiums and thus it would raise the equilibrium real risk-free rate.	93.0	999.0
201611	186	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	If that is the case, from an ex ante viewpoint, holding a large balance sheet that bears a relatively high level of duration risk away from the effective lower bound might create additional scope to cut interest rates in the event of a recessionary shock.	93.0	999.0
201611	187	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	This strategy might help to limit the frequency of episodes at the effective lower bound.	93.0	999.0
201611	188	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	However, this same strategy could present, ex post, some costs of having less space to expand the balance sheet further should short-term rates still fall to the effective lower bound.	93.0	999.0
201611	189	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In either case, the macroeconomic effectiveness of any purchase or sales program will depend a great deal on the public’s understanding of the Committee’s reaction function and its stopping rule for using balance sheet tools, in conjunction with forward guidance on the short-term interest rate.	93.0	999.0
201611	190	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	I will now turn to ways the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet could be used to promote financial stability.	93.0	999.0
201611	191	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	I would like to preface this discussion by noting that, currently, there is only a small research literature on this topic and no real consensus.	93.0	999.0
201611	192	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	As shown on slide 22, policymakers might consider several financial stability objectives.	93.0	999.0
201611	193	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	During periods of stress in financial markets, asset purchases could be used to promote market liquidity and improve market functioning.	93.0	999.0
201611	194	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	The Federal Reserve’s first asset purchase program, initiated at the height of the crisis, likely helped along these dimensions.	93.0	999.0
201611	195	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Outside periods of stress, the balance sheet might also, in principle, be used preemptively to reduce the vulnerabilities in the financial sector.	93.0	999.0
201611	196	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	One of those vulnerabilities could arise from privately created, short-term, money-like assets.	93.0	999.0
201611	197	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In normal times, investors perceive such assets to be safe and liquid, but sudden changes in investors’ perceptions can lead to stressed market conditions.	93.0	999.0
201611	198	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Those changes were powerful catalysts for instability during the financial crisis.	93.0	999.0
201611	199	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In light of these considerations, a recent literature has suggested that a greater supply of publicly provided money-like assets may be able to crowd out excessive creation of runnable, private money-like assets.	93.0	999.0
201611	200	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Nevertheless, a great deal of additional research would be necessary before we would be able to assess the magnitude of the potential benefits of displacing privately supplied money-like assets.	93.0	999.0
201611	201	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Another vulnerability relates to the potential for excessive private maturity and liquidity transformation that arises from the shape of the yield curve.	93.0	999.0
201611	202	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Some researchers have suggested that the Federal Reserve could flatten the yield curve by buying long-term securities, and therefore, by increasing the costs of short-term borrowing relative to the yields on longer-term assets, reduce the amount of maturity transformation taking place in the private sector.	93.0	999.0
201611	203	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	However, there is very limited evidence on the responsiveness of liquidity and maturity transformation to changes in the yield curve.	93.0	999.0
201611	204	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Finally, some observers have suggested that the Federal Reserve hold relatively few high-quality liquid assets in its portfolio to expand the quantity of the same assets available to financial institutions.	93.0	999.0
201611	205	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Others have suggested that the Federal Reserve can “lean against the wind” in the housing market by adjusting its holdings of agency MBS and therefore influencing mortgage market conditions.	93.0	999.0
201611	206	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	This policy might be beneficial if the housing sector is viewed as an important channel affecting financial stability.	93.0	999.0
201611	207	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Thank you.	93.0	999.0
201611	208	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Debby will now continue our presentation.	93.0	999.0
201611	209	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Thank you, David.	93.0	999.0
201611	210	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	David reviewed a number of roles the balance sheet could potentially play in the Federal Reserve’s future operating framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	211	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Your eventual decisions about these roles will have implications for the design of the SOMA portfolio.	93.0	999.0
201611	212	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Some instructive cases are summarized on slide 23.	93.0	999.0
201611	213	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	A simple case might be to use the balance sheet passively to support short-term interest rate control and to deploy it as an active tool only when short-term rates are constrained by the ELB or during times of financial stress.	93.0	999.0
201611	214	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Maintaining a portfolio in normal times that is somewhat greater than currency in circulation and other autonomous factors—but not substantially so—and that has a short average duration would preserve capacity to conduct maturity extension or large-scale asset purchase programs.	93.0	999.0
201611	215	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Active use of the balance sheet at the ELB or in stressed market conditions would then mean expanding the portfolio’s size, lengthening its maturity, or changing its asset composition—then reverting to its previous structure when conditions warrant.	93.0	999.0
201611	216	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	A limitation of this strategy is its assumption that the balance sheet can be normalized before it is expanded again.	93.0	999.0
201611	217	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Under this approach, the portfolio’s size and composition are not necessarily choice variables; they depend on economic developments.	93.0	999.0
201611	218	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	With a persistently low r* suggesting that spells at the ELB may become more frequent or persistent, there is a risk of an ever-increasing balance sheet.	93.0	999.0
201611	219	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Using the balance sheet to support macroeconomic objectives while away from the ELB or to promote financial stability in normal times would likely entail a relatively large balance sheet—driven by needs to supply a large quantity of Federal Reserve liabilities or to hold a large stock of assets—in order to achieve desired objectives.	93.0	999.0
201611	220	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Different objectives, though, lead to different portfolios.	93.0	999.0
201611	221	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	For example, using the balance sheet as a macroeconomic tool away from the ELB might suggest holding a large amount of longer-term securities in order to apply downward pressure on term premiums.	93.0	999.0
201611	222	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	In contrast, positioning the portfolio to be able to flatten the yield curve suggests holding a large stock of shorter-term securities that could then be sold when the need arises.	93.0	999.0
201611	223	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Meanwhile, a desire to increase the quantity of HQLA available to the private sector suggests weighting securities holdings toward agency MBS.	93.0	999.0
201611	224	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	In slide 24, policymakers might consider a range of possible guiding principles for portfolio management, particularly insofar as there is some leeway in determining the composition of SOMA assets within the narrow limits established by the Federal Reserve Act.	93.0	999.0
201611	225	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Three principles that guided portfolio management before the crisis were safety, market neutrality, and liquidity.	93.0	999.0
201611	226	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	The weight each of these concepts holds in a future portfolio will depend in part on your choices about operating regimes and long-run balance sheet objectives.	93.0	999.0
201611	227	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Strategies that require substantial holdings of longer-term Treasury securities or agency MBS mean accepting some financial risk and potentially distorting relative prices or promoting credit allocation across sectors in order to achieve their policy objectives.	93.0	999.0
201611	228	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	While portfolio liquidity provides flexibility to sell assets in response to shocks, the need for sterilization capacity may be less important in an operating regime in which IOER and ON RRP can provide interest rate control.	93.0	999.0
201611	229	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Even so, maintaining some short-term liquid assets in the portfolio might remain a priority if you see such holdings as potentially helpful in meeting policy goals in some economic or market circumstances.	93.0	999.0
201611	230	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Maintaining operational readiness in key financial markets might conceivably be considered a new principle, perhaps suggesting ongoing maintenance of at least a small agency MBS portfolio if you believe you could need to operate in this market sometime in the future.	93.0	999.0
201611	231	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Return and transparency could conceivably become more prominent principles if the Federal Reserve runs a permanently large balance sheet.	93.0	999.0
201611	232	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Transparency about balance sheet policies is important not only to enhance policy effectiveness, as David mentioned, but also to enhance accountability, by enabling the public and the Congress to judge whether the Federal Reserve’s actions are consistent with its stated objectives.	93.0	999.0
201611	233	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	This is all the more important in light of possible fiscal and political economy issues that could accompany certain balance sheet strategies.	93.0	999.0
201611	234	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	As noted on slide 25, monetary policy has fiscal implications regardless of the size and composition of the central bank’s balance sheet.	93.0	999.0
201611	235	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	However, maintaining a persistently large balance sheet and using it as an active policy tool would accentuate fiscal and political economy issues.	93.0	999.0
201611	236	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	One issue is the division of responsibility for debt management decisions between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury.	93.0	999.0
201611	237	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Changes in the size and composition of the central bank’s balance sheet can alter the liability structure and funding costs of the government.	93.0	999.0
201611	238	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Different goals for the central bank and fiscal authority may, in certain circumstances, lead each to act in ways that are at cross purposes with one another.	93.0	999.0
201611	239	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	A second set of issues pertains to the costs of funding a permanently large central bank balance sheet.	93.0	999.0
201611	240	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Interest paid by the central bank to its counterparties can generate political pressures if such payments are viewed as unfair, unwarranted, or a subsidy.	93.0	999.0
201611	241	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Additionally, to the extent that interest payments on central bank liabilities are simply a component of the government’s overall interest expense, one might ask whether central bank liabilities are the least expensive way to finance the public debt.	93.0	999.0
201611	242	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Another set of issues arises when one considers the Federal Reserve as an independent entity that generates a stream of remittances to the Treasury.	93.0	999.0
201611	243	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	If the term premium is positive, a larger and longer-duration balance sheet should lead to levels of income and remittances that are higher on average, but possibly more variable.	93.0	999.0
201611	244	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Purchasing assets while term premiums are negative across the yield curve implies expectations of future negative net income associated with those assets.	93.0	999.0
201611	245	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Of course, monetary policy has general equilibrium effects that have broad fiscal implications, including effects on public revenues and expenditures and rates at which the government finances its debt.	93.0	999.0
201611	246	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Simulation results presented in our memo show how the overall fiscal impact of a large balance sheet can remain positive even when Federal Reserve income is weak.	93.0	999.0
201611	247	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Moreover, negative net income is not an impediment to executing monetary policy so long as losses are not so large as to impair the central bank’s solvency— measured by the sum of net worth and the expected present discounted value from seigniorage.	93.0	999.0
201611	248	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Nonetheless, balance sheet strategies that heighten the risk of losses could jeopardize the Federal Reserve’s independence or ability to pursue its policy mandate should concerns about income losses call into question policymakers’ commitment to raising rates when economic and financial conditions call for it.	93.0	999.0
201611	249	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Thank you, and Thomas will now conclude the briefing.	93.0	999.0
201611	250	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Debby.	93.0	999.0
201611	251	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	As Troy mentioned, the staff memos and presentations prepared for this meeting and for the July FOMC meeting are the culmination of over a year of effort by a large number of staff across the System.	93.0	999.0
201611	252	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	In total, the staff delivered over 500 pages of analysis on a very wide-ranging and complex set of topics.	93.0	999.0
201611	253	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	There will be a quiz before lunch on the details of these staff memos.	93.0	999.0
201611	254	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	[Laughter]	93.0	999.0
201611	255	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Apart from the memos, over the past year the staff also hosted a number of research and policy conferences and other events to build a broader and deeper understanding of the issues; to draw on the insights and perspectives not only of staff throughout the Federal Reserve System, but also academics, market participants, and analysts at other central banks; and to inform the public.	93.0	999.0
201611	256	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	As you might imagine, a project this large and complex required a more formal and extensive project management approach than is typical of FOMC projects.	93.0	999.0
201611	257	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	On behalf of the Executive Committee, co-chaired by Simon and myself, I’d like to thank everyone who helped keep the long-run framework trains running on time, including all the members of the Operating Committee—and particularly Julie Remache, the OC chair.	93.0	999.0
201611	258	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	I’d also thank all of the workgroup leads, the project management office, and a number of staff that helped with information technology and other technical and meeting support.	93.0	999.0
201611	259	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	The very broad focus of the long-run framework project has provided a strong foundation for the analysis of related issues in coming years.	93.0	999.0
201611	260	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	The possible questions we provided for your discussion, shown on slides 27 to 29, are intended to elicit your views on any tentative conclusions you draw from the materials we presented so far.	93.0	999.0
201611	261	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Going forward, we expect that follow-on work will be more targeted and focused on particular topics.	93.0	999.0
201611	262	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	These more targeted efforts will likely be conducted following the usual approach of convening a relatively small group of System staff as necessary to work on particular topics over an FOMC cycle or two.	93.0	999.0
201611	263	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	And with that, we’d be happy to take your questions.	93.0	999.0
201611	264	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	999.0
201611	265	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Before beginning our discussion, I, too, would like to express my sincere thanks to all of the staff across the System who have contributed to the long-run framework project.	93.0	65.0
201611	266	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	A great deal of thoughtful work has gone into this project, and the documents we received for this meeting are clear, well organized, and highly informative.	93.0	65.0
201611	267	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	As we complete this phase of our work on the long-run framework, I would like to congratulate the staff for a tremendous effort.	93.0	65.0
201611	268	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	To set the stage for a discussion, I think it’s useful to review the timeline for when decisions about our longer-run implementation framework will likely need to be made.	93.0	65.0
201611	269	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Clearly, there is no urgency at the moment.	93.0	65.0
201611	270	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Our current implementation framework is working well and should continue to work well for the foreseeable future.	93.0	65.0
201611	271	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	So when might we need to act to either change or affirm our framework?	93.0	65.0
201611	272	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	It seems highly unlikely that we would need to take action while we are continuing our reinvestment policy.	93.0	65.0
201611	273	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And even after we cease reinvestments, it will be quite some time until shrinkage of the balance sheet would force decisions.	93.0	65.0
201611	274	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	As noted in Tealbook B, the staff assumes that reinvestments will cease once the target range for the federal funds rate reaches 1¼ to 1½ percent.	93.0	65.0
201611	275	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Under the baseline, this occurs in the third quarter of next year.	93.0	65.0
201611	276	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thereafter, reserve balances decline at a pace of roughly $650 billion per year.	93.0	65.0
201611	277	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	In the Tealbook projection, it will not be until late 2019 that reserve balances move below $1 trillion, a level that is probably still ample enough to keep us operating on the flat portion of the reserve demand curve, as in our current floor-based system.	93.0	65.0
201611	278	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Now, waiting until reserves become scarce to make any decisions is surely not advisable, particularly as the public will long before then want some idea of where we are headed.	93.0	65.0
201611	279	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	That said, we still have much to learn about the future operation of money markets in the new regulatory environment, including gaining insight into the factors that will affect the supply and demand for reserves.	93.0	65.0
201611	280	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	The significant changes in money markets over the past few months in response to the reforms affecting money market mutual funds is a good reminder that the world may look quite different in some important respects a year or two down the road.	93.0	65.0
201611	281	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Many of the questions that are before us today need not, and probably should not, be settled now.	93.0	65.0
201611	282	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	That being said, I think it is important that we remain engaged in considering these issues, and it’s my hope that we can identify some specific areas for improvement in our implementation framework that will yield benefits regardless of our longer-run decisions.	93.0	65.0
201611	283	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	It will also be useful to get a sense of your general views on the bigger-picture questions regarding the choice of our policy rate, the operating regime, and use of the balance sheet.	93.0	65.0
201611	284	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I am looking forward to hearing your views on these important issues.	93.0	65.0
201611	285	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And with those remarks, let’s start off with Q&A, and then we will go into a round of comments.	93.0	65.0
201611	286	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Any questions for the staff?	93.0	65.0
201611	287	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	93.0	65.0
201611	288	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I agree with all that you said, Madam Chair, in terms of not having to make decisions right now.	93.0	96.0
201611	289	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	But presumably there are some decisions that you might want to make now, just because there might be consensus and there might be a deadweight loss of not making that decision.	93.0	96.0
201611	290	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The one that seems most obvious to me, potentially, is the reserve requirement.	93.0	96.0
201611	291	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	It doesn’t seem, in the current regime, that required reserves has any great value, and it has administrative costs.	93.0	96.0
201611	292	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	It results in fewer high-quality liquid asset sales.	93.0	96.0
201611	293	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I have a general question for the staff or anyone else.	93.0	96.0
201611	294	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Do people feel like all this has to necessarily be deferred if there is consensus on issues like required reserves?	93.0	96.0
201611	295	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I presume a determination on required reserves is a Board decision.	93.0	96.0
201611	296	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Certainly, if the Committee felt comfortable raising them again later, should it decide to operate on the steep part of the demand curve, there would be a number of benefits to setting them to zero temporarily or permanently.	93.0	999.0
201611	297	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	I also think a significant amount of time would be required to get from here to a place like that.	93.0	999.0
201611	298	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	You could actually ask the staff for a proposal for what would be needed to get from here to there and continue thinking about it.	93.0	999.0
201611	299	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	So you wouldn’t have to necessarily make a formal decision immediately.	93.0	999.0
201611	300	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	You could ask the staff for further work.	93.0	999.0
201611	301	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The only thing I would say is that it might signal something that you don’t want to signal.	93.0	999.0
201611	302	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	So there have to be some overall context, I think, for a decision like that.	93.0	999.0
201611	303	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	93.0	96.0
201611	304	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions for the staff?	93.0	65.0
201611	305	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	93.0	65.0
201611	306	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, this is an opportunity to comment.	93.0	65.0
201611	307	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I think, more or less, everybody has indicated that they would like to comment, so let’s begin our go-round.	93.0	65.0
201611	308	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	93.0	65.0
201611	309	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	93.0	96.0
201611	310	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I very much appreciate all of the work the staff has done on the long-run framework.	93.0	96.0
201611	311	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I thought it was an extremely thoughtful and comprehensive, an absolutely excellent piece of work.	93.0	96.0
201611	312	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it is important to consider where we’re headed, because it will influence what capabilities we have to have in the future.	93.0	96.0
201611	313	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	As the Chair has said, obviously time is on our side here, because we’ll likely be in the current floor system for several years at a minimum, and any consensus that was reached by this Committee wouldn’t necessarily be binding on future Committees.	93.0	96.0
201611	314	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So that’s relevant as well.	93.0	96.0
201611	315	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	But I still think it’s worthwhile to do the work to have a good sense of where we’re headed.	93.0	96.0
201611	316	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	To answer the most important question, I think we should have a regime in which there are sufficient reserves in the banking system so we’re operating on the flat portion of the demand curve.	93.0	96.0
201611	317	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	In my mind this type of regime has several important advantages.	93.0	96.0
201611	318	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	First, it’s operationally quite simple.	93.0	96.0
201611	319	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	One doesn’t have to forecast all of the autonomous factors that affect reserve balances and then add and drain reserves each day or week to keep the supply of reserves in balance with demand.	93.0	96.0
201611	320	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, it enables the financial system to operate more efficiently.	93.0	96.0
201611	321	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Excess reserves facilitate larger liquidity buffers and reduce payment frictions.	93.0	96.0
201611	322	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	It also reduces the amount of interbank activity in which reserves are created from bank to bank.	93.0	96.0
201611	323	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The memos talked about the robustness of the money markets.	93.0	96.0
201611	324	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I think having robust money markets makes sense, but I don’t see any bank activity per se as having a lot of value.	93.0	96.0
201611	325	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	It adds complexity to the system, but I don’t think it adds value to the financial system.	93.0	96.0
201611	326	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	There are some regimes in which there’s a lot of activity that takes place in moving reserves from banks that are long in reserves over to banks that are short of reserves that I don’t think actually ends up generating a lot of benefits to the economy at large.	93.0	96.0
201611	327	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Third, a floor regime is robust at the effective lower bound on short-term interest rates.	93.0	96.0
201611	328	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	If you had a corridor system, reserves added by QE and special liquidity programs would have to be drained in order to maintain monetary control, and we saw in 2008 that this can be difficult to do.	93.0	96.0
201611	329	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Sometimes you can actually lose monetary policy control.	93.0	96.0
201611	330	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, I think a corridor regime has one important negative aspect that maybe could be highlighted a little bit more.	93.0	96.0
201611	331	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	In 2007 and 2008, we were reluctant to enact large programs, and we didn’t enact programs that were open-ended, because we were worried about how we would actually offset, by corresponding draining operations, the reserves added through such programs.	93.0	96.0
201611	332	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this is important, because open-ended backstop programs may actually be more effective than programs that are finite in magnitude in terms of supporting financial stability.	93.0	96.0
201611	333	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s because such backstops encourage private market participants to stay engaged rather than pull away, and the fact that they want to stay engaged, I think, does reduce the risk of financial panic somewhat.	93.0	96.0
201611	334	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Under a floor regime, we can expand the balance sheet without risk of losing monetary policy control or needing to conduct offsetting reserve draining operations, and I think that’s important.	93.0	96.0
201611	335	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, clearly, we don’t need a $4.5 trillion balance sheet to have such a regime.	93.0	96.0
201611	336	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I agree with the staff that the amount of excess reserves could come down considerably.	93.0	96.0
201611	337	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	In conversations I’ve had with the staff, the general view has been that if you had $1 trillion of excess reserves, you’d be highly confident that you’d have more than sufficient reserves to ensure that you’d stay on the flat part of the demand curve in a wide range of environments.	93.0	96.0
201611	338	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I think you want to have enough with a margin of safety, and that would make a lot of sense.	93.0	96.0
201611	339	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to some of the other issues raised in the long-run framework memos, many of them are second order relative to this issue of floor versus corridor system.	93.0	96.0
201611	340	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, I think we could target any number of short-term interest rates, or we could have an administered rate, such as the IOER rate or the overnight repo rates, to serve as our short-term interest rate target.	93.0	96.0
201611	341	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	At the margin I prefer using an administered rate, such as the IOER rate or the overnight RRP rate.	93.0	96.0
201611	342	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	In enacting monetary policy, we don’t care about the level of money market rates per se, but instead we care about the effects of our policy stance on financial market conditions more generally.	93.0	96.0
201611	343	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So moving to an administered rate would appropriately shift the focus away from any particular level of a particular money market rate.	93.0	96.0
201611	344	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I understand the IOER rate raises some governance issues, but I don’t see why the Board of Governors wouldn’t just decide to defer to the FOMC on this matter or decide that the IOER rate would be set at a given spread relative to the overnight RRP rate.	93.0	96.0
201611	345	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	If we were to decide not to use an administered rate, which is my preference, I would prefer to shift away from the federal funds rate to another money market rate.	93.0	96.0
201611	346	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The federal funds rate has become increasingly idiosyncratic.	93.0	96.0
201611	347	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	For me, I would either prefer the overnight bank funding rate or the GC Treasury repo rate.	93.0	96.0
201611	348	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Due to my preference to make a floor system permanent, I would also be completely in favor, as I said in my question earlier, of eliminating the reserve requirement, and I don’t really see why we wouldn’t just get on with that right now, because it does create a deadweight loss in the sense that it has a lot of administrative complexity, and required reserves, unlike excess reserves, don’t count as high-quality liquid assets.	93.0	96.0
201611	349	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me like there’s a real gain in just getting rid of the reserve requirement.	93.0	96.0
201611	350	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think that if we were to adopt a floor system on a permanent basis, it might be worthwhile to review whether reserves should be part of the leverage ratio calculation.	93.0	96.0
201611	351	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	As I see it, there are two reasons to consider excluding reserves from the leverage-ratio calculation.	93.0	96.0
201611	352	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	First, the banking system does not control how many excess reserves it must hold.	93.0	96.0
201611	353	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	We do that by our policy decisions.	93.0	96.0
201611	354	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I’d like to have a regime in which we didn’t have to worry about whether a quantitative easing program would lose its effectiveness because the expansion of bank balance sheets was causing the leverage ratio to bite, thereby undermining the incentives that banks had to expand their lending.	93.0	96.0
201611	355	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, excluding excess reserves from the leverage-ratio calculation would create greater incentives to arbitrage the gap between other money market rates, such as the federal fund rate and the interest rate paid on excess reserves, and this would make monetary policy more efficient in that we’d be paying banks a lower interest rate for any given degree of monetary policy stringency.	93.0	96.0
201611	356	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Banks that hold more excess reserves are not riskier.	93.0	96.0
201611	357	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Including such reserves in the leverage ratio calculation in my mind doesn’t achieve any meaningful benefit in terms of safety and soundness of the banking system that we oversee.	93.0	96.0
201611	358	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So, two final thoughts.	93.0	96.0
201611	359	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	First, I’m not a big fan of actively using the balance sheet as a tool of policy when we’re not at the effective lower bound on interest rates.	93.0	96.0
201611	360	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	While I understand we could, in theory, use the balance sheet to affect the shape of the yield curve, I think this benefit is offset by the fact that having two active tools would make communications more difficult.	93.0	96.0
201611	361	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I also worry about our ability to anticipate how expectations would be affected by such balance sheet operations.	93.0	96.0
201611	362	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	If we were to change the balance sheet, would the reaction be mild or would we generate a taper tantrum?	93.0	96.0
201611	363	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The balance sheet is simply a tool that we don’t have much experience with.	93.0	96.0
201611	364	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	My preference is to keep it mostly in the background, except when we’re at the lower bound and it is most needed.	93.0	96.0
201611	365	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, I do think we should continue to work on what we can do to rehabilitate our lender-of-last-resort facilities.	93.0	96.0
201611	366	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not sure what the right way forward is, but getting rid of stigma would be useful.	93.0	96.0
201611	367	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	One option would be to operate the TAF auctions on a regular basis, presumably at very small volumes at a rate slightly above the IOER rate.	93.0	96.0
201611	368	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	This would be similar to the foreign exchange swap operations that take place around the world today.	93.0	96.0
201611	369	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	They’re little used during normal times but available to be used as needed if stress increases.	93.0	96.0
201611	370	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Having a standing facility eliminates the tough decision of whether to bring it back or not and the difficult signal that it sends, because it would already be there.	93.0	96.0
201611	371	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that has a benefit.	93.0	96.0
201611	372	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Another issue with respect to the lender of last resort is our inability to lend to broker- dealers outside of setting up a special 13.3 facility.	93.0	96.0
201611	373	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s obviously no easy solution here.	93.0	96.0
201611	374	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t see the Congress as readily giving us this authority, but I do wonder whether the FDIC might be more amenable to discussing Section 23(a) waivers now that it is on the hook when a SIFI with a broker-dealer has to be resolved under Title II, Single Point of Entry resolution.	93.0	96.0
201611	375	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	In the current regime, the inability to get funds to a distressed broker-dealer without invoking 13.3 remains a real vulnerability.	93.0	96.0
201611	376	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	96.0
201611	377	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	378	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	93.0	65.0
201611	379	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	81.0
201611	380	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The materials provided by the work groups make clear that there are a number of alternative monetary operating regimes that achieve very similar results with regard to interest-rate control.	93.0	81.0
201611	381	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	When comparing alternatives, I place considerable importance on simplicity and transparency, because these characteristics facilitate clear communication with the public and support monetary policy independence.	93.0	81.0
201611	382	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	So I find myself drawn to a relatively parsimonious regime in which the interest rate on excess reserves, an administered rate, is our main policy instrument and enough reserves are supplied so as to operate constantly on the flat portion of the demand curve.	93.0	81.0
201611	383	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Such a regime would achieve our interest-rate control goals in a way that is easy to communicate and requires little or no supplementary tools.	93.0	81.0
201611	384	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Such a regime would also minimize operational challenges and complexity, and the admittedly limited evidence we have suggests that the link between interest on reserves and other short-term interest rates is quite strong.	93.0	81.0
201611	385	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	This type of parsimonious framework could work with a balance sheet that is small relative to where we currently are but relatively large compared with the pre-crisis balance sheet.	93.0	81.0
201611	386	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Based on the preliminary quantitative assessments provided by the work groups, the volume of reserves needed may fall somewhere in the $600 billion to $800 billion range.	93.0	81.0
201611	387	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	We would be able to learn, though, as we implemented such a regime, more about how much is required, and the exact amount might vary over time.	93.0	81.0
201611	388	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	But we should be able to manage it with a program of just occasional outright purchases and sales of Treasury securities and without having to conduct day-to-day market interventions, as we did with our previous regime.	93.0	81.0
201611	389	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	There are a number of valuable features of this parsimonious regime.	93.0	81.0
201611	390	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	It would obviate the need for reserve requirements.	93.0	81.0
201611	391	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I endorse Vice Chairman Dudley’s suggestion that we get on with that if we can.	93.0	81.0
201611	392	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	It would also obviate the need for the overnight reverse repurchase program, which I think is superfluous in the current set-up.	93.0	81.0
201611	393	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	A particularly valuable feature is that the volume of reserve balances should be enough to accommodate the System’s payment settlement needs without much use of daylight credit from the Federal Reserve.	93.0	81.0
201611	394	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	This would make for a more efficient payments system and would reduce the risk of large credit extensions necessitated by operational failures, as occurred in 1985 or on 9/11.	93.0	81.0
201611	395	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I also believe that flexibility and resilience are important because it can be hard to predict how the financial system is going to evolve.	93.0	81.0
201611	396	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The ongoing shift from prime to government money market funds you mentioned, Madam Chair, is a good example.	93.0	81.0
201611	397	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Another is the erosion of Eurodollar volume that is now necessitating a reexamination of scope of our newly minted overnight bank funding rate.	93.0	81.0
201611	398	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	A framework that relies on an administered rate in the flat portion of the demand for reserves seems more likely to be robust to potential changes in the structure of money markets or banking regulations that might affect the behavior or economic significance of various market rates.	93.0	81.0
201611	399	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Of course, using an administered rate as our main policy rate does not mean that we have to ignore market rates.	93.0	81.0
201611	400	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	It might make sense, perhaps for an interim period, to continue to articulate our expectations that certain market rates will trade in a certain range determined by the IOER rate.	93.0	81.0
201611	401	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	But if so, I think that we should state such expectations broadly enough to make clear that we do not take much signal from highly transitory fluctuations in particular rates, such as the blips we often see at quarter-end.	93.0	81.0
201611	402	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Although we should be attentive and well informed about such fluctuations, they can have many sources, and most have little or no implications for the stance of monetary policy.	93.0	81.0
201611	403	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Another reason to set policy in terms of an administered rate is the fact that there are counterparty credit risk premiums embedded in many market rates.	93.0	81.0
201611	404	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	These may be generally negligible in normal times, but at other times, movements in market rates reflect changes in the distribution of risk premiums charged to private-sector borrowers.	93.0	81.0
201611	405	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	August 2007 was a good example of an episode in which broad shifts in perceived credit risk affected market rates that were usually virtually risk free.	93.0	81.0
201611	406	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The interest rate on reserves, by contrast, allows us to conduct monetary policy by managing a clearly risk-free overnight rate whose interpretation is unobscured by changes in the creditworthiness of market participants.	93.0	81.0
201611	407	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Just a word about governance.	93.0	81.0
201611	408	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I agree with Vice Chairman Dudley.	93.0	81.0
201611	409	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The one drawback you might see to a purely administered rate regime that depends on the interest rate on excess reserves is the awkwardness of the IOER rate being set by the Board of Governors and not the FOMC.	93.0	81.0
201611	410	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	But, similarly to the way we’ve handled the discount window rate since 2003, I think a solid commitment by the Board to follow the lead of the FOMC should suffice.	93.0	81.0
201611	411	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	And you could always pursue legislation, but I hesitate to recommend that.	93.0	81.0
201611	412	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	A simple floor mechanism would allow us to control a risk-free short-term interest rate with essentially no routine Federal Reserve credit extension—that is, no standing lending facility.	93.0	81.0
201611	413	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	It would represent essentially an agnostic stance with regard to balance sheet policies and lending programs.	93.0	81.0
201611	414	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	In contrast, some other regimes may require a standing lending facility to establish a ceiling, perhaps a soft one, on targeted market rates, although I would argue that in the pre-crisis regime, the discount rate played virtually no material role in controlling the market interest rates we cared about, such as one-year borrowing rates.	93.0	81.0
201611	415	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	So, for me, it’s not obvious that it was integrated in any meaningful sense.	93.0	81.0
201611	416	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	It was there, and I’m not sure what a discount rate that hadn’t been integrated would look like.	93.0	81.0
201611	417	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	It seems like it would look pretty much the same as the one we had.	93.0	81.0
201611	418	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	So it seems to me as if it’s sort of tangential to interest rate control for our purposes.	93.0	81.0
201611	419	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	More broadly, a parsimonious regime would allow us to cleanly separate decisions about our monetary policy interest rate and how we control that from decisions about other potential uses of our balance sheet, such as purchasing assets to compress yield spreads or intervening in credit markets in response to either market developments or institution-specific risks.	93.0	81.0
201611	420	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	In a parsimonious regime, our decisions about such programs would be unencumbered by fear of interfering with our control of risk-free short-term interest rate.	93.0	81.0
201611	421	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The benefit of separating decisions about balance sheet programs and credit market intervention from our interest rate targeting mechanism stems from the fact that there are really distinct considerations that are involved for each.	93.0	81.0
201611	422	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	For one, interest rate control is aimed at macroeconomic objectives, and credit market interventions are presumably aimed at microeconomic objectives.	93.0	81.0
201611	423	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I think one clear lesson arising from the crisis is that credit programs are clearly more politically controversial than interest rate setting.	93.0	81.0
201611	424	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Credit market programs have distributional effects that seem different in nature from the distributional effects associated with changing our interest-rate target.	93.0	81.0
201611	425	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The latter have differential effects on borrowers and savers, which have come to be widely regarded as unavoidable consequences of the central bank’s core monetary policy role.	93.0	81.0
201611	426	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The former, the distributional effects of credit market programs, have differential effects on different classes of borrowers.	93.0	81.0
201611	427	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	They’re less familiar to the public and are inessential to the control of risk-free interest rates.	93.0	81.0
201611	428	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Setting aside political considerations, assessments of the economic effects of interest rate setting and credit programs are on far different footings as well.	93.0	81.0
201611	429	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	There’s an enormous research literature on central bank interest rate policy.	93.0	81.0
201611	430	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The efficacy of central bank credit market interventions is another matter entirely, and I think it’s quite fair to say that the subject can hardly be regarded as settled.	93.0	81.0
201611	431	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Most of you know I’m not a big fan of central bank lending, but this isn’t the time and place to rehash that.	93.0	81.0
201611	432	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I certainly understand that many people came away from the crisis with strongly held beliefs about the utility of central bank credit market intervention, but this Committee has never really discussed a comprehensive retrospective assessment of cost and benefits.	93.0	81.0
201611	433	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	This area is likely to be the subject of a great deal of additional research in coming decades.	93.0	81.0
201611	434	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	In the meantime, we can avoid having to take a stand by choosing a parsimonious mechanism for controlling interest rates and leaving as a separate matter the fascinating debate about other uses of our balance sheet.	93.0	81.0
201611	435	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	81.0
201611	436	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	437	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	93.0	65.0
201611	438	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	88.0
201611	439	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Let me add my thanks to the staff for the excellent suite of memos and the presentation we just heard, which was helpful and very clear.	93.0	88.0
201611	440	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	In approaching the subject of the implementation framework for policy in the long run, my first reaction to the questions was to limit comments to purely practical considerations under the assumption that the balance sheet will likely be large—that is, on the flat part of the demand curve—for quite some time.	93.0	88.0
201611	441	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I am a little skeptical about constructing a long-term framework that’s disconnected from the feasible time horizon for its implementation.	93.0	88.0
201611	442	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	If this time horizon is long, our implementation practices are likely to become institutionalized and impractical to abandon.	93.0	88.0
201611	443	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Options that might seem easy to implement in the abstract could be more difficult and costly in reality.	93.0	88.0
201611	444	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Ease of transition may be a consideration in designing a long-term framework.	93.0	88.0
201611	445	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	In later discussions down the road, the Committee may want to engage the question of the transition path.	93.0	88.0
201611	446	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Nonetheless, the more my team and I worked through the memos and questions, the more I saw some value in laying out tentative thoughts on an idealized framework, even if short-term considerations could make its implementation elusive.	93.0	88.0
201611	447	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	In thinking about such a framework, I am inclined to narrow the options to just those that focus on an unsecured interbank funding rate.	93.0	88.0
201611	448	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Although I can see some merit in expanding the focus to the broader market represented by the secured rate option, I think issues like volatility argue for sticking closer to the status quo.	93.0	88.0
201611	449	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	In an ideal situation, I lean toward operating with the quantity of reserves at or near a point on the flat part of the demand curve in which the volume of reserves is smallest and the balance sheet is, accordingly, as small as possible.	93.0	88.0
201611	450	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I am inclined to avoid operating at positions on the curve with more reserve scarcity because of the concern about payment systems efficiency.	93.0	88.0
201611	451	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I also prefer to operate in the area on the curve of smallest balance sheet consistent with ample reserves—that is, the flat region—for reasons related to the concerns of financial stability and the functioning of short-term funding markets.	93.0	88.0
201611	452	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	As a safeguard of global liquidity in various states of the world, I think the Federal Reserve should hold as small a fraction of outstanding safe assets as feasible.	93.0	88.0
201611	453	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	One other reason to operate with the smallest possible balance sheet, consistent with being in the flat region of the curve, is mitigation of political economy concerns that could arise with sizable payments to financial institutions.	93.0	88.0
201611	454	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Conditions associated with the balance sheet setting I’ve described are likely to make an active federal funds market less viable, so I envision moving in the direction of the OBFR as the policy target.	93.0	88.0
201611	455	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	A framework that stays on the flat part of the curve would necessarily involve the IOER rate as an implementation tool.	93.0	88.0
201611	456	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	With the OBFR as the policy target, it makes sense to me to maintain an ongoing overnight reverse repo facility with the aim of enhancing monetary control by providing a deposit facility for a wider set of participants in short-term money markets, including the Eurodollar market.	93.0	88.0
201611	457	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	An ongoing ON RRP facility would serve as a complement or even a replacement, in time, for the IOER rate.	93.0	88.0
201611	458	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding balance sheet composition at my preferred position on the demand curve, I envision a relatively neutral asset side of the balance sheet.	93.0	88.0
201611	459	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	By “neutral,”	93.0	88.0
201611	460	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I mean holdings are distributed across maturities in rough apportionment to outstanding issues.	93.0	88.0
201611	461	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	And in my idealized framework, I prefer an asset portfolio in steady state being close to composed exclusively of Treasury securities, as that avoids any credit allocation.	93.0	88.0
201611	462	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	That said, I could see maintaining a small MBS operation as a form of contingency readiness.	93.0	88.0
201611	463	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	One final thought:  Some of the options we are considering include elements in conflict with our earlier public positions.	93.0	88.0
201611	464	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I think it’s advisable for the Committee to consider when and how to indicate any shift in thinking about these previous positions presented in the September 2014 normalization principles as well as public statements on the overnight reverse repo facility.	93.0	88.0
201611	465	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	88.0
201611	466	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	467	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	93.0	65.0
201611	468	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	102.0
201611	469	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I, too, found the briefings and the memos very valuable.	93.0	102.0
201611	470	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, I have a somewhat different take on where we are on these issues.	93.0	102.0
201611	471	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I noticed that in the briefing it was described as the “long-run monetary policy implementation framework,” and that was the task that you were assigned and carried out.	93.0	102.0
201611	472	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I actually think we need to be thinking much more seriously about the long-run monetary policy framework itself, and this ties into a lot of the comments that David López-Salido made in his presentation.	93.0	102.0
201611	473	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m going to focus primarily on macro stabilization and macroeconomic objectives, and my main concern, as always, is how are we going to conduct monetary policy successfully, achieving our inflation goal and our macroeconomic goals, in a world of a very low r*?	93.0	102.0
201611	474	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’ll note the staff’s view today is that the equilibrium nominal funds rate is 2¾ percent.	93.0	102.0
201611	475	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with that.	93.0	102.0
201611	476	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	If you look at the recent research that Kathryn Holston, Thomas Laubach, and I have done, and at research by economists at central banks around the world using similar methods, many people are finding that r* is much lower today than in the past in many countries.	93.0	102.0
201611	477	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And it’s a global phenomenon.	93.0	102.0
201611	478	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	This brings me to concerns about our monetary policy framework.	93.0	102.0
201611	479	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	First, if you think about our balance sheet of more than $4 trillion and the massive QE in other countries, that is presumably adding, at least according to our models and our analysis, quite a bit of stimulus to the US economy and to the global economy more generally.	93.0	102.0
201611	480	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	If you look at the methods for actually estimating r*, whether it is the model with Thomas and Kathryn or models, such as those developed at the Richmond Federal Reserve, DSGE models, and others, they generally do not take into account the effects of QE on demand.	93.0	102.0
201611	481	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s just part of where the IS curve is, if you will.	93.0	102.0
201611	482	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Then, if you actually think about going from massive QE stimulus in the United States and around the world and taking that away, going back to the baseline, you’re talking about reducing a significant amount of stimulus in the global economy and the US economy in particular, which arguably, using the methodology either of the work of my work with Thomas or other people’s work or DSGE models or whatever, generally would imply that r* will be lower in the future, not where it is today.	93.0	102.0
201611	483	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I am really picking up on what David López-Salido said.	93.0	102.0
201611	484	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	He described it the opposite way; a large balance sheet will boost r*.	93.0	102.0
201611	485	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	But if you actually look at how the methodology of these research papers work, because they don’t take into account the balance sheet generally, it actually is arguing that that boost to r* is already built into our estimate.	93.0	102.0
201611	486	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I would argue that there is up to ½ percentage point lower r* out there once we take away QE in the United States, and more generally globally, which would argue a nominal neutral federal  funds rate maybe of 2 or 2¼ percent or so.	93.0	102.0
201611	487	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And that does bring a huge challenge to carrying out monetary policy.	93.0	102.0
201611	488	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	If we keep the balance sheet elevated to keep r* higher, like David López-Salido said, we don’t have as much room to use QE to stimulate.	93.0	102.0
201611	489	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	If you look at the very nice paper by Dave Reifschneider a few months ago, it does point out, if we can get our balance sheet back down and if r* isn’t lower, we actually have a lot of room for stimulus.	93.0	102.0
201611	490	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	But in my interpretation, I fear that there’s not nearly as much room for stimulus.	93.0	102.0
201611	491	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	There are limits to how far QE can go in terms of the assets that we can buy under current law and the amount of outstanding MBS.	93.0	102.0
201611	492	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	These considerations make me think that, really, we need to be seriously discussing the monetary policy framework.	93.0	102.0
201611	493	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And we should be focusing our discussions and our decisionmaking on that framework, meaning what our inflation target should be and whether we should be thinking about price-level or nominal GDP targeting or other approaches to overcome the effective lower bound.	93.0	102.0
201611	494	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And from that will flow naturally some of the decisions about what’s the right size of the balance sheet, what’s the right policy framework.	93.0	102.0
201611	495	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	From my point of view, I agree with the Chair that we are not in a rush to make these decisions about what I think of as mostly tactical aspects of the operational sides of monetary policy.	93.0	102.0
201611	496	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think instead we should not be making public statements about what our operational or implementation side of our framework would be until we really have thought through some of these longer-run issues in connection with what our objectives and our actual monetary policy framework itself should be.	93.0	102.0
201611	497	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	93.0	102.0
201611	498	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	499	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	93.0	65.0
201611	500	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	90.0
201611	501	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	My comments actually follow very closely those of President Williams.	93.0	90.0
201611	502	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would say there does seem to be a surprising amount of consensus when the Presidents to my right and left actually agree on being on the flat part of the demand curve.	93.0	90.0
201611	503	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	[Laughter].	93.0	90.0
201611	504	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	There does seem to be somewhat of an emerging consensus.	93.0	90.0
201611	505	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	There was an awful lot of material.	93.0	90.0
201611	506	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	The staff did a fantastic job pulling it all together.	93.0	90.0
201611	507	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’m going to deal with only part of that, because I’m trying to keep my comments parsimonious.	93.0	90.0
201611	508	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	[Laughter]	93.0	90.0
201611	509	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Let me start by focusing on the balance sheet and make some conditioning assumptions.	93.0	90.0
201611	510	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I assume that if and when we again hit the effective lower bound, tools other than negative interest rates will be our first line of defense.	93.0	90.0
201611	511	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I make this assumption for three reasons.	93.0	90.0
201611	512	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	First, I view the results arising from the experience of other nations as quite mixed.	93.0	90.0
201611	513	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Second, I do not believe that currency will be eliminated or retail deposits will stop being sticky at a zero rate.	93.0	90.0
201611	514	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Third, these regimes disproportionately affect banks, which in turn affect monetary policy transmission and financial stability, often in perverse ways.	93.0	90.0
201611	515	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I also make the assumption that in the near term, this Committee will not be willing to raise the inflation target, even though I personally think we set the inflation target too low.	93.0	90.0
201611	516	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Finally, I take as given that the short-term equilibrium interest rate will remain lower than it has been historically.	93.0	90.0
201611	517	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	In a world with low equilibrium interest rates, it is worth revisiting how frequently short- term rates are likely to hit zero and how long they may stay there.	93.0	90.0
201611	518	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	The business cycle is unlikely to have been tamed.	93.0	90.0
201611	519	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we look at the Tealbook and private forecasters’ assessments of the probability of a recession in the next few years, it would be risky to assume that no recession occurs over that horizon.	93.0	90.0
201611	520	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, it is reasonably likely that even if we were to shrink the balance sheet relatively soon, the next recession could easily occur before the current surplus of excess reserves is fully removed.	93.0	90.0
201611	521	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	With a low real interest rate and a low 2 percent inflation target, we will not have much room to lower short-term rates.	93.0	90.0
201611	522	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	This may well cause us to, once again, hit zero short-term rates and to need alternative monetary policies to stimulate the economy, most likely by engaging in large-scale asset purchases to lower longer-term rates and rates other than on Treasury securities.	93.0	90.0
201611	523	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, if my assumptions are right, I think it is, at the least, prudent risk management to assume that large- scale asset purchases, in conjunction with hitting zero for short-term rates, will be our standard recession-fighting tools.	93.0	90.0
201611	524	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, I see the balance sheet varying but with high average excess reserves that grow during recessions and recede during recoveries.	93.0	90.0
201611	525	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we are quite likely to have a large balance sheet, then our operating framework should make clear and seek to optimize policy in a framework that acknowledges that we will be operating in a world of large excess reserves.	93.0	90.0
201611	526	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	What factors other than the business cycle should be considered in determining the size and composition of the balance sheet?	93.0	90.0
201611	527	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would continue to hold some long-term Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, the latter in order to maintain operational expertise in preparation for economic downturns, when we may resume large purchases or sales.	93.0	90.0
201611	528	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Also, we have successfully used the size, composition, and duration of the balance sheet to support the economy during recessions.	93.0	90.0
201611	529	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Some of the staff memos point out that such purchases may have smaller effects during expansions, in part because they will not be helping to improve market function.	93.0	90.0
201611	530	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	But there is no reason to believe that these factors can affect the economy only during economic downturns or only in one direction.	93.0	90.0
201611	531	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, I would maintain sufficient balance sheet compositional mix and duration to address both macroeconomic stabilization and financial stability concerns.	93.0	90.0
201611	532	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, to signal or influence these concerns, we would need to continue to hold MBS and long-duration securities in our portfolio.	93.0	90.0
201611	533	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would prefer to have a broader discussion on rates once we have more clarity on the balance sheet strategy.	93.0	90.0
201611	534	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	My current thinking is to communicate policy primarily through the administered rate that we control.	93.0	90.0
201611	535	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because the only administered rate controlled by the FOMC is the overnight RRP rate, I would focus on that rate as a floor unless the interest rate on excess reserves at some point in the future becomes a tool of the FOMC.	93.0	90.0
201611	536	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	My own view is that we closely monitor short-term rates but not necessarily target them.	93.0	90.0
201611	537	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would postpone the discussion of liquidity facilities.	93.0	90.0
201611	538	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think we should make decisions about the balance sheet first.	93.0	90.0
201611	539	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	In particular, what are the size, composition, and duration of our balance sheet going to be should we experience a long period of recovery, knowing that in a recession the size, duration, and composition of the balance sheet will likely be altered by the severity and nature of that recession?	93.0	90.0
201611	540	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	How we need to think about liquidity facilities depends on the decisions that we make about the balance sheet during good times.	93.0	90.0
201611	541	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	90.0
201611	542	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	543	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	93.0	65.0
201611	544	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	104.0
201611	545	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I’ll go through the three sets of questions expeditiously, if not parsimoniously.	93.0	104.0
201611	546	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The first set of questions asked for views on the key design elements, and I would want to start with a rate that’s highly robust and likely to remain so over time.	93.0	104.0
201611	547	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Although our current system is working at the moment, I think that for the longer term, the federal funds rate is unlikely to meet that test.	93.0	104.0
201611	548	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	There are a couple of near-term problems with the arbitrage trade that represents nearly all of the current activity in the federal funds market.	93.0	104.0
201611	549	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	First, the spread between the IOER rate and the federal funds rate generates criticism that it’s subsidizing banks, mainly large foreign banks.	93.0	104.0
201611	550	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Second, the arbitrage trade is vulnerable and could easily disappear, thanks to potential market concerns about European banks, or, for that matter, the banks themselves could pull back if regulatory changes make a trade unprofitable.	93.0	104.0
201611	551	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	If the federal funds rate does become idiosyncratic or goes away entirely, we’ll be left without a viable policy rate as well as with $11 trillion or $12 trillion of OIS swaps that are priced off the federal funds rate.	93.0	104.0
201611	552	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The plan developed in our work with the alternative reference rate committee is to move new OIS trading to either a GC repo rate or the overnight bank funding rate, depending on which rate that committee picks, we expect, in early 2017.	93.0	104.0
201611	553	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	For existing OIS trades, we will then work with the industry and with ISDA to get the chosen rate into swap agreements as a backup in case federal funds fails.	93.0	104.0
201611	554	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	But the fact that we’re even talking about this says nothing good about the quality of federal funds as a benchmark.	93.0	104.0
201611	555	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Bottom line:  I would be inclined to look for a more robust alternative.	93.0	104.0
201611	556	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Of the two possible administered rates, either of them could make sense to me.	93.0	104.0
201611	557	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The IOER rate could work particularly, I think, in a narrower spread to overnight RRP, which probably means a larger RRP.	93.0	104.0
201611	558	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	And I agree with others that the governance issues there could easily be managed.	93.0	104.0
201611	559	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	We could also pick the overnight repo rate if that facility is to be with us for the longer term, a possibility that is more real to me now in a lower-for-longer world.	93.0	104.0
201611	560	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	As for market rates, the overnight bank funding rate is a plausible alternative, although OBFR transaction volumes have fallen by roughly half this year, thanks to money market reform, and, as I think Antoine indicated, it would probably be necessary to broaden the scope of that rate.	93.0	104.0
201611	561	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The most robust rate—and I guess this makes me a case 3 person—and most relevant as a source of funding could well be a GC Treasury repo rate, depending on whether it’s triparty or includes bilateral transactions.	93.0	104.0
201611	562	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The size of the underlying market could run anywhere from $300 billion to $700 billion or more per day, and unlike the markets associated with the unsecured overnight rates, the repo market is and is likely to remain an important source of funding for a wide set of financial institutions.	93.0	104.0
201611	563	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Of course, if we do target a repo rate, it would make sense to deal with an expanded set of counterparties that are active in the market, and I’m fine with an operating framework that recognizes that we’re no longer mainly dependent on banks for financial intermediation.	93.0	104.0
201611	564	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The memo asks next whether we would prefer to operate on the flat or steep part of the demand curve for reserves, and I’m well aligned with essentially all that’s been said on this.	93.0	104.0
201611	565	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	We face both a larger balance sheet and interest rates that will be well below historical norms for the foreseeable future, and this reality has important implications for the operating framework.	93.0	104.0
201611	566	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I do lean toward a world of plentiful reserves, but one that is no larger than it needs to be.	93.0	104.0
201611	567	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	But, regardless of what one might see as the ideal end state, the long-run framework, I believe, should assume that we’re going to be operating indefinitely in a world of plentiful reserves.	93.0	104.0
201611	568	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I frankly think that the Tealbook balance sheet projections—I understand how they’re derived and appropriately derived from the mechanical interest rate rule and assumptions based on what the Committee has said—are out of touch with market expectations as well as the latest SEP numbers.	93.0	104.0
201611	569	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The surveys of the primary dealers and market participants that came out last week suggest that reinvestments will continue in full until April 2018 and estimate that the SOMA will be at $3 trillion at year-end 2019, unless there’s a return to the effective lower bound, in which case the SOMA will have increased to $4.9 trillion.	93.0	104.0
201611	570	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Of course, in the Tealbook we achieve equilibrium and there are no recessions—again, a perfectly natural assumption—but there will be a recession, and if one happens, think about this for a second:  If you just roll over the probability of recession for a few years, there’s roughly a two-out-of-three chance that there will be a recession in the next four years.	93.0	104.0
201611	571	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The SEP says that we’ll start from a low level of rates.	93.0	104.0
201611	572	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	We’ll go back to the effective lower bound.	93.0	104.0
201611	573	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I strongly suspect that we’ll be there for an extended stay and ultimately resort to another LSAP, and then we’ll be very cautious about liftoff and move gradually in raising rates.	93.0	104.0
201611	574	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	If you add all that up, what you get is a balance sheet that is probably just about as likely to grow as to shrink in the years ahead.	93.0	104.0
201611	575	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	That is not a world that I embrace or want.	93.0	104.0
201611	576	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	But it just seems to me that is the likely world in which we live.	93.0	104.0
201611	577	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	So reserves are likely to remain abundant, even allowing for some uncertainty with respect to the level at which they would become scarce.	93.0	104.0
201611	578	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Now, I think that does suggest that the overnight RRP will need to be more long lasting than I had anticipated, and I’m inclined to consider that.	93.0	104.0
201611	579	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	So far, it has provided an effective floor and done so without distorting markets.	93.0	104.0
201611	580	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I think we will need a dynamic cap on the facility if it’s going to be around for longer, and I also think we should consider narrowing the corridor between the IOER rate and the overnight RRP rate in order to address that perception of subsidization.	93.0	104.0
201611	581	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The second set of questions, more briefly, relates to the possible alternative liquidity arrangements that could mitigate stigma and create a ceiling, and let me say I’m open to any changes that would help lower the stigma of borrowing from the central bank.	93.0	104.0
201611	582	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	It isn’t clear to me that the suggestions in the staff memos could accomplish that, because it’s hard to avoid stigma when you’re borrowing at a penalty rate.	93.0	104.0
201611	583	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	But I encourage that these ideas receive more examination and analysis.	93.0	104.0
201611	584	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I also think it may be worth considering the idea of price liquidity along lines similar to what the Reserve Bank of Australia does.	93.0	104.0
201611	585	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The idea would be to require US banks to pay ex ante for discount window access, and then because they paid for it, they ought to be able to use it without stigma.	93.0	104.0
201611	586	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I’m sure there are problems and holes with that, but it’s another idea that I’m sure we have considered and should continue to do so.	93.0	104.0
201611	587	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	In the meantime, I don’t see it as particularly necessary to have a solid ceiling if we’re in a floor system.	93.0	104.0
201611	588	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I think that’s less of a consideration, and we didn’t particularly, I think, as other have pointed out, have a hard ceiling in our previous regime.	93.0	104.0
201611	589	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The third set of questions relates to the long-run size and composition of the balance sheet.	93.0	104.0
201611	590	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I strongly prefer that we use LSAPs only at the effective lower bound.	93.0	104.0
201611	591	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I think we’ve learned that it’s easier to grow a big balance sheet than it is to return to normal size.	93.0	104.0
201611	592	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	So I would use LSAPs only when conventional policy is exhausted.	93.0	104.0
201611	593	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I am open to the idea that a larger balance sheet could have some financial-stability benefits, but these are relatively new ideas, and as David López-Salido said, this is a new and fascinating literature and small literature that has not reached a real consensus.	93.0	104.0
201611	594	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	So I think it’s premature to get close to embracing anything like that.	93.0	104.0
201611	595	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	As I’ve mentioned, in any case, I think we’re going to have a larger balance sheet.	93.0	104.0
201611	596	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I am open to the idea of continuing to hold a residual amount of MBS for the reasons that President Lockhart suggested—in other words, only to maintain a certain amount of expertise.	93.0	104.0
201611	597	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	It’s not something I feel strongly about.	93.0	104.0
201611	598	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	And I’m not attracted to the idea of intervening to manipulate the shape of the yield curve for financial-stability reasons.	93.0	104.0
201611	599	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Finally, I would look at the idea of gradually shortening the duration of the portfolio mainly to diminish our effect on fiscal outcomes.	93.0	104.0
201611	600	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I do realize this is a form of tightening, and I would look at it longer term, and I would want to do it gradually and in consideration of the fact that it is a form of tightening.	93.0	104.0
201611	601	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	And with that, I’m done.	93.0	104.0
201611	602	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Thank you.	93.0	104.0
201611	603	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	604	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	93.0	65.0
201611	605	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	91.0
201611	606	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I have a set of relatively small and idiosyncratic comments.	93.0	91.0
201611	607	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I’m going to deliver them anyway.	93.0	91.0
201611	608	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	93.0	91.0
201611	609	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I will say they feel smaller after hearing President Williams’s and President Rosengren’s comments.	93.0	91.0
201611	610	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I think they really hit on a very important issue.	93.0	91.0
201611	611	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I think President Williams is right.	93.0	91.0
201611	612	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	It’s very important to assess our monetary policy framework if we’re expected to be in a low-r* environment.	93.0	91.0
201611	613	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Both President Rosengren and President Williams pointed to the fact that, in our present position, there’s not a lot of room to reduce short-term policy rates, and that’s going to be the case even if we get it up somewhat.	93.0	91.0
201611	614	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	So compared with our past experience, I think that’s likely to continue to be a problem.	93.0	91.0
201611	615	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I know it’s not popular, but having a discussion about whether or not we have the right inflation objective or some other price level targeting regime would be very useful, especially in view of where we are with the long-run framework.	93.0	91.0
201611	616	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Back to the idiosyncratic comments.	93.0	91.0
201611	617	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Thanks to everyone involved in producing these insightful analyses and memos.	93.0	91.0
201611	618	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	My staff and I had a good dialogue that challenged my understanding and preferences regarding possible future policy frameworks.	93.0	91.0
201611	619	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	In particular, the memos clarified a number of operational issues related to our monetary framework, and I found this useful.	93.0	91.0
201611	620	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	However, most of my comments today will reflect either a curmudgeonly nostalgia [laughter] for our previous operational framework or concerns about strategic risks that would come with a big change in our operating regime.	93.0	91.0
201611	621	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	The memos touched on many of these questions as well.	93.0	91.0
201611	622	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	First, the operational issues.	93.0	91.0
201611	623	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I previously expressed sympathy for a framework with a smaller balance sheet and scarce reserves so that we can go back to targeting the market rate in a sufficiently well-ordered federal funds market.	93.0	91.0
201611	624	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Such plans seem consistent with the Committee’s June 2011 exit principles as well as their update in September 2014.	93.0	91.0
201611	625	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Back then, the Committee indicated that when increases in policy rates are well under way, we will cease reinvesting maturing securities and let the balance sheet gradually shrink.	93.0	91.0
201611	626	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Many observers likely have assumed that this would lead to reserves becoming scarce and the funds rate tightening relative to the IOER rate.	93.0	91.0
201611	627	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	If this occurred, we’d be back to something similar to our previous operating system.	93.0	91.0
201611	628	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	But the long-run framework analysis suggests it’s quite possible that a robust federal funds market may not reemerge even if we return to a scarce reserves environment.	93.0	91.0
201611	629	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	One reason is that some elements of the post-crisis regulatory environment appropriately favor secured or term funding to meet the liquidity coverage ratio.	93.0	91.0
201611	630	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	As a result, depositories seem likely to rely less on unsecured overnight borrowing on the federal funds market to meet reserve requirements, and without a vibrant market, it may not be desirable to target the federal funds rate.	93.0	91.0
201611	631	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	If it’s impractical or undesirable to return to a tightly controlled target for the federal funds rate or the overnight bank funding rate, then it seems like we are led to using the IOER rate or an overnight secured rate like the Treasury repo rate as our formal policy target.	93.0	91.0
201611	632	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I understand the arguments in favor of running such a system with a large balance sheet, and I can appreciate that operating on the flat part of the reserves demand curve is appealing from the point of view of interest rate control.	93.0	91.0
201611	633	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I spent a good deal of time with my staff discussing something close to the third illustrative framework, an operating regime in which the target was a range for the repo rate and which included IOER, a large balance sheet, and a floor and ceiling facilities.	93.0	91.0
201611	634	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	While I won’t say that this is my preferred outcome, mulling over this regime highlighted a number of general framework issues for me.	93.0	91.0
201611	635	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	For example, our paramount aim is to pick a target rate that we can hit accurately as well as one that is a root pricing kernel for the interest rates that determine the degree of accommodation or restraint in the real economy.	93.0	91.0
201611	636	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	From a technical market standpoint, I see that targeting a repo rate and working with a broad set of counterparties has some appeal.	93.0	91.0
201611	637	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	But I wonder whether such a choice also could have implications for financial markets beyond basic monetary policy control.	93.0	91.0
201611	638	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	So I think there are benefits arising from better understanding the scale and composition of the financial market activities that we would be encouraging under these frameworks.	93.0	91.0
201611	639	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	For example, would our actions inadvertently change risk spreads in a way that might not be socially optimal?	93.0	91.0
201611	640	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	If our actions change risk spreads, we have to ask whether such changes in our framework are necessary for us to achieve our policy transmission goals, and if they are, whether we can communicate them in a way that the public would not perceive as simply promoting the interests of Wall Street.	93.0	91.0
201611	641	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Herein lies one of my main concerns, and perhaps this is just the nostalgia I mentioned at the outset for a simpler, smaller operating system, nostalgia for a system in which banks, both large and small, can see the way monetary policy interacts with them by a familiar and transparent federal funds market.	93.0	91.0
201611	642	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I think the memos plausibly describe how we will achieve monetary policy control with our operating procedure targets, something like a Treasury repo rate and a floor system with IOER.	93.0	91.0
201611	643	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Dealers and large and small banks will all see their funding conditions tightening or easing together as we alter our policy rates.	93.0	91.0
201611	644	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	So technically it all should work, but I worry that shifting the public focus of policy from well-known interactions with depositories to rates in the repo market might be seen as primarily benefiting Wall Street with no material benefit to Main Street.	93.0	91.0
201611	645	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	This would be a perception problem.	93.0	91.0
201611	646	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	A long US history of criticizing central banks centers precisely on issues like this.	93.0	91.0
201611	647	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Go back to the founding of the Federal Reserve and remember the contentious issues related to city versus country banks, as recounted in Friedman and Schwartz.	93.0	91.0
201611	648	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Admittedly, even in the pre-crisis period, explaining monetary policy transmission was not an easy task.	93.0	91.0
201611	649	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Still, the required reserve constraint that banks faced was relatively easy to describe to the public.	93.0	91.0
201611	650	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	In contrast, the Treasury repo rate transmission mechanism might conjure up to the naïve, like myself, visions of subsidies to Wall Street or meddling with capital market pricing adjustments.	93.0	91.0
201611	651	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Finally, I worry about the political economy risks to our independence if we run a large balance sheet.	93.0	91.0
201611	652	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Fiscal authorities have proven adept at discovering new pots of funding that do not obviously disadvantage their constituents the way that higher taxes do.	93.0	91.0
201611	653	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Even when the balance sheet was smaller, the Federal Reserve was sometimes used as a piggybank to finance expenditures.	93.0	91.0
201611	654	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	A scarce reserve system is not a panacea, but surely the risk is higher under a large balance sheet.	93.0	91.0
201611	655	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	To sum up, I’m coming around to the idea that the future might look more like the present.	93.0	91.0
201611	656	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	However, I think my fonder memories of our old operating framework are more than simply curmudgeonly nostalgia.	93.0	91.0
201611	657	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	My misgivings underscore some risks that we may need to better understand and assess.	93.0	91.0
201611	658	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	91.0
201611	659	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	660	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	93.0	65.0
201611	661	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	94.0
201611	662	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Let me thank the staff for these valuable summaries of key issues facing the Committee.	93.0	94.0
201611	663	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I know a lot of work went into this, and I think this is going to provide fodder for thought for the Committee for a long time.	93.0	94.0
201611	664	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I have a broad comment, and then I’m going to get to more specific comments.	93.0	94.0
201611	665	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I think my broad comment is consistent with what many around the table are saying, but perhaps my statement will be a bit stronger.	93.0	94.0
201611	666	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Normalization, as originally conceived by this Committee, is not proceeding as planned.	93.0	94.0
201611	667	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	The pace at which we are going, which is about one 25 basis point increase per year, is almost imperceptibly slow.	93.0	94.0
201611	668	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	The balance sheet is unlikely to decline via ceasing reinvestment any time soon.	93.0	94.0
201611	669	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I think it would be better for the Committee to state that we are not thinking in terms of a normalization program and that we instead think that the current level of the policy rate and the current size of the balance sheet are approximately correct, in light of the macroeconomic situation prevailing today and likely to prevail over the forecast horizon.	93.0	94.0
201611	670	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	In my view, this makes many of the issues addressed in the long-run framework project somewhat less urgent, as it appears that it may be many years before we are in a policy situation that is meaningfully different from the one that exists today.	93.0	94.0
201611	671	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	And in this I agree with Governor Powell’s assessment just a moment ago and those of many others around the table.	93.0	94.0
201611	672	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	At a minimum, I think that these issues would need to be discussed in detail when we are closer to a decision point on how we want to deviate from what we’re doing currently.	93.0	94.0
201611	673	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	That said, I’ll now turn to some brief comments centered on the questions posed to the Committee.	93.0	94.0
201611	674	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Regarding the first question, the so-called key design elements, I have a mild preference for a floor system with no reserve requirements and in which we use the overnight reverse repo rate as the policy rate.	93.0	94.0
201611	675	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I would prefer no gap between the overnight reverse repo rate and the IOER rate—the so-called no subsidies condition.	93.0	94.0
201611	676	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Concerning liquidity provision, the second question, I prefer to leave the discount window operations as they are.	93.0	94.0
201611	677	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I would be willing to consider a continually operational TAF with periodic testing, which could then be more fully utilized in the event of severe financial stress.	93.0	94.0
201611	678	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Finally, considering asset purchases as a policy tool for the future, I think it is a reality that asset purchases are the Committee’s most effective tool once the zero bound has been reached and are likely to be implemented by the Committee should we return to recession in the years ahead.	93.0	94.0
201611	679	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	However, because this is a discussion about the FOMC’s long-run policy framework, we may want to put more weight on three possibilities that could provide partial substitutes for asset purchases:  number one, price-level targeting; number two, nominal GDP targeting; and number three, targeting long-term interest rates more directly.	93.0	94.0
201611	680	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	It seems to me that the future of the Committee probably lies in one of these directions more than in the asset purchase direction, or at least as much probability should be assigned to these possibilities as to extensive use of asset purchases over the next decade or so, let’s say.	93.0	94.0
201611	681	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Now, if I turn back to limiting the discussion just to the balance sheet question, I have three further comments.	93.0	94.0
201611	682	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Number one, I think we should turn to asset purchases only after the effective lower bound has been reached, as several here have said.	93.0	94.0
201611	683	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I would rank asset purchases well ahead of a negative nominal interest rate policy in terms of likely effectiveness.	93.0	94.0
201611	684	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Number two, concerning the balance sheet as a financial-stability tool, as the staff suggested, I think this deserves further study.	93.0	94.0
201611	685	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I found former Governor Stein’s comments at the Jackson Hole symposium interesting, but the topic requires additional research.	93.0	94.0
201611	686	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	And, finally, on the long-run composition of the balance sheet, I would like to go with all Treasury securities, with an average duration under five years.	93.0	94.0
201611	687	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	94.0
201611	688	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	689	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	93.0	65.0
201611	690	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	999.0
201611	691	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	I’d also like to thank the team for some great work.	93.0	999.0
201611	692	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	You provided a real wealth of information that was very thought-provoking, so I want to thank you.	93.0	999.0
201611	693	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	In my thinking, we can start making some progress by first identifying some design aspects that appear desirable across a wide range of frameworks and, thus, once selected, would not constrain our choices in the future.	93.0	999.0
201611	694	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Second, I would like to pose some questions and offer some thoughts on the higher-level issues.	93.0	999.0
201611	695	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Progress on these issues has the potential to drive the design of much of the long-run framework and, thus, substantially narrow our choices.	93.0	999.0
201611	696	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	In doing that, I will comment on the questions posed by Thomas and Simon’s memo.	93.0	999.0
201611	697	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	What are the possible aspects of the framework that are desirable pretty much independently over the overall design and that could occur sooner rather than later, not waiting for the full implementation of a long-run framework?	93.0	999.0
201611	698	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Some of these have already been mentioned.	93.0	999.0
201611	699	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	In my view, it seems desirable to get rid of remaining reserve requirements.	93.0	999.0
201611	700	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	They are outdated, impose a costly burden on both banks and us, and foster avoidance practices.	93.0	999.0
201611	701	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Reserve requirements may only be essential in a corridor system with a very small balance sheet such as we employed before the crisis, and I don’t envision returning to that system any time soon.	93.0	999.0
201611	702	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Second, I think that the memo’s discussion of alternative arrangements for liquidity provision belongs in this category.	93.0	999.0
201611	703	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	We should better delineate the goals of interest rate control and liquidity provision, both broad and idiosyncratic, into separate facilities.	93.0	999.0
201611	704	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	In terms of establishing a ceiling on rates, whether one prefers a deposit institution repo facility or the financial institution repo facility, may depend on the overall framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	705	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	But in any case, a separate facility designed exclusively for interest-rate control would potentially avoid stigmatizing borrowing.	93.0	999.0
201611	706	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Similarly, as others have said, I view the TAF as the best way to provide broad liquidity, as it avoids stigma, and it should be kept operationally ready for situations deemed appropriate by the Committee.	93.0	999.0
201611	707	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Further, the discount window should be used exclusively for those idiosyncratic liquidity needs.	93.0	999.0
201611	708	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Finally, as others have mentioned, I think it’s important that we’re ready to move away from the federal funds rate to the overnight bank funding rate, the OBFR, because we may actually find ourselves with no choice but to do so.	93.0	999.0
201611	709	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	The federal funds market is basically one change in business practices, either by the Federal Home Loan Banks or foreign banks, from pretty much disappearing.	93.0	999.0
201611	710	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	We should continue the effort spearheaded by the New York Federal Reserve to expand data coverage to onshore deposits, which would facilitate communication and avoid the perception that the Eurodollar market is a foreign market.	93.0	999.0
201611	711	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	In contrast, I am particularly uncomfortable with the general level of rates option.	93.0	999.0
201611	712	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	It may be difficult to achieve, as various rates can diverge from time to time, and communicating why a particularly weighted composite average is good policy would not be easy, as I don’t think we have any idea what those weights should be.	93.0	999.0
201611	713	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Let me now delve into some of the higher-level questions and some tentative answers that could help drive many of the operational choices we face.	93.0	999.0
201611	714	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	An important question is whether we should actively use the balance sheet for financial stability concerns in normal times.	93.0	999.0
201611	715	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	If so, then many aspects of the operating regime will be subservient to financial-stability issues.	93.0	999.0
201611	716	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	For example, decisions on how much public money-like assets should be provided would basically determine the size of the balance sheet, and concerns over maturity transformation would affect this composition in terms of maturity.	93.0	999.0
201611	717	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	I think, as the staff emphasized, we know very little about how the size and composition of our balance sheet affects financial stability.	93.0	999.0
201611	718	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Furthermore, providing for an allocation of government liabilities with a particular term structure would require coordination with the Treasury, which I find to be problematic.	93.0	999.0
201611	719	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Similarly, I would also avoid buying MBS or other credit market assets, as doing so distorts asset allocation and opens up the door to political pressures for supporting various borrowers and lenders at the expense of others.	93.0	999.0
201611	720	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	More generally, I would not be in favor of the balance sheet being an instrument in normal times.	93.0	999.0
201611	721	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Coordinating both tools would pose challenges, and it would be difficult to communicate the exact reasoning for any policy mix, because, theoretically and empirically, we don’t know with enough certainty what the effects of the balance-sheet changes will be.	93.0	999.0
201611	722	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Another issue that others have discussed surrounds the use of negative interest rates as opposed to LSAPs as the primary alternative tool for additional policy accommodation at the effective lower bound.	93.0	999.0
201611	723	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	If we view negative rates as our first line of defense at the lower bound, then the operating regime must be ready for them.	93.0	999.0
201611	724	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	I am not a big fan of negative interest rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	725	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	They may send alarming signals, could be politically unpalatable, and are potentially damaging to commercial banks’ balance sheets.	93.0	999.0
201611	726	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	When necessary, I would much rather resort to asset purchases, but that implies that we must be willing to unwind past LSAPs as part of the normalization process or we could end up with an excessively large balance sheet, with negative remittances and their associated political risk becoming increasingly likely.	93.0	999.0
201611	727	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Another central question for me is the use of voluntary reserve targets.	93.0	999.0
201611	728	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Theoretically, they appear attractive because they can be used at any desired level of the balance sheet, expanding our choices while providing for an active interbank market.	93.0	999.0
201611	729	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	An active interbank market would allow us to return to money market conditions—maybe I am a curmudgeon, too, President Evans—that prevailed before the crisis and still allow for fairly precise control over short-term rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	730	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	In the language of the memo, we would be able to operate on the steep part of the demand for reserves at the level of our choice.	93.0	999.0
201611	731	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	VRT would, thus, also put policy on familiar grounds and separate considerations of balance sheet size from interest rate adjustments.	93.0	999.0
201611	732	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	But— and I emphasize “but”	93.0	999.0
201611	733	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	—there are issues concerning whether the VRT chosen by the banks will always be consistent with our desired level of reserves.	93.0	999.0
201611	734	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	It is not totally clear whether the Desk will need to perform large and frequent open market operations for the funds rate to be consistent with the desired target.	93.0	999.0
201611	735	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	The extent to which this had the potential to cause problems will depend on the degree of interest-rate volatility we are prepared to accept.	93.0	999.0
201611	736	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Thus, VRT is not “ready for prime time,” but I do think it’s worth further study.	93.0	999.0
201611	737	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	My final big-picture issue is whether actively targeting a repo rate is really a viable alternative to targeting the OBFR.	93.0	999.0
201611	738	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Such a move would potentially have large implications for the operating regime and balance sheet size.	93.0	999.0
201611	739	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Although the memo circulated made a good start on this complex topic, I don’t consider this a viable option at present.	93.0	999.0
201611	740	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Basically, I don’t think we possess a deep enough understanding of the changing regulatory environment and the market structure effects of a permanent Federal Reserve presence in the repo market to proceed confidently at this moment.	93.0	999.0
201611	741	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	999.0
201611	742	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	743	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	93.0	65.0
201611	744	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to the working group for this great work.	93.0	110.0
201611	745	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Let me mention three aspects of discussions I have had with my team as we wrestled through some of these issues.	93.0	110.0
201611	746	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	The number one issue we talked about was how hard it is to discuss these issues separately from talking about the realities of monetary policy.	93.0	110.0
201611	747	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	In particular, and to return to what President Williams talked about on r*, our view is that unless there are fiscal policy structural reforms, infrastructure spending, or other actions, r*, all things being equal, is going to be low for an extended period of time.	93.0	110.0
201611	748	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	If that’s going to be the reality, it’s harder to have this discussion.	93.0	110.0
201611	749	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Assuming there are other economic policy actions that help improve prospective economic growth rates and, therefore, give us more operating maneuverability, my team and I totally agree with an objective to operate on the flat part of the demand curve for reserves, with a balance sheet ideally smaller than the one we have today—and I might even go so far as to say as small as possible, but certainly smaller than the one we have today—with the Federal Reserve owning as small a percentage of safe assets as is feasible.	93.0	110.0
201611	750	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Like others, I’m much more comfortable with our owning Treasury securities than MBS.	93.0	110.0
201611	751	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	The Treasury market is a big liquid market, and the Federal Reserve owning sizable portions of Treasury securities is unlikely to affect the dynamics of that market materially.	93.0	110.0
201611	752	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	My concern is that we could have a big effect, and we probably already are, in the MBS market.	93.0	110.0
201611	753	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	So while we may have some minimum working level of MBS, I’d prefer to keep it as small as possible.	93.0	110.0
201611	754	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	With those objectives, we also came to the view that an administrative rate or the OBFR might make more sense as a target than the federal funds rate.	93.0	110.0
201611	755	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	And, clearly, we would need to employ other tools, such as the IOER rate.	93.0	110.0
201611	756	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	The biggest issue we wrestled with, though, is—I guess I’ve learned a new acronym, PE—the effect on the political economy.	93.0	110.0
201611	757	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	In particular, we debated extensively the need for the Federal Reserve to be independent and the importance to this country of a strong, independent central bank.	93.0	110.0
201611	758	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	My concern is that if the Fed’s balance sheet stays large and there’s a prospect of it getting larger, certainly away from a crisis, we are likely to induce accusations that the Federal Reserve has overstepped its bounds, which I fear will reduce our scope to act in a crisis when action is actually needed.	93.0	110.0
201611	759	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I think a large balance sheet, or a sizable balance sheet, is probably going to be accompanied by calls for review of our communication practices, transparency, and how we deal with our various constituencies.	93.0	110.0
201611	760	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	So all things being equal, I, for one, would like to see us take every opportunity to reduce the size of the balance sheet, and I’m very leery of alternatives that would call for a larger balance sheet, for fear that it might ultimately reduce our independence and our ability to act when there is a crisis.	93.0	110.0
201611	761	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	110.0
201611	762	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	763	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	93.0	65.0
201611	764	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	97.0
201611	765	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I’d like to associate myself with the perspective introduced by Presidents Rosengren and Williams and echoed, at least briefly, by Presidents Evans and Kaplan.	93.0	97.0
201611	766	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	That is to say, I think the most important thing for us to be focusing on now is, as President Williams said, not necessarily the implementation framework but the framework.	93.0	97.0
201611	767	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	President Williams’s point, which he made today and has made in his paper, is that in a world of low r*, one needs to think about what your monetary policy framework is and consider alternatives that heretofore haven’t been particularly attractive to people.	93.0	97.0
201611	768	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I think what President Rosengren did in complementing President Williams’s approach was basically to ask us to hypothesize that some external event causes a recession in the relatively near term and ask how we would respond.	93.0	97.0
201611	769	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Those are somewhat distinct things to ask about, but I think they fit together.	93.0	97.0
201611	770	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And, indeed, those concerns have informed my position on meeting-to-meeting monetary policy, that is, my concern that we have relatively few tools to deploy—or at least attractive tools to deploy—in the event that we were to get a recession.	93.0	97.0
201611	771	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	So I very much agree with them and with President Williams’s point that a lot of the implementation issues will, if not fall easily out of that analysis, be a little bit more obvious and the choices perhaps a bit more circumscribed.	93.0	97.0
201611	772	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I might note, in that regard, that I thought Rob framed it exactly right.	93.0	97.0
201611	773	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	We can hope that other things happen—that there’s fiscal stimulus, that there’s structural reform—but we can’t count on it, and so we need to be thinking about options.	93.0	97.0
201611	774	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And a related point is, it’s not enough to say, “Oh, gee, there are downsides to some of the options that are out there.”	93.0	97.0
201611	775	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Well, yes, negative interest rates have downsides.	93.0	97.0
201611	776	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	A higher inflation rate has a downside.	93.0	97.0
201611	777	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Nominal interest rate targeting has a downside.	93.0	97.0
201611	778	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But so, too, as many people have pointed out, does further growth of the balance sheet have a downside, and it might not even be particularly efficacious if the slope of the yield curve hasn’t risen very much.	93.0	97.0
201611	779	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Another LSAP may well not even do the trick were we to take on some of the additional political vulnerability.	93.0	97.0
201611	780	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	So I just want to reinforce the most important point to focus on.	93.0	97.0
201611	781	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	As a corollary, I will say I wouldn’t dismiss all of the balance sheet issues out of hand— even though I agree with those who have said that it’s sort of provisional and we don’t really know about the effects—precisely because of my first point, which is we just don’t know what kind of tools we’re going to have and what the downsides of those tools are going to be.	93.0	97.0
201611	782	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I think looking at some of the issues associated with maintaining a larger balance sheet or at whether there would be utility in having different durations on the balance sheet and buying and selling those is very much worth consideration, precisely because we might find ourselves constrained in our overall monetary policy and have to use a tool that does have some costs but whose benefits might be more important.	93.0	97.0
201611	783	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I do have one quite discrete suggestion, though, in the context of the particular memos that the staff has done.	93.0	97.0
201611	784	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	There was a passing reference in one of the memos to the possibility of changing the qualifications for those who participate in the ON RRP program, and some of you may recall that my concern at the outset of our institution of the ON RRP was the potential for counterparties using the Federal Reserve as a place to run from other short-term funding destinations when stress built up in the economy.	93.0	97.0
201611	785	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I was particularly concerned about prime money market funds doing that, yanking their CP from large banks and sticking it in the Federal Reserve at the first sign of stress.	93.0	97.0
201611	786	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	The SEC’s reform package, coupled with the reaction of the industry and of investors, which was, I will say, greater than what I certainly had anticipated has provided an opportunity now, as prime funds are what, Simon?	93.0	97.0
201611	787	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Down to about 200?	93.0	97.0
201611	788	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Institutional funds, 200.	93.0	999.0
201611	789	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Yes, institutional prime down to about 200.	93.0	97.0
201611	790	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	So this may be an opportunity for us to narrow the formal qualifications for being a counterparty, for example, to a fund that invests only in government securities, but to do so in a fashion that doesn’t have an enormous practical effect, because that’s what most of the funds are now.	93.0	97.0
201611	791	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I would hope that maybe we could pursue that a little bit in the shorter term, so that we don’t lose the opportunity to do it, particularly if the prime funds have a bit of a resurrection over the next year or so if investors perhaps come back or spreads change or something of the sort.	93.0	97.0
201611	792	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	The other thing I’d say is that neither of the issues that Vice Chairman Dudley raised at the end of his comments—that is, to make a change in the leverage ratio or regulatory requirement, or to be able to lend to broker-dealers—is within the authority of this Committee.	93.0	97.0
201611	793	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	So I don’t feel the need to comment at length.	93.0	97.0
201611	794	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But at least on the leverage ratio point, I did want to say I’m not quite sure I would have framed the issue the way Vice Chairman Dudley did.	93.0	97.0
201611	795	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	First, the whole purpose of a leverage ratio conceptually is not to focus on issues of risk.	93.0	97.0
201611	796	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	So the risk-free nature of reserves is not really relevant to the conceptualization of a leverage ratio as part of a complementary set of capital requirements.	93.0	97.0
201611	797	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Second, although it is true that the banking system as a whole does not have the ability to affect the amount of reserves in the system, the activities and conduct of any particular bank do have an effect on the relative reserve holdings that it has, and there are regulatory benefits that come from having those reserves.	93.0	97.0
201611	798	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	So, in some sense, as in many areas, this is a balancing that the banks need to engage in.	93.0	97.0
201611	799	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But third, and maybe most importantly, it seems to me premature to draw any judgments on this right now not only because of the debate that’s going on in this room today, but also because, not having implemented all of the risk-based reform requirements, we don’t really yet have a good picture as to the degree to which the large banks that very much want a change in the leverage ratio will be scraping up against that in a way that we would regard as counterproductive.	93.0	97.0
201611	800	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	So it’s obviously something that people are watching, but there are other ways to deal with a problem that may be established over the years other than the exclusion of one asset from the denominator.	93.0	97.0
201611	801	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And that’s sort of the way in which regulators, particularly those from noncentral banks, have leaned, even though central bankers sort of like the idea that their asset is the one that would get excluded.	93.0	97.0
201611	802	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Finance ministries like the idea that their asset is the one that would get excluded.	93.0	97.0
201611	803	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And you can see why, as a conceptual matter, academics have tended to say that’s why you don’t exclude anything.	93.0	97.0
201611	804	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	97.0
201611	805	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	806	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	93.0	65.0
201611	807	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	103.0
201611	808	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	I, too, thank the staff for their work over the past year to bring the discussions we’ve had in July and today.	93.0	103.0
201611	809	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	I will also jump on the President Williams bandwagon, because as I looked at this material, I found the various tradeoffs left me thinking about what’s the appropriate starting point for a framework, in view of the realities we face today.	93.0	103.0
201611	810	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	I think there are many ways we could go about it, as some have already suggested, but I thought about it in the context of the size of our balance sheet in the longer run as one approach.	93.0	103.0
201611	811	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	In light of the importance of this issue, it’s worth certainly more discussion among this Committee to get a sense of where we’re ultimately going.	93.0	103.0
201611	812	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	As it relates to the questions the staff asked, I see the benefits of a leaner balance sheet.	93.0	103.0
201611	813	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Political issues that arise with payment of interest on a large stock of reserves and credit allocation pose a number of risks that come with a very large balance sheet.	93.0	103.0
201611	814	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, if the equilibrium real rate remains low, a leaner balance sheet would give us more scope to use large-scale asset purchases if we are, again, at the lower bound, rather than expanding the balance sheet further into uncharted territory or contemplating negative policy rates.	93.0	103.0
201611	815	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Of course, transitioning to a leaner balance sheet poses its own challenges.	93.0	103.0
201611	816	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	While I understand this work is about the framework in the long run, it seems one part of the discussion that could be missing is talking about the costs and benefits of a possible transition to a leaner balance sheet.	93.0	103.0
201611	817	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	A lean balance sheet, however, does not need to resemble its pre-crisis composition.	93.0	103.0
201611	818	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	From this standpoint, I’m not sure we necessarily need to operate on the steep portion of the demand curve for reserves.	93.0	103.0
201611	819	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	If we remain on the flat portion, then it may make sense to consider an alternative policy rate, including the OBFR.	93.0	103.0
201611	820	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	In this case, a reconsideration on the longer-run plans regarding the overnight RRP facility is also warranted.	93.0	103.0
201611	821	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	I could imagine a scenario with a leaner balance sheet, a standing ON RRP facility, and the OBFR as the target.	93.0	103.0
201611	822	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	The leaner balance sheet would provide a lower cap on the ON RRP facility, and that would give me more comfort if it were to be integrated into our framework on a more permanent basis.	93.0	103.0
201611	823	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Of course, there would be significant changes that would require a communication to the public and a revisiting of the current normalization principles and plans.	93.0	103.0
201611	824	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of the liquidity provision options, the tradeoffs between providing backstop lending, interest rate control, and moral hazard are not new ones.	93.0	103.0
201611	825	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	I think further analysis would be needed, and I’m interested in how separate facilities might support different liquidity needs in the future.	93.0	103.0
201611	826	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	And as some have commented, I, too, believe that thinking about the TAF as a standing facility has some merit.	93.0	103.0
201611	827	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	103.0
201611	828	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	829	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	93.0	65.0
201611	830	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	999.0
201611	831	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I am going to add my two thumbs up to the Federal Reserve System staff for their efforts and insights.	93.0	999.0
201611	832	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Obviously, it was a Herculean effort, and the memos that you provided are very useful in helping guide us through a lot of these issues.	93.0	999.0
201611	833	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I think the memos make a fairly compelling case that a number of different long-run frameworks would allow us to implement monetary policy effectively with sufficient interest rate control and transmission to market rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	834	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	So the choices are dependent on our preferences about other issues, and a few of those issues loom large for me.	93.0	999.0
201611	835	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	First, I would prefer that the Federal Reserve not have a large footprint across markets in normal times.	93.0	999.0
201611	836	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Our design of the framework will affect financial market participants’ behavior and the structure of financial markets.	93.0	999.0
201611	837	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	While the Federal Reserve should promote the orderly functioning of markets, we should not choose a framework that will lead us to displace private- sector financial markets.	93.0	999.0
201611	838	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I don’t think the Federal Reserve should be the main intermediary.	93.0	999.0
201611	839	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	We should be the lender of last resort, not first resort.	93.0	999.0
201611	840	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	For example, I believe if the Federal Reserve were to crowd out all private-sector maturity transformation with an aim of promoting financial stability, as discussed in the staff’s balance-sheet memo, we might actually find ourselves with less financial stability, as firms wouldn’t be taking actions to ensure they could obtain liquidity from the markets, nor would they have incentives to monitor one another.	93.0	999.0
201611	841	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Also, it’s an open question as to what the efficient size of the financial sector is.	93.0	999.0
201611	842	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	If an excessive volume of private short-term Treasury security-like liabilities are being created in the market, we need to know more about why these assets are being demanded.	93.0	999.0
201611	843	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	It is not clear to me that, if the Federal Reserve were always to meet the market’s demand for such assets, we wouldn’t be engendering inefficient expansion of the financial sector and encouraging more risk- taking, not less.	93.0	999.0
201611	844	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Associated with this, I lean toward frameworks that are less complex—I guess “parsimonious,” perhaps.	93.0	999.0
201611	845	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Rather than a single structure that can handle all possible contingencies and that would be costly to maintain, I prefer a framework that would work fairly well in normal times but be nimble enough to be augmented by additional tools during times of market dysfunction and stress.	93.0	999.0
201611	846	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I support the Desk’s efforts to expand the number of counterparties with which we normally engage, but I don’t think we should broadly expand all of the types of financial institutions with which we engage in normal times.	93.0	999.0
201611	847	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	With the equilibrium interest rate expected to remain lower than it was before the crisis, the probability of returning to the effective lower bound on the policy rate has increased.	93.0	999.0
201611	848	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	We need to be operationally prepared to engage in asset purchases in these situations when we’ve reached the lower bound.	93.0	999.0
201611	849	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	But, in normal times, I prefer not using asset purchases as a standard tool of policy.	93.0	999.0
201611	850	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	We have less experience with this tool, and it isn’t clear how to achieve appropriate coordination of the policy rate and asset purchases away from the lower bound.	93.0	999.0
201611	851	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	So I’d prefer the simpler approach:  keeping asset purchases for extraordinary times.	93.0	999.0
201611	852	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Second, political economy issues loom large for me.	93.0	999.0
201611	853	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I’d like to maintain the separation between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury to the extent we can.	93.0	999.0
201611	854	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I believe that if we run policy with a large balance sheet, we have to acknowledge that we would more likely be subjecting ourselves to increased political pressures to take on a wider array of assets than I’d feel comfortable with.	93.0	999.0
201611	855	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The Federal Reserve’s long-standing desire to avoid allocating credit to particular market segments has served to protect the independence of monetary policy from short-run political influence, and I believe this independence has served the public well.	93.0	999.0
201611	856	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Our commitment to avoid this type of pressure would be to bring the asset composition of the balance sheet back to comprising solely Treasury securities.	93.0	999.0
201611	857	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	This is the goal stated in the Committee’s published normalization principles.	93.0	999.0
201611	858	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	An all-Treasuries portfolio is feasible in a corridor framework, but it isn’t clear to me whether such a portfolio is feasible in a large-balance-sheet floor framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	859	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The staff memo says there’s uncertainty about the level of reserves at which the demand curve for reserves flattens out.	93.0	999.0
201611	860	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	It would be good to have some numerical estimates of the shape of this demand curve and how it might change with the level of interest rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	861	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Banks currently hold $2.3 trillion in reserves.	93.0	999.0
201611	862	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	What’s the effective minimum size of reserves for our being able to run an effective floor system?	93.0	999.0
201611	863	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	And, in such a system, would the Federal Reserve be able to operate with a portfolio of only Treasury securities without holding a very high share of outstanding and new issues of Treasury securities, which we would want to avoid?	93.0	999.0
201611	864	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I think we need to know more about this before we can make some tactical choices about the framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	865	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The political economy issues that would arise if the Federal Reserve were to issue its own short-term liabilities, so-called Federal Reserve bills or Fed bills, also makes going down that path undesirable to me.	93.0	999.0
201611	866	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	And, as I mentioned earlier, I’m not convinced they would necessarily lead to more-stable financial markets.	93.0	999.0
201611	867	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Third, communications issues are also important to me.	93.0	999.0
201611	868	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I appreciate the memo on communications that was circulated to the research directors.	93.0	999.0
201611	869	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Communications considerations also lead me to think simplicity is better.	93.0	999.0
201611	870	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Even if we were to choose an administered rate as our target, we will need to provide the public with some guidance on a market rate by which we gauge the stance of policy.	93.0	999.0
201611	871	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I think communications would be simpler if we use a market rate as our target.	93.0	999.0
201611	872	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	If we opt for a floor system, then the IOER rate would be an important tool for implementation, but our communications would focus on the market rate.	93.0	999.0
201611	873	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I’d be interested in further work on how the public would understand a shift in the interest rate we might choose as a target, perhaps drawing on foreign experience.	93.0	999.0
201611	874	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Associated with communications is governance related to our choice of the interest rate target.	93.0	999.0
201611	875	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Since gaining the ability to pay interest on reserves, we have successfully dealt with the governance issue arising from the fact that the IOER rate is set by the Board of Governors, while the FOMC has purview over monetary policy.	93.0	999.0
201611	876	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Our normalization principles are clear that the FOMC sets the target range for the funds rate and uses the IOER rate to move the funds rate into that target range.	93.0	999.0
201611	877	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Even though we internally agree that the FOMC is responsible for monetary policy, I’d be concerned about the communications issues that would arise if the IOER rate were chosen as our target rate.	93.0	999.0
201611	878	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	That is another reason I prefer choosing a market rate as our target.	93.0	999.0
201611	879	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The funds rate is most familiar, but using it as a target would depend on whether the interbank market remains robust enough so that the rate is tied to other market rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	880	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Finally, I support the approach we’ve taken of first focusing on the long-run framework and evaluating the costs and benefits of each option.	93.0	999.0
201611	881	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	But before we can make a final choice, we’re going to need to have a better understanding of the transition costs when moving to the desired framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	882	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	For example, if we desire to move back to a corridor system, we’d need to shrink the balance sheet substantially.	93.0	999.0
201611	883	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	What would be the appropriate transition path?	93.0	999.0
201611	884	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	What would be the costs?	93.0	999.0
201611	885	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Perhaps a lower equilibrium real funds rate, as discussed earlier, would be the outcome.	93.0	999.0
201611	886	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	These considerations are important.	93.0	999.0
201611	887	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	We need to think about the transition costs and paths, and I would welcome the staffs to begin to work on that.	93.0	999.0
201611	888	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	It may be that some things are going to be ruled out because we really can’t get there from here within any appropriate time frame.	93.0	999.0
201611	889	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	And I also would appreciate thinking more about what would be our appropriate long-run framework in a low-r* environment.	93.0	999.0
201611	890	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I think there are other aspects, other than the operational issues that the memos cover, that are important.	93.0	999.0
201611	891	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	999.0
201611	892	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	893	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	93.0	65.0
201611	894	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair, and I’d like to thank the staff as well for the excellent work.	93.0	111.0
201611	895	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I appreciate a lot of the comments around the table about focusing first on the broader framework and then on the implementation issues.	93.0	111.0
201611	896	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I think that would be worth spending time exploring.	93.0	111.0
201611	897	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	One thing that I’m struggling with—and this may be a topic more for tomorrow than for today—is that many people around the table are concerned that we are in a low-r* environment for the foreseeable future, yet at the same time there seems to be momentum building for raising rates.	93.0	111.0
201611	898	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I find those two things somewhat inconsistent, but maybe we can talk about that tomorrow.	93.0	111.0
201611	899	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	In terms of implementation, it strikes me that switching costs are high because there’s a big downside risk if something doesn’t work.	93.0	111.0
201611	900	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	So we shouldn’t make changes unless there is a compelling reason to make changes.	93.0	111.0
201611	901	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	The FOMC had compelling reason during the crisis to switch from a corridor system to a floor system, and that shift was successful.	93.0	111.0
201611	902	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	But in light of that, as the staff said, all the various frameworks seem to work, and what we are doing now seems to be working pretty well, there doesn’t seem to be a compelling reason to make a big change any time soon.	93.0	111.0
201611	903	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I think the Chair mentioned this in her comments.	93.0	111.0
201611	904	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	For me, when I look at where we are and where we’re going, I favor a more passive framework, something that requires lower-frequency activity and lower cost.	93.0	111.0
201611	905	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	And that pushes me toward staying in the floor environment, preferably with an administered rate, under which we focus our market rates expressed in a range, so that we’re not in and out of the markets very actively.	93.0	111.0
201611	906	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	To me, like many others, this also raises governance questions, but I think they can be addressed.	93.0	111.0
201611	907	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	And I would encourage the staff to do some work to see how we could maintain the FOMC’s role in that environment.	93.0	111.0
201611	908	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Like many others, I do think the discount window seems to be broken, and I would encourage us to do more work on what reforms could look like.	93.0	111.0
201611	909	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	In terms of the balance sheet, I, too, view the large-scale asset purchases as a tool to use when we are at the effective lower bound or in periods of market stress.	93.0	111.0
201611	910	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I’d like to see the balance sheet return to maybe not pre-crisis levels, but as small as necessary to stay in the floor environment.	93.0	111.0
201611	911	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I am not excited about getting into the active yield curve management business.	93.0	111.0
201611	912	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I think it’s hard enough to manage short-term interest rates and to express our reaction function to markets, let alone actively managing the yield curve.	93.0	111.0
201611	913	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I think it implies a level of wisdom that maybe we may or may not have.	93.0	111.0
201611	914	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Finally, I am skeptical that a large balance sheet is necessarily good for financial stability.	93.0	111.0
201611	915	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I understand the theory of crowding out maturity transformation, but if we’re simultaneously pushing up asset prices, it isn’t at all clear that a large balance sheet is a net benefit for financial stability.	93.0	111.0
201611	916	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	But, again, it’s worth doing more work on.	93.0	111.0
201611	917	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	111.0
201611	918	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	919	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	93.0	65.0
201611	920	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	108.0
201611	921	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Like everyone, I am grateful to the staff for its work in producing this comprehensive set of documents.	93.0	108.0
201611	922	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	This is an important stage in thinking through how we’re going to move ahead and where we’re heading.	93.0	108.0
201611	923	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I’m sure that wherever we’re heading is not a final destination, but that there’s going to be many more changes in the financial system as time goes by.	93.0	108.0
201611	924	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I’m certainly happy, for the moment, to live with the current system, the IOER rate floor with abundant reserves combined with the overnight RRP facility.	93.0	108.0
201611	925	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	That system seems to be working pretty well at the moment and should continue to be a viable option for some time into the future.	93.0	108.0
201611	926	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And I’d guess that it may be close to the system to which we converge 5 to 10 years down the road.	93.0	108.0
201611	927	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	But we should acknowledge the potential political cost of paying interest on a large stock of reserves as well as another PE problem, which is that a large balance sheet is a standing invitation to even the most financially conservative of governments to raid the central bank.	93.0	108.0
201611	928	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Two of the central banks that were raided were the Swiss central bank and the German central bank, whose gold reserves got to be worth too much and the government took funds away.	93.0	108.0
201611	929	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Big balance sheets are politically problematic at times, and we need to be careful about that.	93.0	108.0
201611	930	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I’d support efforts to shrink the size of the balance sheet, but it’s not clear how far we should go, and we’re going to have to work on that in the months and even years ahead.	93.0	108.0
201611	931	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	In doing that, I was interested, as the study points out, that Australia and other countries are actually doing different things.	93.0	108.0
201611	932	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	For example, the DIRF and the FIRF, the standing facilities that allow either depository institutions or financial institutions to run a balance at the central bank, are being used in the United Kingdom and in Europe.	93.0	108.0
201611	933	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	It would be interesting to know how useful they are in determining the size of the reserves.	93.0	108.0
201611	934	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Similarly, the statement that was made about how Australia is dealing with stigma was very interesting.	93.0	108.0
201611	935	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I think it’s very similar to the main proposal that’s made in Mervyn King’s recent book on how to reform the entire financial system.	93.0	108.0
201611	936	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Again, we need to know how well these things are working, if they’ve started to work at all.	93.0	108.0
201611	937	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The Australian one sounds particularly interesting, because I couldn’t quite figure out how the three proposals we had for different facilities that would handle different uses of reserves would deal with the stigma problem.	93.0	108.0
201611	938	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I think that is absolutely critical because when a bank has a good reason for running into trouble and we don’t want it to collapse, lending to it makes sense, and it would be useful not to have the stigma.	93.0	108.0
201611	939	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	On the LSAPs and when we use them, I’m not quite sure of the logic of what we’re saying.	93.0	108.0
201611	940	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	If we are going to be prepared to use LSAPs, I don’t see why we should run ourselves all the way down to zero and then start using the LSAPs.	93.0	108.0
201611	941	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	That means we’re more likely to hit the effective lower bound than we would be otherwise, and I’m not sure we want to be there if reasonably sized operations in the assets that we have could be used to prevent us getting to zero.	93.0	108.0
201611	942	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I think we need to rethink the view that we have to change regimes very sharply rather than slide into them with the hope that by sliding, you increase the probability that you’re not going to get to where it looks like you’re going.	93.0	108.0
201611	943	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I want to talk a little bit more about the balance sheet as a tool for managing financial stability concerns.	93.0	108.0
201611	944	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	There are suggestions that we should structure the balance sheet in such a way that it makes it easier for us to intervene in a variety of circumstances or in a variety of industries that might get into trouble.	93.0	108.0
201611	945	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Obviously the one that is clear is housing, and we’re already doing that as part of our portfolio.	93.0	108.0
201611	946	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think we should go too far on this because we’re going to look like micromanagers of the economy if we’ve got this little fund for that industry and another little fund for another industry, and so forth.	93.0	108.0
201611	947	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Anyway, the financial markets kept working to some extent even during the Great Financial Crisis.	93.0	108.0
201611	948	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	So I think that our normal mode of operation, which is to set the interest rate and to leave it to the markets to decide on the allocation of the resulting changes in credit, is the right mode, both politically and economically.	93.0	108.0
201611	949	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And the politics are very complicated.	93.0	108.0
201611	950	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We’re not elected officials, and when we start deciding that we should be intervening in this industry or the other, we would be making decisions that are much closer to being political than what we do when we deal with the overall balance sheet.	93.0	108.0
201611	951	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think it’s a big problem if the balance sheet, which obviously would continue to include short-term government obligations, included long bonds.	93.0	108.0
201611	952	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	This is related to the fact that the model that we use for most of our simulations and forecasts actually relies on the long rate to affect output and not the short rate.	93.0	108.0
201611	953	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Now, either the model is wrong, and possibly that’s the end of that story, or if the model is right, then I think having long-term bonds could be useful.	93.0	108.0
201611	954	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And then, at least at present I don’t think we should get rid of the MBS in a given morning, but I’m not sure we want to keep a big supply of MBS there.	93.0	108.0
201611	955	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We can intervene in that market, if the need arises, with our general balance sheet.	93.0	108.0
201611	956	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I also suspect that the more we go into specific areas, the more political problems we’re going to have, and that we just shouldn’t do it.	93.0	108.0
201611	957	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Monetary policy should be macroeconomic, not microeconomic.	93.0	108.0
201611	958	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	93.0	108.0
201611	959	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	960	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	93.0	65.0
201611	961	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	107.0
201611	962	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Let me join everybody else in thanking the staff for the very thoughtful memos.	93.0	107.0
201611	963	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	The key considerations associated with our longer-run framework entail important tradeoffs, and the information needed to weigh them is necessarily very incomplete as a result of the unusual circumstances, which we still find ourselves in today, that led to the expansion of the balance sheet and a number of fundamental changes that have taken place concurrently.	93.0	107.0
201611	964	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Short-term money markets continue to evolve, as does the demand for reserves, while the effect of our balance sheet on liquidity and maturity transformation and on economic activity more generally is difficult to estimate.	93.0	107.0
201611	965	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	This is especially true because the regulatory environment affecting money markets changed dramatically during the same time period, and technology is changing these markets in important ways.	93.0	107.0
201611	966	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	I want to associate myself with the consideration introduced by President Lockhart that in this environment, it’s very difficult to evaluate the desired end state without taking into account the initial conditions that we’re starting from and considerations associated with the transition path.	93.0	107.0
201611	967	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	I also would associate myself with the sentiment introduced by President Williams that it is impossible to separate these considerations from considerations regarding the appropriate monetary policy and macroeconomic framework.	93.0	107.0
201611	968	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Indeed, it was the dawning recognition of the substantial change in the neutral rate of interest that led us initially to change the language in paragraph 5 last December to say, essentially, that we would not contemplate any reinvestment until normalization was well under way.	93.0	107.0
201611	969	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	And I think markets have responded to that as we anticipated.	93.0	107.0
201611	970	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	I will, having said that, try to assess the thought experiment that you put on the table for us.	93.0	107.0
201611	971	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	But, again, I hope that, as we go forward, we’ll be able to integrate those different elements.	93.0	107.0
201611	972	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Let me just briefly touch on the balance sheet.	93.0	107.0
201611	973	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	I agree with our current principles, which state that the balance sheet should be no larger than necessary to effectively conduct monetary policy.	93.0	107.0
201611	974	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	But it is very uncertain what this minimally necessary level is, and I doubt it is as small as levels maintained before the financial crisis, for many reasons.	93.0	107.0
201611	975	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Money markets have changed materially, with significant activity outside the interbank funds market.	93.0	107.0
201611	976	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	We will want to maintain our ability to influence these markets, which will likely require having a larger balance sheet in steady state.	93.0	107.0
201611	977	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, the demand for safe assets is higher than in the pre-crisis period, and the crisis brought into sharp relief the risks associated with private-sector money-like instruments.	93.0	107.0
201611	978	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Together, these developments suggest that the demand for reserves is likely to remain elevated above pre-crisis levels.	93.0	107.0
201611	979	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, the need for accommodation in the proximity of the effective lower bound will likely be greater, because the neutral rate is markedly lower than before the financial crisis.	93.0	107.0
201611	980	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	And this means we will likely want to leave space for balance sheet expansion under exigent circumstances.	93.0	107.0
201611	981	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Echoing sentiments expressed by others, I would observe that this, perhaps, is the best tool under those circumstances.	93.0	107.0
201611	982	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	When considering the operating regime, I would prioritize maintaining and, where appropriate, enhancing the facilities we have for interest rate control and, importantly, for liquidity provision.	93.0	107.0
201611	983	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Maintaining several tools will be useful, regardless of the interest rate target we choose.	93.0	107.0
201611	984	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Of course, we will want to continue with the interest rate on reserves, which will likely continue to be an important tool.	93.0	107.0
201611	985	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	The second is the overnight RRP facility.	93.0	107.0
201611	986	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	As a great deal of money market activity takes place outside the interbank market, it will be important to continue operating this facility or at least maintain it in a state of operational readiness, although I prefer the first.	93.0	107.0
201611	987	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	I’d also be open to creating an RRP facility to enhance interest rate control, though I regard this as somewhat less important.	93.0	107.0
201611	988	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	We also need liquidity facilities, as the crisis made clear.	93.0	107.0
201611	989	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s not clear that the discount window can be fully adequate because of the stigma associated with it.	93.0	107.0
201611	990	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	One possibility that many have supported, and I do too, would be to supplement the discount window with a standing auction facility.	93.0	107.0
201611	991	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, as we learned from the crisis, in certain circumstances it may be important to be operationally ready to act as a lender of last resort to a wider range of financial market entities beyond our traditional counterparties.	93.0	107.0
201611	992	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Ensuring that our operating tools can achieve interest rate control, access to liquidity, and financial stability will likely mean working with a wider range of counterparties while structuring these interactions to minimize moral hazard.	93.0	107.0
201611	993	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Regarding the target rate, the current configuration of the funds market is highly unusual.	93.0	107.0
201611	994	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s difficult to say how stable the market will be in the period ahead, but it seems unlikely the funds rate will be the most effective way to implement and communicate policy.	93.0	107.0
201611	995	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Certainly we wouldn’t have chosen the funds rate if we had started from scratch in today’s conditions.	93.0	107.0
201611	996	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	The same appears to be true of the OBFR.	93.0	107.0
201611	997	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Eurodollar lending has dropped noticeably of late as money market reform has gone into effect.	93.0	107.0
201611	998	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s also hard to imagine moving at this juncture to a regime in which we choose the repo rate as our target.	93.0	107.0
201611	999	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	This strikes me as a quite dramatic change, and so, of necessity, given the initial conditions, it seems likely we’re going to remain in circumstances in which we have several rates.	93.0	107.0
201611	1000	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Finally, again, I want to say that the analysis did a very nice job on abstracting from current circumstances.	93.0	107.0
201611	1001	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	It really helped to clarify some of the tradeoffs.	93.0	107.0
201611	1002	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Now that we’ve seen that analysis, as we go forward we’ll probably benefit greatly from having analysis that integrates considerations of the monetary policy framework with the long-run operating framework as well as taking into account possible transition costs.	93.0	107.0
201611	1003	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	107.0
201611	1004	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, and thanks to everyone for your thoughtful comments and suggestions.	93.0	65.0
201611	1005	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I’ll wrap up our discussion with a few comments of my own on the three questions.	93.0	65.0
201611	1006	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	However, I want to say at the outset that I agree with Presidents Bullard, Rosengren, Williams, and other participants who have weighed in on the larger issues pertaining to our monetary policy framework.	93.0	65.0
201611	1007	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I certainly agree that in light of our growing recognition that the equilibrium real funds rate is likely to remain low for a long time, we need to think about a broader range of issues.	93.0	65.0
201611	1008	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Let me just say, I am more than open to further work and discussion on these topics in the coming months.	93.0	65.0
201611	1009	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Turning to the questions, regarding the first one, I, like most of you, prefer a floor system that involves us operating on the flat portion of the demand curve for reserves.	93.0	65.0
201611	1010	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Such a system is very simple to operate, and it may foster an efficient payments system.	93.0	65.0
201611	1011	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	In view of the likelihood that we may again hit the effective lower bound in response to future adverse shocks, it’s clearly advantageous that such a system seamlessly accommodates large-scale asset purchases.	93.0	65.0
201611	1012	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I certainly hope that we will have a chance to shrink our balance sheet substantially before that happens—namely, another adverse shock—but it’s something we can’t count on.	93.0	65.0
201611	1013	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I think that reducing mandatory reserve requirements to zero also seems worthy of further evaluation, especially in light of improved liquidity regulation.	93.0	65.0
201611	1014	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to the choice of a policy rate, I don’t yet have a clear preference, although selecting an administered rate has considerable appeal for the reasons Vice Chairman Dudley articulated.	93.0	65.0
201611	1015	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	There is no particular short-term interest rate that is invariably especially relevant to the transmission mechanism.	93.0	65.0
201611	1016	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	That depends on the overall state of financial conditions.	93.0	65.0
201611	1017	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	The federal funds market is idiosyncratic and vulnerable to structural changes and shifts in the business models of Federal Home Loan Banks, and I worry that activity may erode further over time.	93.0	65.0
201611	1018	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	However, I do think we need to think carefully about possible unintended consequences of making changes—for example, something a couple of you mentioned, a tightening of the overnight RRP–IOER rate spread that could significantly alter the functioning of the federal funds market and other unsecured markets.	93.0	65.0
201611	1019	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	One issue that featured prominently in our earlier normalization discussions was whether there would be market or legal ramifications stemming from the drying up of activity in that market, as many financial contracts reference the effective federal funds rate.	93.0	65.0
201611	1020	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	As Governor Powell mentioned, there may be solutions—I hope there are—to this potential problem, especially if we communicate our intentions well in advance of any change.	93.0	65.0
201611	1021	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	But I think it is important to proceed carefully.	93.0	65.0
201611	1022	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	On the second question on liquidity provision, it’s possible that facilities like the depository institution repo facility, or DIRF, could enhance interest rate control by providing an effective ceiling on short-term interest rates, although providing such a ceiling is less important in a floor system.	93.0	65.0
201611	1023	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	That said, stigma and reluctance to borrow at the discount window have been long-standing issues, and we may need to do more work in this area before settling on appropriate options.	93.0	65.0
201611	1024	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Regarding the financial institutions repo facility, or FIRF—I think that’s a novel idea and might be useful in some frameworks.	93.0	65.0
201611	1025	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	But I do think we need to be cautious about using our authorities for open market operations when they could be viewed as lending facilities for nonbank firms.	93.0	65.0
201611	1026	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Turning to broad-based liquidity strains, the term auction facility did prove to be quite effective during the crisis, because its design features helped overcome stigma, and I think in light of that experience, the TAF should remain part of our toolkit.	93.0	65.0
201611	1027	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Whether it should be a standing facility or a contingent one is an open question, although in either case, it appears that the facility could be rapidly deployed if needed.	93.0	65.0
201611	1028	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	A problem with contingent facilities is that the act of using them may be taken as a dire signal and reinforce negative market dynamics.	93.0	65.0
201611	1029	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	But a standing facility also could have costs, including increasing moral hazard and altering the current role of Federal Home Loan Banks in the financial system.	93.0	65.0
201611	1030	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	As I can foresee a role for the TAF regardless of our future choice of long-run framework, we could consider whether any enhancements are worth making in the next couple of years and whether some regular small- value testing of the facility is appropriate.	93.0	65.0
201611	1031	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	But again, hereto, I don’t think there is much urgency.	93.0	65.0
201611	1032	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, on the third question, as I articulated in my speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, I believe large-scale asset purchases are an essential part of our toolkit.	93.0	65.0
201611	1033	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	They played an important role in fostering recovery from the crisis, and we very well may need to use this tool again in the future, particularly if scope for conventional interest rate cuts remains limited.	93.0	65.0
201611	1034	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	My inclination at this point would be to deploy asset purchases in conjunction with hitting the effective lower bound on the policy rate, rather than as a separate tool.	93.0	65.0
201611	1035	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Regarding financial stability, I do support using the balance sheet to address acute stress in the financial system, as we did during the crisis, but I really think the bar should be quite high for using the balance sheet as a routine tool to pursue financial stability objectives.	93.0	65.0
201611	1036	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Maintaining a large balance sheet to crowd out private money-like assets and flatten the yield curve is intellectually intriguing, but from a practical perspective, our knowledge in this area remains very limited.	93.0	65.0
201611	1037	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And, as a general point:  Sustaining any proactive use of our balance sheet requires the understanding and support of the public—which is no small thing.	93.0	65.0
201611	1038	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Even in times of crisis, when the cost of inaction loomed large, our actions drew a great deal of criticism.	93.0	65.0
201611	1039	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	In normal times, pursuing such policies could simply lead to a change in our statutory authority.	93.0	65.0
201611	1040	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Such an outcome would be particularly unfortunate, because it could eliminate our ability to use the full range of tools when they are most needed.	93.0	65.0
201611	1041	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there.	93.0	65.0
201611	1042	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	As I noted at the outset, we need not be in a hurry to make decisions about our long-run framework, and our deliberations will surely be informed by another year or two of experience.	93.0	65.0
201611	1043	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	As we wrap up this phase of work on the long-run framework, let me again express my gratitude to the staff.	93.0	65.0
201611	1044	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And, at this point, I would suggest that the senior staff, based on the views expressed today, consider any potential areas in which we could make improvements over the next year or two without materially constraining our choices down the road.	93.0	65.0
201611	1045	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I think we have had a very good discussion, and we are entitled to take a break for lunch [laughter], which is available next door.	52.0	65.0
201611	1046	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	We will reconvene in a little bit less than an hour, at 1:30.	52.0	65.0
201611	1048	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I think we are ready to get going again, and we are going to now move to “Financial Developments and Open Market Operations.”	61.0	65.0
201611	1049	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s call on Simon to begin the presentation.	61.0	65.0
201611	1050	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201611	1051	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period, domestic asset prices were largely range-bound, although inflation compensation increased amid a rise in oil prices.	61.0	999.0
201611	1052	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Markets have largely priced in a December rate hike with little drama, and market participants appear focused on global risks, including concerns over the sustainability of monetary policy stances abroad and political and financial stability in Europe and China.	61.0	999.0
201611	1053	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period, the market-implied probability of an increase in the target federal funds rate at or before the December FOMC meeting drifted higher.	61.0	999.0
201611	1054	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The probability is currently around 70 percent, as shown by the dark blue line in the top-left panel of your first exhibit, about 30 percentage points above the level seen just before the October 2015 meeting, the light blue line.	61.0	999.0
201611	1055	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The current market-implied probability of a hike at or before the December FOMC meeting is arguably about as high as can be expected, in view of the time remaining ahead of the December meeting and intervening risk events, which include the US election and two employment reports.	61.0	999.0
201611	1056	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	In the Desk’s most recent surveys, the average probability of a hike by December was a touch lower, at about 60 percent.	61.0	999.0
201611	1057	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Meanwhile, the market- and survey-implied probabilities of a rate hike occurring at this meeting are essentially zero, with market participants pointing to the lack of a press conference and the upcoming election as effectively eliminating the possibility of a rate hike.	61.0	999.0
201611	1058	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Looking past 2016, the market-implied path of the target federal funds rate is little changed over the last few months, as shown in the top-right panel, and continues to suggest that investors expect a very gradual normalization path.	61.0	999.0
201611	1059	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The expected path implied by the Desk surveys, the pink diamonds, is also little changed.	61.0	999.0
201611	1060	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Both the market- and survey-implied rate paths remain well below the path implied by the median SEP diamonds, especially over the longer horizon.	61.0	999.0
201611	1061	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	As we have discussed, a large portion of this gap is attributable to the SEP being a median of modal paths based on continued economic expansion, while Desk survey responses represent a mean expectation for the path of the policy rate.	61.0	999.0
201611	1062	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Indeed, respondents to the Desk’s surveys continue to assign a roughly 25 percent probability of a return to the effective lower bound before the end of 2019.	61.0	999.0
201611	1063	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Market participants continue to debate the notion of tightening in an era of unconventional monetary policy.	61.0	999.0
201611	1064	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Some investors date the first tightening step by the FOMC to May 2013, the so-called taper tantrum, while others look to the end of balance sheet expansion two years ago.	61.0	999.0
201611	1065	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Of course, a more conventional view is that the first tightening took place last December.	61.0	999.0
201611	1066	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The middle-left panel shows how indicators of financial conditions have changed since two possible dates for the start of tightening.	61.0	999.0
201611	1067	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Two indicators stand out: first, the consistent decline in the 10-year Treasury yield, and, second, the large increase in the exchange value of the dollar before liftoff.	61.0	999.0
201611	1068	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	These movements could, at least in part, be explained by the evolving policy stance of advanced economy central banks.	61.0	999.0
201611	1069	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	But market participants are still working to understand the implications of a tightening that to date is more reflected in exchange rates than interest rates for the reserve currency.	61.0	999.0
201611	1070	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period the dollar appreciated broadly, as shown in the middle-right panel, but only ¾ percent on a trade-weighted basis.	61.0	999.0
201611	1071	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Some special factors produced this modest trade-weighted appreciation.	61.0	999.0
201611	1072	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	For example, the Mexican peso appreciated 4 percent because of shifts in expectations for the outcome of the US presidential election, and the Russian ruble appreciated roughly 3 percent, in large part because of an 8 percent increase in oil prices.	61.0	999.0
201611	1073	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The increase in oil prices also contributed to a rise in measures of inflation compensation, as shown in the bottom-left panel, with the five-year, five-year- forward breakeven up about 20 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201611	1074	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	While acknowledging the disconnect with theory, market participants continue to emphasize that spot inflation affects far- forward inflation compensation, as long tenors offer the most liquidity and are thus traded most actively.	61.0	999.0
201611	1075	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Inflation compensation also increased in other G-4 countries, as shown in the decomposition of changes in 10-year nominal sovereign yields in the bottom-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201611	1076	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	While the increase in oil prices was reportedly the primary driver of these changes, investors also noted a perceived shift in the willingness of global monetary policymakers to tolerate higher levels of inflation.	61.0	999.0
201611	1077	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Market participants highlighted Chair Yellen’s discussion of the merits of running a “high-pressure economy,”	61.0	999.0
201611	1078	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Bank of England Governor Carney’s comments on his willingness to overshoot the inflation target, and the BOJ’s explicit commitment to overshoot its inflation target.	61.0	999.0
201611	1079	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Nevertheless, forward measures of inflation compensation remain well below target levels, except in the United Kingdom, and market participants remain focused on the efficacy and sustainability of monetary policy stances abroad, especially for the Bank of Japan and the ECB.	61.0	999.0
201611	1080	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The top-left panel of your second exhibit summarizes recent policy announcements from the Bank of Japan and the ECB.	61.0	999.0
201611	1081	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Overnight, the Bank of Japan announced no change in its stance but acknowledged that inflation would take longer to reach the target than previous forecasts.	61.0	999.0
201611	1082	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	In addition to announcing a commitment to overshoot its inflation target in September, the Bank of Japan introduced a yield-curve-control framework of targeting a 10-year nominal JGB yield of around 0 percent.	61.0	999.0
201611	1083	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Doubts remain over whether the Bank of Japan can reach its inflation target, and many suggest there is tension between the 10-year yield target and the Bank of Japan’s commitment to expand the monetary base by around ¥80 trillion per year—that is, both a price and quantity target for its asset purchases.	61.0	999.0
201611	1084	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	As part of its new regime, the Bank of Japan introduced a fixed-rate operation to purchase mainly on-the-run JGBs with no pre- specified limit.	61.0	999.0
201611	1085	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	However, this tool has yet to be used, as the 10-year rate has remained around zero.	61.0	999.0
201611	1086	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The ECB made no changes to its policy framework.	61.0	999.0
201611	1087	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	However, most market participants expect that at its next meeting in December, it will formally extend its asset purchase program past March 2017.	61.0	999.0
201611	1088	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	An extension would require adjustments to the program parameters to increase the universe of eligible assets for purchase.	61.0	999.0
201611	1089	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	These adjustments could include a removal of the minimum yield floor, an increase in the issue and issuer share limits, or a shift in the distribution of purchases away from the capital key.	61.0	999.0
201611	1090	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Outside of concerns over the effectiveness of monetary policy, a series of other medium- to long-term risks continue to garner attention.	61.0	999.0
201611	1091	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	In the United Kingdom, a considerable amount of uncertainty remains regarding Brexit—specifically, what the implications will be for the UK economy and political cohesion in Europe.	61.0	999.0
201611	1092	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period, comments from elements of the UK government increased the perceived likelihood of a hard exit from the European Union, which would significantly reduce economic linkages between the regions.	61.0	999.0
201611	1093	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	This increased likelihood of a so-called hard Brexit led to a broad-based depreciation of the pound, including 6 percent against the dollar, and contributed to the roughly 50 basis point widening in 10-year UK inflation breakevens, as shown in the top-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201611	1094	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	In addition, the British pound experienced a flash-type event during the early hours of the Asian trading session on October 7, depreciating abruptly by roughly 9 percent against the dollar before retracing in a matter of minutes.	61.0	999.0
201611	1095	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The event follows similar sharp moves in the dollar–yen and euro–dollar currency pairs last year and reinforces concerns some have about the robustness of liquidity in the world’s most heavily traded currency pairs.	61.0	999.0
201611	1096	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Despite uncertainty associated with Brexit, UK and euro-area economic data have been quite resilient in the wake of the referendum, at least thus far.	61.0	999.0
201611	1097	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Some investors speculate that if Brexit appears positive for the UK economy in the short- term, other European countries may face similar internal political upheavals.	61.0	999.0
201611	1098	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Market participants view the December constitutional amendment referendum in Italy and elections in Germany and France next year as key risk events for the euro area and broader European project.	61.0	999.0
201611	1099	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	On top of these political risks, investors had renewed concerns about the stability of the European financial sector.	61.0	999.0
201611	1100	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Over the period, market participants were focused on Deutsche Bank and its capital adequacy.	61.0	999.0
201611	1101	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The bank’s stock hit a multidecade low and its CDS widened well above its peers, as shown in the middle-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201611	1102	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Deutsche Bank has experienced deterioration in market participants’ assessment of its business model, recently highlighted by reports of hedge fund clients moving relationships away from it amid speculation over the level of a settlement with the US Department of Justice.	61.0	999.0
201611	1103	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	While there have been limited spillovers from Deutsche Bank thus far, the concerns over its capital adequacy are symptomatic of Europe’s broader banking- sector challenges.	61.0	999.0
201611	1104	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The middle-right panel shows that the price-to-tangible book ratio for Europe’s banking sector—a common valuation metric—remains well below ratios for US banks.	61.0	999.0
201611	1105	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The low valuation reflects concerns about European banking business models amid low or negative interest rates and an oversaturation of banks in the region.	61.0	999.0
201611	1106	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Euro-area banking assets account for roughly 300 percent of GDP, compared with about 100 percent of GDP in the United States.	61.0	999.0
201611	1107	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Michael Palumbo and Steve Kamin will talk further about banking-sector valuations in their briefings.	61.0	999.0
201611	1108	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Outside of Europe, market participants remained attentive to China.	61.0	999.0
201611	1109	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-left panel, the RMB depreciated 1½ percent against the dollar over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201611	1110	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Meanwhile, the RMB declined about ½ percent on a trade- weighted basis.	61.0	999.0
201611	1111	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Market participants have become less focused on the short-term financial stability risks that China poses to the rest of the globe, largely because they seem more comfortable with the new exchange rate policy and the official sector’s general capacity to control short-term stress.	61.0	999.0
201611	1112	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	However, many view the continued depreciation of the RMB against the dollar as reflective of ongoing capital outflow pressures.	61.0	999.0
201611	1113	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Market participants suggest mainland Chinese investors are increasingly searching for offshore investment opportunities in anticipation of continued currency depreciation and the possibility of enhanced capital controls.	61.0	999.0
201611	1114	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	In the face of these capital outflow pressures, China’s foreign reserves have declined notably since 2014, as shown in the bottom-right panel, as substantial FX intervention has been used to slow the pace of depreciation.	61.0	999.0
201611	1115	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	While fears of another sharp devaluation in the near term are reportedly minimal, if the dollar were to appreciate in the coming months, many expect that capital outflows from China would accelerate and could ignite global financial market instability.	61.0	999.0
201611	1116	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Finally, investors are keenly focused on the Party Congress next fall when the extent of President Xi’s power is likely to be revealed.	61.0	999.0
201611	1117	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	This could have important implications for further financial liberalization in China.	61.0	999.0
201611	1118	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Lorie will continue the briefing.	61.0	999.0
201611	1119	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	In exhibits 3 and 4, I’ll cover money markets and Desk operations.	61.0	999.0
201611	1120	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	The implementation of SEC money fund reform continued to be the primary focus in money markets over the intermeeting period, with the compliance deadline for the reforms on October 14 passing without material disruption in funding markets.	61.0	999.0
201611	1121	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	However, the large reallocation of assets away from prime funds over the past year and the corresponding shift in liquidity management of the remaining prime fund assets have significantly affected the structure of some short-term markets and the cost of funding for some borrowers.	61.0	999.0
201611	1122	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel, while the overall size of the money fund industry has remained relatively stable, prime fund assets under management have fallen roughly $1 trillion over the past year.	61.0	999.0
201611	1123	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	This decline exceeded the average of expectations reported in earlier surveys taken in late May and early September.	61.0	999.0
201611	1124	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	The bulk of the outflows moved into government funds, with their assets under management reaching $2.1 trillion.	61.0	999.0
201611	1125	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As shown by the dashed lines in the panel, respondents to our most recent survey of money funds expect only a small portion of these flows to reverse.	61.0	999.0
201611	1126	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As shown by the blue line in the top-right panel, the weighted average maturity of prime institutional funds has declined significantly over the past year, though it has rebounded slightly since October 14, as prime fund managers’ uncertainty about additional investor withdrawals decreased.	61.0	999.0
201611	1127	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As shown by the blue dashed line, survey respondents expect the weighted-average maturity to continue to increase but remain well below historical levels.	61.0	999.0
201611	1128	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Prime funds responded to the decline in assets under management by reducing holdings of all major asset classes.	61.0	999.0
201611	1129	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-left panel, prime fund holdings of commercial paper and bank deposits fell more than $700 billion over the past year.	61.0	999.0
201611	1130	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As prime fund lending in unsecured term money markets declined, the banks borrowing in these term markets, which are largely foreign banking organizations, have had to pay higher rates.	61.0	999.0
201611	1131	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-right panel, the spreads of three-month CP, CD, and LIBOR rates over three-month OIS have widened around 30 basis points since late last year, and Desk survey respondents project the spread to narrow only modestly.	61.0	999.0
201611	1132	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Part of the decline in bank deposits was a sharp reduction in overnight Eurodollar volumes, which are shown in the bottom-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201611	1133	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Prime funds have historically accounted for more than 80 percent of lending in the overnight Eurodollar market.	61.0	999.0
201611	1134	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Importantly, overnight Eurodollar volumes could fall further still, if, as is expected by survey respondents, prime funds shift away from existing overnight investments to reextend their weighted-average maturities.	61.0	999.0
201611	1135	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Meanwhile, volumes in the overnight federal funds market, shown in light blue, have remained steady.	61.0	999.0
201611	1136	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	The decline in overnight Eurodollar volumes appears to have exerted only modest upward pressure on the overnight bank funding and effective federal funds rates.	61.0	999.0
201611	1137	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Both rates averaged 41 basis points over the intermeeting period, excluding month- ends, compared with 40 basis points last period.	61.0	999.0
201611	1138	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	One explanation for the relative lack of effect on these overnight rates is that many bank borrowers have been conducting these trades for arbitrage purposes and have little need for overnight funding at the margin.	61.0	999.0
201611	1139	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	They have therefore responded to the shift in supply of funds by reducing overnight borrowing rather than paying higher rates.	61.0	999.0
201611	1140	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	However, as shifts in the Eurodollar market have the potential to affect the federal funds market, we will continue to monitor these developments closely.	61.0	999.0
201611	1141	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	While the reallocation from prime to government funds has been substantial, government funds have been able to invest the new cash without major effects on related market rates.	61.0	999.0
201611	1142	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the bottom-right panel, most of the funds have been placed in repos and in US Treasury bills.	61.0	999.0
201611	1143	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	The smooth transition has been attributed, to a large degree, to the availability of repo investments, including the overnight RRP facility, as well as to sizable increases in the Treasury bill supply.	61.0	999.0
201611	1144	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	While the roughly $500 billion increase in net supply of US Treasury bills over the past year has helped absorb a large portion of the new demand, it’s important to note that bill supply is expected to decline significantly ahead of the next debt ceiling deadline in March.	61.0	999.0
201611	1145	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel of your final exhibit, some of the increase in repo investment has been in the overnight RRP facility, which, excluding quarter-end, averaged about $190 billion, $110 billion higher than last period’s average.	61.0	999.0
201611	1146	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Looking ahead, Desk survey respondents expect overnight RRP usage over the next year to remain somewhat higher than historical averages.	61.0	999.0
201611	1147	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants had noted some concern for potential stresses at the September quarter-end, due to the combination of money-fund reform and typical quarter-end balance sheet adjustments.	61.0	999.0
201611	1148	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Market functioning was orderly across money markets though, with changes in rates and volumes on the quarter-end date broadly similar to what we’ve observed in previous periods.	61.0	999.0
201611	1149	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	However, as you can see in the top-left panel, overnight RRP usage increased to a greater extent than typical in the days around quarter-end, largely the result of government funds temporarily placing reform-related inflows into the facility.	61.0	999.0
201611	1150	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Usage reached $413 billion on the quarter- end date, with nearly all of the increase coming from government funds.	61.0	999.0
201611	1151	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	In addition to the usual quarter-end dynamics, uncertainties related to both money market reform and the concerns related to Deutsche Bank reportedly put upward pressure on the FX swap basis.	61.0	999.0
201611	1152	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-right panel, the three-month basis of key US dollar currency pairs widened in the run-up to September quarter- end.	61.0	999.0
201611	1153	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Similarly to previous periods, we saw demand at recent ECB, and to a lesser extent, BOJ dollar auctions over quarter-end as well as sporadically over the weeks following, as shown in the middle-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201611	1154	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Demand has fallen at the most recent auctions, with banks demanding just over $1 billion from the ECB.	61.0	999.0
201611	1155	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Shifting to the SOMA portfolio, Treasury and agency MBS reinvestment operations continue to proceed smoothly.	61.0	999.0
201611	1156	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Similarly to previous cycles, reinvestment purchases of agency MBS were elevated, driven primarily by the ongoing low level of mortgage interest rates and resulting pickup in refinancing activity.	61.0	999.0
201611	1157	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	On the Desk’s policy surveys, the median expectation for the timing of a first change in the Committee’s reinvestment policy stands at 18 months ahead, or in the second quarter of 2018, as shown on the left-hand side of the middle-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201611	1158	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	The expected timing of the first change has moved out considerably since liftoff last year, when the median respondent expected a change to the reinvestment policy approximately 12 months forward, or around December of this year.	61.0	999.0
201611	1159	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Many respondents appear to view the timing of a change as linked to the level of the target federal funds rate, and, consequently, the expected timing has been pushed out, as expectations for the pace of policy rate normalization have become more gradual.	61.0	999.0
201611	1160	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the right-hand side of the panel, the median response for the level of the federal funds rate when a change in reinvestment policy first occurs has remained steady this year at 1.38 percent.	61.0	999.0
201611	1161	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Regarding the foreign portfolio, early last month the Desk began a three-month process of reinvesting maturing euro proceeds to match the new target asset allocation, which, as shown in the bottom-left panel, will result in an increase in cash and longer-term securities.	61.0	999.0
201611	1162	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	In addition to continued purchases of French and German sovereign debt, we are now buying Dutch sovereign securities, and these new transactions have proceeded smoothly.	61.0	999.0
201611	1163	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	For the yen portfolio, as we still receive an interest rate of zero on Bank of Japan deposits, we are leaving maturing proceeds and coupons from securities holdings on deposit with the Bank of Japan for the time being.	61.0	999.0
201611	1164	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Lastly, as we briefed the Committee at the December 2015 FOMC meeting and as discussed in a memo circulated last week, the staff has been exploring the production and publication of an overnight Treasury general collateral repo benchmark rate, in coordination with the Treasury Department’s Office of Financial Research.	61.0	999.0
201611	1165	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	This work is summarized in the bottom-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201611	1166	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	In pursuing the development of a Treasury GC repo rate, the staff had three main objectives: first, to improve the amount and quality of information on the repo market available to the public; second, to produce a rate aligned with the IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks that could be considered as a reference rate in financial contracts; and, third, to produce a rate that is correlated with other money market rates, resilient to market evolution, and could be considered as a potential backup monetary policy rate.	61.0	999.0
201611	1167	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	In order to achieve these goals, the staff is currently proposing the publication of three daily secured benchmark rates:  one comprising triparty transactions collected from Bank of New York Mellon; a second comprising the triparty transactions as well as GCF data collected from the DTCC; and a third comprising the triparty transactions, the GCF transactions, and the Fed’s repo-based open market operations.	61.0	999.0
201611	1168	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	All three rates would be calculated as a volume-weighted median.	61.0	999.0
201611	1169	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	A Desk statement scheduled for publication Friday will describe the three potential benchmark rates, the motivation and purpose for their publication, and the proposed calculation methodology.	61.0	999.0
201611	1170	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	A draft of that statement was included in the memo circulated before the meeting.	61.0	999.0
201611	1171	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	The staff also intends to release a Federal Register notice asking for public comment on the proposed rates.	61.0	999.0
201611	1172	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	To conclude, your appendix contains a summary of operational tests performed over the intermeeting period and those planned during the next period.	61.0	999.0
201611	1173	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you, that concludes my prepared remarks.	61.0	999.0
201611	1174	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Questions?	62.0	65.0
201611	1175	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	62.0	65.0
201611	1176	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	97.0
201611	1177	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I have two factual questions, and I think they are both on Lorie’s part of the presentation.	62.0	97.0
201611	1178	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Lorie, I infer from what you said that the roughly $1 trillion in prime fund investments that flowed out was not replaced euro-for-euro or dollar-for-dollar by the former recipients of those investments.	62.0	97.0
201611	1179	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But to the degree that there was replacement, what were the sources of the funding that they got that had formerly been provided by the prime funds?	62.0	97.0
201611	1180	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	If banks were getting investments from the money market funds, they may not have replaced dollar-for-dollar what they were getting, as you explained.	62.0	97.0
201611	1181	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But they obviously replaced some significant proportion of what they were getting.	62.0	97.0
201611	1182	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Who was making those investments?	62.0	97.0
201611	1183	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	One of the other things I noted was the widening in the FX basis swap, and I think some of the foreign banking organizations turned to the dollar swap market to obtain dollars by swapping out yen or euros or something into dollars, and that was putting pressure on that swap.	62.0	999.0
201611	1184	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	So I think they turned to that type of investment product as one alternative.	62.0	999.0
201611	1185	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I see.	62.0	97.0
201611	1186	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But does that mean that the balance sheets of the European banks were, on net, reduced, because they were just swapping assets rather than getting new funding?	62.0	97.0
201611	1187	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	I think, in the term markets, they tried to replace some of that.	62.0	999.0
201611	1188	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	I think, in the overnight markets, a lot of that was arbitrage trading taking place in Eurodollars, and I don’t think they replaced that.	62.0	999.0
201611	1189	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Okay, got it.	62.0	97.0
201611	1190	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	62.0	97.0
201611	1191	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	The second question is on the take-up of ON RRP.	62.0	97.0
201611	1192	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Again, I think I’m trying to read between the lines of what you did say, but I want to make sure I understand it.	62.0	97.0
201611	1193	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	The quarter-end take-up was substantially larger than the past couple of quarter-ends, which I found, when I first looked at the chart, a bit counterintuitive.	62.0	97.0
201611	1194	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I thought one of the reasons why the quarter-end spiked in the past was that the European banks that are operating under this system of “it’s the last day of the quarter that matters for your capital ratios” would want to reduce their balance sheets at that time.	62.0	97.0
201611	1195	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But that, presumably, should be less the case when the ON RRP market is dominated by government money market funds.	62.0	97.0
201611	1196	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	You said that some of these government money market funds had parked the funds in the ON RRP initially.	62.0	97.0
201611	1197	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But does that mean you expect that subsequent quarters will not have this kind of spike?	62.0	97.0
201611	1198	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	I think we’re still going to learn a lot from the quarter-ends, but I think we have also been seeing that type of balance sheet reduction take place in repo, particularly on the part of some of those European broker-dealers.	62.0	999.0
201611	1199	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	So some of these government funds are invested in repo, and those balance sheets reduce as well.	62.0	999.0
201611	1200	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Oh, I see.	62.0	97.0
201611	1201	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Those would still be affected, yes.	62.0	97.0
201611	1202	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	And I think the government funds are still having to do some replacement in the overnight RRP around quarter-end.	62.0	999.0
201611	1203	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	We just saw the same thing on month-end, that the government funds were a large part of the increase around the prime funds.	62.0	999.0
201611	1204	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	So that’s consistent with Lorie’s story.	62.0	999.0
201611	1205	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I know it’s hard to predict, but if one had to, would one predict an end- of-quarter spike that was somewhere between the spike at the end of September and those of the previous couple of quarters?	62.0	97.0
201611	1206	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	It’s hard to know.	62.0	999.0
201611	1207	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	I think year-end also has its own thing, so that could be larger.	62.0	999.0
201611	1208	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	What I was trying to emphasize was that we saw higher usage around just the quarter-end date—a couple of days before and a couple of days after.	62.0	999.0
201611	1209	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	And I think those were higher than typical because of the placement temporarily.	62.0	999.0
201611	1210	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	On the quarter-end itself, from what we’ve heard from market participants, it’s largely dominated by government now.	62.0	999.0
201611	1211	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	It still could spike— maybe not quite this high, but higher than it was before—from the repo balance sheets being used.	62.0	999.0
201611	1212	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Okay.	62.0	97.0
201611	1213	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	62.0	97.0
201611	1214	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	62.0	65.0
201611	1215	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Call on Eric first.	62.0	81.0
201611	1216	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201611	1217	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	62.0	65.0
201611	1218	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I wanted to follow up where Governor Tarullo just was.	62.0	90.0
201611	1219	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	In the earlier discussion, Governor Tarullo had made the comment about no longer using the prime money market funds for the overnight RRP.	62.0	90.0
201611	1220	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	And when I look at this chart, it highlights that they are not a particularly essential part of the overnight RRP.	62.0	90.0
201611	1221	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	What are the costs versus benefits of no longer using them?	62.0	90.0
201611	1222	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I can think of one benefit from a financial stability standpoint, which is that having less prime money market funds may be, overall, stabilizing over time, and getting them out of the overnight RRP might be an effective signal of that.	62.0	90.0
201611	1223	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	But are there countervailing costs that we ought to be thinking about when we consider who should have access to the overnight RRP?	62.0	90.0
201611	1224	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	I should note that of the remaining assets under management for prime, $131 billion of it is institutional, and I think that institutional amount is the part that we are more concerned would be flightier.	62.0	999.0
201611	1225	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	So it’s a fairly small number now.	62.0	999.0
201611	1226	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	I think it’s possible to consider either adding caps or eliminating prime funds as counterparties, and it’s something we should study over the coming months.	62.0	999.0
201611	1227	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	And I do think there is still this competitive arbitrage that may still be supporting interest rate control even at those low amounts.	62.0	999.0
201611	1228	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	But it’s also possible that they could seek access through government funds if they needed to use the overnight RRP as competitive pressure to the other rates they’re receiving in money markets.	62.0	999.0
201611	1229	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	So I think we should definitely look at it.	62.0	999.0
201611	1230	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	62.0	90.0
201611	1231	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	62.0	65.0
201611	1232	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	62.0	81.0
201611	1233	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	His question was more interesting than mine.	62.0	81.0
201611	1234	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	62.0	81.0
201611	1235	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	On the overnight bank funding rate, we understand that there is work going on to broaden its coverage to perhaps include bank deposits and stuff about where the Eurodollar funding is going.	62.0	81.0
201611	1236	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I was interested in the prospects for that:  Is that going to be easy?	62.0	81.0
201611	1237	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Are there impediments?	62.0	81.0
201611	1238	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Is it going to be hard?	62.0	81.0
201611	1239	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As we said in chart 15, most of that decline we think is related to money fund reform.	62.0	999.0
201611	1240	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	We’re aware that about $20 billion to $30 billion of that total decline might be related to moving some deposits on shore.	62.0	999.0
201611	1241	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	It’s a small portion of the total amount, but it is something we’re studying.	62.0	999.0
201611	1242	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	I think it would be quite complicated to get the instructions right, to capture the right amount of onshore deposits that we’d want for this type of reference rate, but it’s definitely something that we’re studying carefully right now.	62.0	999.0
201611	1243	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	This market is still much more diverse than the federal funds market in the sense that there are a lot more types of lenders rather than one type of lender for 95 percent of federal funds.	62.0	999.0
201611	1244	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Can I ask a follow-up?	62.0	81.0
201611	1245	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	What would be hard about it?	62.0	81.0
201611	1246	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I’m sort of thinking naively that $10 million on deposit is $10 million on deposit.	62.0	81.0
201611	1247	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Jim.	62.0	999.0
201611	1248	2016-11-02	meeting	CLOUSE	One thing that’s hard about it is that in the one case in which we had Eurodollar deposits move from a Cayman Islands branch to a domestic office, the deposits at the domestic office were classified as “demand deposits.”	62.0	999.0
201611	1249	2016-11-02	meeting	CLOUSE	So we have a deposit that is a money market instrument, but it’s lumped in with many other types of retail deposits.	62.0	999.0
201611	1250	2016-11-02	meeting	CLOUSE	As a result, you have to figure out, as Lorie was noting, how to write the instructions to capture the types of deposits that you would not want to use for monetary policy purposes.	62.0	999.0
201611	1251	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Why wouldn’t you want to use them?	62.0	81.0
201611	1252	2016-11-02	meeting	CLOUSE	Well, many of the deposits are retail liquid deposits, and we have rates on all kinds of liquid deposits right now that we are not using for the purposes of the OBFR.	62.0	999.0
201611	1253	2016-11-02	meeting	CLOUSE	The purpose of the OBFR is to try to capture a money market rate, not a retail deposit rate, and the rates on demand deposits, as you know very well, are just very heavily dominated by factors such as the market power of banks in retail deposit markets.	62.0	999.0
201611	1254	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	62.0	81.0
201611	1255	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I’m just thinking that it was not necessarily the case that you want to limit it to capturing what was in Eurodollars, because obviously some wholesale funding goes on with deposit markets in the United States as well.	62.0	81.0
201611	1256	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Thanks for that explanation.	62.0	81.0
201611	1257	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	We are working on it.	62.0	999.0
201611	1258	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	We will try our best to capture wholesale transactions rather than retail.	62.0	999.0
201611	1259	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Sure.	62.0	81.0
201611	1260	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201611	1261	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Are there further questions?	62.0	65.0
201611	1262	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62.0	65.0
201611	1263	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201611	1264	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	If not, I need a motion to ratify domestic open market operations.	63.0	65.0
201611	1265	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So moved.	63.0	96.0
201611	1266	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	63.0	65.0
201611	1267	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	63.0	65.0
201611	1268	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Now we’re ready to move on to the “Economic and Financial Situation,” and let me call on Eric Engen to get us started.	11.0	65.0
201611	1269	2016-11-02	meeting	MADIGAN	If I could interrupt just before we get started, in the financial stability package of briefings, on exhibit 2, you’ll see that there’s a missing panel.	50.0	999.0
201611	1270	2016-11-02	meeting	MADIGAN	Corrected versions with the panel included are coming around right now.	50.0	999.0
201611	1271	2016-11-02	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you.	50.0	999.0
201611	1272	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201611	1273	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	I will be referring to the exhibits in the handout titled “Material for Briefing on the US Outlook.”	11.0	999.0
201611	1274	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	And I’m hoping that my exhibits are all included there in your packet.	11.0	999.0
201611	1275	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	As shown in panel 1 of the forecast summary exhibit, we continue to see real GDP growth picking up in the second half of this year from its subdued first-half pace.	11.0	999.0
201611	1276	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	However, we did trim our near-term outlook for GDP growth in the October Tealbook from our September projection.	11.0	999.0
201611	1277	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Most notably, the incoming data on consumer spending have been somewhat weaker than we were expecting, and we put through a modest downward revision to our near-term PCE forecast.	11.0	999.0
201611	1278	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Our medium- term projection of real GDP is also a bit lower than in September, primarily reflecting the effects of the somewhat higher paths of the dollar and crude oil prices in this forecast.	11.0	999.0
201611	1279	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Last Friday, after the Tealbook had closed, we received the BEA’s advance estimate of third-quarter GDP.	11.0	999.0
201611	1280	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	As shown by the blue dot, the BEA’s estimate came in a little above our Tealbook forecast, as stronger-than-expected net exports and inventory accumulation more than offset weaker-than-expected growth in consumer spending and business fixed investment.	11.0	999.0
201611	1281	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	With an essentially unrevised set of supply-side assumptions, the slightly weaker path of output in this forecast yields a projected path of the output gap—the black line in panel 2—that is a little lower than in September.	11.0	999.0
201611	1282	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	That said, we see the output gap as currently closed and continue to expect that aggregate demand will rise faster than aggregate supply over the next couple of years, leaving the level of real GDP more than 1 percent above potential by 2019.	11.0	999.0
201611	1283	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Turning to the labor market, the employment report for September indicated that job market conditions continued to improve and were broadly as we had expected.	11.0	999.0
201611	1284	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	As shown in panel 3, the projected unemployment rate still declines over the next couple of years, but this path is a bit higher than in our previous forecast, reflecting the slightly smaller positive output gap.	11.0	999.0
201611	1285	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Likewise, as indicated in panel 4, we have edged down our forecast of monthly payroll job gains over the medium term, with total payrolls expected to rise over the rest of this year and next year an average of around 170,000 jobs per month.	11.0	999.0
201611	1286	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	As projected real GDP growth slows, average payroll gains are expected to move down to 130,000 jobs per month in 2018 and to 100,000 jobs per month in 2019.	11.0	999.0
201611	1287	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	This 2019 forecast is consistent with a “neutral pace” of payroll gains, in which the unemployment rate is stable and the participation rate is declining in line with its trend.	11.0	999.0
201611	1288	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	The next two panels provide a closer look at developments in the labor market by plotting the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate for several broad racial and ethnic groups.	11.0	999.0
201611	1289	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	In line with the aggregate unemployment rate—the black line in panel 5—the unemployment rates for these various groups are now quite close to the levels seen just before the last recession.	11.0	999.0
201611	1290	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Similarly, the differentials in jobless rates between the groups are close to their pre-recession levels.	11.0	999.0
201611	1291	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Panel 6 plots participation rates, where I have focused on persons between the ages of 25 and 54 as a rough way of controlling for the differing age composition of these racial and ethnic groups.	11.0	999.0
201611	1292	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Here the hint of an upturn that we have recently seen in the aggregate participation rate—the black line in the figure—is easily seen in a corresponding rise in the participation rate for whites—the green line.	11.0	999.0
201611	1293	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	The measured participation rates for African Americans and Hispanics—the blue and red lines—are more volatile, but they appear to have been either moving sideways or also edging up recently.	11.0	999.0
201611	1294	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	The panels on the next page summarize the inflation outlook.	11.0	999.0
201611	1295	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Our near-term projection of headline PCE price inflation—panel 7—is somewhat higher than we had written down in September, largely reflecting an upward revision in the expected path of gasoline prices.	11.0	999.0
201611	1296	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	However, core PCE price inflation—panel 8—has come in a little higher than expected as well.	11.0	999.0
201611	1297	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Part of the upward surprise in core was in nonmarket components of the index.	11.0	999.0
201611	1298	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Although we typically take little signal for future inflation from quarter-to-quarter movements in these prices, our review of recent price trends suggests that nonmarket PCE price inflation has been running at a somewhat higher average pace than we had previously been assuming.	11.0	999.0
201611	1299	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	We therefore marked up our forecast of nonmarket inflation in coming quarters.	11.0	999.0
201611	1300	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Therefore, while we continue to expect that core PCE price inflation will move lower in the second half of this year—a pattern that is partially attributable to the presence of some residual seasonality in the published price data—the anticipated step-down is not as pronounced as in our September forecast.	11.0	999.0
201611	1301	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Beyond the near term, the inflation projection is very little different from our previous forecast.	11.0	999.0
201611	1302	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	In panels 7 and 8, I have again used blue dots to show the BEA’s advance third- quarter estimates for total and core PCE price inflation, which we received last Friday after the Tealbook closed.	11.0	999.0
201611	1303	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	As you can see, these estimates came in about as expected.	11.0	999.0
201611	1304	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	In addition, yesterday we received the BEA’s personal income release for September, which included monthly data for PCE prices.	11.0	999.0
201611	1305	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	The report implies that total PCE prices rose 1.2 percent over the 12 months ending in September, with a corresponding 12-month change for core prices of 1.7 percent.	11.0	999.0
201611	1306	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Looking ahead, we expect the 12-month change in the total PCE price index to step up to about 1.6 percent by the end of the year, while the 12-month change in core prices is projected to remain roughly flat around 1¾ percent in the coming months.	11.0	999.0
201611	1307	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	The next two panels reproduce the inflation monitor exhibits from the October Tealbook, which parse out the cumulative revisions that we have made to our projections of total and core PCE price inflation since December of last year, when you first raised the funds rate target 25 basis points.	11.0	999.0
201611	1308	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Total PCE price inflation, panel 9, is now projected to come in 0.3 percentage point higher this year as a result of the upward revisions to core inflation and energy prices that we made this round.	11.0	999.0
201611	1309	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	The revision to this year’s forecast of core inflation, which is parsed out in panel 10, is concentrated in the category labeled “other,” the yellow portion of the bar, and is not attributable to a change in any fundamentals but simply reflects the fact that we have been surprised by the data this year—both the surprisingly high core inflation readings early in the year and the upward revisions we made this round in response to the recent price data.	11.0	999.0
201611	1310	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	As shown in panel 11, the final October reading on the median measure of longer- run inflation expectations from the Michigan survey—the red line—was 2.4 percent, the lowest level on record for this series.	11.0	999.0
201611	1311	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	This measure can be quite noisy from month to month, but a smoothed trend of the series—the blue line—still shows a relatively steady decline over the past few years.	11.0	999.0
201611	1312	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	However, we continue to think that a portion of the decline in this expectations measure may be attributable to the low rates of headline inflation seen over the past few years.	11.0	999.0
201611	1313	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	When we try to control for the effect of changes in food and energy prices, the resulting estimate of the trend— the green line—doesn’t decline as much lately and remains within the historical 70 percent range for the series, the gray shaded area.	11.0	999.0
201611	1314	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Of course, this result does not rule out the possibility that longer-run inflation expectations have moved down somewhat.	11.0	999.0
201611	1315	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Thus, we continue to closely monitor these and other measures of inflation expectations and to assess the implications of their recent behavior for our inflation projection.	11.0	999.0
201611	1316	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Panel 12 shows three of the measures of labor compensation that we follow.	11.0	999.0
201611	1317	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	After the October Tealbook closed, we received the BLS’s estimate of the ECI for September, and we updated our estimate of compensation per hour with our translation of the third-quarter personal income data.	11.0	999.0
201611	1318	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Both measures are roughly what we had expected.	11.0	999.0
201611	1319	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	In general, nominal labor compensation growth has remained relatively modest, with just a hint of a pickup evident in some measures.	11.0	999.0
201611	1320	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Finally, the last page uses our October Tealbook projection to update a table that provides a high-level summary of some of the key pieces of information that will be available to you at the next couple of FOMC meetings.	11.0	999.0
201611	1321	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	I won’t walk you through the details, though I would note that at the December meeting, the gold-shaded portion, we will have two more months of labor market data but only one additional month of PCE price data—for October—beyond yesterday’s release for September.	11.0	999.0
201611	1322	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	In addition, the November CPI will not be released until the day after the December FOMC meeting concludes.	11.0	999.0
201611	1323	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Steve will now continue our presentation.	11.0	999.0
201611	1324	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Thank you, Eric.	11.0	999.0
201611	1325	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	I’ll be referring to the materials labeled “Materials for Briefing on the International Outlook.”	11.0	999.0
201611	1326	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	I’ll start by addressing the question that is doubtless on all of your minds right now:  Where is Wallonia, and why did it represent the greatest threat to globalization since Brexit?	11.0	999.0
201611	1327	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	As panel 1 shows, Wallonia is the French-speaking half of Belgium.	11.0	999.0
201611	1328	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	It has virtual veto power over foreign policy decisions made by Belgium and also, it turns out, the European Union, which would not sign its seven-years-in-the-making free trade agreement with Canada, known as CETA, unless all 28 of its member governments agreed.	11.0	999.0
201611	1329	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	So 3½ million Walloons, worried about the effect of CETA on their dairy industry, had been blocking the 500-million-person European Union from concluding its trade agreement with Canada.	11.0	999.0
201611	1330	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Wallonia finally caved last week after Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau canceled his trip to Brussels.	11.0	999.0
201611	1331	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	But to the UK and EU negotiators who will spend the next couple of years hammering out a new trade agreement, all I can say is: Good luck with that! As you may gather, I am stalling in an effort to avoid discussing our projection of foreign GDP, which is little revised from the September Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201611	1332	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	As can be seen in panel 2, foreign GDP growth plunged in the second quarter, reflecting transitory weakness in Canada and Mexico, major trading partners with large weights in our foreign GDP aggregate.	11.0	999.0
201611	1333	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	As we’d expected, third-quarter data suggest that activity in both countries rebounded, pushing total foreign growth back to 3 percent.	11.0	999.0
201611	1334	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	In the current quarter, GDP growth steps back down a bit as Canada’s and Mexico’s rebounds are completed and Brexit worries further slow the UK economy.	11.0	999.0
201611	1335	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Thereafter, the AFEs tread water while EME growth edges up as South America limps out of its persistent deep recession.	11.0	999.0
201611	1336	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Total foreign growth, the black line, barely budges.	11.0	999.0
201611	1337	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	We have been anticipating reaching the completion of the economic recovery abroad for eight years now, and it’s dispiriting to think that we’ve finally gotten here.	11.0	999.0
201611	1338	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	But we’ve marked down our estimate of potential economic growth abroad to 2½ percent, compared with over 3 percent before the Global Financial Crisis.	11.0	999.0
201611	1339	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Much of that reflects declines in productivity growth, demographic changes, and structural shifts that are unlikely to turn around anytime soon.	11.0	999.0
201611	1340	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	So, for now, our sense is that this is about as good as it’s going to get.	11.0	999.0
201611	1341	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	With foreign economic growth and interest rates looking likely to remain subdued for the foreseeable future, there are a host of uncertainties for the foreign outlook.	11.0	999.0
201611	1342	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	First, what will be the consequences of further divergence of monetary policies?	11.0	999.0
201611	1343	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	As indicated in panel 3 by the solid blue lines, the staff forecast has the federal funds rate rising to 3 percent by the end of 2019, while an average of AFE interest rates edges up to ½ percent.	11.0	999.0
201611	1344	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Market expectations, shown by the dashed red lines, are for much less divergence over the next three years, mainly because they expect less FOMC tightening.	11.0	999.0
201611	1345	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	In our baseline forecast of the dollar, shown in panel 4, we project that FOMC tightening surprises will contribute to a rise in the broad real dollar—that’s the black solid line—of some 5 percent over the forecast period.	11.0	999.0
201611	1346	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	This is based on our estimates that the broad dollar index rises 2.2 percent for each 100 basis points of surprise increase in the federal funds rate.	11.0	999.0
201611	1347	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	But this elasticity has varied significantly over time, and as illustrated by the alternative dollar scenario discussed in the Tealbook, which assumes a 7.5 percent dollar move for 100 basis points of interest rate surprise in part as emerging markets are roiled by FOMC tightening, a much stronger rise in the dollar is entirely possible.	11.0	999.0
201611	1348	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Besides its effect on the dollar, policy divergences may have implications for longer-term interest rates.	11.0	999.0
201611	1349	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Panel 5 shows that surprise increases in US 10-year yields around FOMC announcements tend to boost German government yields about half that amount.	11.0	999.0
201611	1350	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Such developments would further complicate the tasks of many foreign central banks trying to keep financial conditions highly accommodative.	11.0	999.0
201611	1351	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	By the same token, however, as shown in panel 6, foreign monetary policies tend to spill over to US yields.	11.0	999.0
201611	1352	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Our forecast of rising longer-term Treasury yields incorporates some restraint from low yields abroad, but the restraint could be larger than we anticipate.	11.0	999.0
201611	1353	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	If the consequences of policy divergence are one major source of uncertainty, another is prospects for foreign monetary policy itself, especially by the BOJ and ECB.	11.0	999.0
201611	1354	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	As indicated by the black lines in panels 7 and 8 on your next exhibit, both institutions are struggling with inflation rates that are near or below zero and well below their 2 percent targets.	11.0	999.0
201611	1355	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	This represents a clear rationale for further stimulus.	11.0	999.0
201611	1356	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	But at the same time, both institutions are concerned about the effects of further asset purchases on market functioning as well as the consequences of low interest rates for profitability in the financial sector.	11.0	999.0
201611	1357	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Finally, in both economies, the threat of recession or severe economic slack has receded:  Japanese unemployment, the red line in panel 7, has fallen to 3 percent, its lowest level in decades.	11.0	999.0
201611	1358	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Unemployment remains high in the euro area, at 10 percent, but is trending down as euro-area GDP expands at a lackluster 1½ percent pace.	11.0	999.0
201611	1359	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Under these circumstances, we see both the Bank of Japan and ECB maintaining their highly accommodative policies but not adding a great deal more stimulus.	11.0	999.0
201611	1360	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	On the second day of your September meeting, the Bank of Japan announced that it would target the 10-year yield near zero (a bid to keep the yield curve from flattening further and thus protect bank profits) and it would plan on overshooting its inflation target (a bid to get inflation expectations up).	11.0	999.0
201611	1361	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	In the event, market settings were little changed by the announcement.	11.0	999.0
201611	1362	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Investors likely figured that, in view of the troubles the Bank of Japan was having getting anywhere close to its inflation target, a commitment to overshoot it didn’t count for much.	11.0	999.0
201611	1363	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Meanwhile, the ECB is working through its own issues as it considers how to loosen its self-imposed constraints on asset purchases in order to continue those purchases beyond their notional ending point next March.	11.0	999.0
201611	1364	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	We expect the ECB to extend its program through later next year but to keep its deposit rate unchanged at negative 40 basis points.	11.0	999.0
201611	1365	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	All told, accommodative policy in both economies leads inflation to move up over the forecast period but remain shy of the 2 percent target.	11.0	999.0
201611	1366	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Are worries about the financial system reason enough for central banks to forgo further stimulus?	11.0	999.0
201611	1367	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Many concerns have been raised that monetary accommodation, especially when rates are near or below zero, may lower bank net interest margins both because deposit rates cannot be lowered as much as loan rates and because shallower yield curves reduce profits from maturity transformation.	11.0	999.0
201611	1368	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	One of our staff members, Nick Coleman, estimated the equation shown in panel 9 for European banks and confirmed that both declines in the level of short-term interest rates and shallower yield curves tend to lower net interest margins.	11.0	999.0
201611	1369	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	But he also found that the negative interest rates and very shallow yield curves prevailing in Europe explain only a small part of why these net interest margins are so low.	11.0	999.0
201611	1370	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Moreover, the low profitability of European banks likely reflects other factors besides low NIMS, such as excess capacity, failure to cut costs, low GDP growth, and legacy of nonperforming loans.	11.0	999.0
201611	1371	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, protecting the financial system is probably not a sufficient reason to forgo further stimulus.	11.0	999.0
201611	1372	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Instead, what Japan and especially Europe need are assertive measures to restore banking system health, including cutting costs, consolidation, and concerted capital raising.	11.0	999.0
201611	1373	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	The inadequate capital and profitability of Europe’s banks pose two threats to the outlook.	11.0	999.0
201611	1374	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	First, they may constrain lending, leading to lower investment and growth.	11.0	999.0
201611	1375	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Second, they raise the likelihood of bank failure.	11.0	999.0
201611	1376	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	The Tealbook features an alternative scenario in which the deterioration in the financial position of a large systemic bank in Europe requires its resolution.	11.0	999.0
201611	1377	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Obviously, it’s very difficult to predict the consequences of such an event.	11.0	999.0
201611	1378	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	In our scenario, the failure of the authorities to bail out the bank, concerns that other banks may have similar problems, and difficulties implementing the resolution process trigger disruptive spillovers and a retreat from risk in global financial markets.	11.0	999.0
201611	1379	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Europe falls back into recession, and—as shown in panels 10 through 12—the dollar appreciates, US GDP growth slows, and the federal funds rate rises more slowly.	11.0	999.0
201611	1380	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	While we are on the topic of financial stability, I’d like to briefly remind you of a new product developed by the International Finance Division that was presented in the QS financial stability report a couple of weeks ago: the International Financial Stability Matrix, or IFSM.	11.0	999.0
201611	1381	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	As shown in your final exhibit, the IFSM provides evaluations of financial vulnerability for 12 countries based on both quantitative data and judgmental assessments and, like the matrix for the US economy, is built up from assessments of various key sectors.	11.0	999.0
201611	1382	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	You may have noticed that I spoke about uncertainties in the foreign outlook for 10 minutes without discussing China.	11.0	999.0
201611	1383	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Indeed, China is one of the countries highlighted in our matrix as being especially vulnerable to financial disruptions, but describing its many issues would take at least another 10 minutes and would in any case cover pretty familiar ground.	11.0	999.0
201611	1384	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	I will cede that time to Michael, who will discuss US financial-stability issues.	11.0	999.0
201611	1385	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Thank you, Steve.	11.0	999.0
201611	1386	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I’m going to refer to the second handout titled “Material for Briefing on Financial Stability.”	11.0	999.0
201611	1387	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I’m going to review the staff’s latest assessment of vulnerabilities in the US financial system, drawing on the quarterly quantitative surveillance report (QS) you received two weeks ago.	11.0	999.0
201611	1388	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	As the report highlights, we continue to judge overall vulnerabilities in the financial system as moderate, due importantly to strong regulatory capital and liquidity positions among our largest banks, an absence of widespread valuation pressures across major asset categories, moderate growth of credit in the nonfinancial sector, and the effects of new money market fund rules that have lessened some key vulnerabilities associated with maturity and liquidity transformation.	11.0	999.0
201611	1389	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Turning to exhibit 1, the implementation of the new rules for prime money market funds has had a dramatic effect on the industry, as Lorie showed.	11.0	999.0
201611	1390	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	The first panel shows that money fund managers and investors have shifted about $1 trillion over the past year from prime funds, the red and blue lines, to government funds, in black.	11.0	999.0
201611	1391	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	As a result, the volume of confidence-sensitive, short-term private borrowing financed by money funds—the black line to the right—has plunged.	11.0	999.0
201611	1392	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	While this is good news for financial stability, we want to be attentive to how fund managers and borrowers adjust over time to the new environment.	11.0	999.0
201611	1393	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	For example, as shown by the red line, as government money fund assets have grown, these funds have substantially increased their holdings of Federal Home Loan Banks’ short-term paper.	11.0	999.0
201611	1394	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Moreover, the FHLBs appear to be increasing their own maturity transformation, as they have continued to lend at longer maturity to banks and nonbanks, including insurance companies.	11.0	999.0
201611	1395	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	In addition, financial institutions that used to rely on prime money funds appear to be turning more to funding secured by Treasury and agency collateral from government money funds, which is an increase in the funds’ counterparty risk.	11.0	999.0
201611	1396	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Finally, it is far too soon to know whether the current elevated level of government fund assets under management will ultimately migrate to other higher-yielding lending vehicles, which may be more run-prone than government funds.	11.0	999.0
201611	1397	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	So, for now, we lowered our assessment of the vulnerability to the financial system stemming from maturity and liquidity transformation by just half a notch to “between low and moderate” from just “moderate” in July.	11.0	999.0
201611	1398	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Turning to financial-sector leverage, we continue to assess this vulnerability as low.	11.0	999.0
201611	1399	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	As shown by the black line in the middle-left panel, the most systemically important US banks are currently holding high levels of regulatory capital.	11.0	999.0
201611	1400	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Their average Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio is now the same as that for smaller non- CCAR banks, the dotted blue line, and the largest banks currently meet their fully phased-in Basel III capital requirements, including their G-SIB surcharges.	11.0	999.0
201611	1401	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Large banks have been able to add capital in recent years even as net interest margins at the CCAR banks—the black line in the panel to the right—have been at very low levels, reflecting the effects of low short-term interest rates and a relatively flat yield curve.	11.0	999.0
201611	1402	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	A reasonable question is whether these banks have shifted their activities so as to be susceptible to rising rates in the future, but the answer seems to be “not particularly.”	11.0	999.0
201611	1403	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	The largest banks have been subject to such interest rate shocks in past stress tests, and the projected resulting losses have been manageable relative to capital—and much smaller than the losses generated under the severely adverse macroeconomic scenarios in the tests.	11.0	999.0
201611	1404	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	In terms of market indicators, premiums on credit default swaps for the largest domestic banks—plotted in the bottom-left panel—have remained relatively low in recent months, suggesting little concern among investors about the solvency of these firms.	11.0	999.0
201611	1405	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	In equity markets, as shown to the right, equity price-to-book ratios have edged down this year, on net—the purple bars are a touch below the green bars for each firm—and are below 1 for some of these firms, reflecting ongoing investor concerns regarding profitability in the context of low interest rates, slow economic growth, and more-stringent regulation.	11.0	999.0
201611	1406	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	The foreign banks shown in the figure have experienced noticeably larger drops in price-to-book this year, and the tenuous situation facing Deutsche Bank that Simon and Steve mentioned is reflected in its ratio of only 0.3.	11.0	999.0
201611	1407	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Spillovers from Deutsche Bank to the United States have been modest to date, consistent with our view that the financial system is resilient.	11.0	999.0
201611	1408	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	However, severe stress at the firm would be a stiffer test, and we included a box in the QS assessment describing some of the financial market channels through which the firm’s distress could be transmitted to the United States.	11.0	999.0
201611	1409	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	This QS round, we again spent a lot of time debating the assessment of systemic vulnerabilities associated with valuation pressures across a range of domestic asset markets.	11.0	999.0
201611	1410	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	The top panel of exhibit 2 tries to convey the dilemma.	11.0	999.0
201611	1411	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	The left-hand column of colors indicates that some key valuation metrics—the price-earnings ratio for S&P 500 firms, a “price index” for corporate bonds (reflecting the inverse of their yields), and the capitalization rate for recent commercial real estate transactions—all currently appear in the upper portions of their historical ranges, indicating “notable”	11.0	999.0
201611	1412	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	However, as shown in the right-hand column, relative to the unusually low level of Treasury yields, valuation pressures are “moderate”	11.0	999.0
201611	1413	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Thus, while the QS community generally agrees that low Treasury yields have continued to provide considerable support for risky asset prices, opinions are mixed about how resilient prices will prove to be.	11.0	999.0
201611	1414	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	In addition, we think a sharp rise in Treasury term premiums toward historic norms would present a significant risk to valuations.	11.0	999.0
201611	1415	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Our assessment framework for valuation pressures also includes monitoring nonprice developments, including lending standards and other indicators of investor risk appetite.	11.0	999.0
201611	1416	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	For corporate debt and commercial real estate mortgages, we see those as having moderated, on balance, over the past year or so.	11.0	999.0
201611	1417	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	In addition, exposures to credit losses from a drop in commercial real estate values are more significant for smaller banks than larger ones.	11.0	999.0
201611	1418	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	All told, we ended up maintaining our assessment that, on balance, vulnerabilities from valuation pressures are moderate at present.	11.0	999.0
201611	1419	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	The remainder of exhibit 2 plots a few indicators of vulnerabilities from nonfinancial-sector leverage, which we also gauge to be moderate overall.	11.0	999.0
201611	1420	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Debt in the private nonfinancial sector expanded a touch faster than GDP in the second quarter, so the credit-to-GDP ratio, the purple line, inched up but remained well below its estimated long-run trend, the black line.	11.0	999.0
201611	1421	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Not all of us view that trend as representing benign developments in the US financial system, however, so it is also worth noting that the current credit-to-GDP ratio is as high as it was in the middle of 2005.	11.0	999.0
201611	1422	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	In terms of the components of nonfinancial debt, aggregate leverage in the corporate sector has continued to be quite high by historical standards.	11.0	999.0
201611	1423	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	However, as shown in the bottom-left panel, growth over the past year in the total amount of higher-risk debt (junk bonds and leveraged loans, measured here in real terms) owed by US nonfinancial corporations has been slowing noticeably for several quarters and was unchanged, on net, over the past year.	11.0	999.0
201611	1424	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Moving to the right, you can see that the moderate aggregate rise in household debt has continued to accrue to borrowers with very high credit scores, the orange line.	11.0	999.0
201611	1425	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Exhibit 3 is the QS heat map, which, for the most part, resembles the version we presented in July.	11.0	999.0
201611	1426	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	The exception is the maturity and liquidity transformation category of vulnerabilities, toward the bottom on the right, which we changed from yellow to half-yellow and half-green to reflect the consequences of prime money market fund reform.	11.0	999.0
201611	1427	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Finally, the Board voted last week to affirm the current level of 0 percent for the countercyclical capital buffer for Advanced Approaches banks, based on the qualitative assessment that systemic vulnerabilities are not meaningfully greater than normal at present, so that large banking organizations do not need additional capacity to absorb above-normal losses at this stage of the credit cycle.	11.0	999.0
201611	1428	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Several quantitative guides based on nonfinancial credit growth, asset prices, and selected financial-sector indicators that we maintain currently prescribe a value of zero for the countercyclical capital buffer.	11.0	999.0
201611	1429	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201611	1430	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	That concludes our presentations, and we’ll be happy to take your questions.	11.0	999.0
201611	1431	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Questions?	12.0	65.0
201611	1432	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	12.0	65.0
201611	1433	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	12.0	81.0
201611	1434	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I’d like to hear more about this upgrade.	12.0	81.0
201611	1435	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	What caught my ear was the increase in maturity transformation activity at Federal Home Loan Banks.	12.0	81.0
201611	1436	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Let me just verify that they’re not off the table or out of bounds because they’re quasi-government.	12.0	81.0
201611	1437	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	If they’re risky, it counts as risk for you, right?	12.0	81.0
201611	1438	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201611	1439	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I want to verify that, but I also wanted to ask whether you have a quantitative sense that net or gross maturity transformation has decreased?	12.0	81.0
201611	1440	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	It seems like it has gone from some places to some other places.	12.0	81.0
201611	1441	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Right.	12.0	999.0
201611	1442	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	But is there is less of it now, or do you know that?	12.0	81.0
201611	1443	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I wouldn’t say there’s less of it.	12.0	999.0
201611	1444	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I’d say we think it’s in a little bit more stable, less run-prone form.	12.0	999.0
201611	1445	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	The FHLBs, I think, are a bit of an open question.	12.0	999.0
201611	1446	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	That’s another area in which I think we’re engaged in discussions among ourselves and in new research and analysis to think about, if that developed, how we would feel about it over time.	12.0	999.0
201611	1447	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Personally, I think anything that doubles in size over the course of a year is worth giving some attention to, and we are.	12.0	999.0
201611	1448	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	And I know we’ve got some decent understanding and knowledge about the FHLB systems and how they’re interacting with other money markets.	12.0	999.0
201611	1449	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	But I think that’s an area in which work is now going to be ongoing.	12.0	999.0
201611	1450	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	But they’re not off the table, so we wouldn’t say that because they’re agencies with implicit government support, we don’t need to consider their activities in the context of the system.	12.0	999.0
201611	1451	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Right.	12.0	81.0
201611	1452	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	So that’s definitely not true, and we’re just trying to see, compared with the highly run-prone prime money funds—which was, you know, from our perspective, a horrible vehicle for maturity transmission to take—whether this is a little bit of a better place to be.	12.0	999.0
201611	1453	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	But that’s why we’re half yellow and half green, because we haven’t really come down firmly on that particular question.	12.0	999.0
201611	1454	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Can I follow up?	12.0	81.0
201611	1455	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Is it like a dollar-for-dollar wash— why is it a better place?	12.0	81.0
201611	1456	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	The mutualization of the prime money funds with the rounded NAV provided a first-mover advantage for highly sophisticated investors that evidently were unwilling to take chances on receiving their money a few weeks after they thought they were promised it.	12.0	999.0
201611	1457	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	That was a very dangerous and run-prone vehicle.	12.0	999.0
201611	1458	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	12.0	81.0
201611	1459	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	The FHLBs themselves are doing a lot of maturity transformation and more than they were a year ago because they’ve been adding short-term debt, and they’ve not, as best we can tell, shortened their asset side at all, or at least not meaningfully.	12.0	999.0
201611	1460	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	So it’s worth looking at, but it is different.	12.0	999.0
201611	1461	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I don’t know a lot about the FHLBs, but they have the ability to take very senior positions in the debt structure of their lending.	12.0	999.0
201611	1462	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Again, that means that for better or worse, they do move up the seniority structure.	12.0	999.0
201611	1463	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	So in that sense, they should be, at high frequency, a little more stable.	12.0	999.0
201611	1464	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	But I think, as you might recall, FHLB discount notes’ spreads soared in the financial crisis.	12.0	999.0
201611	1465	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	They went to something like 150 basis points very quickly, and government money funds are not necessarily always going to be well positioned to absorb those price changes if they occurred.	12.0	999.0
201611	1466	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	If the confidence in the FHLBs were to erode, then I think it could be a problem.	12.0	999.0
201611	1467	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	12.0	81.0
201611	1468	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I remember learning suddenly about FHLBs when I discovered that the Atlanta one had a $50 billion credit to Countrywide and a total balance sheet of $120 billion.	12.0	81.0
201611	1469	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	That caught my attention.	12.0	81.0
201611	1470	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	How do you feel about the governance of these things?	12.0	81.0
201611	1471	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	How do you feel about their incentives and how well they’re run?	12.0	81.0
201611	1472	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	And do you monitor their investment side?	12.0	81.0
201611	1473	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Do you have visibility into that?	12.0	81.0
201611	1474	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I think we have visibility.	12.0	999.0
201611	1475	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	It’s a growth area for us.	12.0	999.0
201611	1476	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I’d say four months ago, the FHLBs were just entering the radar screen.	12.0	999.0
201611	1477	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Four months from now, I think we’ll be able to, with much more confidence than I could do today, have a more definitive stance about what the issues are and how we feel about them.	12.0	999.0
201611	1478	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	You wouldn’t criticize me for putting a little asterisk against this upgrade, would you?	12.0	81.0
201611	1479	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	No.	12.0	999.0
201611	1480	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Again, the half-green, half-yellow is signaling an asterisk from our perspective.	12.0	999.0
201611	1481	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	If I could make one comment.	12.0	999.0
201611	1482	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	On the decline in the black line, the CD + CP + ABCP, I think you asked about where that funding has gone.	12.0	999.0
201611	1483	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	We’re not able to totally quantify it.	12.0	999.0
201611	1484	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	Certainly, some of the European or Japanese institutions have termed out— gone a little bit longer.	12.0	999.0
201611	1485	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	We’ve heard them going to other asset managers or to insurance companies for slightly longer paper.	12.0	999.0
201611	1486	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	It makes us feel a little better.	12.0	999.0
201611	1487	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	That would be one.	12.0	999.0
201611	1488	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	In part, they are using the FX swap market, as Lorie said.	12.0	999.0
201611	1489	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	So that’s a plus, but we clearly wanted to show there are offsets here that need to be looked at.	12.0	999.0
201611	1490	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	We think, on net, it’s a little bit better.	12.0	999.0
201611	1491	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Right.	12.0	81.0
201611	1492	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	12.0	65.0
201611	1493	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Is yours a two-hander or one?	12.0	90.0
201611	1494	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I just wanted to talk about the Federal Home Loan Banks for a second.	12.0	96.0
201611	1495	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Okay.	12.0	90.0
201611	1496	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	We met with Federal Home Loan Bank of New York in a week or two ago.	12.0	96.0
201611	1497	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	A couple of points.	12.0	96.0
201611	1498	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	One, the incentive system is pretty good in the sense that they’re run as cooperatives.	12.0	96.0
201611	1499	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	They’re not trying to make profits for shareholders.	12.0	96.0
201611	1500	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So you don’t have the Fannie and Freddie issues that you saw for the GSEs.	12.0	96.0
201611	1501	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Two, their capital is sort of self- created.	12.0	96.0
201611	1502	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	As people take advances, it automatically creates capital.	12.0	96.0
201611	1503	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	And the point that Mike made about them being super senior is really important.	12.0	96.0
201611	1504	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	They’re collateralized loans, but they’re actually ahead of the FDIC in the capital stack.	12.0	96.0
201611	1505	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So if the depository were to fail, they actually have a claim senior to the FDIC.	12.0	96.0
201611	1506	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	They presumably could get in trouble from an asset quality issue, but they’re super senior.	12.0	96.0
201611	1507	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	They could get in trouble from an interest rate or transformation issue, but I think they’d have to take a lot of interest rate risk to really get into great difficulty.	12.0	96.0
201611	1508	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So I guess my bottom line after talking to them and looking at their performance during the financial crisis is, it could always be a risk, but it doesn’t seem to be something I’d put pretty high up on my list.	12.0	96.0
201611	1509	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s one person’s view.	12.0	96.0
201611	1510	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	12.0	65.0
201611	1511	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Mike, I also have a question for you.	12.0	90.0
201611	1512	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	It’s on exhibit 2, and I’m trying to figure out in my own mind how much comfort I should take from the change between the “level” and the “adjusted for Treasuries.”	12.0	90.0
201611	1513	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	One way to think of this chart is, if we were in a bubble world, the orange-red-red would more than likely be orange-red-red in the second column, and that would be a bubble.	12.0	90.0
201611	1514	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	If instead the mechanism was “reach-for-yield,” then it might look a lot like the column that you actually have there.	12.0	90.0
201611	1515	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	So I was trying to ask, in my own mind, is there an inherent reason why the risk of price reversal is greater in an asset-bubble world than it is for a “reach-for-yield” one, and should I take comfort in the difference between these two columns?	12.0	90.0
201611	1516	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Well, I can’t say that you shouldn’t.	12.0	999.0
201611	1517	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I think the reason we presented it this way is that, necessarily, you cannot feel better about the right-hand column than the left- hand column.	12.0	999.0
201611	1518	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	As a group, we frankly ended up splitting the difference.	12.0	999.0
201611	1519	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	And I tried to allude to that a little bit in my remarks, but I think we’re of two minds.	12.0	999.0
201611	1520	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	If you’re just somebody who’s discounting cash flows, and you’re using a risk-free rate and you don’t mind a rate that has a negative term premium in it to do your discounting, then, again, that’s the sense in which the right-hand column gives you more comfort, and I think neither of these have super predictive power for what the future price changes are going to be, but, on average, there’s probably a little bit of evidence for the right-hand side versus the left-hand side.	12.0	999.0
201611	1521	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	But I think it’s just a case in which we don’t know.	12.0	999.0
201611	1522	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	And I would say, to me, the low-term premiums as part of the calculus is part of the reason that I would be more inclined to hedge away from the right column toward the middle column.	12.0	999.0
201611	1523	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	That’s really an unusual pricing situation for these asset markets, and I guess I wouldn’t want to be too confident about how that would play out with a shock or even maybe with something that’s not even so shocking.	12.0	999.0
201611	1524	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	12.0	65.0
201611	1525	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Jeff—	12.0	102.0
201611	1526	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Yes, a two-hander.	12.0	81.0
201611	1527	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	He had a two-hander.	12.0	90.0
201611	1528	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Oh, did you want to—	12.0	81.0
201611	1529	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have a two-hander.	12.0	102.0
201611	1530	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	It’s a tie.	12.0	91.0
201611	1531	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	We tied.	12.0	102.0
201611	1532	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I think mine’s reasonably interesting.	12.0	81.0
201611	1533	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	12.0	81.0
201611	1534	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Is one way to interpret this that if you look at the valuations all by themselves of these risky assets, they look overvalued?	12.0	81.0
201611	1535	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	If you believe longer-term Treasury securities are at their right value, then these are not overvalued.	12.0	81.0
201611	1536	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	And so then my next question is, is that a fair description?	12.0	81.0
201611	1537	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	It’s certainly a description that you hear and that many people believe.	12.0	999.0
201611	1539	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	It seems implied by your colors, doesn’t it?	12.0	81.0
201611	1540	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I’m sure investors are taking many different approaches for valuations.	12.0	999.0
201611	1541	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Can you guess my next question?	12.0	81.0
201611	1542	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Are Treasury securiries overvalued?	12.0	81.0
201611	1543	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I don’t think Treasury securities are necessarily overvalued, but the term premium is out of its historical range.	12.0	999.0
201611	1544	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	So I have to think about it a little bit more as an empiricist rather than a theorist.	12.0	999.0
201611	1545	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Of course, a year ago we said it was out of its historical range, more likely to rise than to fall, and subsequently we’ve been marking down our forecast of what Treasury yields would do and what term premiums would do, because it seems like the world is different than the one we expected.	12.0	999.0
201611	1546	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	So that does set me up.	12.0	102.0
201611	1547	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	There are a couple of issues about whether Treasury securities are properly priced.	12.0	102.0
201611	1548	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	One issue is just this issue of very low r*.	12.0	102.0
201611	1549	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	How do you take that into account if you really think we’re in this world of very low rates?	12.0	102.0
201611	1550	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Then that obviously changes your view about what interest rates should be relative to the SEP.	12.0	102.0
201611	1551	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	But the second issue is the term premium itself.	12.0	102.0
201611	1552	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	In our earlier discussion today, I think we kind of came around to realizing that we’re probably going to have a big balance sheet for a long time despite our earlier public statements that we’re going to normalize the balance sheet.	12.0	102.0
201611	1553	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	So that could be an argument for a low term premium for a very long time.	12.0	102.0
201611	1554	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	In addition, I think there’s a growing recognition that the pricing of risk in the Treasury securities market has changed fundamentally from the 1980s and 1990s, when the risk you were protecting against was high inflation.	12.0	102.0
201611	1555	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	The market seems to be, at least based on what I’ve seen, pricing the downside scenario in terms of what you’re really worried about.	12.0	102.0
201611	1556	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And that is just going to push the term premium associated with a 10-year Treasury security from a high positive value to a potentially very low positive value or even a negative value.	12.0	102.0
201611	1557	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Getting back to President Lacker’s question:  How do you take into account both a very low r* and, probably because of a low r*, a shift in the equilibrium term premium when you do this kind of assessment?	12.0	102.0
201611	1558	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	As best we can.	12.0	999.0
201611	1559	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay.	12.0	102.0
201611	1560	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	We’re thinking about things very much the way that you are.	12.0	999.0
201611	1561	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	As I mentioned a second ago, over time, in the Tealbook baseline outlook, we’ve both lowered not just the r* in the forecast—which we’ve taken down, as you know, quite a bit—but we’ve also materially lowered where we think the term premium will end up over the long term, though it’s still well above where it is now.	12.0	999.0
201611	1562	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	We’ve also flattened out the trajectory.	12.0	999.0
201611	1563	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	We’ve elongated the time it will take for today’s term premium to migrate toward whatever we think its long-run equilibrium would be.	12.0	999.0
201611	1564	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	We did that all in the context of recognizing that the pricing is different, that the global equilibrium rates around the world are lower, and that’s going to have very persistent consequences.	12.0	999.0
201611	1565	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	So we’ve factored that in as best we can.	12.0	999.0
201611	1566	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes, but by implication, if I do the subtraction of the colors—if I can do this in my head—the Treasury securities are red, right?	12.0	102.0
201611	1567	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Well, maybe.	12.0	999.0
201611	1568	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	[Laughter]	12.0	999.0
201611	1569	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I wouldn’t necessarily put it that way.	12.0	999.0
201611	1570	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	It depends.	12.0	999.0
201611	1571	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I think we have people on the team who would say that longer-term Treasury yields could stay where they are today and stock prices could fall 15 percent over the next seven months if the economy evolves the way we think it will—if there are no surprises—just because the valuations that are implicit in today’s prices will prove to be unsustainable by themselves.	12.0	999.0
201611	1572	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Again, that’s not everybody on the team, it’s the position of people I respect.	12.0	999.0
201611	1573	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I don’t think it’s a ridiculous place to be, I guess.	12.0	999.0
201611	1574	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	It’s not like it’s only those people.	12.0	999.0
201611	1575	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	You read about that in other spheres as well.	12.0	999.0
201611	1576	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thomas.	12.0	65.0
201611	1577	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Perhaps merely to add the detail that, of course, we think that part of the low term premium is thanks to the large asset holdings.	12.0	999.0
201611	1578	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Right now, for example, the Kim-Wright model, which is informed by survey expectations as best as we can tell, is at about negative 50 basis points.	12.0	999.0
201611	1579	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	We think that the current effect of the balance sheet is about in the range of 85 basis points.	12.0	999.0
201611	1580	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	That would get you to an adjusted level of about 35 basis points.	12.0	999.0
201611	1581	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Certainly, that’s still low by historical standards, but as you point out, it might reflect a different perception of the hedging properties of long-term nominal safe assets.	12.0	999.0
201611	1582	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	12.0	65.0
201611	1583	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Just two questions.	12.0	108.0
201611	1584	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	First, why do you show the level of debt on a ratio scale?	12.0	108.0
201611	1585	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	What happens if you show debt service?	12.0	108.0
201611	1586	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Doesn’t everything look very different?	12.0	108.0
201611	1587	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Yes, debt service does look very different.	12.0	999.0
201611	1588	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	The debt service ratio for households is basically lower than it was between 1980 and 2013.	12.0	999.0
201611	1589	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I guess one reason we do it this way is that in 2006, the debt service ratio was also not looking particularly high, and so we think that—especially when you think about it in terms of originations—it’s also useful to track just the overall positions of households.	12.0	999.0
201611	1590	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Again, we do both, typically.	12.0	999.0
201611	1591	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	12.0	108.0
201611	1592	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	You said it’s also useful to track the overall positions, but the ones with the income are not shown.	12.0	108.0
201611	1593	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Right.	12.0	999.0
201611	1594	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	It’s hard for us to do income, because the data that we’re showing here are the credit-records data.	12.0	999.0
201611	1595	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	And, unfortunately, we get to see a lot about debt, but we don’t get to see much about income.	12.0	999.0
201611	1596	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	In these data, we don’t even get to see much about payments or risk—only a little bit about payments.	12.0	999.0
201611	1597	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	But the point I was trying to make here is a different one, which is that even insofar as we do see real increases in debt owed by households, it’s accruing to these households who have, in the data, virtually no delinquency rates or default rates.	12.0	999.0
201611	1598	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	It’s just a way to characterize, again, the overall likelihood of the sustainability of those balance sheet positions.	12.0	999.0
201611	1599	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	That’s the only thing I was trying to do there.	12.0	999.0
201611	1600	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And the second question:  Was it intentional that you showed “adjusted for Treasuries” in the national colors of Brazil?	12.0	108.0
201611	1601	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	12.0	108.0
201611	1602	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	No.	12.0	999.0
201611	1603	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	If you look at the legend, which is in probably a 4.5-point font beneath that table, you can see what we were trying to do is gauge where they were located in the historical distribution.	12.0	999.0
201611	1604	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	He’s just giving you a hard time.	12.0	97.0
201611	1605	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I know.	12.0	999.0
201611	1606	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	12.0	65.0
201611	1607	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I’d like to return to the top of exhibit 2 and the color chart and ask about the equity ratio valuation.	12.0	88.0
201611	1608	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I’ve been reading recently about growing concern over the changing structure of equity markets with exchange-traded funds and other aggregations of equities that are perhaps more vulnerable to runs.	12.0	88.0
201611	1609	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Two things are going on:  Exchange-traded funds are growing and the, let’s say, in the battle between passive and active management, passive is winning.	12.0	88.0
201611	1610	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Both suggest that in a really bad market, very disruptive runs could occur.	12.0	88.0
201611	1611	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Is that factored into your valuation here or is this just a P/E ratio effect?	12.0	88.0
201611	1612	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Here, this is just a P/E ratio.	12.0	999.0
201611	1613	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Now, again, when we’re thinking more broadly about the valuation pressures in the domestic equity markets, we do take a much broader view, and we certainly would entertain the possibility that changes in the microstructure of the markets were either reducing or adding to pressures beyond what we would see in our traditional or historical metric.	12.0	999.0
201611	1614	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	So that’s part of the perspective that we take.	12.0	999.0
201611	1615	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I think, though, it’s fair to say that in the US broad stock markets today, I haven’t heard people really emphasizing that the active versus the passive investors are particularly causing trouble evaluating the resilience of prices.	12.0	999.0
201611	1616	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	And I guess I don’t know much about the exchange- traded funds, but I have colleagues that do.	12.0	999.0
201611	1617	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Some people like the exchange traded fund as an instrument.	12.0	999.0
201611	1618	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	It depends on how these—what are the dealers called in the ETFs?	12.0	999.0
201611	1619	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	“Authorized participants.”	12.0	999.0
201611	1620	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Authorized participants.	12.0	999.0
201611	1621	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	It depends on how they’re going to behave in a period of stress, but in principle, investors can’t just pull their money out of those funds the way they can out of an open-ended long-term mutual fund.	12.0	999.0
201611	1622	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	So there’s a sense in which they may have more robustness than the long-term mutual fund model.	12.0	999.0
201611	1623	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	We’ve thought about that a lot in the context of loan funds and bond funds, but it could even be true in equity funds in principle.	12.0	999.0
201611	1624	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	12.0	65.0
201611	1625	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	91.0
201611	1626	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Is it okay to ask questions on the economic situation?	12.0	91.0
201611	1627	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	12.0	91.0
201611	1628	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Go ahead.	12.0	65.0
201611	1629	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	It’s a question for Eric about inflation expectations on exhibit 11.	12.0	91.0
201611	1630	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	We had taken note of the fact that, as you pointed out, the Michigan survey had dropped down to a historical low for inflation expectations, and then you did the trend-augmented calculation, taking into account food and energy inflation.	12.0	91.0
201611	1631	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	So I was staring at that for a little while, and I guess I have a question and an observation.	12.0	91.0
201611	1632	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	My question is whether or not the shaded region corresponds to the same type of uncertainty as it does for the other data.	12.0	91.0
201611	1633	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	The observation is, as I stared at it, that the other times the green line had sort of touched down on the bottom were both periods when the FOMC was either adding a lot of accommodation or had just recently added accommodation.	12.0	91.0
201611	1634	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	One was August 2003, when we did forward guidance by saying it’ll be a considerable period of time before we increase the funds rate.	12.0	91.0
201611	1635	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	The other one looks like it was the fall of 2012 when we started the open-ended asset purchases, QE3.	12.0	91.0
201611	1636	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	So as we’re on the downward slope here and perhaps haven’t touched bottom on that green line, I wonder if the circumstances aren’t a little bit different than just “it’s within the normal historical experience.”	12.0	91.0
201611	1637	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201611	1638	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	The gray shaded region is the 70 percent range for just the historical observations, unadjusted for anything, and so the green line being in that range is just an observation.	12.0	999.0
201611	1639	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	All the green line controls for, other than estimating a simple trend, is essentially movements in food and energy prices both contemporaneous and 12 months previous and 24 months previous.	12.0	999.0
201611	1640	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	That’s the lag structure.	12.0	999.0
201611	1641	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	And the estimated cofficients on these variables are all significant.	12.0	999.0
201611	1642	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	The coefficients on both the contemporaneous and the 12-month lags are of roughly equal size.	12.0	999.0
201611	1643	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	So that lag structure does seem to matter.	12.0	999.0
201611	1644	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	You raise a possibility that there may be something else in there.	12.0	999.0
201611	1645	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	We haven’t looked at that, but at least sort of walking through some of the history could be something we could consider to see if it does further explain the trend.	12.0	999.0
201611	1646	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Now, it’s also going to be the case that, looking ahead, if we do get the rise in food and energy prices that’s in the forecast, this measure should be kind of bottoming out and then moving up, if that’s what’s going on here.	12.0	999.0
201611	1647	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Right.	12.0	91.0
201611	1648	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	The way you did the presentation, I might have had the takeaway that looks like this is not that unusual, but recognizing those two episodes, I wonder about that.	12.0	91.0
201611	1649	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Sounds like it’s up for grabs, at least.	12.0	91.0
201611	1650	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Yes, point well taken.	12.0	999.0
201611	1651	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Any other questions?	12.0	65.0
201611	1652	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	12.0	65.0
201611	1653	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12.0	65.0
201611	1654	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	We now have an opportunity for people to comment, if they’d like, on financial-stability issues, and a few of you have indicated your desire to do so.	94.0	65.0
201611	1655	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s start with President Rosengren.	94.0	65.0
201611	1656	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	90.0
201611	1657	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	My comments on financial stability usually highlight increased risks to financial stability.	94.0	90.0
201611	1658	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Today I wanted to highlight that one risk associated with the shadow banking system has clearly declined, as was mentioned in the Tealbook and the presentations we just heard.	94.0	90.0
201611	1659	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	The recent trillion-dollar movement out of prime money market funds into government-only money market funds represents a relatively rare instance in which we have been successful in intentionally reducing risk in the shadow banking system.	94.0	90.0
201611	1660	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Prime money market funds were a source of great instability during the financial crisis.	94.0	90.0
201611	1661	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	The promise of a fixed NAV on a fund for which investments for a significant credit duration risk turned out to be a promise they could not necessarily keep, especially in the wake of Lehman’s failure.	94.0	90.0
201611	1662	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	A very substantial movement into government funds as a result of regulatory changes to prime money market funds should give us some hope that, with sufficient perseverance, we will be able to identify other significant areas of instability in the shadow banking system, discuss them publicly, and get them changed.	94.0	90.0
201611	1663	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	94.0	90.0
201611	1664	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	94.0	65.0
201611	1665	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I just want to make a few comments on one of the risks that’s already been highlighted by several different people on the staff, which is Deutsche Bank.	94.0	96.0
201611	1666	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	As I see it, there are multiple problems here:  a bad business model, poor execution, undercapitalization, and multiple legal cases that will result in large fines that will certainly put even greater pressure on the bank’s capital.	94.0	96.0
201611	1667	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	And the situation is made worse because of the lack of visibility about when the legal cases will be settled and the amount of fines that will ultimately be assessed.	94.0	96.0
201611	1668	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The firm is apparently waiting to settle its RMBS case with the Department of Justice before unveiling its new strategy, which apparently is going to be to shrink to a smaller, more reasonable footprint supplemented by a large equity capital raise.	94.0	96.0
201611	1669	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	But the problem is that, in the meantime, the franchise is eroding, which undercuts the firm’s future profitability prospects.	94.0	96.0
201611	1670	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	This also makes it more difficult for the firm to raise the necessary equity to shore up its balance sheet.	94.0	96.0
201611	1671	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I think someone remarked that it’s selling at 0.3 times book value currently.	94.0	96.0
201611	1672	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So the firm is very fragile, and even though it announced its earnings last week and nothing really bad happened, the risk of an abrupt loss of confidence seems to still be very, very high.	94.0	96.0
201611	1673	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I remember the summer of 2008 when there were weeks and months when there were firms that looked okay.	94.0	96.0
201611	1674	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	That didn’t mean that they turned out to be okay.	94.0	96.0
201611	1675	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, one might argue that the German government will not let Deutsche Bank fail because it is their largest bank, and that could be correct, but I think it does ignore two constraints, one political and one legal.	94.0	96.0
201611	1676	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The political constraint is that a German government bailout of Deutsche Bank would be very unpopular politically, and that’s particularly relevant in the current environment, in light of the upcoming German election and the fact that Angela Merkel’s popularity is already somewhat diminished.	94.0	96.0
201611	1677	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The German government has said they will not do a recap, but it’s unclear what their appetite would be if there was actually no alternative.	94.0	96.0
201611	1678	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The legal constraint is the European Union’s bank competition policy, which sharply constrains the ability of national governments to recapitalize, as opposed to resolve, their troubled institutions.	94.0	96.0
201611	1679	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	In a resolution, bank debt has to be built in, which means large losses for investors and a heightened risk of contagion.	94.0	96.0
201611	1680	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So they’re in a difficult place.	94.0	96.0
201611	1681	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Although the financial system is a lot stronger today than it was in 2008, I believe that the failure of a firm the size and complexity of Deutsche Bank would have significant consequences for the stability of the global financial system.	94.0	96.0
201611	1682	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Deutsche Bank has a huge derivatives book, and a significant portion of this book is still cleared on a bilateral rather than centrally settled basis.	94.0	96.0
201611	1683	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Moreover, the risk of failure really isn’t priced in to any significant degree, although Deutsche Bank’s five-year CDS is elevated relative to other institutions.	94.0	96.0
201611	1684	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s only trading in a range of 200 to 250 basis points, which is far lower than a number of institutions that actually did not fail during the 2008 financial crisis.	94.0	96.0
201611	1685	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think that if Deutsche Bank did fail, it would be a pretty big surprise, and so the shock would be even more intensified.	94.0	96.0
201611	1686	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I also don’t think it would be viewed as a purely idiosyncratic event, because there are other firms that are challenged in terms of profitability, business model, and uncertain legal liabilities, including banks like Credit Suisse and Barclays.	94.0	96.0
201611	1687	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, on the positive side, I think those firms have some core businesses that are well functioning and actually do have fundamentally stronger franchises, but I have little doubt that if Deutsche Bank failed, it would put significant pressure on several other major banking institutions.	94.0	96.0
201611	1688	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Of course, what’s frustrating about all of this is, what do we do about it sitting here in the United States?	94.0	96.0
201611	1689	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, there’s not much we can do but to ensure that Deutsche Bank has sufficient liquidity in the United States so there is no late-day funding shortfall, and to press Deutsche Bank and the ECB, which is its supervisor, to have Deutsche Bank settle its RMBS case with the Department of Justice as swiftly as possible.	94.0	96.0
201611	1690	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Settlement of the case, I think, would be important, because it would encourage Deutsche Bank to then go forward and announce its new strategy, quickly followed by a raising of capital.	94.0	96.0
201611	1691	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think if those two things could happen, we might be in a somewhat better place.	94.0	96.0
201611	1692	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	But where we’re sitting today is not something that makes me very confident.	94.0	96.0
201611	1693	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	94.0	96.0
201611	1694	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201611	1695	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	94.0	65.0
201611	1696	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks.	94.0	108.0
201611	1697	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Could I ask a question?	94.0	110.0
201611	1698	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	There is a two-hander there.	94.0	108.0
201611	1699	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Oh.	94.0	65.0
201611	1700	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, President Kaplan.	94.0	65.0
201611	1701	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	This discussion begs the obvious question, which I guess I’ll just ask.	94.0	110.0
201611	1702	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I am familiar with the bank, and it does have profitability.	94.0	110.0
201611	1703	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	And, although there are other issues, the accelerant to this is a $14 billion fine for a $13 billion-less-market-cash company.	94.0	110.0
201611	1704	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	That is just the Department of Justice’s opening offer.	94.0	96.0
201611	1705	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	That doesn’t mean that’s where it will end up.	94.0	96.0
201611	1706	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	But it has created substantial instability because of the uncertainty about where they are ultimately going to settle.	94.0	110.0
201611	1707	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	What I’m asking is—although I guess you may not agree with that premise—if that were true, what could we do?	94.0	110.0
201611	1708	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Is there something that should be discussed so we don’t manufacture a crisis?	94.0	110.0
201611	1709	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	No, I don’t think there is anything for us to do, in that sense.	94.0	96.0
201611	1710	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The Department of Justice has to do what it has to do, and I don’t think there is any role for us.	94.0	96.0
201611	1711	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Okay.	94.0	110.0
201611	1712	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	There is the case, then there is the amount of the fine, and then there is the way it is being negotiated.	94.0	110.0
201611	1713	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Even though the ultimate negotiation may ultimately wind up being a far smaller number, the headline will do a lot of damage.	94.0	110.0
201611	1714	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The problem here is lack of clarity.	94.0	96.0
201611	1715	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The lack of clarity means that people have no visibility about when it will be resolved.	94.0	96.0
201611	1716	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	And in the meantime, the franchise value of this company is eroding because of the wide level of uncertainty .	94.0	96.0
201611	1717	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I know.	94.0	110.0
201611	1718	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I watch it every day.	94.0	110.0
201611	1719	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	So you can argue that there is some sort of combination of size of settlement and speed of settlement that are both probably relevant here.	94.0	110.0
201611	1720	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Nellie.	94.0	65.0
201611	1721	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	I just wanted to add that Deutsche Bank has been an ongoing issue for most of this year.	94.0	999.0
201611	1722	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	It wasn’t just this settlement.	94.0	999.0
201611	1723	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	I think its stock price fell about 50 percent in January, and it has not recovered.	94.0	999.0
201611	1724	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	So it has got a thin capital cushion.	94.0	999.0
201611	1725	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	It is not only the DOJ.	94.0	999.0
201611	1726	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	And there are other cases besides the current RMBS case that are relevant here, which makes it even more complicated.	94.0	96.0
201611	1727	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	94.0	65.0
201611	1728	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	108.0
201611	1729	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The quantity of QS that has been presented by the Financial Stability Division is really very good, and it raises a lot of questions and answers a lot of questions.	94.0	108.0
201611	1730	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Let me say a few words first about the IFSM, the International Financial Stability Matrix, which extends the assessment of the Financial Stability Division to 12 foreign countries and produces a very colorful quilt for us to look at.	94.0	108.0
201611	1731	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	It is extremely ambitious.	94.0	108.0
201611	1732	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	It is a lot of work, but there is one big reason you want to know about other countries, and that is how the system as a whole will work and what the dynamics of the system will be.	94.0	108.0
201611	1733	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And that’s a whole other level of difficulty in looking at this.	94.0	108.0
201611	1734	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And you might ask at some point whether you actually need to have 13 countries in this system of equations or whether you can manage with fewer.	94.0	108.0
201611	1735	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	But it’s a very ambitious, very bold, and, at this stage, very interesting piece of work.	94.0	108.0
201611	1736	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Congratulations.	94.0	108.0
201611	1737	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Then the first part is the regular QS of the US financial system, which starts with Deutsche Bank.	94.0	108.0
201611	1738	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	So I am going to say a few things related to what Vice Chairman Dudley just said, which is, so far, nothing seems to be happening in the standoff between the Department of Justice and Deutsche Bank.	94.0	108.0
201611	1739	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I suppose you could call this a phony war, but I also suppose that actually there is a lot going on in the background.	94.0	108.0
201611	1740	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	One of the things we do know is that if the dynamics that the staff has looked at continue, then Deutsche Bank would find itself, after eight weeks, with very little left in the way of liquidity.	94.0	108.0
201611	1741	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Well, what happens then?	94.0	108.0
201611	1742	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Either Deutsche Bank is rescued from bankruptcy or from the hands of the regulators in some fashion, or the international system—and that means especially the European financial system—faces a very difficult situation.	94.0	108.0
201611	1743	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Now, I don’t know the inside details to the extent that Vice Chairman Dudley probably does, but it’s standard in games of chicken—and this is one of them—that there is a lengthy period of confrontation, but they end.	94.0	108.0
201611	1744	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	How will it end?	94.0	108.0
201611	1745	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We don’t know.	94.0	108.0
201611	1746	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We are dealing with a German government that was thought to be playing a game of chicken with Greece and didn’t actually blink very much in that entire process.	94.0	108.0
201611	1747	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And it is trying to set an example for the rest of Europe, but it is not going to want Deutsche Bank to go broke.	94.0	108.0
201611	1748	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	So it is going to be a very interesting and a very closely run thing.	94.0	108.0
201611	1749	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And one of the troubles with a game of chicken is that, occasionally, neither side withdraws, and then you get a crash.	94.0	108.0
201611	1750	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And I don’t know, and don’t think any of us can know, what is going to happen.	94.0	108.0
201611	1751	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	There is a very good box later in the paper on how Deutsche Bank’s problems would affect us, and it ends on a sober note, which I think actually is the note that was read to us earlier, which says that holding bank capitalization and the intensity of regulation constant, all these factors—and I will tell you what they are in a moment—should make the equity and subordinated debt of a large bank appear substantially riskier now than before the crisis.	94.0	108.0
201611	1752	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	What are these factors?	94.0	108.0
201611	1753	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Well, we now know that house prices can drop at the national level, and they did drop 25 percent.	94.0	108.0
201611	1754	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We also know that financial crises can happen more than once.	94.0	108.0
201611	1755	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And, finally—this is a very delicate way that you put it—the support for too-big-to-fail policies might have weakened considerably.	94.0	108.0
201611	1756	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	So it is a different situation, and much of history is not entirely relevant.	94.0	108.0
201611	1757	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And I don’t think we know very much about what is going to happen, and we probably all have the feeling that President Kaplan has, but we don’t interfere in the Department of Justice, and we hope they don’t interfere here, and that’s it.	94.0	108.0
201611	1758	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The matrix on exhibit 3, which we have talked about a little bit, shows considerable stability.	94.0	108.0
201611	1759	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	In the last year, there have been only two changes in color, and they might amount to only one and a half changes.	94.0	108.0
201611	1760	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	But both are improvements, so the last year has been good for the financial stability of the United States.	94.0	108.0
201611	1761	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The overall assessment over the year has been steady.	94.0	108.0
201611	1762	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The bottom line, the one that is all yellow, says that the level of vulnerability of the US financial system is moderate, which is a good level, because if it was much better, we would have to begin worrying about complacency.	94.0	108.0
201611	1763	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	94.0	108.0
201611	1764	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	But I doubt that that is what will happen with Nellie’s troops, even after she has gone.	94.0	108.0
201611	1765	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Another few comments.	94.0	108.0
201611	1766	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The reform of the prime money market funds seems to have gone very well, and congratulations to all involved, many of them in this room.	94.0	108.0
201611	1767	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Second, on valuation pressures—this is a very complicated section of the report, and we have had some discussion of the complications already.	94.0	108.0
201611	1768	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The report says valuation pressures are moderate.	94.0	108.0
201611	1769	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	It says estimates of expected Treasury security yields are more or less in line with past experience, which surprised me.	94.0	108.0
201611	1770	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	But it then says that, even so, a risk that a sharp rise in interest rates not driven by improving economic conditions could trigger broad declines in asset prices.	94.0	108.0
201611	1771	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And that is a question I think, again, that we have all been asking ourselves.	94.0	108.0
201611	1772	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We know we reduced the interest rate to get asset prices up.	94.0	108.0
201611	1773	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We assumed, at least I assumed, that as the economy improved, we would just move into a situation with a higher interest rate, which justified, more or less, the higher level to which prices have gotten.	94.0	108.0
201611	1774	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	But we haven’t seen the economy improving to that extent, and so I suppose that is what is being said.	94.0	108.0
201611	1775	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	If we get into a situation in which interest rates rise for a reason not driven by improving economic conditions, we are going to be in a difficult situation.	94.0	108.0
201611	1776	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Nonetheless, the bottom line is, broad indicators of household solvency have remained within historical norms.	94.0	108.0
201611	1777	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Now, just four concluding comments.	94.0	108.0
201611	1778	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	One was almost said by President Rosengren.	94.0	108.0
201611	1779	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	There isn’t a whole lot on the shadow banking system.	94.0	108.0
201611	1780	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Second, the task of a monitoring agency is a very difficult one.	94.0	108.0
201611	1781	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	If you keep on monitoring and your brilliant interventions prevent anything happening, no one knows unless you go out and boast about it, but you shouldn’t.	94.0	108.0
201611	1782	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	But if you keep on monitoring and a crisis occurs, everyone knows, and that’s why it is difficult.	94.0	108.0
201611	1783	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The equilibrium of this process, however, is likely to result in an excess of crises called over the number that actually occur, and that actually may be an optimal outcome.	94.0	108.0
201611	1784	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Third, in evaluating financial stability, we should presumably also try to describe what is likely to happen in the way of damages and in the way of policies to mitigate the resultant crises.	94.0	108.0
201611	1785	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We could ask the FS Division to do one or two case studies of how a crisis would be dealt with, and it is very close to what you did in the case of Deutsche Bank in the box.	94.0	108.0
201611	1786	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And that was not a comforting analysis, and we might find that about other potential crises.	94.0	108.0
201611	1787	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Fourth and finally, as the Chair announced, this is Nellie’s last FOMC meeting.	94.0	108.0
201611	1788	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Nellie, you will leave the Federal Reserve with the gratitude of those with whom you have worked over the past 30 years, and with the gratitude of some with whom you have worked only over the last 2 years.	94.0	108.0
201611	1789	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And you will end your service at the Fed having transformed a small office into a mighty Division of Financial Stability.	94.0	108.0
201611	1790	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	When someone asks the Chair how many economic divisions she has [laughter], she can say, “Thirty-three percent more than I had last year.”	94.0	108.0
201611	1791	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And she will add, “And it’s a damn good division, too.”	94.0	108.0
201611	1792	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We thank you for everything you have done, Nellie, together with your colleagues in the FS Division and in cooperation with other divisions.	94.0	108.0
201611	1793	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	You have done it extraordinarily well.	94.0	108.0
201611	1794	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Good luck as you move on.	94.0	108.0
201611	1795	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We will miss you.	94.0	108.0
201611	1796	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	Thank you very much.	94.0	999.0
201611	1797	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	94.0	65.0
201611	1798	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’re ready now to go into our round on economic comments.	13.0	65.0
201611	1799	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And our first speaker is President Williams.	13.0	65.0
201611	1800	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	All right.	13.0	102.0
201611	1801	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m losing half my audience.	13.0	102.0
201611	1802	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	102.0
201611	1803	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Real GDP growth in the third quarter was strong.	13.0	102.0
201611	1804	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	The economy grew almost twice as fast as my estimate of its sustainable trend, which is about 1½ percent.	13.0	102.0
201611	1805	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, we have to remember that the quarterly numbers can be volatile, and they’re subject to one-off transitory factors such as the spike in soybean exports and residual seasonality.	13.0	102.0
201611	1806	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, in the past, some people, including my good friend who sits here to my right, have claimed that I only talk about seasonal adjustment problems when the real GDP number is weak.	13.0	102.0
201611	1807	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	So to prove him wrong, let me wade back into the weeds of residual seasonality one more time when residual seasonality is, in fact, likely giving us an overly optimistic read on the economy.	13.0	102.0
201611	1808	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Just to recall, the main problem is that, on average, first-quarter real GDP growth has been weaker than growth in other quarters even after seasonal adjustment.	13.0	102.0
201611	1809	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, this seems to reflect the BEA’s bottom-up methodology, which seasonally adjusts the individual subcomponents instead of the aggregate number directly.	13.0	102.0
201611	1810	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	But small amounts of seasonal variation at the granular level when aggregated can affect the top-line GDP numbers.	13.0	102.0
201611	1811	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the past, to correct for this residual seasonality, my staff has applied a second line of seasonal adjustment to the published aggregates, taking, in effect, a top-down approach.	13.0	102.0
201611	1812	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Recently, the BEA has taken some steps to reduce residual seasonality, and in this summer’s annual revision, it implemented several improvements to its seasonal adjustment methodology.	13.0	102.0
201611	1813	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	That creates a little bit of a problem, because in that annual revision, the BEA only provided us with three and a half years of historical data using these new procedures, and that short sample means it’s hard to calculate a precise magnitude of any remaining residual seasonality.	13.0	102.0
201611	1814	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, furthermore, a complete sample of the consistently revised GDP data won’t be available until 2018 when we get the next comprehensive NIPA revision.	13.0	102.0
201611	1815	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	So until then, I won’t go so far as to say that we’re flying blind on this important issue, but our windshield is still fogged up.	13.0	102.0
201611	1816	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	In view of the likelihood of some remaining residual seasonality, it seems appropriate to focus even more on the four-quarter growth rates of real GDP and prices.	13.0	102.0
201611	1817	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And on that basis, both real GDP growth and core PCE inflation appear likely to be around 1¾ percent this year, which is in line with the September SEP—that is, on balance, the recent data have been consistent with our expectations.	13.0	102.0
201611	1818	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, much of the economic and policy discussions focus on the balance of risks associated with the forecast and the management of those risks.	13.0	102.0
201611	1819	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	One risk that has been highlighted in the Tealbook and in the presentation today is that future interest rate hikes and the associated divergence in global monetary policies may cause an appreciation of the dollar.	13.0	102.0
201611	1820	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	For example, the Tealbook currently expects the dollar to rise almost 5 percent over the next couple of years as market participants’ expectations of FOMC rate actions are revised up.	13.0	102.0
201611	1821	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Underlying this projection, the Tealbook assumes that each 100 basis point funds rate surprise leads to a 3 percent appreciation in the dollar.	13.0	102.0
201611	1822	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	This effect—the “bang for the buck,” if you will—is based on recent dollar responses that are somewhat larger than historical averages.	13.0	102.0
201611	1823	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	In looking into this issue, my staff investigated the robustness of the estimated dollar response across several different specifications to get a sense of how much larger or smaller it could be.	13.0	102.0
201611	1824	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And while the dollar has shown greater sensitivity to interest rate movements since 2014, overall, this change isn’t statistically significant one account is taken of the wide empirical confidence intervals surrounding these estimates.	13.0	102.0
201611	1825	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, these wide confidence intervals also imply that there is a risk that the exchange value of the dollar may appreciate even more than assumed in the Tealbook.	13.0	102.0
201611	1826	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I don’t lose too much sleep over this risk, because it can be fairly easily mitigated by an adjustment in the path of policy.	13.0	102.0
201611	1827	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	For example, if we raise interest rates a bit and we see a larger-than-expected rise in the dollar, we can offset this jump by postponing future funds rate increases appropriately.	13.0	102.0
201611	1828	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	We don’t need to let risk-management caution turn into paralysis.	13.0	102.0
201611	1829	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And it’s important to see the risks on both sides.	13.0	102.0
201611	1830	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	There are downside risks to inflation from an outsized appreciation in the dollar, but there are also notable upside risks.	13.0	102.0
201611	1831	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	The divergence between the PCE and CPI inflation rates may get resolved in favor of the CPI.	13.0	102.0
201611	1832	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	That may happen, for example, if the unusually weak PCE health-care price inflation starts to rise next year.	13.0	102.0
201611	1833	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Also, there’s no question that wage growth is picking up.	13.0	102.0
201611	1834	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	If you look at the apples-to- apples measure like the Atlanta Fed Wage Growth Tracker, that’s been increasing, but other labor cost measures are firming somewhat as well.	13.0	102.0
201611	1835	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And if these upside risks play out, inflation could easily overshoot our 2 percent target next year.	13.0	102.0
201611	1836	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t think that would be such a big problem, because in that case, monetary policy should be positioned to shift to a much less accommodative stance.	13.0	102.0
201611	1837	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	For the real economy, the risks look fairly balanced.	13.0	102.0
201611	1838	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	While the improvement in labor force participation this year has bought us some time, I see a low probability of a repeat performance next year.	13.0	102.0
201611	1839	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	So it seems more likely that job gains will outpace labor force growth, and the unemployment rate will go back to edging down to somewhere between 4½ and 4¾ percent.	13.0	102.0
201611	1840	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	To sum up, the economic expansion looks like it’s on track.	13.0	102.0
201611	1841	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	The labor market is strong and shows solid momentum, inflation is moving back toward our 2 percent goal, and we’re well positioned for a gradual increase in interest rates.	13.0	102.0
201611	1842	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13.0	102.0
201611	1843	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	1844	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	13.0	65.0
201611	1845	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201611	1846	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I expect the economy will likely reach 2 percent core PCE inflation and my estimate of full employment, which is 4.7 percent, sometime next year.	13.0	90.0
201611	1847	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Achievement of both parts of our mandate in 2017 is likely, conditional on my forecast of continued above-potential economic growth over the next couple of years.	13.0	90.0
201611	1848	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	We are already relatively close to full employment, and with projected output growth above potential next year, we may well see the unemployment rate continue to decline gradually , although this, of course, depends on the evolution of labor force participation, a topic to which I will now turn.	13.0	90.0
201611	1849	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	One reason to be skeptical that labor markets will tighten further might be the constancy of the unemployment rate over the course of this year.	13.0	90.0
201611	1850	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Of course, a relatively flat unemployment rate, despite reasonably strong payroll employment growth, is a good sign for the economy, as it implies that the labor force has grown strongly over the past year.	13.0	90.0
201611	1851	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, there is reason to believe that this good news on labor force growth is unlikely to persist too far into the future.	13.0	90.0
201611	1852	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	At the Boston Federal Reserve conference last month, papers by Robert Hall and Alan Krueger each emphasized important secular trends in labor force participation.	13.0	90.0
201611	1853	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	In particular, the paper by Krueger suggests that the scope for further increases in labor force participation may be limited by the fact that a large portion of the working-age male population currently out of the labor force reports having a serious health condition that is a barrier to work.	13.0	90.0
201611	1854	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is also worth noting that while the recent increase in labor force participation can be interpreted as evidence of slack in the labor market, participation does feature a cyclical component.	13.0	90.0
201611	1855	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	From a cyclical perspective, the rise in labor force participation, rather than a sign of slack, could well be taken as a sign of a labor market that is nearing full employment.	13.0	90.0
201611	1856	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I hope that the recent increase in labor force participation at this juncture of the business cycle will prove persistent, it is also important to be mindful that the historical experience in the United States is not especially supportive of such a view.	13.0	90.0
201611	1857	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Work by my staff indicates that workers entering the labor force at age 25 or older in a good labor market do not exhibit a significantly higher permanence, measured over a 12-year span, in the labor force than similar workers entering the labor market at other stages of the business cycle.	13.0	90.0
201611	1858	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	In all, we should not be overly confident that output growth above potential will continue to entice new entrants into the labor force, nor that those who enter will remain for long.	13.0	90.0
201611	1859	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	With the aging of the baby boom and its entrance into retirement, along with the limited evidence that labor force growth is likely to continue, I expect that output growth above its potential rate will result in a gradual decline in the unemployment rate.	13.0	90.0
201611	1860	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Turning to potential signals of labor market tightness, evidence suggests that both wages and prices seem to be gradually rising.	13.0	90.0
201611	1861	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Core PCE prices over the past year have risen 1.7 percent.	13.0	90.0
201611	1862	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	If, in fact, we reach 2 percent inflation by next year, it will likely have an effect on financial market prices and the relative stability we have enjoyed over the past year.	13.0	90.0
201611	1863	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	The Tealbook is forecasting a fairly gradual rise in the 10-year Treasury rate.	13.0	90.0
201611	1864	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I hope that is the outcome, I am worried that the long rate response may be more unruly than the Tealbook envisions as markets realize that their assumed funds rate path is inconsistent with having achieved our dual mandate, with the prospect of further labor market tightening still to come.	13.0	90.0
201611	1865	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	In sum, we are currently quite close to achieving our dual mandate.	13.0	90.0
201611	1866	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Both my forecast and that in the Tealbook expect the unemployment rate to undershoot the natural rate.	13.0	90.0
201611	1867	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Our ability to pursue a path of gradual tightening will be dependent on when we resume raising rates.	13.0	90.0
201611	1868	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Tomorrow I will discuss in more detail why delaying too long could be costly.	13.0	90.0
201611	1869	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201611	1870	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	1871	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13.0	65.0
201611	1872	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201611	1873	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I think everyone shares the intuition that monetary policy operates with a lag, although I would note, in passing, that this means that a central bank may keep tightening for too long as well as that it may wait too long to begin tightening.	13.0	97.0
201611	1874	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But saying we shouldn’t wait too long is almost tautological and not particularly helpful in deciding when to move.	13.0	97.0
201611	1875	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	There have been suggestions in some quarters going back several years or more about the existence of lags, arguing for raising rates relatively soon after the suggestion was made.	13.0	97.0
201611	1876	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And, of course, many more people have been voicing this view in the past year or so.	13.0	97.0
201611	1877	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I certainly didn’t find this view convincing two or three or four years ago.	13.0	97.0
201611	1878	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But as I mentioned at our previous meeting, although I haven’t yet been persuaded—and, thus, I haven’t been in favor of incurring the costs of the marginal jobs and economic growth that would not be realized with another rate hike taking place sooner rather than later—I have found the case a closer one over the past few meetings.	13.0	97.0
201611	1879	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Because not moving won’t be the right position forever, except perhaps if secular stagnation has gripped the economy with a vengeance, I have tried to define for myself with a little more specificity when the intuition of a preemptive move should click in.	13.0	97.0
201611	1880	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	There doesn’t seem to be a consensus answer to the question of how long the implementation lag may be.	13.0	97.0
201611	1881	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I’ve seen everything from three months to two years, with relatively more views in the two-to-three- quarter range.	13.0	97.0
201611	1882	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And I should note that, if one’s concern is financial stability, the implementation lag may be a good bit shorter than that affecting real economic activity.	13.0	97.0
201611	1883	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And, of course, the length of the implementation lag isn’t the only important question.	13.0	97.0
201611	1884	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Also important are the relative degree of certainty that conditions are emerging that will recommend a monetary policy response and the relative magnitude of the risks associated with dealing with possible adverse outcomes that suggest ex post it would have been better to have followed the policy road not taken.	13.0	97.0
201611	1885	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	While I suppose the implementation lag may have changed even in the past year or so, I think it would be very difficult to determine with any certainty whether that’s been the case.	13.0	97.0
201611	1886	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And I don’t think that what I’ve regarded as the asymmetric balance of risks or the relevance of a low r* that may remain low indefinitely have changed materially in recent months.	13.0	97.0
201611	1887	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	In examining whether my own position should change, I focused mostly on the questions of the relative degree of confidence that conditions will emerge, counseling a rate increase, and the relative magnitude of risks associated with possible adverse outcomes in both directions.	13.0	97.0
201611	1888	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I’m not going to repeat my self-described pragmatic view, which you’ve all probably heard plenty of times.	13.0	97.0
201611	1889	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But let me mention a few developments that have affected my assessment as to whether we are closer to the point at which a failure to remove more accommodation would begin to carry sufficiently high risks that it is worth the admittedly hard-to-quantify opportunity costs of some number of additional jobs being created.	13.0	97.0
201611	1890	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	On the labor market front, I continue to believe there is more slack—that is, that the trend of the past year or more of job creation well above the number of new entrants with an essentially flat unemployment rate can continue.	13.0	97.0
201611	1891	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Again, though, this view won’t be right forever.	13.0	97.0
201611	1892	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And even though the flat Phillips curve means that the pass-through from potentially increased nominal wage growth to price inflation is not all that direct, I think nearly everyone agrees that, directionally at least, there is some correlation.	13.0	97.0
201611	1893	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	So I’ve been watching for some indication in the data that this trend may be nearing its end.	13.0	97.0
201611	1894	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think there’s too much in wage patterns yet.	13.0	97.0
201611	1895	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Here, not much has changed in the past year.	13.0	97.0
201611	1896	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	There is one measure suggesting we have begun to see some increased distance between industries in which wages are growing faster and those in which they are not—something that, in the past, has been correlated with later acceleration across the board.	13.0	97.0
201611	1897	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But this is the measure based on three-digit industry codes, and even then it’s not that significant a move.	13.0	97.0
201611	1898	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	The more granular four-digit industry code measure shows no change at all.	13.0	97.0
201611	1899	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Our labor economists did, however, point out something that might prove to be a harbinger of the end of the aforementioned trend.	13.0	97.0
201611	1900	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	At the height of past business cycles, the labor force participation rate has increased somewhat above its trend but, with the exception of the halcyon period of very high growth in the late 1990s, not for more than a couple of quarters.	13.0	97.0
201611	1901	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Under the staff’s current estimate of trend labor force participation, actual labor force participation has, for the first time since the financial crisis, exceeded the trend, albeit by a very small margin.	13.0	97.0
201611	1902	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Now, I think the staff would agree that we shouldn’t have a high degree of confidence in current estimates of trend, as they have debated it so much among themselves.	13.0	97.0
201611	1903	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	If it’s actually higher than the staff estimate, which does fall below some other estimates I’ve seen, then we’re still not back to trend.	13.0	97.0
201611	1904	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And the fact that we have been below trend for so long— nearly eight years—may mean that past correlations won’t hold up in current circumstances.	13.0	97.0
201611	1905	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But it is something I’ll be watching.	13.0	97.0
201611	1906	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Another thing I want to note in passing—and I think people have commented on this before, but it’s something we should probably keep in mind—is that the change in the labor force participation rate, contrary to the instinct I think we all have, is not principally due to a lot more people being pulled back into the labor force.	13.0	97.0
201611	1907	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	It’s actually due to people making decisions not to leave the labor force in greater numbers than they had previously—I guess it’s a double positive—which may affect our sense of the future trend, particularly when you’re talking about people who are hitting an age that, in the past, has been a retirement age—that is, it may be a little bit more sustainable.	13.0	97.0
201611	1908	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to inflation, I’ve been focused on seeing some tangible developments on the inflation front that would credibly promise nontransitory attainment of the inflation target, with due consideration to the symmetrical nature of that target.	13.0	97.0
201611	1909	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	It does seem as though the disinflationary effects of the stronger dollar and energy prices are waning, though it’s less clear whether the dollar is done strengthening.	13.0	97.0
201611	1910	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And the recent core inflation reading has come in a little higher than anticipated, I gather reflecting, in part, slightly larger effects from now-rising energy prices and some nonmarket services components.	13.0	97.0
201611	1911	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t place an enormous amount of weight on such a modest change, particularly any that is attributable to those pesky nonmarket components, but now, at least, the uncertainty with respect to inflation’s path is a little more tilted in an upward direction.	13.0	97.0
201611	1912	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	To conclude, as you can tell, I find the situation to have considerably more nuance than was the case just six months ago.	13.0	97.0
201611	1913	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t find the case for another increase yet to be compelling and certainly not urgent, in view of the still mixed nature of incoming data.	13.0	97.0
201611	1914	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Moreover, I don’t think there should be concern about some overshooting of the 2 percent target, something that could actually have favorable medium-term effects.	13.0	97.0
201611	1915	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But I do find it arguable that we’re getting to the point at which some further modest, cautious removal of accommodation may be a reasonable response to the continuing diminution of slack in the economy and the labor market.	13.0	97.0
201611	1916	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201611	1917	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	1918	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	13.0	65.0
201611	1919	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201611	1920	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Overall, there’s been very little change in the moderate growth picture of the Fourth District economy since our previous meeting.	13.0	999.0
201611	1921	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	District contacts report largely stable economic conditions.	13.0	999.0
201611	1922	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The Bank’s diffusion index of business contacts reporting better versus worse conditions edged down to minus 6 from minus 4 at the time of our previous meeting.	13.0	999.0
201611	1923	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Manufacturing remained weak, but contacts in the energy sector reported a pickup in activity.	13.0	999.0
201611	1924	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Retailers reported a slowdown in activity, but many cited ongoing pressures associated with the transformation of the sector from bricks and mortar to online sales rather than a drop in overall demand.	13.0	999.0
201611	1925	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	As has been true for some time, labor market conditions in the District remain healthy.	13.0	999.0
201611	1926	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland staff estimates that year- over-year growth in District payrolls was 1 percent in September, essentially the same pace as seen over the past five months.	13.0	999.0
201611	1927	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The District’s unemployment rate has remained low and stable at 5 percent all year.	13.0	999.0
201611	1928	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	District contacts continue to report increasing upward wage pressures, particularly for relatively low-skilled positions, over the past few months.	13.0	999.0
201611	1929	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	A national labor leader who is on our Cincinnati Branch board noted that a very high volume of union contracts are being renegotiated this year.	13.0	999.0
201611	1930	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	He reports that the negotiations involving his organization have gone relatively smoothly, with average wage increases of 3 to 4 percent.	13.0	999.0
201611	1931	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	He also noted that there’s a growing sentiment among companies that they must invest in workforce development at the entry level and upgrade skills of experienced workers.	13.0	999.0
201611	1932	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	In fact, several of our directors have reported that they’re allocating additional resources for worker training and apprenticeships aimed at strengthening their staffing pipeline.	13.0	999.0
201611	1933	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	On the inflation front, overall, District firms report that prices received and nonlabor costs continue to rise but at a somewhat slower pace than in September.	13.0	999.0
201611	1934	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Turning to the national economy, overall, my outlook for the US economy over the medium run is unchanged since our previous meeting.	13.0	999.0
201611	1935	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I expect output growth to be at or slightly above trend, the unemployment rate to fall below its longer-run rate, and inflation to continue to rise gradually toward our longer-run objective of 2 percent.	13.0	999.0
201611	1936	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	In my view, the incoming data have been supportive of this projection.	13.0	999.0
201611	1937	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Output growth picked up in the third quarter from its weaker first-half pace.	13.0	999.0
201611	1938	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The pattern of growth was about as expected.	13.0	999.0
201611	1939	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Consumer spending remains solid, but nonresidential investment remains weak.	13.0	999.0
201611	1940	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I continue to anticipate some pickup in investment as the expansion continues.	13.0	999.0
201611	1941	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Oil drilling activity is rising in response to higher oil prices, and low corporate bond spreads are supportive of increased investment spending.	13.0	999.0
201611	1942	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	A stronger pace of capital deepening would help boost labor productivity growth from recent low levels.	13.0	999.0
201611	1943	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Labor markets continue to improve.	13.0	999.0
201611	1944	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	A broad set of indicators are consistent with labor market strength.	13.0	999.0
201611	1945	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Since the start of the year, monthly gains in payroll employment have averaged nearly 180,000 jobs, a pace well above trend.	13.0	999.0
201611	1946	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The unemployment rate has been relatively stable at estimates of its longer-run level.	13.0	999.0
201611	1947	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Measures of underutilization have decreased, the labor force participation rate has edged up, and average hourly earnings and other measures of wages have accelerated somewhat.	13.0	999.0
201611	1948	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	My view, like the Tealbook’s, is that we are essentially at full employment from the standpoint of what monetary policy can do.	13.0	999.0
201611	1949	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	With respect to the other part of our dual mandate, I view incoming data as consistent with the Committee’s anticipation that inflation would begin to rise as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate.	13.0	999.0
201611	1950	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Oil and gasoline prices have risen back to their levels of a year ago, and nonpetroleum import prices have moved up over the past six months and are now less than 1 percent below year-ago levels.	13.0	999.0
201611	1951	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	As a result, year-over-year PCE inflation is now 1¼ percent, 1 percentage point above its level from a year ago.	13.0	999.0
201611	1952	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Over the past six months, PCE inflation has risen at an annual pace of slightly more than 2 percent.	13.0	999.0
201611	1953	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Core inflation measures have been stable to up slightly over the past several months and are above year-ago levels.	13.0	999.0
201611	1954	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Core PCE inflation, measured year over year, is now 1.7 percent, up from 1.4 percent a year ago.	13.0	999.0
201611	1955	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The Dallas Federal Reserve trimmed mean inflation rate is also running at 1.7 percent, up slightly from a year ago.	13.0	999.0
201611	1956	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Core CPI inflation has been slightly over 2 percent all year.	13.0	999.0
201611	1957	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland Federal Reserve median CPI measure has been at or above 2½ percent for the past five months.	13.0	999.0
201611	1958	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland Federal Reserve staff’s near-term inflation model is forecasting inflation to rise for the remainder of the year, closing in on the 2 percent objective.	13.0	999.0
201611	1959	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	In December, the model predicts year-over-year PCE inflation to be 1.7 percent, a significant increase from the current level, and core PCE inflation to be 1.9 percent.	13.0	999.0
201611	1960	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Admittedly, there is a fairly wide confidence band around these point forecasts, but the rise being predicted is consistent with what the FOMC has been anticipating.	13.0	999.0
201611	1961	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	In my view, inflation expectations remain reasonably stable.	13.0	999.0
201611	1962	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Our Reserve Bank’s 10- year and 5-year, 5-year-forward measures have been stable.	13.0	999.0
201611	1963	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The 5-year, 5-year-forward breakeven rates moved up a bit since the previous meeting, but we have to be cautious in reading too much into this, as the move may have reflected changes in liquidity and inflation risk premiums rather than inflation expectations.	13.0	999.0
201611	1964	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The University of Michigan survey measure of inflation expectations over the next 5-to-10 years fell in October to a record low of 2.3 percent, but as I discussed at our previous meeting, this measure has been trending down since 2013, and the distribution in responses has been changing as well, with fewer respondents reporting expected inflation rates at 5 percent and at 10 percent.	13.0	999.0
201611	1965	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The downward movement in the Michigan survey bears watching and further investigation, but at this point I’m not taking a strong signal from it.	13.0	999.0
201611	1966	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	So I anticipate inflation will gradually return to our 2 percent goal over the next couple of years as the drag due to earlier declines in oil prices and the appreciation of the dollar pass through.	13.0	999.0
201611	1967	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Output growth continues to be at or slightly above trend, labor markets continue to be healthy, and inflation expectations remain stable.	13.0	999.0
201611	1968	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I continue to project that a gradual upward path of interest rates over the forecast horizon will be appropriate in view of my outlook and the risks associated with it.	13.0	999.0
201611	1969	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I see those risks as broadly balanced at this time.	13.0	999.0
201611	1970	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	However, failure to move interest rates up gradually from the current low level will increase the risks over time.	13.0	999.0
201611	1971	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	These risks include risks to financial stability from search-for-yield behavior and potential asset price bubbles.	13.0	999.0
201611	1972	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The staff’s QS report suggests that commercial real estate prices continue to rise and are somewhat overvalued in some markets.	13.0	999.0
201611	1973	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The risks also include risks to macroeconomic stability from potentially getting “behind the curve,” generating excessive inflation, and then having to take more aggressive action than currently anticipated, which would shorten the expansion.	13.0	999.0
201611	1974	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Some private-sector economists who see the macro risks as low at this point have been advocating that until inflation moves up to or above our goal, the FOMC should run the economy “hot” in order to bring more people into the labor force and drive down the unemployment rate further, perhaps even lowering the structural unemployment rate.	13.0	999.0
201611	1975	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	First, setting aside the risks, it isn’t clear that that strategy would work.	13.0	999.0
201611	1976	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The historical data suggest that labor force participation is not very cyclical.	13.0	999.0
201611	1977	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	In addition, running the unemployment rate well below its natural rate would entail supply-side costs—for example, inefficient matching that could lower productivity growth.	13.0	999.0
201611	1978	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	In a typical DSGE model, these costs are reflected in the welfare-based loss function, which is well approximated by the familiar quadratic loss function that penalizes both positive and negative deviations of inflation from its target and of unemployment from its natural rate.	13.0	999.0
201611	1979	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Second, history tells us that this “hot economy strategy” is quite risky.	13.0	999.0
201611	1980	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Now, if we could rely on the Phillips curve remaining flat and inflation expectations remaining anchored, then the risk of engendering excessive inflation following this strategy would be relatively low.	13.0	999.0
201611	1981	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	We might expect outcomes like in the first alternative scenario in the Tealbook.	13.0	999.0
201611	1982	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	But what if the Phillips curve turns out not to remain linear and flat so that as the unemployment rate falls further, wage growth picks up significantly and inflation expectations don’t remain anchored?	13.0	999.0
201611	1983	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Then the cost of this hot economy strategy could be very high.	13.0	999.0
201611	1984	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	We could find ourselves well “behind the curve” because of our deliberate actions and then have to take aggressive action in response to bring inflation down.	13.0	999.0
201611	1985	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	We risk turning the hot economy strategy into a cold economy strategy if we end up in a recession.	13.0	999.0
201611	1986	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The second alternative scenario in the Tealbook captures part of this possibility, but it’s more benign because inflation expectations remain anchored.	13.0	999.0
201611	1987	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Even so, that scenario ends up with inflation above our goal and the unemployment rate eventually higher than in the baseline.	13.0	999.0
201611	1988	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Third, the discussion at the March 2004 FOMC meeting echoes some of our recent discussions.	13.0	999.0
201611	1989	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	At that point in time, interest rates had been on hold at 1 percent for some time, and some on the Committee believed low inflation and economic slack meant that the costs if economic growth turned out to be stronger than expected were lower than the costs if it turned out to be weaker than expected.	13.0	999.0
201611	1990	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Subsequent data revisions revealed that inflation was actually quite a bit higher and the output gap considerably smaller than the Committee believed at the time, so policy was considerably more accommodative than they believed it to be.	13.0	999.0
201611	1991	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	This type of measurement risk heightens the risk of attempting the hot economy strategy.	13.0	999.0
201611	1992	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	These considerations leave me believing that a gradual process of raising rates is actually the prudent course at this point.	13.0	999.0
201611	1993	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	It allows us to continue to monitor and respond to unanticipated changes in economic conditions and allows us to better calibrate our policy over time as we learn more about the underlying longer-run structural aspects of the economy, such as the natural rate of unemployment, potential output growth, structural productivity growth, and the natural real rate of interest.	13.0	999.0
201611	1994	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201611	1995	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	1996	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13.0	65.0
201611	1997	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Thank you very much, Madam Chair.	13.0	81.0
201611	1998	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Economic conditions in the Fifth District appear to have changed little since September.	13.0	81.0
201611	1999	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	There are a couple of exceptions.	13.0	81.0
201611	2000	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	First, Hurricane Matthew caused extensive flooding in areas of North and South Carolina, although major cities were spared, and that sparked the usual rebuilding efforts.	13.0	81.0
201611	2001	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	And, second, a number of survey participants and other contacts mentioned the upcoming election as a reason that businesses were hesitant to place orders.	13.0	81.0
201611	2002	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Otherwise, conditions looked very similar to what we’ve seen recently.	13.0	81.0
201611	2003	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	For example, manufacturing indicators were somewhat mixed this month, as has been the case for the past few months.	13.0	81.0
201611	2004	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	October survey results indicated continued contraction, although with some improvement from September.	13.0	81.0
201611	2005	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The composite index rose 4 points to negative 4.	13.0	81.0
201611	2006	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	More manufacturers saw wage increases in October, and the wage index, which rose to plus 18, has been in double digits for the past 11 months.	13.0	81.0
201611	2007	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The services sector continued to expand in October, according to our survey results and comments from contacts.	13.0	81.0
201611	2008	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Difficulty finding qualified workers persists as an issue cited by directors and other contacts.	13.0	81.0
201611	2009	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	For example, a staffing company reported seeing a sizable shift toward orders for permanent rather than temporary hires, reflecting a desire to lock in qualified workers rather than risk losing them.	13.0	81.0
201611	2010	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The wage components across all of our surveys are elevated and have increased notably for the retail sector.	13.0	81.0
201611	2011	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Turning to residential real estate markets, they continue to improve in many areas of the District.	13.0	81.0
201611	2012	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	For the most part, comments on housing were upbeat, and the CEO of a leading national building products supplier reported strong gains for September and October after several flat months in the late spring and summer and was expecting that strength to continue through year-end.	13.0	81.0
201611	2013	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The outlook for commercial real estate is more mixed, according to our contacts.	13.0	81.0
201611	2014	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	In most markets, the demand for multifamily construction remains strong, although there was a good deal of commentary about financing constraints.	13.0	81.0
201611	2015	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Banks that are close to their CRE guidance thresholds are reportedly pulling out of many markets and leaving borrowers to choose among only one or two lenders rather than four or five as had been typical.	13.0	81.0
201611	2016	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Turning to the national economy, the most notable change in the staff’s medium-term outlook since our previous meeting was the reduction of the GDP path.	13.0	81.0
201611	2017	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Growth in 2017 is projected to be 2.2 percent versus 2.4 percent in the September Tealbook.	13.0	81.0
201611	2018	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Some markdown seems appropriate, I think, even though third-quarter GDP growth was a bit above the staff’s estimate, because in that report final sales to domestic purchasers were weaker than expected.	13.0	81.0
201611	2019	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Growth in real consumer spending, which dominates that category, slowed to an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the third quarter, but that’s right in line with growth in real disposable income.	13.0	81.0
201611	2020	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The staff’s assessment is that we are at full employment, and that output growth will exceed its trend rate for the next couple of years.	13.0	81.0
201611	2021	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	But I think there’s a good chance that real GDP growth will converge to its trend rate more rapidly than the Tealbook projects.	13.0	81.0
201611	2022	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I think we’re already seeing some signs of supply-side constraints on growth.	13.0	81.0
201611	2023	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Reports of difficulty finding skilled workers have broadened noticeably over the past year or so.	13.0	81.0
201611	2024	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	We hear many instances of firms limiting current production as a result.	13.0	81.0
201611	2025	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	In several areas in our District, we’ve heard that single-family housing construction is being limited by labor constraints as well as by a limited supply of buildable lots, and we’re hearing that many firms are coping with labor shortages by increasing overtime hours for existing workers and by hiring unskilled workers and putting them through training.	13.0	81.0
201611	2026	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	As I mentioned earlier, we’ve also heard reports recently of reduced lending for multifamily construction in response to the regulatory burdens.	13.0	81.0
201611	2027	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	So I would not be surprised to see real GDP growth fall below 2 percent over the near term as we converge to trend, and a corollary of lower real GDP growth is that employment growth will almost certainly be lower as well.	13.0	81.0
201611	2028	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	In fact, it would not surprise me if employment growth fell to below 10,000 jobs per month in the near term.	13.0	81.0
201611	2029	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Did you mean 100,000?	13.0	91.0
201611	2030	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	You said 10,000 per month.	13.0	97.0
201611	2031	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I said 10,000?	13.0	81.0
201611	2032	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Well, so, you know, if 60,000 per month would keep labor force participation rates constant, and there’s a significant amount of noise about 60,000, maybe under 10,000 would be realized as well.	13.0	81.0
201611	2033	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I did mean to say 100,000, though.	13.0	81.0
201611	2034	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	13.0	81.0
201611	2035	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Turning to inflation, core inflation has averaged 1.7 percent over the past four quarters, up from 1.3 percent four quarters ago.	13.0	81.0
201611	2036	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Many forecasters have been surprised by the strength of core readings this year.	13.0	81.0
201611	2037	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The Tealbook, for example, last December predicted that core inflation would be at an annual rate of 1.4 percent in the first quarter.	13.0	81.0
201611	2038	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	It turned out to be 2.1 percent.	13.0	81.0
201611	2039	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Similarly, in March, core inflation was predicted to be 1.5 percent in the second quarter, but the latest estimate is 1.8 percent for the second quarter.	13.0	81.0
201611	2040	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	And in June, core inflation was predicted to be 1.3 percent in the third quarter, but on Friday we learned it was 1.7 percent.	13.0	81.0
201611	2041	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The Tealbook still has inflation remaining below 2.2 percent for three more years, though.	13.0	81.0
201611	2042	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	For me, this year’s experience suggests that we seem to be likely to hit 2 percent more rapidly than we otherwise would have thought.	13.0	81.0
201611	2043	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	13.0	81.0
201611	2044	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	2045	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13.0	65.0
201611	2046	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201611	2047	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	The reports from my directors and other business contacts were mixed this round.	13.0	91.0
201611	2048	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	The consensus seems to be that economic growth is proceeding slowly and steadily.	13.0	91.0
201611	2049	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Although nearly everyone had some commentary about the near-term uncertainty, nothing concrete seemed to be flashing red.	13.0	91.0
201611	2050	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I did hear a few more reports of larger wage increases this round, but, in general, the gains were still moderate and not expected to have much of an effect on inflation.	13.0	91.0
201611	2051	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Many employers say they don’t have the pricing power to pass along more than minimal cost increases to their customers.	13.0	91.0
201611	2052	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Others expect productivity enhancements to offset their higher wages, and pretty much everyone is expecting to be living in a low-inflation world for the foreseeable future.	13.0	91.0
201611	2053	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	My financial market contacts also had little new to report, although I did hear from one large nonfinancial firm as well as from a small business owner that the increase in LIBOR over the intermeeting period had raised their short-term borrowing costs about 25 basis points.	13.0	91.0
201611	2054	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	With regard to the national outlook, recent data seem reasonably consistent with our previous economic projections.	13.0	91.0
201611	2055	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Overall, third-quarter GDP growth was in line with our forecast, although private domestic final purchases were a little softer than we anticipated and are something to keep an eye on.	13.0	91.0
201611	2056	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	But we still think that consumer fundamentals are good and that GDP growth will continue to run modestly above potential over the next couple of years.	13.0	91.0
201611	2057	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Our GDP growth numbers are somewhat stronger than the Tealbook’s, but our basic forecast narratives are quite similar.	13.0	91.0
201611	2058	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	However, our estimate for the natural rate of unemployment in 2016 is 4.7 percent, and the labor force participation rate is currently below our estimate of its trend.	13.0	91.0
201611	2059	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	So our Chicago outlook envisions a bit more resource slack remaining in the economy than the Tealbook does.	13.0	91.0
201611	2060	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	We also see less overshooting in potential output later in the projection period.	13.0	91.0
201611	2061	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	The news on inflation has been a bit encouraging, and like the Tealbook, we’ve nudged up our forecast of core PCE inflation to 1.7 percent this year and see it remaining there in 2017.	13.0	91.0
201611	2062	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I would take more comfort from the higher inflation numbers if we were also seeing better news on inflation expectations.	13.0	91.0
201611	2063	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	The recent uptick in TIPS breakevens is a small move in the right direction, but the levels of breakevens and other financial market measures of inflation compensation are still pointing quite loudly toward downside risks.	13.0	91.0
201611	2064	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	And the Michigan survey of household inflation expectations has hit a new low.	13.0	91.0
201611	2065	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	All in all, we seem to be on a steady-as-you- go tack at the moment, and I’m not seeing any significant changes to economic conditions that alter my views on appropriate policy for tomorrow’s decision or for the near future.	13.0	91.0
201611	2066	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I apologize for the brevity of my comments today.	13.0	91.0
201611	2067	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	It’s been hard to get my staff to help lately because of late-night World Series games.	13.0	91.0
201611	2068	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	13.0	91.0
201611	2069	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	It’s going to end soon.	13.0	97.0
201611	2070	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Well—	13.0	91.0
201611	2071	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	One way or the other.	13.0	97.0
201611	2072	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	13.0	97.0
201611	2073	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	2074	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13.0	65.0
201611	2075	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	The data since we last met have been mixed but consistent, overall, with gradual progress toward our goals.	13.0	107.0
201611	2076	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	On the labor market, recent payroll gains, averaging around 180,000 per month, are likely sufficient to gradually increase resource utilization, although they are below last year’s pace.	13.0	107.0
201611	2077	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Even so, I have yet to see clear indications of binding resource constraints.	13.0	107.0
201611	2078	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	The unemployment rate has moved sideways over the past year at around 5 percent, and increases in labor demand have been met by further cyclical improvement in the participation rate.	13.0	107.0
201611	2079	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	The participation rate is up ½ percentage point on a year ago.	13.0	107.0
201611	2080	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Even so, the prime-age participation rate remains 1½ percentage points below pre-crisis levels.	13.0	107.0
201611	2081	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Both the recent data on average hourly earnings and the employment cost index suggest nominal wage growth of around 2¼ to 2½ percent, up somewhat from earlier in the recovery but still quite modest relative to pre-crisis trends.	13.0	107.0
201611	2082	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s noteworthy that the improvement in the labor market has likely been of most benefit to individuals and families in the bottom part of the income distribution.	13.0	107.0
201611	2083	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, the gains in the participation rate over the past year have gone disproportionately to those with relatively little education.	13.0	107.0
201611	2084	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	And, as David Wilcox’s research has shown, incremental improvements in the labor market tend to have the largest effects on minority households.	13.0	107.0
201611	2085	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Over the past year, the unemployment rate for African Americans, for instance, has fallen 1 full percentage point as the overall rate has held steady.	13.0	107.0
201611	2086	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	We also learned over the intermeeting period that the poverty rate declined 1.2 percentage points last year, the largest reduction since the onset of the Global Financial Crisis.	13.0	107.0
201611	2087	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Median household income rose more than 5.2 percent for the first time since the financial crisis, and you can see the improvement across all racial and ethnic groups.	13.0	107.0
201611	2088	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	The improvement in median incomes was greatest for households at or close to the bottom of the income distribution.	13.0	107.0
201611	2089	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Thus, the continued gradual improvement in the labor market is increasingly benefiting those individuals and communities most in need.	13.0	107.0
201611	2090	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Turning to aggregate spending, the latest data have been mixed but, overall, suggest a continued moderate pace of expansion.	13.0	107.0
201611	2091	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Private domestic consumption and fixed investment, the most forward-looking components of GDP, rose at only 1.6 percent annual rate in the third quarter, down from average growth of 3 percent over the previous several years.	13.0	107.0
201611	2092	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Consumer spending appears to have slowed.	13.0	107.0
201611	2093	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	The level of single-family housing permits, likely our best indicator of housing activity, has changed little, on net, over the past year.	13.0	107.0
201611	2094	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	This slowing in consumption and housing is noteworthy because these two sources of demand have more than accounted for GDP growth since the end of 2013.	13.0	107.0
201611	2095	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	After contributing 2½ percentage points, on average, in 2014 and 2015, consumption and housing contributed only 1¾ percentage points in the first three quarters of this year.	13.0	107.0
201611	2096	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Business fixed investment, which declined over the first half of this year, has shown some tentative signs of turning up.	13.0	107.0
201611	2097	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Turning to the international environment, this relatively weak domestic momentum is of some concern because recent events remind us of the significant downside risks coming from abroad.	13.0	107.0
201611	2098	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Increasingly, markets are assuming that the most that can be expected from the ECB and the Bank of Japan is that they can hold the line in terms of the degree of accommodation because they face increasingly unattractive tradeoffs in the absence of large fiscal changes.	13.0	107.0
201611	2099	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent communications suggesting the United Kingdom is pursuing a so-called hard Brexit from the EU led to a sharp, 6 percent decline in the pound and a markdown of medium-term growth prospects in the United Kingdom and the EU.	13.0	107.0
201611	2100	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, as we just discussed, during the intermeeting period market concerns about Deutsche Bank increased as anticipation of fines for past violations led to a reassessment of its profitability, which was already under pressure, and some counterparties began to limit their exposure to the bank, which was deemed by the IMF to be the world’s most systemically risky.	13.0	107.0
201611	2101	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	These developments remind us that fragile banks and low economic growth in Europe could feed off each other, with potentially destabilizing effects on the European economy and spillovers to our financial markets.	13.0	107.0
201611	2102	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Indeed, the concerns about a hard Brexit and about Deutsche, which have emerged in sharp relief in the intermeeting period, are somewhat at odds with our characterization of risks in the statement.	13.0	107.0
201611	2103	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Finally, while relatively buoyant Chinese economic growth so far this year has reduced near-term risks, the quality of that growth has been quite poor, with the debt-to-GDP ratio and corporate indebtedness in particular already at extremely elevated levels and continuing to climb.	13.0	107.0
201611	2104	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	This poses important medium-term risks.	13.0	107.0
201611	2105	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	These downside risks coming from abroad remind us of the importance of asymmetry and risk-management considerations, a subject to which we return tomorrow.	13.0	107.0
201611	2106	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Turning to inflation, the most recent data offer hints that inflation may indeed be moving toward our goal after a very long period of underperformance.	13.0	107.0
201611	2107	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	People have noted the 12-month change in core PCE prices in September was 1.7 percent, at the upper end of the range of values occupied since mid-2012.	13.0	107.0
201611	2108	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Inflation compensation, as measured by TIPS and by yields on nominal Treasury securities, has increased about 20 basis points since our previous meeting, which is also welcome.	13.0	107.0
201611	2109	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	However, these tentative signs of improvement come against a backdrop of persistent shortfalls from our 2 percent target.	13.0	107.0
201611	2110	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, five-year inflation compensation five years ahead remains very low at 1.6 percent—1 percentage point below levels prevailing before mid-2014—and survey measures of longer-term household inflation expectations are still very low.	13.0	107.0
201611	2111	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Thus, although the recent news has been positive, getting back to a credibly symmetric 2 percent target will require continued progress in the labor market and the absence of adverse shocks from abroad.	13.0	107.0
201611	2112	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	To conclude, I’ve been wrestling with this question we’ve discussed of the wisdom of preemptive tightening to guard against the risks of allowing the labor market to experience material further improvement.	13.0	107.0
201611	2113	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	And I know some who’ve looked at past episodes of low unemployment have cautioned that further improvement would bring with it significant recessionary risks.	13.0	107.0
201611	2114	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	I think it’s important to realize that today’s circumstances are importantly different.	13.0	107.0
201611	2115	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In the past, low levels of unemployment have been associated with relatively rapid increases in inflation.	13.0	107.0
201611	2116	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	A key channel was likely inflation expectations, which, starting in the mid-to-late 1960s, likely began to move higher and became unanchored.	13.0	107.0
201611	2117	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s also helpful to recall that some of these episodes, certainly in the 1970s, contained dramatic supply-side boosts to inflation, which may have made policymakers more reluctant to move early due to the unattractive tradeoffs.	13.0	107.0
201611	2118	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Thus, when policy eventually tightened, it may have been importantly influenced by the need to reduce inflation expectations.	13.0	107.0
201611	2119	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Circumstances could not be more different today.	13.0	107.0
201611	2120	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Unlike in the previous episodes, inflation expectations are well anchored to the upside.	13.0	107.0
201611	2121	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Indeed, they have been stubbornly low for eight years, and some measures of expectations have moved lower.	13.0	107.0
201611	2122	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, we’ve observed that other major advanced foreign economies that have allowed persistently weak demand to affect inflation expectations haven’t been able to achieve their inflation mandates despite their extraordinary efforts.	13.0	107.0
201611	2123	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, there has been legitimate concern that when the unemployment rate falls too far, financial stability risks are heightened.	13.0	107.0
201611	2124	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Here, too, I think it’s worth noting that the financial system today is much different than before the crisis.	13.0	107.0
201611	2125	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Capital levels have doubled at the largest banks; liquidity is higher; regulatory oversight is considerably more intense; and in cases in which risks have arisen, we have a much better framework for identifying them earlier, as we just saw in the previous session.	13.0	107.0
201611	2126	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	For example, in leveraged lending and CRE, regulatory guidance has pushed back, and there are some signs that it has been effective.	13.0	107.0
201611	2127	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In short, we must continue to be vigilant against signs of undue risk-taking in financial markets, but we should also recognize that the tradeoff between the kind of high-quality improvement in the labor market that I discussed earlier and low-quality growth in the financial sector that has sometimes occurred as expansions mature is not inevitable.	13.0	107.0
201611	2128	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	107.0
201611	2129	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201611	2130	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And I think this would be a good time for a short break.	13.0	65.0
201611	2131	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we return at 4:15, in about 15 minutes.	13.0	65.0
201611	2133	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, folks.	13.0	65.0
201611	2134	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s resume the economic go-round, and President Bullard is on.	13.0	65.0
201611	2135	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201611	2136	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Incoming intermeeting data seem to be consistent with the regime-based view of the state of the US and Eighth District economies.	13.0	94.0
201611	2137	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	The regime is characterized by relatively slow real GDP growth at 2 percent per year; stable unemployment, which remains in the 4½ to 5 percent range over the forecast horizon; and an inflation forecast roughly centered on the Committee’s inflation target of 2 percent.	13.0	94.0
201611	2138	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	That is, looking at a chart, once uncertainty is taken into account, it would look like 2 percent is roughly in the middle of the probability distribution for the forecast.	13.0	94.0
201611	2139	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	You could look at panels 7 and 8 on the US outlook, which were just handed out, to see examples of that.	13.0	94.0
201611	2140	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	District contacts emphasized a relatively weak agribusiness sector, along with weakness in some heavy manufacturing.	13.0	94.0
201611	2141	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Some contacts at large firms stressed that slow growth and low interest rates would continue to make mergers and acquisitions the top business strategy for the future.	13.0	94.0
201611	2142	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Housing market contacts reported relatively strong results.	13.0	94.0
201611	2143	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	District labor markets appear to have outperformed national labor markets in recent months.	13.0	94.0
201611	2144	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Commentary from the health- care sector was mixed.	13.0	94.0
201611	2145	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Nationally, the third-quarter real GDP estimate of 2.9 percent was about as expected, according to tracking estimates on the eve of the announcement.	13.0	94.0
201611	2146	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Most tracking estimates for the current quarter are lower.	13.0	94.0
201611	2147	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	The median of tracking estimates around the Federal Reserve System is currently about 2.1 percent for Q4.	13.0	94.0
201611	2148	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	This means that the real GDP growth rate for the year as a whole will likely be somewhat below 2 percent, perhaps 1.7 or 1.8 percent, once we have all available information.	13.0	94.0
201611	2149	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Many forecasts for 2017 real GDP growth are close to 2 percent.	13.0	94.0
201611	2150	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I regard these available data and forecasts as consistent with a regime of 2 percent growth in real GDP over the forecast horizon, and this is likely the current trend pace of growth for the US economy.	13.0	94.0
201611	2151	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	In light of this outlook for real GDP growth, I continue to expect unemployment to remain in the 4½ to 5 percent range over the next several years, and I expect inflation to be centered on the 2 percent target.	13.0	94.0
201611	2152	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I think this outcome can be supported with a policy rate setting only slightly higher than currently.	13.0	94.0
201611	2153	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	In short, unlike many around the table, I would not interpret the current situation in cyclical terms.	13.0	94.0
201611	2154	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I do not see the current situation changing unless at least one of two things happens: Number one, there is a switch to a higher-productivity-growth rate regime, which would be associated with faster real GDP growth and a higher real rate of return on safe assets; number two, the large liquidity premium associated with safe assets abates and switches to a value more consistent with historical pre-crisis experience, which would also drive the real rate of safe assets higher; or both.	13.0	94.0
201611	2155	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I do not expect either one of these switches to occur over the forecast horizon, but I will keep my eyes open and watch the data carefully.	13.0	94.0
201611	2156	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201611	2157	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	2158	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13.0	65.0
201611	2159	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201611	2160	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The incoming data continue to show moderate GDP growth, a healthy pace of labor market tightening, and inflation gradually moving up to 2 percent.	13.0	104.0
201611	2161	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The expected pickup in real GDP growth over the second half of the year seems to be materializing, thanks to the waning effects of oil prices on business investment and an end of the inventory correction.	13.0	104.0
201611	2162	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I expect output growth to continue at about 2 percent in 2017 and productivity growth to remain weak, with reasonably strong job growth continuing as well—in essence, a continuation of the trends that we’ve seen for the past several years.	13.0	104.0
201611	2163	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	That does imply significant ongoing labor market tightening.	13.0	104.0
201611	2164	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	So far this year, that tightening has taken the form of higher participation as the unemployment rate has moved sideways—a welcome development, as it shows that the economy has had a bit more “room to run.”	13.0	104.0
201611	2165	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	For the period ahead, I expect that participation will remain about flat, on net, for a while longer or perhaps decline slightly, as that margin of slack has probably been used up, and that job growth will again show through to the unemployment rate, which I expect to decline to the mid-4s over the next year.	13.0	104.0
201611	2166	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	It’s worth remembering again that participation has been volatile this year and can move around two- or three-tenths and it can be noise.	13.0	104.0
201611	2167	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	If participation had declined as forecast by the Tealbook last December, unemployment would now be 4.3 percent, holding all else equal.	13.0	104.0
201611	2168	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Wages have continued their gradual upward climb.	13.0	104.0
201611	2169	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	With low inflation and de minimis productivity growth, real wage increases are now quite healthy.	13.0	104.0
201611	2170	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Real unit labor costs have been increasing since early 2014, and this should put some upward pressure on prices.	13.0	104.0
201611	2171	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Trailing 12-month core inflation has increased 0.4 percentage point over the past year— now it’s at 1.7 percent—and total inflation is forecast in the Tealbook to reach that level in the first quarter of next year.	13.0	104.0
201611	2172	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	In the staff narrative, inflation remains at 1.7 percent next year, despite tightening labor markets and the waning of the drags that I mentioned, because of the unwinding of some transitory factors that are temporarily boosting inflation this year.	13.0	104.0
201611	2173	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Overall, inflation has been in line with our forecast for some time, albeit a little higher.	13.0	104.0
201611	2174	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The Michigan survey notwithstanding, there does seem to me to be evidence of a change in inflation sentiment, with higher nominal yields, higher market-based inflation compensation, and market chatter about a modest overshoot.	13.0	104.0
201611	2175	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I regard this as a healthy development and hope that it will be sustained.	13.0	104.0
201611	2176	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	For me, there is good reason to expect that inflation will continue to move gradually up to 2 percent, with a reasonable likelihood that this will happen faster than in the forecast.	13.0	104.0
201611	2177	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	While the US economy remains on a healthy track, the global picture remains a source of risk, whether it is excessive credit growth in China or a hard Brexit or weak European banks or just low economic growth and low inflation.	13.0	104.0
201611	2178	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Perhaps with global risks in mind, by a straight read, the market continues to price in only about one rate increase per year, assuming a zero term premium.	13.0	104.0
201611	2179	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Of course, term and risk premiums are probably negative, especially at longer durations.	13.0	104.0
201611	2180	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Even so, markets are clearly pricing in significant risks of low economic growth and inflation outcomes.	13.0	104.0
201611	2181	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I’m supportive of allowing a modest undershoot of the natural rate of unemployment.	13.0	104.0
201611	2182	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	With inflation having run below our 2 percent inflation objective every single month since I joined the Board four and a half years ago, I do not expect to feel alarmed if inflation moves modestly above 2 percent, except in what, in my view, is the the highly unlikely case in which longer-run inflation expectations move up excessively.	13.0	104.0
201611	2183	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I believe that this approach may help repair some of the residual labor market damage at little risk to price stability.	13.0	104.0
201611	2184	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I have supported a patient approach to policy, and I believe that that approach has paid dividends and continues to do so.	13.0	104.0
201611	2185	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I do also believe, however, that the risks are now becoming more two sided, and more on that tomorrow.	13.0	104.0
201611	2186	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201611	2187	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	2188	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13.0	65.0
201611	2189	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201611	2190	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	My presentation will be divided into three unequal parts—the labor market, inflation, and economic growth—and if much of what I have to say induces a sense of déjà vu, I plead guilty, for the economic situation and the key economic issues have not changed by much since our September decision.	13.0	108.0
201611	2191	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	First, the labor market.	13.0	108.0
201611	2192	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Nonfarm payroll employment has been continuing to grow at a good pace, averaging 178,000 per month so far this year.	13.0	108.0
201611	2193	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	There’s been one interesting development with respect to the employment data since our September meeting.	13.0	108.0
201611	2194	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The headlines about the 151,000 estimated net new hires in August were distinctly gloomy.	13.0	108.0
201611	2195	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Those about the 156,000 estimate of net new hires in September were neutral to positive, so much so that I was asked in an interview in mid-September whether the economy was now in a “Goldilocks” situation.	13.0	108.0
201611	2196	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I was tempted to answer “yes,” with the proviso that Goldilocks isn’t what he or she used to be [laughter], but instead switched the topic to the slow growth rate of GDP.	13.0	108.0
201611	2197	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	It’s not clear why public reactions to almost identical data between September and October were different, but whatever the reason, we need to emphasize that the rate of hiring required to prevent the unemployment rate from rising depends on changes in the participation rate, and that staff estimates of the required rate of hiring range between 75,000 and 150,000.	13.0	108.0
201611	2198	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Otherwise, we would be faced with unnecessary public and market disappointment about numbers that could, in fact, be fully consistent with the continuation of the strong performance of the labor market.	13.0	108.0
201611	2199	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Over the course of the past two years, we’ve been concerned about the effect of a variety of negative shocks on the US economy, including the Chinese devaluation, the market turbulence in the first six weeks of this year, the May pothole, Brexit, and more.	13.0	108.0
201611	2200	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	US employment has resumed robust growth after each temporary slowdown.	13.0	108.0
201611	2201	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	This has been, and continues to be, a powerful recovery in terms of one of our two main targets: employment.	13.0	108.0
201611	2202	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Second, inflation.	13.0	108.0
201611	2203	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We’ve not heard many complaints about the low rate of inflation from the general public.	13.0	108.0
201611	2204	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The 2 percent inflation target was set originally as a tradeoff between the many costs of positive inflation and the increased efficiency of reallocation in the labor market that a moderate rate of inflation makes possible.	13.0	108.0
201611	2205	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I do not recall that the costs associated with the greater probability of being at the ELB with a low rate of inflation was taken into account at the time.	13.0	108.0
201611	2206	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	It was the early and mid-1990s when the 2 percent inflation target started becoming the received wisdom.	13.0	108.0
201611	2207	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The core rate of PCE inflation has been increasing—slowly, to be sure—and is now close to our 2 percent target.	13.0	108.0
201611	2208	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	In view of the imprecision of our estimates of the optimal rate of inflation, we should be happy to be as close to the target as we are, particularly when the Phillips curve appears to be so flat.	13.0	108.0
201611	2209	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The CPI rate of core inflation has been above 2 percent, but that is not the inflation rate we target, even if it is the rate of inflation with which the public is most familiar.	13.0	108.0
201611	2210	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Further, the rate of nominal wage increase has been rising—an indication that the Phillips curve lives, if not with the same vigor as it has in the past.	13.0	108.0
201611	2211	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	On balance, I believe we are close to meeting our inflation target.	13.0	108.0
201611	2212	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Let me discuss a few other aspects of the inflation target.	13.0	108.0
201611	2213	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	One is the argument that because we set 2 percent as our target, that’s the number we have to hit if we are to remain credible.	13.0	108.0
201611	2214	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I give this argument some weight, though I do not believe we need to hit precisely 2 percent, and I believe that the public and the markets will treat small divergences both above and below 2 percent as consistent with our being credible.	13.0	108.0
201611	2215	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Taking into consideration the wide confidence interval associated with the economic costs of diverging from the 2 percent target, I still believe it would have been better to define an optimal range for the inflation rate, possibly 1.5 to 2.5 percent, rather than an optimal point estimate.	13.0	108.0
201611	2216	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Finally, on inflation, the jury is still out on whether there’s been a permanent downward revision in the level of r*, something that’s extremely difficult to predict, for the future is long and the standard deviation of r* is large.	13.0	108.0
201611	2217	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	However, as we’ve been saying, if r* remains low for a relatively long time, monetary policy will be constrained by the ELB during that period more frequently than in the past.	13.0	108.0
201611	2218	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Should we, therefore, raise the target inflation rate?	13.0	108.0
201611	2219	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Well, of course, the optimal rate of inflation is an area of active research and debate.	13.0	108.0
201611	2220	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	But actually changing the target rate is a serious matter not to be entered into lightly.	13.0	108.0
201611	2221	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	There are welfare costs associated with higher inflation, especially the advent of more widespread indexation, which kicks in at a relatively low rate of inflation.	13.0	108.0
201611	2222	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	There is, further, the credibility cost of changing the target inflation rate, something that done once becomes a permanent credibility-reducing part of history.	13.0	108.0
201611	2223	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	If such a step were nevertheless taken, it should include a formal mechanism for dealing with future changes in the target rate—for instance, the mechanism used by Canada in which the inflation target can, in principle, be reset every five years.	13.0	108.0
201611	2224	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	All this is to say that core PCE inflation is, indeed, approaching the 2 percent level, that real wages are rising more rapidly than earlier in the post–Great Recession period, and that we need to think very hard before changing the monetary framework to solve a problem that is likely to be solved within a year or two without changing the inflation target.	13.0	108.0
201611	2225	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Third, economic growth.	13.0	108.0
201611	2226	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Here I need to mention that I support everything that President Mester said about what happened at her directors’ meeting because I was there, and I was greatly struck by the fact that almost everyone there was complaining about some aspect of information technology.	13.0	108.0
201611	2227	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	There were the people who were in the automobile industry who were petrified about driverless cars.	13.0	108.0
201611	2228	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	There were guys in the retail industry who were petrified about Amazon, which was building some huge depot in—was it in Cleveland or in Pittsburgh?	13.0	108.0
201611	2229	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	In Cleveland.	13.0	999.0
201611	2230	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	In Cleveland, and that was going to put them all out of business.	13.0	108.0
201611	2231	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And they said, “There are no more malls being built.	13.0	108.0
201611	2232	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	All you have are strip malls.”	13.0	108.0
201611	2233	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	There have been only three malls built in the United States since the Great Recession, and that’s a result of the revolution that’s taking place in the retailing industry.	13.0	108.0
201611	2234	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	So I really began to wonder whether there’s something going on slowly in the background, and whether we’re sort of close to the 1990s solum line when a lot of thing are happening, but we’re not seeing much effect of them at this stage, and maybe it could happen later.	13.0	108.0
201611	2235	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you for the visit.	13.0	108.0
201611	2236	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	It was very interesting.	13.0	108.0
201611	2237	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Now, on economic growth, with a first estimate of third-quarter growth at 2.9 percent, it’s tempting to say that the period of very slow growth and negative productivity growth from which we’ve been suffering for several quarters should no longer be relevant to our thinking about the growth of the economy in the next few years.	13.0	108.0
201611	2238	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	That’s especially so, because the 2.9 percent real GDP growth was probably accompanied by positive productivity growth, and that estimated productivity growth could soon return to the 1¼ percent rate that the staff now regards as its long-run level.	13.0	108.0
201611	2239	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Well, those could be the directions in which data on, and expectations of, growth will move in the next quarter or two, but the data of one quarter do not make a trend.	13.0	108.0
201611	2240	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Tealbook A forecasts that total labor productivity will increase at a rate of 1.1 percent in 2017 and 2018 and 1.2 percent in 2019.	13.0	108.0
201611	2241	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We’ll have to wait and see whether that’s what happens—namely, whether productivity over the next few years will grow at a rate close to 1.1 percent or possibly even a little higher.	13.0	108.0
201611	2242	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And as we wait to see whether productivity growth increases, we’ll need to monitor the situation closely, to look at the details of growth, and be prepared to change policy in either direction should that become necessary.	13.0	108.0
201611	2243	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	If productivity growth, in fact, increases, we’ll have to remember the standard warning that the IMF dispenses when things are going well: Complacency must be avoided.	13.0	108.0
201611	2244	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	But, truth to tell, the FOMC is a committee that shows few signs of succumbing to the disease of complacency.	13.0	108.0
201611	2245	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	13.0	108.0
201611	2246	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The slow growth of the economy since the Great Recession is due mainly to the extremely low rate of productivity growth, for which the low rate of physical investment, despite the near-zero short-term interest rate, bears the significant share of the responsibility.	13.0	108.0
201611	2247	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	But there’s not much that we in the Federal Reserve can do that directly affects productivity growth except to maintain conditions conducive to investment and productivity growth—which one thought were low interest rates—by giving confidence to investors in the stability of the economy, especially the stability of the financial system, and by continuing to support the excellent research on productivity growth of several of our Federal Reserve economists.	13.0	108.0
201611	2248	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Now, each of us probably asks herself or himself from time to time why the outstanding employment performance of the economy in the period since the fall of Lehman Brothers and the essential role of the Federal Reserve in producing that result are so underappreciated.	13.0	108.0
201611	2249	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Well, almost certainly, the slow rate of real GDP growth during that period and the phenomena that indicate animal spirits are low are both important factors in this regard.	13.0	108.0
201611	2250	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	For some time, answers to two questions in public opinion surveys have presented an interesting contrast.	13.0	108.0
201611	2251	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Asked whether they’re satisfied or dissatisfied about the way things are going or similar questions, a large majority of the public is dissatisfied.	13.0	108.0
201611	2252	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Yet University of Michigan and Conference Board consumer satisfaction polls say that Americans are just as happy or optimistic as they were before the Great Recession.	13.0	108.0
201611	2253	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Ben Bernanke took up this contrast in a June blog and Alan Blinder wrote about it in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal on October 25.	13.0	108.0
201611	2254	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Ben concluded—and here I quote Alan Blinder’s article that agrees with Ben—that it “might be the increasingly shrill, partisan nature of our politics, not the state of the economy” that has so disappointed Americans, or, as the headline to Alan Blinder’s article says, “It’s Not the Economy, Stupid.	13.0	108.0
201611	2255	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	It’s the Political Gridlock.”	13.0	108.0
201611	2256	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	All that is by way of suggesting that people don’t feel as bad about the economy as many, certainly including me, have for some time felt that they do.	13.0	108.0
201611	2257	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, and more tomorrow.	13.0	108.0
201611	2258	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	2259	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	13.0	65.0
201611	2260	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201611	2261	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Since the previous FOMC meeting, there’s been a conceptual agreement, well documented or publicized, between OPEC nations to limit production levels, and we believe this agreement for a time has had some positive effect on oil prices.	13.0	110.0
201611	2262	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	However, on the basis of on discussions with our contacts, we believe that the details of this agreement may be very tough to work out.	13.0	110.0
201611	2263	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	And until the details are explicitly agreed upon, we are quite skeptical as to whether this agreement will ultimately translate into actual supply reductions among OPEC nations.	13.0	110.0
201611	2264	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Despite this backdrop, it continues to be our belief that global supply and demand are moving toward balance.	13.0	110.0
201611	2265	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	And while there’s some disagreement regarding the exact timing, we believe that the market should get into global balance during the first half of 2017.	13.0	110.0
201611	2266	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	This judgment, again, is based on our estimate that the growth of global supply is slowing and that global demand is growing at approximately 1.2 million barrels a day this year and should grow at a similar rate in 2017.	13.0	110.0
201611	2267	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	We believe that price volatility will persist, in view of the imperfect nature of supply–demand information in this market as well as the fact that excess inventories continue to stand at record levels.	13.0	110.0
201611	2268	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	But, while we expect continued price volatility, it’s likely to occur in an overall context of firming prices.	13.0	110.0
201611	2269	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	The rig count in Texas and across the nation is continuing to build, but based on discussions with our contacts, we believe the rig count will not accelerate until producers become more confident that oil prices can reach between $55 and $65 a barrel within the next year or two.	13.0	110.0
201611	2270	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Long-lived projects will take longer to be initiated, not only because they require higher breakeven oil prices but also because the priority for many integrated oil companies is to maintain their dividend levels rather than allocate resources to capital expenditures.	13.0	110.0
201611	2271	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	In the meantime, though, we expect more bankruptcies, mergers, and restructurings in the industry for the remainder of 2016, and, in fact, one significant one was announced this week.	13.0	110.0
201611	2272	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	And we see three reasons for this:  One, a number of companies are highly leveraged; two, the current market price is still below breakeven for many fields; and, three, lenders are increasingly focusing on cash flow versus asset values in decisions to extend credit.	13.0	110.0
201611	2273	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	In terms of the District, Texas employment growth was a bit under 1 percent at an annual rate over the first six months of 2016.	13.0	110.0
201611	2274	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Our forecast, though, is that the rate of job growth will rebound to approximately a 2 percent rate in the second half of this year and continue at a similar pace in 2017.	13.0	110.0
201611	2275	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	As headwinds from weak energy and a strong dollar continue to dissipate, we are seeing some stabilization and even modest growth in manufacturing as well as in exports from the State of Texas.	13.0	110.0
201611	2276	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Texas continues to benefit from migration of people and firms to the state.	13.0	110.0
201611	2277	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	In our surveys, the District is seeing not only building wage pressures in skilled trades in industries like construction, truck driving, nursing, IT, and the like but also broader evidence of labor shortages in the District.	13.0	110.0
201611	2278	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	The state’s high schools and colleges are increasingly offering skilled trade degrees to their students in an effort to address the state’s skills gap.	13.0	110.0
201611	2279	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	In addition, there’s a growing effort to address lagging educational attainment levels in the state by focusing on improving pre-K literacy levels for at-risk populations.	13.0	110.0
201611	2280	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	The Dallas Fed, as well as many other Federal Reserve Banks around this table, is playing an active leadership role in order to spur more of these efforts in our District.	13.0	110.0
201611	2281	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Regarding the nation, I have not materially changed my economic forecast since the previous meeting.	13.0	110.0
201611	2282	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	On the basis of our expectation of a strong US consumer, the Dallas Federal Reserve continues to estimate that GDP growth for the year will be somewhere between 1¾ and 2 percent.	13.0	110.0
201611	2283	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	We expect this growth to be sufficient to produce a further reduction in labor market slack in the economy.	13.0	110.0
201611	2284	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	The Dallas trimmed mean, as some of you have already noted, is currently running at approximately 1.7 percent—it’s been running at that level basically all year—and we continue to believe that we will gradually reach our 2 percent objective in the medium term.	13.0	110.0
201611	2285	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	The main focus for our research team and myself continues to be to try to understand several key persistent economic headwinds.	13.0	110.0
201611	2286	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	The first is aging demographics in the United States as well as in almost all other advanced economies.	13.0	110.0
201611	2287	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	The second trend we continue to try to understand is globalization, particularly excess global capacity and high levels of debt in China, which is having and will have an effect on global economic growth and inflation as well as creating vulnerability to periodic bouts of financial instability.	13.0	110.0
201611	2288	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	As Governor Fischer just mentioned, technology-enabled disruption is a third trend we are working heavily to try to understand.	13.0	110.0
201611	2289	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	In our view, it’s happening across almost every industry.	13.0	110.0
201611	2290	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	It’s having the effect of reducing pricing power, squeezing margins, and increasing uncertainty, which in turn is likely affecting the propensity of companies to allocate resources to capital expansion and capital spending.	13.0	110.0
201611	2291	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	And the last big trend is high levels of government debt to GDP across most major economies, which at a minimum is squeezing out the capacity for fiscal policy and other actions like infrastructure spending that could help improve GDP growth.	13.0	110.0
201611	2292	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	One last comment regarding business tone—and I guess I’ll refer to this as “CEO tone”— draws from discussions with CEOs in our District and some scattered CEOs across the nation.	13.0	110.0
201611	2293	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	At the previous meeting, I mentioned the issue of rising shareholder activism and the generally shorter investor time horizons that I’m observing.	13.0	110.0
201611	2294	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Let me say another word about this.	13.0	110.0
201611	2295	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	As Dennis Lockhart mentioned earlier, more money is going into passive funds—that’s well documented—with very low fees.	13.0	110.0
201611	2296	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	As a result, active managers who remain are under increasing pressure to outperform and justify high fees.	13.0	110.0
201611	2297	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	In that context, activism has increased because it’s a way for active managers to demonstrate outperformance.	13.0	110.0
201611	2298	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	It’s also putting much more pressure on active managers to show performance more quickly because they’re under regular pressure from the threat of investor redemptions.	13.0	110.0
201611	2299	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	This trend of shorter time frames and greater activism—combined with high rates of technology-enabled disruption, higher levels of regulation, and sluggish global demand—is making it tougher for CEOs to choose capital spending over share repurchase or dividends or cash mergers.	13.0	110.0
201611	2300	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	As I said in the September meeting, I think this trend is intensifying and, in my opinion, may be one reason why capital spending levels have been very sluggish and disappointing.	13.0	110.0
201611	2301	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I don’t see this trend reversing unless we experience higher rates of GDP growth or see potentially greater tax and other incentives for capital spending or both.	13.0	110.0
201611	2302	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201611	2303	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	2304	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	13.0	65.0
201611	2305	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201611	2306	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Over the intermeeting period, overall economic activity in the Third District continues to be a bit sluggish, with economic growth a bit below trend.	13.0	999.0
201611	2307	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Job growth continues to lag the nation, with year-over-year employment growth at a mere 0.4 percent in September, less than half that of the nation.	13.0	999.0
201611	2308	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	The unemployment rate remained at 5.5 percent, a full ½ percent higher than a year ago.	13.0	999.0
201611	2309	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	That said, the region’s higher unemployment rate is largely due to higher labor force participation than the nation as a whole, and almost all of the increase in regional unemployment has occurred in Pennsylvania.	13.0	999.0
201611	2310	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	In addition, the sectors facing the stiffest challenges remain mining and drilling in the Marcellus shale region, and job growth remains somewhat weak in manufacturing.	13.0	999.0
201611	2311	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Our region’s relatively weak labor market is reflected in our state coincident indexes that, with the exception of Delaware, are measurably less robust than the national average.	13.0	999.0
201611	2312	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	For example, over the 12 months ending in September, Pennsylvania’s coincident index increased 1.6 percent, compared with a 2.9 percent increase for the nation as a whole.	13.0	999.0
201611	2313	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Manufacturing activity, however, appears to be on a slight upward trend, with October’s general activity index in our Business Outlook Survey remaining in positive territory for the third straight month.	13.0	999.0
201611	2314	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	At 9.7 in October, the index is exactly at its nonrecessionary average.	13.0	999.0
201611	2315	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Both the new orders and shipments indexes are now in positive territory as well, but employment has yet to show signs of picking up.	13.0	999.0
201611	2316	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Survey respondents remain upbeat, with all of the forward-looking indexes showing substantial optimism.	13.0	999.0
201611	2317	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Now, while we’re not generally seeing strong growth in the region, a few areas of the District are doing modestly well.	13.0	999.0
201611	2318	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	One such area is auto sales, which are holding up at high levels, and the value of residential construction continues at a pace that is somewhat stronger than earlier in the year.	13.0	999.0
201611	2319	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Permits are also up, but that increase is largely due to, again, the multifamily sector of the market.	13.0	999.0
201611	2320	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Unlike the nation, we have yet to see any firming in single- family permits.	13.0	999.0
201611	2321	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Additionally, nonresidential construction has weakened a bit recently, and, like the nation, we are seeing less strength in our retail sector.	13.0	999.0
201611	2322	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Regarding Third District consumers, the pace of activity has diminished somewhat, which was reflected in the general activity index in our nonmanufacturing survey remaining slightly below its nonrecessionary average.	13.0	999.0
201611	2323	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	But consumer confidence remains high and retailers continue to be optimistic.	13.0	999.0
201611	2324	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Overall, the Third District is seeing, and should continue to see, steady if unspectacular economic growth, and contacts remain upbeat about the future.	13.0	999.0
201611	2325	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Turning to the nation as a whole, we appear to have gotten the bounceback in third- quarter activity that most of us were expecting, but the details were a bit weaker than the headline number, with growth in final sales not particularly robust.	13.0	999.0
201611	2326	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	I find little to disagree with in the Tealbook forecast, although I anticipate a bit more slowing in employment growth and a bit more of a pickup in inflation.	13.0	999.0
201611	2327	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Basically, I see the current unemployment rate at about its natural rate, and economic fundamentals are in line with continued consumption growth.	13.0	999.0
201611	2328	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	And I agree with the staff that growth in investment may turn positive.	13.0	999.0
201611	2329	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	But it could remain at troubling low levels.	13.0	999.0
201611	2330	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	My main worry remains the lack of productivity growth, as others have mentioned, without which it will be difficult to maintain our economic momentum.	13.0	999.0
201611	2331	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Overall, conditions remain consistent with a rate move this year, but I’ll return to that thought tomorrow.	13.0	999.0
201611	2332	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201611	2333	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	2334	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13.0	65.0
201611	2335	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	103.0
201611	2336	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	The 10th District economy continues to feel the effects of last year’s decline in energy and agricultural commodity prices.	13.0	103.0
201611	2337	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Job growth is modest or slipping in all of our states except Colorado, and unemployment in Oklahoma and Wyoming is now 1 full percentage point higher than a year ago.	13.0	103.0
201611	2338	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Tax revenues also continue to worsen in most District states, creating the potential for future drags on state and local government spending.	13.0	103.0
201611	2339	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Construction has slowed in the region, but office vacancies and the inventory of unsold homes remain low, and mortgage delinquencies in energy states have not shown any concerning increase.	13.0	103.0
201611	2340	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Agricultural commodity prices also remain low and have continued to weigh on farm income, farm spending, and economic activity in rural parts of the District.	13.0	103.0
201611	2341	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	On the positive side, consumer spending is rising in most District states, and capital spending plans have improved moderately outside of the ag sector.	13.0	103.0
201611	2342	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Our manufacturing survey posted its second consecutive expansionary reading in October, the first back-to-back increase in almost two years, due in part to a somewhat brighter outlook in the energy sector.	13.0	103.0
201611	2343	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Current oil prices are around the level firms say they need, on average, to be profitable, and energy firms in our region have continued to modestly increase drilling activity and are planning further expansion in 2017.	13.0	103.0
201611	2344	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	My outlook for the national economy is little changed since September.	13.0	103.0
201611	2345	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	I continue to expect a moderate pace of economic growth led by consumer spending.	13.0	103.0
201611	2346	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Business fixed investment is also likely to begin making a modest contribution to output growth, as the recent rise in energy prices support new drilling activities, with additional oil rigs contributing to investment in structures.	13.0	103.0
201611	2347	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Recent data on shipments and orders for core capital goods also suggest some gains in equipment investment.	13.0	103.0
201611	2348	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Labor markets appear well positioned to support consumer-led growth.	13.0	103.0
201611	2349	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Nonfarm payrolls have grown, resulting in nearly 2.5 million new jobs on net.	13.0	103.0
201611	2350	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Nominal wage growth has picked up this year, with the Atlanta Fed Wage Growth Tracker indicating median wage growth above 3 percent for all of 2016 and accelerating in recent months.	13.0	103.0
201611	2351	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Most recently, it nearly matches the pace of wage gains at the peak of the last expansion.	13.0	103.0
201611	2352	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Perhaps most encouraging is that the labor force has increased by 3 million since September 2015, which is the strongest growth in the labor force since 2000.	13.0	103.0
201611	2353	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	This solid growth in the labor force over the past year is a welcome development.	13.0	103.0
201611	2354	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	But as Governor Tarullo highlighted, the increase in the labor force does not reflect a strong pull of workers from the sidelines into the labor market.	13.0	103.0
201611	2355	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	In fact, the number of labor market entrants has slowed from 6.7 million in September 2015 to 6½ million entrants in September of this year.	13.0	103.0
201611	2356	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	On the other hand, the number of people exiting the labor force over the past year has declined substantially.	13.0	103.0
201611	2357	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Over the past year, the number of workers exiting has fallen from 6.6 million to 6.2 million.	13.0	103.0
201611	2358	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Therefore, the growth in the labor force largely reflects slowing in outflows of workers rather than an increase in the flow of workers coming in from the sidelines.	13.0	103.0
201611	2359	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	The decline in exits suggests workers are now more attached to the labor force compared with earlier years in the recovery.	13.0	103.0
201611	2360	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, I see inflation advancing toward the 2 percent goal, supported by higher energy prices.	13.0	103.0
201611	2361	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Headline inflation increased at an annual rate of 2.1 percent over the past six months compared with 1.3 percent over the past 12 months.	13.0	103.0
201611	2362	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased, as have flows into investments offering inflation protection.	13.0	103.0
201611	2363	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	13.0	103.0
201611	2364	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	2365	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13.0	65.0
201611	2366	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201611	2367	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	The narrative on which I would premise a near-term increase in the policy rate anticipates GDP growth in the neighborhood of 2 percent for the medium term.	13.0	88.0
201611	2368	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	This modest pace of growth ought to be sufficient to absorb any remaining slack in labor markets and provide support for nudging inflation up to target.	13.0	88.0
201611	2369	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I believe my outlook is in the mainstream of this Committee, and it is broadly consistent with the forecast presented in this meeting’s Tealbook.	13.0	88.0
201611	2370	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Although Friday’s third-quarter GDP report carried mixed messages, the top-line number in last week’s GDP report was in line with my expectation of a stronger second half.	13.0	88.0
201611	2371	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	The uneven composition of growth was attention getting, but Friday’s GDP report did not set off any alarm bells, in my estimation.	13.0	88.0
201611	2372	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I would say that, overall, I’m satisfied the economy remains on narrative.	13.0	88.0
201611	2373	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	The third-quarter personal consumption number was soft but on the heels of second- quarter strength.	13.0	88.0
201611	2374	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Consumer-savvy contacts in my District reported for the most part that consumer spending continues to grow at a moderate pace.	13.0	88.0
201611	2375	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Most expect flat-to-slightly-higher holiday sales.	13.0	88.0
201611	2376	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	One contact offered that consumers are tending to make their purchases later in the holiday shopping season, the implication being that we may not know much about holiday sales results until rather late in December.	13.0	88.0
201611	2377	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Translating to the Committee’s concerns, we may not have much of a read on fourth-quarter spending at our December meeting.	13.0	88.0
201611	2378	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	It’s widely recognized that online retailers are experiencing strong sales at the expense of their mostly brick-and-mortar competitors.	13.0	88.0
201611	2379	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	In response to this trend, our director from a large global package delivery company reported adding a record number of new jumbo jet aircraft to the company’s fleet and aggressively expanding its number of facilities.	13.0	88.0
201611	2380	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	This encouraging business investment report was in contrast, however, to most of what we heard over the past few weeks.	13.0	88.0
201611	2381	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Business investment continues to be soft, particularly in the bellwether equipment spending category.	13.0	88.0
201611	2382	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Most reports confirm the signal coming from the data.	13.0	88.0
201611	2383	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding net exports, we did not pick up in our interviews this cycle any expectation of ongoing strength in exports.	13.0	88.0
201611	2384	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I think Friday’s result is best interpreted as a one-off quarter of better numbers, not a trend.	13.0	88.0
201611	2385	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	The soybean factor was apparently decisive.	13.0	88.0
201611	2386	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m looking for a headline:  “Export Report Full of Beans.”	13.0	88.0
201611	2387	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	[Laughter]	13.0	88.0
201611	2388	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Our District soundings for unemployment and labor market conditions continue to be suggestive of a tightening market, and businesses still report little in the way of pricing power.	13.0	88.0
201611	2389	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I consider the risks to be balanced, and, to summarize, neither our interpretation of the incoming data nor the economic intelligence collected in my District have challenged my basic narrative enough to reconsider a policy move at this or the next meeting.	13.0	88.0
201611	2390	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201611	2391	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	2392	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	13.0	65.0
201611	2393	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	111.0
201611	2394	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Employers in the Ninth District continue to report trouble finding workers.	13.0	111.0
201611	2395	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	There is some anecdotal evidence that wages for low-skilled jobs are rising.	13.0	111.0
201611	2396	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	For example, some lower-skilled health-care positions have moved from about $12 an hour to between $14 and $15 an hour in the past year.	13.0	111.0
201611	2397	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	We’ve also heard that jobs at customer service centers have seen wages go up from $12 to $14 an hour to about $16 to $18 an hour.	13.0	111.0
201611	2398	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Meanwhile, inflation pressures have remained muted.	13.0	111.0
201611	2399	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Looking nationally, Friday’s GDP release contains little evidence to me and our staff of strong forward momentum in the US economy.	13.0	111.0
201611	2400	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	The headline GDP number for Q3 was decent, but, as many others have noted, domestic demand came in weak and fixed investment continues to decline, signaling little business confidence.	13.0	111.0
201611	2401	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	With 1.1 percent real GDP growth in the first half, overall growth for 2016 is likely to be subpar, even for the post-recession period.	13.0	111.0
201611	2402	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	When I turn to inflation, the news is somewhat better.	13.0	111.0
201611	2403	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	The latest data show a small uptick in core PCE inflation, which I’m happy about.	13.0	111.0
201611	2404	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Core inflation in Q3 came in at 1.7 percent, and the Tealbook has marked up the both 2016 and 2017 core PCE projections from 1.6 to 1.7 percent.	13.0	111.0
201611	2405	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Market-based inflation expectations have also ticked up recently.	13.0	111.0
201611	2406	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Meanwhile, wage growth remains moderate.	13.0	111.0
201611	2407	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Now, these are welcome developments, but I, like many of you, am also concerned that both market- and survey-based measures of inflation expectations remain extremely low by historical standards.	13.0	111.0
201611	2408	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	For me, I don’t know whether this uptick is a signal or noise.	13.0	111.0
201611	2409	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I hope it’s a signal, but I’d like to see more evidence before I draw any firm conclusions.	13.0	111.0
201611	2410	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Meanwhile, in the global economy, world inflation and global economic growth remain subdued.	13.0	111.0
201611	2411	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Now, regarding the labor market, US employment continues to rise strongly.	13.0	111.0
201611	2412	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	The optimistic narrative that I and several of us around the table have been emphasizing this year is that the United States can continue to add a lot of jobs without driving unemployment uncomfortably low as long as we can keep adding to the labor force, which we’ve been doing.	13.0	111.0
201611	2413	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	The headline rate even ticked up just slightly.	13.0	111.0
201611	2414	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	This has been the story over the past 12 months, a period during which the unemployment rate has barely budged, while prime-age labor force participation, ignoring demographic effects, has risen about 1 percentage point.	13.0	111.0
201611	2415	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	So the big question for me is, how much longer can this play out?	13.0	111.0
201611	2416	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Prime-age labor force participation fell very sharply during the recession, and it’s still about 1½ percentage points below where it was in the mid-2000s.	13.0	111.0
201611	2417	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Prime-age male labor force participation is also very low in the United States compared with most other OECD countries.	13.0	111.0
201611	2418	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	So there’s a very real possibility—it’s not impossible—that prime-age labor force participation could continue to rise back to levels seen in the 2000s.	13.0	111.0
201611	2419	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	If prime-age labor force participation rose another 1 percentage point over the next 12 months, as it did over the past 12 months, that would be another 1.25 million Americans in the labor force.	13.0	111.0
201611	2420	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	And many people around the table have said the narrative is about people reentering the labor force.	13.0	111.0
201611	2421	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	It’s not that.	13.0	111.0
201611	2422	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	It’s people not leaving.	13.0	111.0
201611	2423	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I’ll take it either way, and I know all of you agree.	13.0	111.0
201611	2424	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Either way, it’s a net positive for the country.	13.0	111.0
201611	2425	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	My conclusion is, my baseline outlook is more of the same:  modest GDP growth, subdued inflation.	13.0	111.0
201611	2426	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	It’s very possible we’ll see continued decent job growth supported by rising labor force participation without seeing much in terms of inflation.	13.0	111.0
201611	2427	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Again, we just don’t know, and until I start seeing some signs of that process petering out, I’d like to give it more time to run.	13.0	111.0
201611	2428	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Overall, risks remain tilted to the downside.	13.0	111.0
201611	2429	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	We’re currently not well placed to respond to the next negative shock that pushes us back onto the lower bound.	13.0	111.0
201611	2430	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	13.0	111.0
201611	2431	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	2432	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13.0	65.0
201611	2433	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201611	2434	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	On the economic growth side, I’m pretty much with everyone else.	13.0	96.0
201611	2435	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I anticipate that the economy will continue to expand at a slightly above-trend pace.	13.0	96.0
201611	2436	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I agree with others that Q3 GDP probably overstates that strength a bit because of the big rise in exports, which was so narrowly based on the soybean factor, and because we had a sharp swing from inventory liquidation back to accumulation, which probably won’t be repeated in the fourth quarter.	13.0	96.0
201611	2437	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	When I look at the economy, I think the good news is that it seems to be relatively well balanced.	13.0	96.0
201611	2438	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The drag arising from the collapse in oil and gas drilling activity looks to be over.	13.0	96.0
201611	2439	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Household income is rising.	13.0	96.0
201611	2440	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The household saving rate and household balance sheets appear supportive of continued gains in consumption.	13.0	96.0
201611	2441	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Both residential and nonresidential investment seems likely to expand gradually, with, presumably, business fixed investment getting some lift once the uncertainty surrounding next week’s election is resolved.	13.0	96.0
201611	2442	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Of course, it depends on how that uncertainty is resolved.	13.0	96.0
201611	2443	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I’ll have more on that in a minute.	13.0	96.0
201611	2444	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	At the same time, I don’t see what would cause the economy to expand much more quickly.	13.0	96.0
201611	2445	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Cyclically, the expansion seems to be relatively mature at this point.	13.0	96.0
201611	2446	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So, for example, if you look at cyclical sectors such as motor vehicles, they seem close to their cycle peaks.	13.0	96.0
201611	2447	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Housing, though, seems to be a bit of an exception, and why housing starts aren’t stronger is a little unclear to me.	13.0	96.0
201611	2448	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the election, the concern of market participants appears to be the tail risk—either a sweep by the Democrats or a sweep by the Republicans.	13.0	96.0
201611	2449	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	We had our buy-side advisory group in a couple of weeks ago, and the prevailing view was that if we had control by either party of both the Congress and the White House, that would increase uncertainty and would lead to an equity market selloff.	13.0	96.0
201611	2450	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	In contrast, if current expectations were realized—a Clinton victory and a Republican House, with the Senate uncertain—the view among this group was generally on the side that this would be considered a continuation of the status quo and there wouldn’t be much of a market response.	13.0	96.0
201611	2451	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	There does also seem to be, however, some sentiment that, regardless of the outcome, the Congress would be more willing to move forward with an infrastructure spending program.	13.0	96.0
201611	2452	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	And that’s interesting, because fiscal policy is really not on such a great path.	13.0	96.0
201611	2453	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	But if you add an infrastructure spending program on top of that, the fiscal situation may start to reemerge as an issue.	13.0	96.0
201611	2454	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	It is very quiescent today because interest rates are low, and people don’t see any negative consequence of that.	13.0	96.0
201611	2455	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	If we actually normalize interest rates over time, then the net interest cost on the government debt will start to go back up, and that’ll be another burden.	13.0	96.0
201611	2456	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think the confidence in the sustainability of the fiscal path today is much overstated relative to the path that we’re actually on.	13.0	96.0
201611	2457	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I thought it was interesting that, in New Jersey, we had legislation to raise the gasoline tax by $0.23 per gallon to fund the transportation infrastructure program.	13.0	96.0
201611	2458	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	And the fact that it went through is probably an interesting leading indicator that there is actually more voter support for greater infrastructure spending in this country.	13.0	96.0
201611	2459	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	On the inflation side, I do take some signal from the slight firming in the core inflation trajectory and the fact that some market-based measures of inflation compensation have firmed in recent weeks.	13.0	96.0
201611	2460	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this development does help support the case for tightening monetary policy at our next meeting in December, assuming that the economy stays close to its current trajectory.	13.0	96.0
201611	2461	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	However, I don’t think that there’s any great urgency to tightening.	13.0	96.0
201611	2462	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The economy is growing at only a slightly above-trend pace.	13.0	96.0
201611	2463	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Inflation is still below our target.	13.0	96.0
201611	2464	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	There still may be some excess slack in the labor market, judging from the fact that the above-trend payroll growth hasn’t caused any downward movement in the unemployment rate this year.	13.0	96.0
201611	2465	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	And the pickup in nominal wage growth—I think there has been a pickup—has been very modest.	13.0	96.0
201611	2466	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I thought the third-quarter employment cost index release was interesting in the sense that it showed a 2.3 percent year-over-year rise in total compensation, which was not an acceleration from the previous quarter.	13.0	96.0
201611	2467	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	And 2.3 percent is not a very high rate of increase in employee compensation.	13.0	96.0
201611	2468	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, judging from the modest forward momentum in the economy, it doesn’t look like our nominal federal funds rate target is very far below a neutral monetary policy setting.	13.0	96.0
201611	2469	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I judge the gap today as only about 100 to 150 basis points.	13.0	96.0
201611	2470	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	And that’s a gap we could close relatively quickly, should that prove necessary.	13.0	96.0
201611	2471	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So the lack of urgency implies that there is not a good case for moving at this meeting.	13.0	96.0
201611	2472	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	To do so with the election a week away, the outcome uncertain, and no scheduled press conference would imply an urgency to move that I just don’t think is consistent with the incoming information or the economic outlook.	13.0	96.0
201611	2473	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201611	2474	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks, everyone, for an interesting discussion of the outlook and the risks.	13.0	65.0
201611	2475	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And, if I might, I’d like to wrap up the go-round with some of my own comments on recent data, the near-term outlook, and their implications for our policy actions in December and into next year.	13.0	65.0
201611	2476	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Although we haven’t received much data since our September meeting, what we have received suggests that labor market conditions continue to improve.	13.0	65.0
201611	2477	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Payrolls rose almost 160,000 in September, only a little slower than the roughly 180,000 per month pace seen since the start of the year and well above their longer-run trend.	13.0	65.0
201611	2478	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Labor force participation has continued to move sideways, a favorable development in light of the downward pressure from demographic trends and one that’s allowed the unemployment rate to remain close to 5 percent for the past year amid solid job growth.	13.0	65.0
201611	2479	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Along most other dimensions, labor market conditions are little changed this year.	13.0	65.0
201611	2480	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	The broad U-6 measure of unemployment continues to move sideways, as have JOLTS measures of job openings, hires, separations, and quits.	13.0	65.0
201611	2481	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Business survey readings on net hiring plans and the difficulty of filling jobs have also been flat since January.	13.0	65.0
201611	2482	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	However, household perceptions of job availability have trended up since the start of the year, as has the employment-to-population ratio.	13.0	65.0
201611	2483	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	So, where does that leave us?	13.0	65.0
201611	2484	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	So far, I see few signs of overheating in the labor market.	13.0	65.0
201611	2485	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Reports of worker shortages have increased, particularly for certain occupations and in some sectors.	13.0	65.0
201611	2486	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And in response to a tighter labor market, wage growth has picked up somewhat from a year ago.	13.0	65.0
201611	2487	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Nevertheless, wage gains remain moderate overall, with average hourly earnings and the ECI rising only 2.6 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, over the past 12 months.	13.0	65.0
201611	2488	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	For these and other reasons, I continue to believe that some modest amount of slack remains, and that we should welcome a limited degree of further tightening, particularly with inflation still running below 2 percent.	13.0	65.0
201611	2489	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, I continue to put some weight on the possibility of letting the economy run a bit hot for a time—and let me emphasize here that I mean “hot” in the sense of allowing the unemployment rate to decline a little bit below current estimates of its natural rate—a path that is exactly consistent with the median unemployment projection in our September SEP.	13.0	65.0
201611	2490	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Allowing the economy to run hot in that sense could have favorable supply-side effects, as I noted in a recent speech.	13.0	65.0
201611	2491	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And I was interested that several of you, in your own comments, mentioned the increased efforts that you’ve seen firms make in terms of investing in training and hiring workers who were less skilled and investing in them so that they can occupy jobs for which they’re not able to hire the people with the skills they’d ideally like.	13.0	65.0
201611	2492	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I consider that kind of investment in workforce training and upgrading to be exactly an example of the kind of favorable supply-side effect that I think you would expect to see in a tight labor market.	13.0	65.0
201611	2493	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	But I don’t want to overstate my expectations on this score.	13.0	65.0
201611	2494	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	In the case of the participation rate, I don’t expect it to remain flat for much longer, in view of research within and outside the Federal Reserve suggesting that the current rate is near its longer-run trend, which is clearly headed down.	13.0	65.0
201611	2495	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And, although involuntary part-time employment remains well above its pre-crisis level, I cannot be sure that structural change over the past decade has not resulted in a new, higher norm.	13.0	65.0
201611	2496	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	In light of the uncertainties we face, I would not be especially surprised to see the unemployment rate fall sharply over the next few months even though my baseline forecast has labor utilization tightening more gradually than that.	13.0	65.0
201611	2497	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	This possibility and the fact that monetary policy operates with a lag limit how far we can safely go in probing the economy’s ability to absorb relatively rapid employment growth.	13.0	65.0
201611	2498	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Although we have discovered over the past year that we have somewhat more “running room” than we might have expected regarding the pace at which we need to tighten, the extra room is only so great and could quickly disappear.	13.0	65.0
201611	2499	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I will now turn to real activity more broadly.	13.0	65.0
201611	2500	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	The incoming data have been somewhat mixed but, on balance, suggest that the economy is continuing to expand at a moderate pace.	13.0	65.0
201611	2501	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Although real GDP rose at an annual rate of almost 3 percent in the third quarter, a robust pace by recent standards, much of that strength reflected what’s probably a transitory swing in inventory investment.	13.0	65.0
201611	2502	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And, overall, as several of you noted, real GDP growth was boosted by a surge in soybean exports.	13.0	65.0
201611	2503	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	In other categories of spending, conditions were relatively lackluster.	13.0	65.0
201611	2504	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Growth in consumer spending slowed appreciably from the rapid pace seen earlier in the year and by more than the staff expected.	13.0	65.0
201611	2505	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	The recovery in residential construction seems to have stalled out for reasons that are not clear—raising questions about the sector’s future prospects even if mortgage rates remain low—and business investment continued to be surprisingly soft.	13.0	65.0
201611	2506	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	If we cut through the quarterly ups and downs, real GDP growth over the past year was quite mediocre, only 1½ percent.	13.0	65.0
201611	2507	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I hope we will see some step-up in coming quarters.	13.0	65.0
201611	2508	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Consumer spending is likely to continue to grow at a moderate pace, supported by ongoing employment gains, previous increases in wealth, and low interest rates.	13.0	65.0
201611	2509	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Business investment may also pick up now that drilling activity has finally bottomed out and is starting to rise again.	13.0	65.0
201611	2510	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	But with the dollar still elevated and only lackluster economic growth abroad, there’s not much reason to expect a lot of support from net exports.	13.0	65.0
201611	2511	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Overall, real GDP growth will probably run in the vicinity of 2 percent in coming quarters, enough to keep employment rising somewhat faster than its long-run trend as long as productivity growth continues to be anemic.	13.0	65.0
201611	2512	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Under these conditions, r* is likely to remain low for the foreseeable future.	13.0	65.0
201611	2513	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Regarding inflation, the recent news has been encouraging.	13.0	65.0
201611	2514	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Both headline and core consumer prices have come in somewhat higher than expected in recent months.	13.0	65.0
201611	2515	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, spot oil prices have moved up recently and will almost certainly put significant upward pressure on consumer energy prices in the next few months.	13.0	65.0
201611	2516	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And because the dollar has been stable for some time, core import prices are now rising at a moderate rate rather than falling.	13.0	65.0
201611	2517	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	On the basis of this information, the staff now projects that by the time of the December meeting, the data in hand will show overall PCE prices rising almost 1½ percent on a 12-month basis, with core PCE prices up about 1¾ percent from a year earlier.	13.0	65.0
201611	2518	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Such price increases would represent considerable progress toward our inflation objective since we first raised the federal funds rate late last year.	13.0	65.0
201611	2519	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	At that time, headline PCE inflation was running below ½ percent, and core inflation was only a little above 1¼ percent.	13.0	65.0
201611	2520	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, only time will tell whether these encouraging developments will continue into 2017 and be followed by further progress over time.	13.0	65.0
201611	2521	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	The recent firming of core PCE inflation may signal a persistent acceleration in prices, but it also could represent the transitory effects of special factors such as movements in nonmarket prices.	13.0	65.0
201611	2522	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And we cannot rule out the possibility that developments abroad could again put upward pressure on the dollar and cause oil prices to fall, thereby restraining inflation for a considerable time.	13.0	65.0
201611	2523	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	That said, developments this year have increased my confidence that, with the unemployment rate likely to run a bit below its estimated longer-run level, inflation will move back to 2 percent over the next couple of years.	13.0	65.0
201611	2524	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Let me conclude with a few observations on some of the issues we will face in coming weeks.	13.0	65.0
201611	2525	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	If the data come in about as the staff expects, I think it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate in December.	13.0	65.0
201611	2526	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Employment will have been increasing at a solid pace, accompanied by moderate GDP growth, and inflation will be up noticeably from where it stood when we first raised the federal funds rate.	13.0	65.0
201611	2527	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Furthermore, I anticipate that an increase would be appropriate even if the data come in a little on the weak side over the next few weeks.	13.0	65.0
201611	2528	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	For me, it would take something quite surprising to merit leaving the federal funds rate unchanged in December.	13.0	65.0
201611	2529	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	We’re in a good position to move in December from a communications standpoint.	13.0	65.0
201611	2530	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Market participants currently place the likelihood of a hike at either the November or December meeting at 70 percent.	13.0	65.0
201611	2531	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	This figure strikes me as about right, against the background of the many unexpected things that can happen in this world.	13.0	65.0
201611	2532	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	So we shouldn’t expect and shouldn’t want market participants to view a December move as completely “baked in the cake.”	13.0	65.0
201611	2533	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I think the language of alternative B should succeed in communicating our expectation that we expect to move but are preserving our options, and thus it should not have a marked influence on market expectations in either direction.	13.0	65.0
201611	2534	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	At this point, I’m not overly concerned that the market may misinterpret a December increase as a signal that we no longer intend to move gradually and proceed cautiously in adjusting policy in pursuit of our employment and inflation goals.	13.0	65.0
201611	2535	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Our actions over the past year have amply demonstrated that this Committee is prepared to be patient and will not tighten unless and until it is appropriate to do so.	13.0	65.0
201611	2536	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Nevertheless, we will need to monitor market reactions carefully to make sure that our intentions and strategy are understood.	13.0	65.0
201611	2537	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there.	13.0	65.0
201611	2538	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I think we have plenty of time tomorrow for our policy round, and I think maybe we could stop and have the reception.	53.0	65.0
201611	2539	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Dinner will be ready at 5:30.	53.0	65.0
201611	2540	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	However, let me just mention before we break for dinner that, unfortunately, this dinner will need to be our last regular such event on the evening of the first day of an FOMC meeting.	53.0	65.0
201611	2541	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	As many of you know, the Martin Building is going to be closed starting in December for renovation, so, unfortunately, this is our last regular, normal dinner gathering.	53.0	65.0
201611	2542	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The last supper.	53.0	96.0
201611	2543	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	53.0	96.0
201611	2544	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	“For some time”?	53.0	81.0
201611	2545	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	“An extended period.”	53.0	65.0
201611	2546	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	53.0	65.0
201611	2547	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I appreciate it—thanks.	53.0	81.0
201611	2548	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I knew there was some guidance there.	53.0	81.0
201611	2549	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	It won’t be as long as “extended period” turned out to be.	53.0	65.0
201611	2550	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	We’re hoping for sooner.	53.0	65.0
201611	2551	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	We will reassemble tomorrow at 9:00.	53.0	65.0
201611	2553	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	November 2 Session .	53.0	65.0
201611	2554	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	53.0	65.0
201611	2555	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s get started.	53.0	65.0
201611	2556	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I first want to call on Eric Engen for a brief report on this morning’s data.	11.0	65.0
201611	2557	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201611	2558	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	This morning ADP, in its employment report, estimated that private-sector employment increased 147,000 in October.	11.0	999.0
201611	2559	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	That was very close to our Tealbook forecast of a gain of 150,000, which includes an effect of Hurricane Matthew of minus 10,000, as the hurricane hit during the reference week.	11.0	999.0
201611	2560	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	So the ADP report is very much in line with what we’re expecting will come out on Friday for private-sector employment.	11.0	999.0
201611	2561	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	11.0	65.0
201611	2562	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Let me now turn things over to Thomas for a monetary policy briefing.	21.0	65.0
201611	2563	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201611	2564	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	I’ll be referring to the handout labeled “Material for the Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21.0	999.0
201611	2565	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	As you know, the market currently places roughly two-thirds odds on an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate by the end of this year.	21.0	999.0
201611	2566	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	These odds are significantly higher than the perceived probability, a year ago, of liftoff occurring at the December 2015 meeting.	21.0	999.0
201611	2567	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	No doubt an important contributor to the market’s greater conviction of a rate increase by year-end has been the cumulative progress toward the Committee’s policy objectives, the reduction of near-term risks to the outlook, and the Committee’s acknowledgment in September’s postmeeting statement that the case for an increase in the funds rate had strengthened.	21.0	999.0
201611	2568	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	The drafts of alternatives B and C recognize further progress toward the Committee’s employment objective by reporting that “although the unemployment rate is little changed in recent months, job gains have been solid.”	21.0	999.0
201611	2569	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	In addition, those alternatives not only note the increase in inflation since earlier in the year, but also recognize the likelihood of slightly higher near-term inflation by deleting the earlier statement that “inflation is expected to remain low in the near term.”	21.0	999.0
201611	2570	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	As Eric pointed out in his briefing, the staff revised up its near-term inflation projection in response to the recent rise in energy prices and somewhat higher-than-expected readings on core prices.	21.0	999.0
201611	2571	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative A, by contrast, makes no reference to the increase in inflation.	21.0	999.0
201611	2572	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Regarding the longer-run outlook for inflation, the upper-left panel of the exhibit shows that the risk-neutral probability distribution of headline CPI inflation over the next 10 years implied by inflation caps and floors now shows somewhat greater probability of CPI inflation above 2.5 percent than was the case before your previous meeting and somewhat lower probability of CPI inflation below 1.5 percent.	21.0	999.0
201611	2573	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	In addition, far-forward inflation compensation, which we showed in Monday’s pre-FOMC briefing, has moved up about 20 basis points over the intermeeting period, a change that is highlighted in the drafts of alternatives B and C and that likely reflects, in part, less concern among investors about the risk of a combination of low inflation and low economic growth.	21.0	999.0
201611	2574	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	The staff projects only a temporary boost to headline inflation from recent energy price increases, followed by a gradual return of inflation from below to 2 percent over the next four years.	21.0	999.0
201611	2575	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Accordingly, the drafts of alternatives B and C acknowledge that, even with the increase in inflation since the beginning of the year, inflation is still running below the Committee’s 2 percent objective but is anticipated to rise to 2 percent over the medium term.	21.0	999.0
201611	2576	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative A emphasizes that the return to 2 percent inflation is expected to be gradual.	21.0	999.0
201611	2577	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	However, as discussed in one of the alternative scenarios in Tealbook A, a more rapid and persistent increase in inflation above 2 percent is certainly a possibility—in fact, the inflation path generated by the “Higher Labor Costs” scenario lies well within the 70 percent confidence interval around the baseline projection.	21.0	999.0
201611	2578	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	As indicated in the upper-right panel, the remainder of my briefing examines two potential implications of such an outcome in which inflation is persistently ½ percentage point above baseline: First, how would that higher inflation path, in hindsight, affect your assessment of the stance of monetary policy today?	21.0	999.0
201611	2579	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	And, second, how would it affect not only the path of the federal funds rate, but also financial conditions more broadly?	21.0	999.0
201611	2580	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	To address the first question—how you might change your assessment of the stance of monetary policy today—I am focusing on how much an unfolding of higher inflation outcomes over the next three years would alter your estimate of the neutral federal funds rate at the current juncture.	21.0	999.0
201611	2581	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	To obtain a benchmark against which to assess how the revision to the inflation outlook would affect your current assessment of the neutral rate, I compute the Laubach–Williams estimate of r*, treating the medians of your September SEP forecasts through 2019 as data.	21.0	999.0
201611	2582	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Note that the r* estimates so obtained differ from the SEP-implied r* estimates I presented most recently in my briefing in September, because the estimates presented here use the Laubach–Williams model’s internal estimate of resource utilization rather than the measure inferred from your projected unemployment rate gaps.	21.0	999.0
201611	2583	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	As shown by the green line in the middle-left panel, if the economy evolved over the next three years in line with the SEP medians, this measure of r* would remain near its current estimate of ¼ percent.	21.0	999.0
201611	2584	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	In addition, the estimate of its current value would be nearly unrevised in hindsight, as shown by the proximity of the green and black lines in mid- 2016.	21.0	999.0
201611	2585	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	The middle-right panel shows the path of inflation in the “Higher Labor Costs” scenario when applying the shocks that generate this scenario to the medians of the September SEP forecasts instead of the current Tealbook projection.	21.0	999.0
201611	2586	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	The gap between the two inflation paths widens to about 0.6 percentage point by 2019.	21.0	999.0
201611	2587	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	When using this inflation path, together with the paths of real GDP and the federal funds rate associated with this scenario, as data and re-estimating the Laubach–Williams measure, the path of r*, shown as the blue dashed line in the middle left, shifts up about 25 basis points over the recent history and the projection period.	21.0	999.0
201611	2588	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Thus, if using the real rate gap implied by the Laubach–Williams estimate as a measure of the stance of monetary policy, this alternative scenario would lead in hindsight to only a modest reassessment of the stance of monetary policy.	21.0	999.0
201611	2589	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	The response of the federal funds rate embedded in this scenario is determined by applying the inertial Taylor (1999) rule to the deviations of variables from the SEP baseline.	21.0	999.0
201611	2590	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	As noted in the lower-left panel, the federal funds rate rises to 3 percent by the end of 2019, nearly ½ percentage point above the baseline.	21.0	999.0
201611	2591	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	This funds rate path is importantly conditioned on the transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions embedded in the FRB/US model, including the transmission to longer- term yields and the exchange value of the dollar.	21.0	999.0
201611	2592	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	In particular, the FRB/US model predicts only a muted response of term premiums, and hence longer-term interest rates, to such a scenario.	21.0	999.0
201611	2593	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Due to the gradual response of the federal funds rate and longer-term interest rates, the inflation shock turns out to be highly persistent.	21.0	999.0
201611	2594	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	But would the market response to such an inflation surprise be as subdued as envisaged by the FRB/US model?	21.0	999.0
201611	2595	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	The red line in the lower-right panel shows that the staff’s estimate of the term premium component of the 10-year Treasury yield remains quite depressed.	21.0	999.0
201611	2596	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	This depressed level is due in part to the ongoing effects from the duration risk on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, but much of it presumably reflects the value of longer-term nominal assets as a hedge in an environment of low inflation and in which short-term rates remain near the lower bound.	21.0	999.0
201611	2597	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	A decomposition of the change in the 10-year Treasury yield over the period from June 2014 to June 2016, a period that saw a major disinflationary shock, suggests that roughly 50 of the 70 basis point overall decline of the 10-year yield is due to a decline in the term premium.	21.0	999.0
201611	2598	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Accordingly, if investors came to expect a persistent change in the inflation outlook, as implied by this scenario, the past declines of term premiums could unwind rapidly, leading to a stronger transmission from changes in the policy rate to longer- term interest rates than assumed in the FRB/US model simulation.	21.0	999.0
201611	2599	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	A substantial increase in US longer-term interest rates would in turn likely be associated with dollar appreciation.	21.0	999.0
201611	2600	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	All in all, therefore, the extent to which the tightening of financial conditions in response to a persistent increase in inflation would come about through a steeper federal funds rate path or through other channels is quite uncertain.	21.0	999.0
201611	2601	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201611	2602	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	That completes my prepared remarks.	21.0	999.0
201611	2603	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	The September statement and the draft alternatives are shown on pages 2 to 9 of the handout.	21.0	999.0
201611	2604	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	I’ll be happy to take any questions.	21.0	999.0
201611	2605	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any questions?	22.0	65.0
201611	2606	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	22.0	65.0
201611	2607	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I have a question, Thomas.	22.0	91.0
201611	2608	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	It has to do with the way you described the uncertainty bands relative to the higher labor costs.	22.0	91.0
201611	2609	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I heard you comment about how the red line was within the 70 percent confidence bands.	22.0	91.0
201611	2610	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I think this is an important question for any future discussion we might have about including error bands associated with our projections.	22.0	91.0
201611	2611	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	My concern is, it’s so easy to glibly say, “Oh, here’s a path.	22.0	91.0
201611	2612	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	It falls within this band.”	22.0	91.0
201611	2613	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	And whether you say it or not, it leaves the listener with the impression that there’s not really a significant difference between these.	22.0	91.0
201611	2614	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	The validity of the bands, unless you’re doing something different than I’m familiar with, is point by point by point.	22.0	91.0
201611	2615	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	So it’s only for one particular hypothesis that it’s actually correct.	22.0	91.0
201611	2616	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I think, in my experience in doing some of these research tabulations of things that sort of fit within an error band, if you have a composite hypothesis like the average response or the discrepancy over four different periods, the tabulations might well end up being something significantly different  Do you have any comments on that?	22.0	91.0
201611	2617	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	I have no objection to that statement at all.	22.0	999.0
201611	2618	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	I think it is completely right.	22.0	999.0
201611	2619	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	All I wanted to indicate is our limited ability to actually forecast inflation with precision at such a horizon.	22.0	999.0
201611	2620	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Therefore, it’s really a statement about whether can we rule that out.	22.0	999.0
201611	2621	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Right.	22.0	91.0
201611	2622	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I know you’re aware of that, and I think I raise it in part because I don’t know exactly how likely this particular experiment is without additional tabulations.	22.0	91.0
201611	2623	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	But if we’re contemplating providing bands, I think we need to understand the kinds of statements that we could have firmer confidence in and ones in which we are not quite so sure.	22.0	91.0
201611	2624	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22.0	91.0
201611	2625	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	22.0	65.0
201611	2626	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have a question on the last bullet point in the lower-left box.	22.0	102.0
201611	2627	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I just don’t know what the literature tells us about this last bullet point.	22.0	102.0
201611	2628	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is “Rise in longer-term yields could be associated with dollar appreciation.”	22.0	102.0
201611	2629	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do know that there is a literature that says that if inflation is above expectations, that will cause a reassessment in the market of the future path of interest rates, and that usually, even after you work it all through, it will indicate an appreciation of the currency.	22.0	102.0
201611	2630	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think there is some literature on that.	22.0	102.0
201611	2631	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes.	22.0	999.0
201611	2632	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	So that’s a clean example.	22.0	102.0
201611	2633	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	But what you’re doing here is layering on an additional factor, that somehow the term premium today is at an unusually low level, which might, in addition to or as part of this response, move up quite a bit.	22.0	102.0
201611	2634	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	My question is, first of all, what’s the empirical evidence on that?	22.0	102.0
201611	2635	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, second of all, would an increase in the term premium on longer-term yields, like the 10-year yield, due to fears of higher inflation actually cause an appreciation or a depreciation of the dollar?	22.0	102.0
201611	2636	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	That last bit isn’t as obvious to me as it seems to be stated here.	22.0	102.0
201611	2637	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	I have something quick.	22.0	999.0
201611	2638	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	I apologize for creating work for Steve.	22.0	999.0
201611	2639	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s just a factual question.	22.0	102.0
201611	2640	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Why don’t you go first?	22.0	999.0
201611	2641	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Well, let’s put it this way.	22.0	999.0
201611	2642	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	I actually share some of your curiosity about this issue.	22.0	999.0
201611	2643	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	In principle, of course, if you have an increase in yields that reflects an increase in expected interest rates, that should have a standard effect of appreciating the currency  When you have a change in the term premium, I think it’s logical to expect a different effect.	22.0	999.0
201611	2644	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Because that increase in the term premium in some sense reflects people being less happy to hold the asset, you could imagine that that would actually depreciate the currency.	22.0	999.0
201611	2645	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	But, looking at it from the other side, you could also imagine that by reducing the price of the bonds, the increase in the term premium basically encourages some portfolio shift into those assets that again raises the dollar.	22.0	999.0
201611	2646	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	As far as the empirics go, this is actually a topic of active investigation right now, and there are different ways to slice it.	22.0	999.0
201611	2647	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	One approach is to look at the effect of both, let’s say, shorter-term yields and longer-term yields on the dollar, with the assumption that the longer-term yields hold more term premium in them.	22.0	999.0
201611	2648	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	And at least one study finds very mixed results, looking at different actions of central banks.	22.0	999.0
201611	2649	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	It’s all over the map in terms of which of those affects their currency the most.	22.0	999.0
201611	2650	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Another approach that we’ve been taking is to try to use actual term structure models to look at central bank actions and figure out how much of the resultant change in interest rates after these events reflects the changes in expected rates and changes in term premiums.	22.0	999.0
201611	2651	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Some initial results we found for the Federal Reserve suggest that the expected rate part affects the dollar more than the term premium part, but that’s pretty preliminary.	22.0	999.0
201611	2652	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	But I think the bottom line is that both of those do boost the dollar.	22.0	999.0
201611	2653	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	So the term premium seems to go in the same direction as expected rates.	22.0	999.0
201611	2654	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Whether it has more of an effect or less seems to be still a matter of research.	22.0	999.0
201611	2655	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thanks.	22.0	102.0
201611	2656	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s helpful.	22.0	102.0
201611	2657	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	22.0	65.0
201611	2658	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Thomas, you noted that these estimates use the internal measure of labor utilization from Laubach–Williams.	22.0	81.0
201611	2659	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	What is the internal measure of labor utilization—I mean numerically—right now?	22.0	81.0
201611	2660	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes.	22.0	999.0
201611	2661	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	First of all, it’s resource utilization.	22.0	999.0
201611	2662	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	We estimate a GDP gap; we don’t have a granular labor market.	22.0	999.0
201611	2663	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	There’s no unemployment rate, for example, in here.	22.0	999.0
201611	2664	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Right now, the estimate from our model for the output gap stands at about 1½ percent.	22.0	999.0
201611	2665	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	One key thing to understand why the gap stays so flat once you add the SEP forecasts is that the Laubach– Williams estimate of the trend rate of potential GDP growth at this point is about 2¼ percent.	22.0	999.0
201611	2666	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	So that means that if the median SEP forecast comes to pass, in fact, the output gap edges down a little bit.	22.0	999.0
201611	2667	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	It does not rise over the projection period.	22.0	999.0
201611	2668	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	That’s a key part.	22.0	999.0
201611	2669	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	At that level, there is a tension here between this model’s view of the world and the SEP medians’ view of the world.	22.0	999.0
201611	2670	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	So what I would like to focus on is basically just the revision in the r* estimate, because that’s an apples-to-apples comparison.	22.0	999.0
201611	2671	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I guess I was also interested in this broader question about r* estimates and whether placing weight on the Laubach–Williams r* should also cause one to place weight on their estimate of the gap and trend growth.	22.0	81.0
201611	2672	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Is that a corollary?	22.0	81.0
201611	2673	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Obviously, these things are estimated with a fair dose of uncertainty.	22.0	999.0
201611	2674	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	So I think, statistically, it’s quite hard to make a strong deduction about whether the output gap now is zero or 1 percent?	22.0	999.0
201611	2675	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	22.0	81.0
201611	2676	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Thanks.	22.0	81.0
201611	2677	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Are there other questions for Thomas?	22.0	65.0
201611	2678	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	22.0	65.0
201611	2679	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I’ll ask one very basic question.	22.0	110.0
201611	2680	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I could see why higher expected GDP growth would raise the term premium, because higher prospective growth might—to me, would—steepen the yield curve.	22.0	110.0
201611	2681	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	In your work, you’re saying that even higher inflation not accompanied by higher prospective GDP growth might raise the term premium.	22.0	110.0
201611	2682	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	And I just want to hear a little bit more about why you would assert that, as opposed to raising the level of the entire curve.	22.0	110.0
201611	2683	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes.	22.0	999.0
201611	2684	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	One line of logic is suggested by what’s known as consumption- based asset pricing models.	22.0	999.0
201611	2685	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Effectively, you can think about in which circumstances do nominal long-term assets have high payoffs and whether these are circumstances when you value these payoffs most.	22.0	999.0
201611	2686	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	So it’s basically an insurance or hedge property.	22.0	999.0
201611	2687	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	In a time when you are very concerned about negative surprises about inflation, combined potentially with monetary policy becoming constrained again by the effective lower bound in a period of economic weakness, that would depress the term premium because it would raise demand for these assets.	22.0	999.0
201611	2688	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Okay, got it.	22.0	110.0
201611	2689	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	22.0	110.0
201611	2690	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any further questions?	22.0	65.0
201611	2691	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	22.0	65.0
201611	2692	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	22.0	65.0
201611	2693	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we begin our policy round?	23.0	65.0
201611	2694	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	23.0	65.0
201611	2695	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201611	2696	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I would have preferred to move at the September meeting and I would have gladly supported a move at this meeting, I’m willing to support alternative B today.	23.0	90.0
201611	2697	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I am comforted that market expectations and the statement are clearly consistent with moving in December unless incoming data dramatically change our forecast.	23.0	90.0
201611	2698	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Had the statement not been consistent with a high likelihood of moving in December, I would not have been able to support alternative B.	23.0	90.0
201611	2699	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because of the slow pace of increases to date, we have the luxury of waiting for a press conference meeting, because a six-week delay under current conditions is unlikely to be particularly costly.	23.0	90.0
201611	2700	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	No econometric model would argue that moving at the beginning of November rather than the middle of December would make a significant economic difference.	23.0	90.0
201611	2701	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, that does not imply that deferring much beyond this meeting would be without costs.	23.0	90.0
201611	2702	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	At the previous meeting, I suggested that there were potential costs to waiting too long to raise rates, and that moving gradually may be possible only if we do not get too far “behind the curve.”	23.0	90.0
201611	2703	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Furthermore, my modal forecast indicates that we risk plunging past full employment rather than gently probing for the natural rate unless we adopt a higher funds rate path than is currently assumed by the market.	23.0	90.0
201611	2704	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	This, in turn, implies a significant risk that, the longer we delay raising rates, the steeper the federal funds rate path will have to be and the more likely that financial markets will overreact to the surprise relative to their expectations.	23.0	90.0
201611	2705	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Moreover, the further we fall below the natural rate, the higher is the probability that our attempts to get back to full employment will entail a more severe slowdown than we expect.	23.0	90.0
201611	2706	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Such a course for policy may thus be much riskier for the economy than a more gradual path that begins sooner.	23.0	90.0
201611	2707	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201611	2708	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201611	2709	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23.0	65.0
201611	2710	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	102.0
201611	2711	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I favor alternative C.	23.0	102.0
201611	2712	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Economic conditions are ideal for a rate increase.	23.0	102.0
201611	2713	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	The employment and inflation data have been consistent with our forecasts, financial markets are tranquil, and we’re already very close to full employment and on a trajectory to overshoot that mandate.	23.0	102.0
201611	2714	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Both employment and output growth have been well above trend.	23.0	102.0
201611	2715	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Our past decisions to delay tightening have relied on the low pace of inflation, but there are signs that the tide is turning.	23.0	102.0
201611	2716	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	The effects of past dollar appreciation and the drop in oil prices have dissipated.	23.0	102.0
201611	2717	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, energy prices have now turned around and are trending up.	23.0	102.0
201611	2718	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Furthermore, evidence of increased wage pressure is more apparent.	23.0	102.0
201611	2719	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	This suggests that there’s not much more room to run in the labor market.	23.0	102.0
201611	2720	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, several years ago, Chair Yellen compared the state of the economy to a car driving from coast to coast.	23.0	102.0
201611	2721	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	She used metaphors like “We’re about in Kansas now” to convey that, although we’d made a lot of progress, the recovery was far from complete.	23.0	102.0
201611	2722	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of our dual- mandate goals today, the Long Island Sound is now in sight.	23.0	102.0
201611	2723	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	23.0	102.0
201611	2724	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	That contrasts starkly with the stance of policy, for which we seem to have run out of gas somewhere outside of Reno, Nevada.	23.0	102.0
201611	2725	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	The current economic situation favors tightening, and our policy stance has over time built up considerable insurance against unforeseen risks to the downside.	23.0	102.0
201611	2726	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, of course, should we encounter surprises to the downside, those can be offset through normal adjustments in our policy rate.	23.0	102.0
201611	2727	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Given that alternative C is not the decision the Committee is taking today, the language in alternative B does a very good job of acknowledging our progress to date and leaves conditions proximate to warranting renewed policy normalization.	23.0	102.0
201611	2728	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, the last comment I’ll make is, President Kashkari yesterday brought up the issue— and his remarks were partially addressed to me, I felt—of, how can one both be for gradual policy normalization and have a view of very low r* and concerns about our long-run policy framework?	23.0	102.0
201611	2729	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And it’s a question I’ve been asked a lot, so let me just very briefly comment on that.	23.0	102.0
201611	2730	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	First of all, I think President Rosengren laid out the argument just a minute ago—that is, under our current policy framework, which the Committee has agreed on and has reiterated every January, we have a 2 percent inflation objective with a balanced approach to our dual-mandate goals.	23.0	102.0
201611	2731	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s the strategy we’ve agreed to, and the one that we are making decisions on how to execute—whether we should raise rates or not.	23.0	102.0
201611	2732	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	As President Rosengren explained—and I agree 100 percent with what he said—in that context, how do we best achieve what I would think of as sustainable maximum employment?	23.0	102.0
201611	2733	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	If we allow the economy to overshoot full employment by too much for too long, I think that does create greater risks of a reversal through different possible mechanisms, including the one President Rosengren just laid out—that by, in a sense, going for too low of unemployment, we basically undermine the sustainability of the economic expansion to the harm of achieving our maximum-employment and inflation goals.	23.0	102.0
201611	2734	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I agree completely with Chair Yellen’s characterization—that we want to run a moderately hot economy for some time.	23.0	102.0
201611	2735	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	That will help us get inflation back to 2 percent quicker, and that’s consistent with our strategy.	23.0	102.0
201611	2736	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I just worry that if we try to go too far on running a hot economy too hot for too long, it creates some of the risks that President Rosengren laid out.	23.0	102.0
201611	2737	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I just think, in terms of balancing the risks, a gradual path of policy increases makes sense.	23.0	102.0
201611	2738	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do think that we should be having a serious discussion of the strategy, which I think of as different than the tactical or execution decisions we’re making about whether we should raise rates or not?	23.0	102.0
201611	2739	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think we should have that discussion, and we should involve a lot of experts and economists and others in thinking through this over time.	23.0	102.0
201611	2740	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	That discussion should eventually lead to a decision by the Committee and to a communication of that decision.	23.0	102.0
201611	2741	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Then that might imply different policy decisions in the future.	23.0	102.0
201611	2742	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	But until that discussion has happened and until whatever decisions come out of it, I think it’s important for us to execute on the policy strategy we have laid out.	23.0	102.0
201611	2743	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t think, through our tactical decisions about whether to raise rates in December or not or in September or not, we’re really addressing at all these longer-run issues that I’m raising.	23.0	102.0
201611	2744	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I mean, I don’t think those are really related to that.	23.0	102.0
201611	2745	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	The longer-run issues are, to me, not just about raising rates or not.	23.0	102.0
201611	2746	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	They’re really more about thinking about what our strategy is and how we communicate that strategy, and then from that follows the actual policy decision.	23.0	102.0
201611	2747	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23.0	102.0
201611	2748	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201611	2749	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23.0	65.0
201611	2750	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201611	2751	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think it makes sense to change the interest rate this month.	23.0	108.0
201611	2752	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	There’s such a great deal of uncertainty about future nonmonetary economic policies.	23.0	108.0
201611	2753	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	That degree of uncertainty will probably, but not certainly, be reduced by the time of our next meeting, and we should therefore not change the interest rate at this meeting.	23.0	108.0
201611	2754	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Our Committee has been extremely cautious about raising the federal funds rate during the period since 2009.	23.0	108.0
201611	2755	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	That’s an understatement.	23.0	108.0
201611	2756	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Two arguments have carried the day.	23.0	108.0
201611	2757	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The first is that we should not raise the rate, because we could soon be forced to reduce it and return to the effective lower bound, thereby suffering a loss of credibility.	23.0	108.0
201611	2758	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The second is that there’s very little difference between making the decision at this FOMC meeting and making it at a subsequent meeting.	23.0	108.0
201611	2759	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	With regard to the credibility loss of having to return to the ELB, we need to weigh the expectation of that possible loss against the potential credibility loss of hesitating too long.	23.0	108.0
201611	2760	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The argument I’ve made is liable to be countered by the statement that it’s only because we kept the interest rate so low for so long that the US economy has performed so well since 2009.	23.0	108.0
201611	2761	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I do not disagree with that point, except at the margins.	23.0	108.0
201611	2762	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	It remains to be shown that the performance of the economy would have been significantly worse with an interest rate path that was now 50 or so basis points above the path that actually obtained—and thus 50 basis points or two interest rate decisions further away from the ELB.	23.0	108.0
201611	2763	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We need to consider the possibility that our superlow interest rates have encouraged financial transactions, particularly mergers and acquisitions and stock buybacks, as much as they have encouraged physical investment.	23.0	108.0
201611	2764	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We have been sending a message that says the US economy still requires the support of superlow interest rates to keep itself growing, even at the moderate 2 percent rate to which we’ve gradually become accustomed.	23.0	108.0
201611	2765	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I do not believe that to be the case, for, as I argued yesterday, the recovery of employment has been powerful, and I should have added that it’s been robust.	23.0	108.0
201611	2766	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I do not believe that maintaining the federal funds rate so close to the ELB for so long sends the right message to potential investors and others facing intertemporal decisions in the economy.	23.0	108.0
201611	2767	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And I do believe we should very soon take the second step on our gradual path away from the ELB and toward normalization.	23.0	108.0
201611	2768	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Finally, as we look to our December decision, we will be navigating treacherous waters.	23.0	108.0
201611	2769	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	When we make our decision in December, we should be looking ahead and choosing an interest rate that reflects our expectations of future economic policies and of the future state of the economy.	23.0	108.0
201611	2770	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Those expectations will and should reflect our expectations of the nonmonetary economic policies that will be followed in 2017 and later.	23.0	108.0
201611	2771	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Are we, therefore, going to be making decisions that reflect our political preferences?	23.0	108.0
201611	2772	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Absolutely not.	23.0	108.0
201611	2773	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	As the Chair has emphasized, we will be making decisions that the Committee believes, on the basis of its professional judgments, are in the best interests of the United States.	23.0	108.0
201611	2774	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I’m confident we’ll continue to follow that principle, as is both our legal obligation and our standard practice.	23.0	108.0
201611	2775	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	23.0	108.0
201611	2776	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201611	2777	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23.0	65.0
201611	2778	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201611	2779	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	My medium-run outlook is unchanged since our September meeting, and I continue to support alternative C, on the basis of realized and projected progress on our dual-mandate goals.	23.0	999.0
201611	2780	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Labor market conditions continue to strengthen, the unemployment rate is at its longer- run level, and labor force participation is at or above trend.	23.0	999.0
201611	2781	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The economy is essentially at full employment from the standpoint of what can be achieved using monetary policy.	23.0	999.0
201611	2782	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The unemployment rate is projected to fall below its longer-run level over the next two years, suggesting that the labor market will continue to strengthen.	23.0	999.0
201611	2783	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Inflation is moving up, and we’re close to our goal.	23.0	999.0
201611	2784	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The risks to the outlook are basically balanced, but they won’t remain that way if we fail to remember a lesson from history—that policy should be forward looking.	23.0	999.0
201611	2785	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Various forecasts, optimal control exercises, and our own statements indicate that, to promote our longer-run policy goals, it’s appropriate that we gradually increase the federal funds rate from its current low level.	23.0	999.0
201611	2786	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The path anticipated is quite gradual.	23.0	999.0
201611	2787	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	This will allow monetary policy to remain accommodative for some time to come, lending support to the economic expansion in the period ahead, allowing u to fall below u*, and allowing the Committee to calibrate policy better over time as it learns more about the underlying structural aspects of the economy.	23.0	999.0
201611	2788	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I’d be concerned if we started to change our strategy to try to run the economy too hot in an attempt to drive the unemployment rate well below our current estimates of the longer-run rate as a prudent course of action.	23.0	999.0
201611	2789	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	In the 1960s and 1970s, when this was tried, it resulted in poor economic outcomes.	23.0	999.0
201611	2790	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	While there are many differences between today’s economy and the economy back then, I don’t think we should ignore historical episodes that illustrate the risks of trying to use monetary policy to change structural aspects of the economy.	23.0	999.0
201611	2791	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	But if we were going to attempt the “hot economy strategy,” then it would behoove us to change our communications.	23.0	999.0
201611	2792	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Such a strategy is inconsistent with a gradual upward path in interest rates.	23.0	999.0
201611	2793	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	It would more likely entail a much steeper path once rates began to rise.	23.0	999.0
201611	2794	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	So in assessing the costs and benefits of our policy actions, I believe it’s appropriate today to take the next step on the gradual policy rate path we have been communicating is the appropriate one.	23.0	999.0
201611	2795	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I realize that I will likely be in the minority today, and that alternative B will win the day.	23.0	999.0
201611	2796	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	But I anticipate the Committee will take action in December unless economic conditions come in considerably different than expected.	23.0	999.0
201611	2797	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I believe the language proposed in alternative B is consistent with that anticipated action.	23.0	999.0
201611	2798	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	But at the same time, the language doesn’t pre-commit the Committee to action should the economy evolve in a way that significantly changes our medium-run outlook.	23.0	999.0
201611	2799	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201611	2800	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201611	2801	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23.0	65.0
201611	2802	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201611	2803	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I’ll vote for alternative B, although the language, particularly as understood in the context of the Chair’s remarks yesterday and what Governor Fischer and Presidents Mester, Rosengren, and Williamshave already said, reflects a higher probability of a rate increase in December than I think likely reflects my own probability of favoring such a move at that time.	23.0	97.0
201611	2804	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	As I intimated yesterday, my own probability is certainly higher than it has been over the course of most of this year, but it’s still not at 70 percent.	23.0	97.0
201611	2805	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I’d like to add a couple of remarks to what I said yesterday.	23.0	97.0
201611	2806	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	First, I want to reiterate my own conclusion, based on having listened to many of you over the course of several meetings and tried to do some of my own work with the help of the staff here, that I don’t think there’s a particularly compelling case to be cited by either side from history regarding why one has to move now or why it would be okay to wait.	23.0	97.0
201611	2807	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I think, actually, the circumstances are different enough today from what they have been in the past that both sides have something they can cite.	23.0	97.0
201611	2808	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But in the end, this is, as I said yesterday, more an intuition than anything else.	23.0	97.0
201611	2809	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	It’s an informed intuition, but it still is, I think, an intuition.	23.0	97.0
201611	2810	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Second, yesterday I concentrated on my own search for tangible indicators that the economy was moving to the point at which circumstances arguably called for an increase in the federal funds rate.	23.0	97.0
201611	2811	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I didn’t put as much emphasis on the other consideration I mentioned, which is the balance of risks with respect to adverse outcomes conditional on the path that we eventually take.	23.0	97.0
201611	2812	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And, as everyone knows, I and others have been concerned with the so-called asymmetric toolbox—or the range of instruments—we have to respond should the economy underperform or fall into recession over the near to medium term, as opposed to whether it might run a little bit hotter than anticipated.	23.0	97.0
201611	2813	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I have to say that yesterday’s conversation on the implementation framework, which I thought took a welcome diversion to thinking in more general terms about monetary policy, reinforced for me the absence of anything approaching a viable consensus on an efficacious response that we would have if the economy slipped into a recession because of some exogenous shock in the near to medium term.	23.0	97.0
201611	2814	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	With the yield curve relatively flat now, it seems as though the utility of an additional LSAP would be quite limited—except perhaps in a very substantial amount, which I’m sure would elicit some concerns for other reasons among members of the Committee.	23.0	97.0
201611	2815	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I heard yesterday among numerous members of the Committee an aversion to the use of negative rates, the reasons for which I can understand.	23.0	97.0
201611	2816	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But I was left thinking that we really are not particularly well suited to respond should there be—unexpectedly—a recession.	23.0	97.0
201611	2817	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And as Eric indicated yesterday, if you just go out a couple of years, the risks of a recession are nontrivial.	23.0	97.0
201611	2818	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	So that’s still influencing my thinking as well.	23.0	97.0
201611	2819	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Having said that, alternative A doesn’t quite capture my views, either.	23.0	97.0
201611	2820	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And I’m not going to propose any changes to the language of alternative B that would make it more compatible with my views, because I’ve already heard enough and I know where everybody else is.	23.0	97.0
201611	2821	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201611	2822	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23.0	65.0
201611	2823	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201611	2824	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Our newer presidents—Harker, Kashkari, and Kaplan—may not be aware that we each have a cumulative word quota for our time on the FOMC.	23.0	88.0
201611	2825	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	And my balance is running low, so I support alternative B and the statement as it stands.	23.0	88.0
201611	2826	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201611	2827	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	[Laughter]	23.0	88.0
201611	2828	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Wow.	23.0	65.0
201611	2829	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23.0	65.0
201611	2830	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201611	2831	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I support alternative B for today.	23.0	94.0
201611	2832	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	In my view, our normalization program is not proceeding as planned.	23.0	94.0
201611	2833	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	One rate increase per year and no change in the balance sheet is not meaningful in the macroeconomic sense.	23.0	94.0
201611	2834	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I think it’s becoming increasingly apparent that we should de-emphasize the idea of normalization as we go forward.	23.0	94.0
201611	2835	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	My basic recommendation is that we should plan to go ahead with a rate increase at the December meeting.	23.0	94.0
201611	2836	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I think that’s necessary at this point to maintain credibility.	23.0	94.0
201611	2837	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	But I think we should accompany that move with language that further moves in 2017 are not anticipated, and that the next move is as likely to be a decrease in the policy rate as it is to be an increase in the policy rate.	23.0	94.0
201611	2838	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	So let me turn to what I see as the problem with our normalization rhetoric.	23.0	94.0
201611	2839	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Policy is mostly about the intended path of policy and not the level of the policy rate today.	23.0	94.0
201611	2840	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Our rhetoric is that we are on the cusp of a 200 basis point or more move upward in the policy rate.	23.0	94.0
201611	2841	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Our forecast is for economic growth near 2 percent over the forecast horizon.	23.0	94.0
201611	2842	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	In my opinion, this is not meaningfully different from trend, in view of the degree of precision with which we can measure the trend.	23.0	94.0
201611	2843	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Our forecast is also for unemployment near the Committee’s estimate of its longer-run value, and inflation forecasts are generally centered on the Committee’s inflation target.	23.0	94.0
201611	2844	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	The general contours of this forecast are very similar whether one is looking at the Tealbook, the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis Fed forecast, or private-sector forecasts.	23.0	94.0
201611	2845	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	What is different about private-sector expectations is the policy rate path, which is very flat in the private-sector view in order to achieve the same forecast outcomes.	23.0	94.0
201611	2846	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	So let’s take the private-sector perspective for just a moment.	23.0	94.0
201611	2847	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	From that perspective, it looks like any surprise in the form of faster output growth, lower-than-expected unemployment, or higher-than-expected inflation will be seen by this Committee as a reason to embark more rapidly on a 200 basis point normalization program.	23.0	94.0
201611	2848	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	From the private-sector perspective, this would be inappropriate.	23.0	94.0
201611	2849	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	This is like holding a hammer over the economy, as deviations from our forecast expectations will be met very aggressively in the private-sector perception.	23.0	94.0
201611	2850	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I think that this is the wrong approach.	23.0	94.0
201611	2851	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	With the type of forecast that we currently have and the type of private-sector expectations that we can measure, I think we would do much better to characterize current policy settings as approximately correct, in light of the current state of the economy and its expected trajectory.	23.0	94.0
201611	2852	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	To conclude, I would say, go ahead for December, but use that moment to realign expectations for 2017 and beyond.	23.0	94.0
201611	2853	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	In particular, use the December opportunity to get rid of the perception that we are on the precipice of a major policy rate move.	23.0	94.0
201611	2854	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I just don’t think that that’s an accurate description of the Committee’s intentions.	23.0	94.0
201611	2855	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201611	2856	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201611	2857	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	23.0	65.0
201611	2858	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201611	2859	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I do believe we’re at the point at which it is appropriate to remove some amount of accommodation.	23.0	110.0
201611	2860	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I would support doing this, if not today, then very soon.	23.0	110.0
201611	2861	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I recommend this in the context of believing that the path of rates over the next few years ought to be very shallow, and the terminal rate is likely to be much lower than we’ve historically experienced.	23.0	110.0
201611	2862	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I believe, therefore, that further removals of accommodation should be done very gradually, with an appropriate amount of patience and caution.	23.0	110.0
201611	2863	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I also believe that in the absence of other economic policies, such as infrastructure spending, fiscal policy, and other structural reforms, prospective GDP growth is going to be very sluggish.	23.0	110.0
201611	2864	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	This is due to persistent secular headwinds I discussed yesterday that do not appear to be abating.	23.0	110.0
201611	2865	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	All of this means to me that we can afford to be patient regarding further removals of accommodation.	23.0	110.0
201611	2866	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	However, I do believe some amount of removal would be healthy in light of building imbalances I see in terms of the effects on savers as well as the distortions regarding asset allocation and other business decisions.	23.0	110.0
201611	2867	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	These imbalances may not only be difficult to ultimately unwind but also have some behavioral effects that, if allowed to persist, could undermine future sustainable economic growth.	23.0	110.0
201611	2868	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201611	2869	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201611	2870	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	23.0	65.0
201611	2871	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201611	2872	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Reflecting my view that there remains little to no slack in the labor market and my fairly upbeat outlook for the economy, as well as the persistent gradual progress of inflation moving close to target, I remain committed to the need for a rate hike this year.	23.0	999.0
201611	2873	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Benchmark interest rate rules indicate we are getting behind the historical norm for our interest rate setting.	23.0	999.0
201611	2874	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	The staff’s projection of how policy will proceed over the forecast horizon is in line with my own, and, adhering to that, very gradual removal of accommodation needs to begin this year.	23.0	999.0
201611	2875	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	I also share some of President Rosengren’s concerns that our overly accommodative policy may be creating some financial stability concerns.	23.0	999.0
201611	2876	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	At this juncture, I tried to ask myself what it would take not to move by year’s end, and I could come up with only some extreme events that are very unlikely.	23.0	999.0
201611	2877	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	In view of the timing of this meeting, we should probably wait until December, but it is essential that we communicate that not moving in December would take a rather severe deterioration in our economic outlook.	23.0	999.0
201611	2878	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	My reading of alternative B is that it comes close to doing that.	23.0	999.0
201611	2879	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	So I can support alternative B at this time.	23.0	999.0
201611	2880	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	The signal we are sending will, in itself, start the process and will achieve some measure of tightening in financial markets.	23.0	999.0
201611	2881	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	So, Brian, please deduct 220 words from my word “Lockhart”	23.0	999.0
201611	2882	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	—I mean, lockbox.	23.0	999.0
201611	2883	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	[Laughter]	23.0	999.0
201611	2884	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201611	2885	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23.0	65.0
201611	2886	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201611	2887	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I support alternative B.	23.0	91.0
201611	2888	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I do not think a move today is appropriate.	23.0	91.0
201611	2889	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	As I noted yesterday, I think we have to keep an eye out to make sure that the recent softer tone in private domestic final purchases is just part of the typical ebb and flow in the data that we see in an economy growing modestly above trend.	23.0	91.0
201611	2890	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I believe this is the case.	23.0	91.0
201611	2891	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	With regard to price stability, core PCE inflation has improved somewhat over the past couple of rounds.	23.0	91.0
201611	2892	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I’m pleased to see that the 12-month change has made it up to 1.7 percent for two months in a row.	23.0	91.0
201611	2893	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	But, as Governor Fischer said yesterday in a different context, “Good.	23.0	91.0
201611	2894	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Nice job.	23.0	91.0
201611	2895	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	But now is not the time for complacency.”	23.0	91.0
201611	2896	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I remain concerned about inflation expectations.	23.0	91.0
201611	2897	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Core inflation has risen 0.3 percentage point since the turn of the year, and total PCE inflation is up about ¾ percentage point.	23.0	91.0
201611	2898	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	But instead of firming, household inflation expectations have fallen to new lows, and, even with the slight pickup since our September meeting, TIPS breakevens are still down a touch, 10 basis points, since late last year.	23.0	91.0
201611	2899	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Furthermore, futures markets continue to indicate that investors are clearly much more concerned about low-inflation outcomes than they are about above-target inflation.	23.0	91.0
201611	2900	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	This lack of improvement in expected inflation weighs heavily on my assessment of appropriate policy.	23.0	91.0
201611	2901	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	In my opinion, unless core inflation overshoots 2 percent by some amount in this cycle, I don’t believe the Board’s inflation attractor will get back to 2 percent.	23.0	91.0
201611	2902	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	And I view that perspective as in line with the long-run strategy that overshooting is consistent with a symmetric inflation objective and trying to get inflation expectations up to 2 percent.	23.0	91.0
201611	2903	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	If our primary policy objective now is to get core inflation back to 2 percent sooner rather than later after so many years of undershooting, I would not advocate a December rate hike.	23.0	91.0
201611	2904	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	But the Committee has pretty firmly signaled that a hike is important, relying on inflation confidence.	23.0	91.0
201611	2905	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Our communications have been pointing fairly forcefully to a rate increase sometime this year, unless there was a clear softening in economic activity.	23.0	91.0
201611	2906	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	In light of this virtual commitment, if economic conditions remain as they are today, the communications and credibility risks of not moving in December would be significant without a very different policy statement and plan.	23.0	91.0
201611	2907	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Hence, I can support the changes in paragraph 3 language that will further validate market expectations for a rate increase in December unless the data strongly object.	23.0	91.0
201611	2908	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	What about beyond December?	23.0	91.0
201611	2909	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	My last SEP submission had three rate increases between now and the end of 2017.	23.0	91.0
201611	2910	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	For me, I feel that we should not get ahead of this pace unless we see a marked improvement in the data, particularly in the factors underlying our inflation outlook, and I agree with President Bullard’s viewpoints on that for characterizing 2017.	23.0	91.0
201611	2911	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I found it useful in my public speaking to communicate about inflation through the lens of the canonical model the Chair spelled out in her Amherst speech last year.	23.0	91.0
201611	2912	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Basically, the model’s inflation determinants are inertia, slack, transitory factors, and inflation expectations.	23.0	91.0
201611	2913	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I find this breakdown helpful for explaining the overall inflation outlook and how this outlook motivates the rationale for my appropriate policy rate path.	23.0	91.0
201611	2914	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I think this taxonomy also could be a useful tool for the Committee to use to describe more explicitly the economic conditionality governing our moves after December.	23.0	91.0
201611	2915	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Our communications should reinforce that future rate increases will depend on the weight of these factors pointing to attainment of our 2 percent objective sustainably, symmetrically, and sooner rather than later.	23.0	91.0
201611	2916	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	We should be able to point to data-based signs of improvements in these indicators when we actually do raise rates in 2017, assuming the data are willing.	23.0	91.0
201611	2917	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201611	2918	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201611	2919	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23.0	65.0
201611	2920	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	81.0
201611	2921	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	At our September meeting, I argued that the data since the beginning of the year had essentially met our expectations as expressed in the December SEP.	23.0	81.0
201611	2922	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	If anything, the real output and productivity data surprised a bit on the low side, and the inflation data have surprised repeatedly on the high side.	23.0	81.0
201611	2923	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Intermeeting events caused us to delay the rate increases that the December SEP had envisioned for this year in order to wait for additional data to confirm that these events would have no material effect on the economy.	23.0	81.0
201611	2924	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Fortunately, they have not, and the data since the September meeting have just strengthened the case for a rate increase.	23.0	81.0
201611	2925	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Some Committee members have argued that the data came close to confirming our December projections precisely because we delayed rate increases and pulled down the expected policy rate path.	23.0	81.0
201611	2926	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I don’t find this convincing, however, because the timing isn’t consistent with the conventional views about the lags in the effects of monetary policy.	23.0	81.0
201611	2927	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Looking forward to our next meeting, I agree with you, Madam Chair, that some weakness in the upcoming economic data should not stay our hand.	23.0	81.0
201611	2928	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	This is especially true when we are in the process of converging to a path with lower trend productivity and employment growth.	23.0	81.0
201611	2929	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The relevant question is whether incoming data are inconsistent with fluctuations around such a lower trend growth path.	23.0	81.0
201611	2930	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	As I pointed out yesterday, for example, a payroll employment number as low as 60,000 is compatible with constant unemployment and labor force participation rates.	23.0	81.0
201611	2931	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	And, obviously, fluctuations within a typical range surrounding such a path would not be inconsistent, either.	23.0	81.0
201611	2932	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	As a consequence, it should take an exceptionally dismal data flow for us to delay raising rates yet again.	23.0	81.0
201611	2933	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	23.0	81.0
201611	2934	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201611	2935	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23.0	65.0
201611	2936	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	103.0
201611	2937	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	I support alternative C, as I view an increase in the federal funds rate as having been appropriate for some time.	23.0	103.0
201611	2938	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Core PCE inflation is now running at 1.7 percent year over year, and we’re moving past the window when the decline in energy prices has held down headline, as the annualized six-month change in headline PCE inflation is now 2.1 percent.	23.0	103.0
201611	2939	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, labor utilization has increased this year, leaving the labor market near full employment.	23.0	103.0
201611	2940	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Accommodative monetary policy certainly supported achieving these objectives, but leaving the funds rate at its current level raises concerns.	23.0	103.0
201611	2941	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Without gradual adjustment, it seems we risk returning to “go-stop” types of policies that can create volatility rather than subdue it.	23.0	103.0
201611	2942	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Monetary policy has also, perhaps arguably, become more accommodative this year.	23.0	103.0
201611	2943	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	The funds rate has not changed, but we’ve signaled a shallower path of the funds rate and a lower terminal rate, this in the context of roughly full employment and inflation near 2 percent.	23.0	103.0
201611	2944	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, the real rate remains well below measures of the equilibrium real rate.	23.0	103.0
201611	2945	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Even with some adjustment to the level of accommodation, I expect to see labor utilization rise above its neutral level, which history shows can end poorly.	23.0	103.0
201611	2946	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	I accept as reasonable the arguments that current conditions are different than those of the past.	23.0	103.0
201611	2947	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	But this approach sits uneasily with me and, I think, with our statutory objective of effectively promoting maximum employment commensurate with the economy’s longer-run potential to increase production.	23.0	103.0
201611	2948	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Bringing more people into the labor force and having stronger attachment is, of course, a desirable feature of a tighter labor market, but I question its long-run benefit.	23.0	103.0
201611	2949	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Research by Christina Romer and David Romer published in a 1998 Jackson Hole conference volume argues that the cyclical effects of monetary policy on unemployment are inherently temporary.	23.0	103.0
201611	2950	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	They conclude that compassionate monetary policy is simply sound monetary policy, policy that aims to keep inflation stable and minimizes output fluctuations.	23.0	103.0
201611	2951	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	The possible benefits of continuing to let the economy heat up in terms of reversing past supply-side damage are highly uncertain.	23.0	103.0
201611	2952	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Research by my staff has examined the effects of expansionary monetary policy on indicators of the economy’s productive capacity in the pre- crisis period.	23.0	103.0
201611	2953	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Their findings indicate that after a period of expansionary monetary policy, labor productivity tends to rise because of an increase in capital and labor utilization, but it does not have benefits in terms of capital deepening or TFP.	23.0	103.0
201611	2954	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	The implication is that the effects are transitory and are consistent with the idea that monetary policy cannot affect the longer-run growth potential of the economy.	23.0	103.0
201611	2955	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Overall, as the economy strengthens, I see growing risk associated with a wait-and-see approach and a stronger case for continuing to normalize policy.	23.0	103.0
201611	2956	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	23.0	103.0
201611	2957	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201611	2958	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23.0	65.0
201611	2959	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201611	2960	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Today I will support alternative B as written.	23.0	104.0
201611	2961	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	In my view, it is fair to say that the economy is not so far from full employment and is making reasonable progress toward 2 percent inflation.	23.0	104.0
201611	2962	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Nonetheless, other features of the landscape have also weighed in my thinking, including uncertainty about the natural rate of unemployment, the presence of pockets of slack in the labor market, inflation running persistently below target for a long time, inflation expectations at low levels, a weak and threatening global economy, a dollar highly sensitive to expectations about US policy, and a constrained scope for further easing at the effective lower bound.	23.0	104.0
201611	2963	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	So, with all of that background, the Committee’s patient approach has, in my view, been the right one, and that patience has paid dividends and continues to do so.	23.0	104.0
201611	2964	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	There has seemed to me to be little risk of falling “behind the curve” and plenty of reason to move cautiously.	23.0	104.0
201611	2965	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	To say it differently, I’ve seen the risks for policy as clearly one-sided.	23.0	104.0
201611	2966	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	But, as the economic outlook continues to slowly improve, the risks facing monetary policy are also gradually shifting.	23.0	104.0
201611	2967	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Today, with job growth continuing at a healthy pace, pockets of slack being gradually used up, and positive news on inflation, I think the risks are beginning to become more two-sided.	23.0	104.0
201611	2968	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	For example, if measured labor force participation ticks down again, then the unemployment rate could quickly fall well below 5 percent, suggesting less “room to run.”	23.0	104.0
201611	2969	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	And the volatility in labor force participation measurement this year and over the years suggests that current measurements could be transitorily high.	23.0	104.0
201611	2970	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Time will tell.	23.0	104.0
201611	2971	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	On inflation, I expect to see inflation move gradually up to 2 percent in the near term, and I see some risk that both headline and core could move up faster than expected.	23.0	104.0
201611	2972	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The recent rise in inflation compensation and flows into TIPS suggests that some investors are coming to the same conclusion.	23.0	104.0
201611	2973	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Of course, inflation has run below target for so long that it shouldn’t be unwelcome for it to run a bit above target for a time.	23.0	104.0
201611	2974	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I am no longer inclined to put, in effect, zero weight on the possibility that upside surprises in inflation and unemployment could require a more aggressive response and put the recovery at risk.	23.0	104.0
201611	2975	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	To me, that means that if the economy continues on its long path of output growth modestly above trend, a tightening labor market, and progress toward 2 percent inflation, I would gradually raise the federal funds rate along the lines of the September SEP.	23.0	104.0
201611	2976	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	And for that reason, I see it as probably appropriate to move in December if the economy performs roughly in line with expectations and there are no materially negative developments here or abroad.	23.0	104.0
201611	2977	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Thank you.	23.0	104.0
201611	2978	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201611	2979	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	23.0	65.0
201611	2980	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	111.0
201611	2981	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I support alternative B.	23.0	111.0
201611	2982	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	As we talked about yesterday, the recent uptick in inflation and inflation expectations, at least market-based ones, makes me more comfortable about the possibility of raising rates in December.	23.0	111.0
201611	2983	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Looking forward, I think we need to remain very open to the possibility that labor force participation might continue to rise, and we might, therefore, see continued strong job growth in the context of stable unemployment and subdued inflation.	23.0	111.0
201611	2984	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Taking into account our dual mandate, this offers a strong case for moving cautiously with rate increases.	23.0	111.0
201611	2985	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	In September, I talked about three metrics that I was looking at:  one, a sustained upward movement in core PCE—we’ve seen an uptick; two, rising inflation expectations—we’ve seen an uptick; or, three, a significant decline in the headline unemployment rate.	23.0	111.0
201611	2986	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I still feel like those are the right three measures for me to have some confidence that this labor force participation story either is continuing or has run its course.	23.0	111.0
201611	2987	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	So, for me to support a move in December, I’m going to want to see continued evidence along those three measurements to understand where that story is and how much more it has to run.	23.0	111.0
201611	2988	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Let me just thank President Williams for responding to my question from yesterday.	23.0	111.0
201611	2989	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	One of the reasons I like to go late is that it gives me a chance to respond and it makes it harder for the other person to respond to my response.	23.0	111.0
201611	2990	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	[Laughter]	23.0	111.0
201611	2991	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	You can have a two-hander.	23.0	65.0
201611	2992	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Yes, unless you go for a two-hander, which I understand and which is a stronger intervention.	23.0	111.0
201611	2993	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	But I understand the point you made—that there’s a short-term consideration, and then there’s a longer-term question of what framework we’re operating under.	23.0	111.0
201611	2994	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I just feel like now is a curious time.	23.0	111.0
201611	2995	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	If we were at the effective lower bound and there was consensus on the Committee that we were going to be at zero or near zero for the foreseeable future, and we’re looking for new ways of achieving accommodation, I could understand exploring a different inflation target or a different regime, like nominal GDP targeting.	23.0	111.0
201611	2996	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Or if we were well off the lower bound, in a more normal economic environment, I could understand raising the question “What’s the best long-term operating framework for this Committee or for future Committees?”	23.0	111.0
201611	2997	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	But I feel like it’s a curious time, when we’re debating whether now is the time to start raising the funds rate, to then say, “Well, maybe we should also be raising the inflation target or changing to a nominal GDP target.”	23.0	111.0
201611	2998	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I just see those two things as in conflict, but I understand conceptually that they are separate questions, so thank you for responding to my question.	23.0	111.0
201611	2999	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201611	3000	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23.0	65.0
201611	3001	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201611	3002	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Since the September meeting, we’ve received welcome indications of a continued improvement in labor market participation, as well as some progress on inflation and inflation expectations after a long period of troubling weakness on both.	23.0	107.0
201611	3003	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	These developments lead me to believe that our prudent risk-management approach has served us well this year, supporting continued gradual gains in employment and progress on inflation while helping to navigate a number of material risks.	23.0	107.0
201611	3004	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Looking ahead, in view of the signs that there may be scope for further improvement in the labor market; the fact that inflation continues to run persistently below our target, which is symmetric; the weakness in the PDFP components of spending data; and the presence of several important adverse medium-term risks coming from abroad, I believe it’s prudent to wait for more evidence that we are near full employment and that inflation is going to be sustainably at our 2 percent target.	23.0	107.0
201611	3005	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In the weeks ahead, we’ll have several important pieces of data in hand that will help with that assessment.	23.0	107.0
201611	3006	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Conversely, I’ve listened carefully, but I would be hard-pressed to identify convincing evidence that the economy is currently running hot.	23.0	107.0
201611	3007	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	When the Committee decides it is appropriate to take a step in removing policy accommodation, it will be important to emphasize, again, that the rate path forward is likely to remain gradual and shallow due to several key features of the post-crisis new normal.	23.0	107.0
201611	3008	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	A combination of a neutral rate that looks to remain persistently low, the elevated sensitivity of the exchange rate to any perceived divergence in US and foreign economic conditions, and somewhat greater room to run in the post-crisis labor market than had been anticipated suggests the amount of accommodation to be removed is likely to be relatively modest.	23.0	107.0
201611	3009	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	I continue to be very concerned about the asymmetry in our ability to respond using conventional tools to counter shortfalls in demand relative to unexpectedly strong demand.	23.0	107.0
201611	3010	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	This also suggests the value of removing that accommodation at a gradual pace.	23.0	107.0
201611	3011	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	As we look forward to a time when something akin to alternative C will be appropriate, I want to highlight two areas for consideration.	23.0	107.0
201611	3012	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	First, as risk events emanating from Europe just since our September meeting remind us, we should be very cautious about characterizing risks to the outlook as balanced.	23.0	107.0
201611	3013	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Risks arising from developments abroad unquestionably remain tilted to the downside, and we’ve seen repeatedly over the past two years that global developments can importantly affect US financial conditions and the outlook.	23.0	107.0
201611	3014	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	As we’ve seen in Europe and Japan, proximity to the effective lower bound imposes important constraints on monetary policy, limiting its ability to offset adverse demand shocks.	23.0	107.0
201611	3015	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	So if we were to go further and characterize risks as fully balanced, as in the current alternative C, I believe we might be perceived as not adequately sensitive to important features of the current economic environment.	23.0	107.0
201611	3016	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, we haven’t altered the language in paragraph 4 since December 2015.	23.0	107.0
201611	3017	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In the meantime, the Committee has significantly lowered its estimate of the longer-run neutral funds rate.	23.0	107.0
201611	3018	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In December 2015, when the sentences describing the future path were last modified, the median longer-run rate in the SEP was 3.5 percent.	23.0	107.0
201611	3019	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	It is currently nearly ¾ percentage point lower.	23.0	107.0
201611	3020	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, I believe it would be helpful to update paragraph 4 in alternative C to reference the lower projected level of the longer-run funds rate, reinforcing the message that interest rates are likely to rise only gradually and to a level likely well below previous norms.	23.0	107.0
201611	3021	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201611	3022	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201611	3023	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23.0	65.0
201611	3024	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201611	3025	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B as written.	23.0	96.0
201611	3026	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I wanted the statement to suggest that we now have greater confidence about reaching our inflation objective, and I think we’ve accomplished that by the changes in the language in paragraph 3.	23.0	96.0
201611	3027	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that will be useful in reinforcing the notion that a December rate hike, barring some unforeseen change in the outlook, is likely.	23.0	96.0
201611	3028	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	At this juncture, I don’t view a December rate hike as particularly risky in terms of provoking a sharp tightening in financial conditions, such as what happened in January this year, which followed our first rate hike last December.	23.0	96.0
201611	3029	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	First, I don’t think the market turbulence we had early this year was mainly attributable to that rate hike.	23.0	96.0
201611	3030	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	But, second, and more important, unlike a year ago, market participants should now better recognize that we’re not on a tightening campaign similar to what occurred during the period from 2004 to 2006.	23.0	96.0
201611	3031	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The median forecast last December was for four rate hikes in 2016—we may get one, and the forward curve is very flat.	23.0	96.0
201611	3032	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The probability of tightening in December, based on January federal funds rate futures, has climbed to about 70 percent right now.	23.0	96.0
201611	3033	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	That has not unnerved market participants.	23.0	96.0
201611	3034	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I find it hard to imagine that the last 30 percent of the probability, should we move, would have an outside effect in financial market conditions.	23.0	96.0
201611	3035	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think that we can do this without great fear that this is going to provoke an outsized market reaction.	23.0	96.0
201611	3036	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201611	3037	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23.0	65.0
201611	3038	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much for a good discussion of the policy move for today.	24.0	65.0
201611	3039	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And we did solicit suggestions concerning alternative C, thinking that if we do move in December, it might be a draft.	24.0	65.0
201611	3040	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I’ve heard some further suggestions, and I would just say, as we come closer to December, that if things seem to be proceeding in a direction of a move and others have thoughts about what would be valuable to see in alternative C, I would really encourage you to contact us with ideas you may have.	24.0	65.0
201611	3041	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	For now, I’d like to put up alternative B for a vote, with the language unchanged.	24.0	65.0
201611	3042	2016-11-02	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	24.0	999.0
201611	3043	2016-11-02	meeting	MADIGAN	As you indicated, this vote will be on the draft statement for alternative B, as included on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas Laubach’s briefing materials.	24.0	999.0
201611	3044	2016-11-02	meeting	MADIGAN	It will also be on the directive to the Desk as included in the implementation note on page 10 of those briefing materials.	24.0	999.0
201611	3045	2016-11-02	meeting	MADIGAN	Chair Yellen Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Brainard Yes President Bullard Yes Governor Fischer Yes President George No President Mester No Governor Powell Yes President Rosengren Yes Governor Tarullo Yes .	24.0	999.0
201611	3046	2016-11-02	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you.	24.0	999.0
201611	3047	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	24.0	65.0
201611	3048	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, everybody.	24.0	65.0
201611	3049	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	It’s still incredibly early.	52.0	65.0
201611	3050	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Hey, lunch is ready.	52.0	97.0
201611	3051	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	52.0	97.0
201611	3052	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	For those of you who will still be here at 11:00, I believe 11:00 is the witching hour at which a buffet lunch will appear, so you’re welcome to stay for that.	52.0	65.0
201611	3053	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And let me just say that the next meeting will be Tuesday and Wednesday, December 13 and 14.	52.0	65.0
