201410	0	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to call this meeting to order.	5	5
201410	1	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Before turning to our agenda, I’d like to say a few words about our communications with the public.	97	9
201410	2	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Many of you will recall that in June 2011, the FOMC adopted a policy pertaining to the external communications of FOMC participants, and we have reaffirmed that policy every year thereafter.	97	9
201410	3	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Principle number one is that every single Committee participant, and not just the Chair, has an obligation to enhance the public’s understanding of monetary policy, including its rationale.	97	9
201410	4	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I would urge you to keep this principle in mind, especially during these highly sensitive times when there is heightened market volatility and tremendous focus on our ongoing discussions about how and when renormalization might proceed.	97	9
201410	5	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	If we aren’t careful about what we say in speeches and other forums, such as media interviews, we can easily confuse markets and the general public, adding to volatility and ultimately diminishing the effectiveness and credibility of our policy.	97	9
201410	6	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, our guidelines affirm that participants are always free to present their own views.	97	9
201410	7	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I personally feel that communicating the diversity of views on the Committee, as we also do with the SEP, is valuable, but I consider it important to do that in a way that clearly distinguishes one’s individual view from the Committee’s agreed-upon policy stance.	97	9
201410	8	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	We have also traditionally emphasized in our communications the collegial, consensus-driven nature of the FOMC policy process, the fact that participants come to meetings with open minds and, after discussing the issues, come to a collective decision.	97	9
201410	9	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I see this tradition as a critical aspect of our decision process, and it could be threatened by what strikes me as an increasing tendency for participants to take strong stands in public on ongoing debates about appropriate policy.	97	9
201410	10	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	If we stake out positions in advance of meetings and we have already decided that it doesn’t matter what our colleagues have to say, there is no real reason for us to meet at all.	97	9
201410	11	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	We could save travel expenses by phoning in our votes.	97	9
201410	12	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	But in reality, I suspect that everyone around the table does support the tradition of arriving at the meeting prepared to listen and to reach a collective decision in which most of us don’t get precisely our first choice on policy.	97	9
201410	13	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	If so, I think the clarity of our communications would be enhanced if discussions about individual views were softened a bit, perhaps by adding a reminder that the ultimate decision will be a collective one and that you look forward to discussing the issues further with your colleagues.	97	9
201410	14	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Such qualifiers might also help the public understand that the thinking on the Committee is less fractured than what a range of speeches might suggest.	97	9
201410	15	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Another concern I have is that the flow of comments on the outlook and policy sometimes takes on the appearance of a public debate in which one participant provides an assessment of the policy implications of some bit of economic news, then another provides a contrasting interpretation, followed by yet other participants weighing in with their views on the correct meaning.	97	9
201410	16	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	And it is easy to see how such sequences can arise, especially with reporters trying to spur them on.	97	9
201410	17	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	While we want to be transparent, I don’t think our communications are necessarily clarified by airing a set of conflicting assessments of the policy implications of the latest news.	97	9
201410	18	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Rather, it may just confuse the markets by introducing noise, and for this reason, I would encourage you to avoid publicly drawing firm policy conclusions about the meaning of the latest data before we’ve had a chance to talk about them here.	97	9
201410	19	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I’d also like to make a few remarks pertaining to our comments on the dollar.	97	9
201410	20	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	By long- standing agreement, the Treasury speaks for the US government on international economic policy and the dollar, while the Federal Reserve speaks for the US government on monetary policy.	97	9
201410	21	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	It is important to respect this division of labor by carefully limiting our remarks about exchange rates.	97	9
201410	22	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	We need to be careful not to ever inadvertently create the impression that we are somehow trying to jawbone down the value of the dollar, especially because that would violate the agreement of the G-7 countries not to seek competitive advantage by targeting the value of their currencies.	97	9
201410	23	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Such comments could prompt counterproductive policy responses abroad.	97	9
201410	24	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, the exchange rate is an important factor for both the economic outlook and monetary policy transmission, so it is hard to avoid all mention of it.	97	9
201410	25	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	But if we follow a few guidelines, I think we can stay out of trouble.	97	9
201410	26	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	First, we should avoid commenting on whether the dollar is appropriately valued.	97	9
201410	27	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Second, we should not discuss current or prospective exchange market interventions by US authorities.	97	9
201410	28	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	And, third, I would urge you to limit references to the economic effects of changes in the dollar to situations in which those effects are important and the public would benefit from some discussion of them.	97	9
201410	29	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Even in these cases, it might be preferable to point to something more encompassing than exchange rates, such as foreign developments.	97	9
201410	30	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Fourth, we want to be clear that the purpose of changes in policies is to achieve the dual mandate, and that any accompanying movements in the dollar, like shifts in bond yields, are a byproduct.	97	9
201410	31	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, if asked to comment on the dollar in a situation in which you had no plan to discuss it, I would recommend saying something like, “I don’t have anything for you on that.	97	9
201410	32	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	As you know, the Treasury speaks for the US government on international economic policy and the dollar.”	97	9
201410	33	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks for indulging me in listening to these comments.	97	9
201410	34	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I’ll stop there, but I do want to end by noting that a guiding principle of our policy on external communications is that we share a responsibility to enhance the public’s understanding of the Committee’s policy actions and the rationale for our decisions, and I’d encourage all of you to bear in mind the broader purpose of our communications.	97	9
201410	35	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s turn to our agenda.	2	2
201410	36	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	The next part of this meeting is going to be a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board.	2	2
201410	37	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I need a motion to close the Board meeting.	2	2
201410	38	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	2	2
201410	39	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	2	2
201410	40	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	And without objection.	2	2
201410	41	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let me call now on Lorie Logan for the Desk report.	2	2
201410	42	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	2	2
201410	43	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	I’ll begin by discussing financial markets and Desk operations over the intermeeting period.	61	6
201410	44	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Simon will briefly review three staff memos that you received prior to the meeting, including proposed changes to the RRP counterparty list, a strategy to address concerns with the federal funds effective rate, and a discussion of segregated balance accounts.	61	6
201410	45	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	After we take Q&A, Fabio will review the staff’s recommendations regarding an additional set of reverse repo tests.	61	6
201410	46	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel of your first exhibit, longer-term sovereign yields in the United States and abroad declined over the intermeeting period, continuing a trend in place since the start of the year.	61	6
201410	47	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Declines in growth-sensitive risk asset prices were also notable as domestic high-yield credit spreads widened and equities fell.	61	6
201410	48	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants primarily attributed these asset price moves to increased concerns over the global growth outlook and to questions regarding the adequacy of future monetary policy accommodation, particularly from the ECB.	61	6
201410	49	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Consistent with this, European equity price indexes underperformed in relation to US equity prices over the period, and the US dollar appreciated modestly, also shown in the top-left panel.	61	6
201410	50	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	As I’ll discuss in more detail in a moment, the unwind of crowded trades predicated on higher US interest rates along with a sharp increase in volatility across markets may have also contributed to the moves, particularly in US interest rates.	61	6
201410	51	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-right panel, the implied federal funds rate path flattened over the period.	61	6
201410	52	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Despite the substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market over recent months that has led nearly all market participants to expect the conclusion of asset purchases at this meeting, the market-implied funds rate path is now much lower than in December, when the initial reduction in the pace of asset purchases was announced.	61	6
201410	53	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Over this intermeeting period, market rates for 2015 and 2016 reached the furthest below corresponding median SEP values on record.	61	6
201410	54	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	In contrast to the large decline in the market-implied path, the Desk’s October surveys showed that respondents’ target rate expectations were little changed.	61	6
201410	55	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Expectations for the most likely timing of liftoff remained clustered near the second quarter of 2015, and the median expectation for the most likely level of the target rate over the next several years barely moved.	61	6
201410	56	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	In addition, as shown in the middle-left panel, the average probability distribution for the timing of liftoff shifted only slightly to a later liftoff, and the average probability distributions for the level of the funds rate through 2016, not shown, were relatively little changed.	61	6
201410	57	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Consistent with this, there was no appreciable increase in the perceived probability of a return to the zero bound after liftoff.	61	6
201410	58	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	One explanation for the significant change in the market-implied path but only small changes in our survey expectations is that investor beliefs that drive the pricing of interest rate futures diverged from the average beliefs of those we survey.	61	6
201410	59	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	An alternative explanation is that risk premiums in the futures market might have shifted lower, perhaps exacerbated by large changes in positioning over the period.	61	6
201410	60	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	We do have some evidence for large positioning changes.	61	6
201410	61	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	For example, CFTC data show that over 60 percent of the substantial speculative short position in Eurodollar futures that had been building since mid-2013 was unwound over the intermeeting period, much of this occurring around the significant volatility on October 15.	61	6
201410	62	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	That day, against the backdrop of an increase in perceived downside risks to global growth and fears of the spread of Ebola, a weak retail sales print appeared to trigger a surprisingly sharp decline in Treasury yields and a spike in volatility across markets.	61	6
201410	63	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	The unexpectedly large moves reportedly led to a rapid unwind of crowded positions predicated on higher US interest rates and continued low volatility.	61	6
201410	64	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	The resulting position adjustments amplified the moves in various markets and led to large price swings, especially in Treasury securities.	61	6
201410	65	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	The intraday trading range of the 10-year Treasury yield on October 15 was 37 basis points, a six-standard-deviation move over the period since 1998, as shown in the middle-right panel.	61	6
201410	66	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Amidst these large intraday movements, Treasury market cash and derivative volumes were at or near record highs.	61	6
201410	67	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	And as shown in the bottom-left panel, daily trading volume in Eurodollar and 5- and 10-year Treasury futures contracts exceeded the amount of open interest.	61	6
201410	68	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Liquidity also became strained, as evidenced by substantial increases in Treasury bid–asked spreads and declines in measures of market depth.	61	6
201410	69	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	During this time, dealers reported reduced willingness and ability to make markets or warehouse risk for Treasury and other securities.	61	6
201410	70	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Many market participants also reported that algorithmic and high-frequency trading activity may have contributed to the increased volatility and reduced liquidity, though more data and analysis are necessary to understand the exact drivers.	61	6
201410	71	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Overall, the moves on October 15 were highly unusual, given the depth and breadth of US Treasury market liquidity.	61	6
201410	72	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	It is possible that as the structure of fixed- income markets evolve, events like this may result in further punctuated periods of very high market volatility.	61	6
201410	73	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the bottom-right panel, implied volatility across markets had been trending higher before increasing sharply on October 15, especially in fixed-income and equity markets.	61	6
201410	74	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	However, despite the rise, a standardized measure of implied volatility across markets remained well below its longer-run average level.	61	6
201410	75	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Further, much of the sharp rise in implied volatility has since retraced, though measures of interest rate implied volatility remain higher, perhaps reflecting a risk premium demanded by market participants following the events of October 15.	61	6
201410	76	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Market-based measures of longer-dated US inflation compensation also shifted significantly over the intermeeting period.	61	6
201410	77	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel of your next exhibit, the Board staff’s measure of five-year, five-year-forward inflation compensation fell to levels below those at the outset of LSAP 3 or following the “taper tantrum.”	61	6
201410	78	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	In contrast, dealer expectations for five-year CPI inflation five years ahead from the Desk’s survey have been very steady.	61	6
201410	79	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	This suggests that recent declines in market-based measures may not reflect changes in inflation expectations but instead may reflect declining risk premiums.	61	6
201410	80	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	In a special question from the most recent Desk surveys, shown in the top-right panel, respondents attributed about half of the recent decline in the market-based five- year, five-year-forward breakeven rate since early September to lower market expectations for inflation and the other half to declines in risk premiums.	61	6
201410	81	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	A few respondents to this question noted that news of a leadership change at the large bond fund manager Pimco, which is a known large holder of TIPS, may have shifted risk premiums in TIPS and thus narrowed breakeven inflation rates.	61	6
201410	82	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Other market participants generally downplayed Pimco-related effects on inflation markets.	61	6
201410	83	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	They instead attributed the bulk of recent breakeven narrowing to recent low inflation readings, increased downside risks to global growth and inflation, and effects from US dollar strength.	61	6
201410	84	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Concerns regarding lower global inflation were also driven in part by worries over a slowdown in China and by lower commodity prices.	61	6
201410	85	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-left panel, industrial metal prices have recently fallen sharply, the share prices of companies with large exposures to China have declined, and oil prices have continued their sharp declines since late June.	61	6
201410	86	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	The middle-right panel shows the recent appreciation of the US dollar against the euro and other major currencies, a development which market participants largely attribute to a divergence in monetary policy expectations and growth outlooks between the United States and most foreign economies.	61	6
201410	87	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Following this recent appreciation, many have begun to discuss the potential effect that further dollar appreciation may have on domestic growth and inflation.	61	6
201410	88	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Despite a weakening euro, measures of inflation compensation in the euro area, shown in the bottom-left panel, continued to decline and recently reached the lowest levels on record.	61	6
201410	89	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	The declines have come despite the ECB having announced numerous easing measures since its June meeting, and market participants remain concerned that the announced actions will be insufficient to return inflation to target.	61	6
201410	90	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	These concerns were amplified following the October ECB meeting, when President Draghi declined to offer an explicit target for the size of the ECB’s balance sheet amidst questions surrounding the efficacy of the already announced purchase and lending programs.	61	6
201410	91	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the bottom-right panel, expectations for the effects of these programs on the ECB’s balance sheet vary widely.	61	6
201410	92	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Summing up the central tendencies of the estimates for each program yields an expected balance sheet expansion of about 700 billion euro over the next two years, below the 1 trillion euro amount that many market participants initially interpreted the ECB to be targeting.	61	6
201410	93	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Subject to questions surrounding ECB balance sheet size and program effectiveness, a substantial share of market participants expect purchases of sovereign bonds sometime in 2015:Q1.	61	6
201410	94	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Finally, on Sunday, the ECB published the long-awaited results of its comprehensive assessment of the European banking sector.	61	6
201410	95	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	While the tests identified a net new capital need of only 5 billion euro, mainly in the periphery, market participants widely viewed the tests as credible, and price action was consistent with this conclusion.	61	6
201410	96	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Negative interest rates on eligible euro-area investments continue to challenge management of the SOMA euro foreign reserves portfolio.	61	6
201410	97	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	As discussed in previous briefings, we continue to pursue a strategy to invest incoming cash flows in the shortest-tenor, non-negative-yielding investments.	61	6
201410	98	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	As a result, duration of the portfolio has lengthened and now exceeds the Desk’s internally managed limit of 12 months, as shown in the top-left panel of your next exhibit.	61	6
201410	99	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Due to the prospects for continued negative interest rates in the euro area, the tradeoff between investing incoming cash flows in shorter-tenor negative-yielding investments and longer-tenor non-negative-yielding instruments will become more pronounced, and the portfolio’s duration is likely to climb further toward the authorized 18-month limit under our current strategy.	61	6
201410	100	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	We will circulate a memo ahead of the December meeting that discusses potential approaches given these tradeoffs.	61	6
201410	101	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Separately, on October 21, the Desk successfully performed the first non-dollar small-value liquidity swap exercise, in which we drew a small amount of euros from the ECB’s euro liquidity swap line.	61	6
201410	102	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Other central banks in the standing swap network conducted similar tests.	61	6
201410	103	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	In terms of the current dollar swap lines, demand at these auctions declined to zero.	61	6
201410	104	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	However, as we noted in a recent memo to the Committee, the Bank of England, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank, and Swiss National Bank still view continuing the seven-day operations for an additional month as prudent.	61	6
201410	105	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	As the monthly extensions are likely to continue in the near future, we intend to notify the Committee only when these foreign central banks expect to discontinue their routine auctions or if the circumstances surrounding future renewals change in a material way.	61	6
201410	106	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	We will consult with the subcommittee on foreign currency on a monthly basis to request the reaffirmation of its intent to approve routine drawings.	61	6
201410	107	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Turning to domestic operations, while Treasury and MBS purchases generally proceeded smoothly over the intermeeting period, measures of MBS operation execution deteriorated somewhat amid increased market volatility.	61	6
201410	108	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-right panel, offer-to-cover ratios declined, though operations generally remained within recent ranges.	61	6
201410	109	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	On October 15, during the height of the market volatility, the Desk extended an MBS operation by 10 minutes to ensure auction coverage.	61	6
201410	110	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Today, the Desk will complete the directed purchases of $15 billion for the month of October.	61	6
201410	111	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	If the Committee chooses to end the purchase program at this meeting, the Desk would conduct no further purchases to increase the size of the SOMA portfolio.	61	6
201410	112	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	If directed, however, we would continue to reinvest agency principal payments into agency MBS and to roll over maturing Treasury securities.	61	6
201410	113	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	We would release a Desk statement at the same time as the Committee statement confirming that the purchase program has been concluded and the strategy for agency reinvestments in the MBS market will generally remain the same, with a few minor adjustments, such as the timing of the publication of the calendar of expected reinvestment purchases.	61	6
201410	114	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	We will have copies of the statement available for review tomorrow.	61	6
201410	115	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	For the remainder of the briefing, we’ll discuss the staff’s continued work on issues related to policy normalization.	61	6
201410	116	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	To start, the content of the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, published after the September FOMC meeting, was largely in line with market expectations.	61	6
201410	117	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants were surprised, however, by some of the announced changes to the overnight RRP parameters.	61	6
201410	118	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Following the announcement of changes to the ON RRP parameters and leading into quarter-end, some short-term money market rates declined, as shown in the middle-left panel, with some rates dipping below the overnight RRP offered rate, even though the aggregate cap did not bind until September 30.	61	6
201410	119	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Treasury bill yields, not shown, also declined.	61	6
201410	120	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	The distribution of triparty repo rates shifted downward following the testing structure changes, and the share of volumes trading below the overnight RRP offered rate increased.	61	6
201410	121	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants reported several factors contributing to some money market rates trading lower than the overnight RRP offered rate ahead of quarter-end.	61	6
201410	122	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	First, market participants had not anticipated the introduction of an overall cap at the September FOMC meeting, and the proximity of this announcement to quarter-end reportedly led some investors to scramble into other money market instruments.	61	6
201410	123	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	In addition, the introduction of the cap reportedly led to increased demand for securities that matured after quarter-end, given expectations that the overall cap would bind on September 30.	61	6
201410	124	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Finally, the prospect of a binding overall limit may have motivated cash investors to lend at lower rates in advance of quarter-end to gain favorable access to borrower balance sheets on days when the cap was seen as likely to bind.	61	6
201410	125	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	On quarter-end, the aggregate cap bound as expected.	61	6
201410	126	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	We received $407 billion in bids, as shown in the middle-right panel.	61	6
201410	127	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	The auction mechanism was successfully executed and the operation stop-out rate was 0 basis points, with 26 participants placing a total of $96 billion in bids at negative rates.	61	6
201410	128	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	As seen in the bottom-left panel, other than on quarter-end, the Desk has only received a handful of bids at negative rates, reportedly submitted for testing purposes.	61	6
201410	129	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Of note, on quarter-end the overnight RRP operation was held several hours earlier than usual so that counterparties whose bids were not accepted might have time to find alternative investments.	61	6
201410	130	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	The bottom-right panel shows the shift in rates and volumes on September 30.	61	6
201410	131	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Similar to past quarter-ends, volumes fell sharply, particularly in unsecured markets.	61	6
201410	132	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Treasury repo and Eurodollar rates fell further than in previous quarter-ends, with the Eurodollar rate printing at a negative rate for the first time since we started collecting data on it in 2010.	61	6
201410	133	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Despite declines in many short-term rates and money market volumes over quarter-end, market participants characterized trading conditions as orderly, with less volatility than many had expected, and there were few signs of significant pressures at major custody banks.	61	6
201410	134	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Custody banks did not charge fees on firms’ excess cash, though some investors reportedly felt pressure from custody banks to place cash in investments at negative rates rather than leave it unremunerated in their accounts.	61	6
201410	135	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	If you briefly return to the middle-left panel, you can see that, as with past quarter-ends, money market rates quickly returned to more typical levels and have remained above the overnight RRP rate.	61	6
201410	136	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	The distribution of triparty repo rates shifted up again, after sliding downward in the weeks leading up to and including quarter- end.	61	6
201410	137	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Lastly, the staff continues to test TDFs.	61	6
201410	138	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Participation has been robust at the first three operations in the current testing series, which incorporates an early withdrawal feature.	61	6
201410	139	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel, usage more than doubled in the first two operations compared with earlier test operations with the same rate and cap but without the breakability feature.	61	6
201410	140	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	The increases in take-up were partially attributable to institutions that did not participate in earlier operations, including some that asked to be credentialed to participate after the breakability feature announcement.	61	6
201410	141	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Take-up in Monday’s operation, not shown in your exhibit, was $219 billion.	61	6
201410	142	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Simon will now continue our report.	61	6
201410	143	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Lorie.	61	6
201410	144	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	First, as discussed in past meetings, the Desk recommends allowing firms that meet the existing set of eligibility criteria to apply to become counterparties in overnight RRP operations.	61	6
201410	145	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	We recommend reopening the application process as an issue of fairness, in order to provide equal treatment to eligible institutions, and we anticipate that the addition of new counterparties would only modestly increase demand for overnight RRPs.	61	6
201410	146	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-right panel, we estimate that 21 money market mutual funds are eligible to apply and that about 13 of them are likely to do so.	61	6
201410	147	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Together, the 21 eligible funds have about $240 billion in assets under management, which would represent a roughly 12 percent increase from the total AUM of existing money market fund counterparties.	61	6
201410	148	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	We estimate that if all 21 funds had been counterparties, demand on a typical day in August would have been about $20 billion higher, assuming that the funds would have exhibited similar take-up for overnight RRPs, as a fraction of AUM, as the current counterparties of the same fund type.	61	6
201410	149	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Of course, this overestimates additional usage, because not all 21 funds have expressed interest in participating in operations.	61	6
201410	150	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Many FHLBs have also expressed interest in becoming counterparties, and four appear likely to meet the eligibility criteria based on a preliminary assessment of available data.	61	6
201410	151	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	The addition of these institutions could increase demand on certain days.	61	6
201410	152	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	For example, the four institutions that appear eligible have left between $2 million and $15 billion in reserves unremunerated in their Federal Reserve accounts over the past year.	61	6
201410	153	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	However, based on the behavior of existing FHLB counterparties, we do not anticipate that their participation would substantially affect volumes in the federal funds market.	61	6
201410	154	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	President Lacker raised some important points about the extended RRP counterparty management strategy in the future and how the Desk would explain this new wave of extended counterparty applications.	61	6
201410	155	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	As discussed in a June memo, the Desk’s preference is to transition to a more traditional counterparty management approach after this last wave.	61	6
201410	156	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	In the traditional approach there would be rolling admission for any firm that meets the eligibility criteria and rolling exit for counterparties that no longer meet eligibility criteria or whose performance is below standard, similar to our management strategy for primary dealers.	61	6
201410	157	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	However, particularly because of the temporary nature of the ON RRP facility, it seems important to amend this traditional approach.	61	6
201410	158	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	The simplest amendment is to set an upper limit on the number of extended counterparties.	61	6
201410	159	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Under this approach the Desk would indicate in the announcement of the new wave of applications that this would be the last such wave and, after adding the accepted counterparties, the total number of extended counterparties would not increase and the eligibility criteria would not change.	61	6
201410	160	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Of course, this approach does limit flexibility, especially because the extended counterparty list could be used for more traditional draining operations.	61	6
201410	161	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	One could couch these statements on the limit on the total number of extended counterparties and eligibility criteria as current anticipations along with an emphasis on the temporary nature of the ON RRP facility.	61	6
201410	162	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	If the Committee does not object to a final reopening of the application process to a new wave of counterparties, we would incorporate any suggestions from the Committee today on the appropriate communication strategy and circulate a draft Desk statement announcing the new wave for further comment.	61	6
201410	163	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Next, the staff proposes two changes to address concerns with the current federal funds effective rate.	61	6
201410	164	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	First, we intend to transition the underlying data source for the federal funds effective rate from the brokers to FR 2420.	61	6
201410	165	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	This change is expected to have little effect on the level of the federal funds effective rate but should enhance both its robustness and its consistency with the IOSCO principles for benchmark rates.	61	6
201410	166	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Additionally, as shown in the middle-left panel, the FR 2420 data capture a larger volume of federal funds transactions than the brokered data.	61	6
201410	167	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	This should make the effective federal funds rate more resilient to modest changes in trading activity.	61	6
201410	168	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Second, the staff would also like to publish a new overnight bank funding rate, which would comprise both Eurodollar and federal funds transactions of US-based banking offices.	61	6
201410	169	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Such a rate would provide a useful benchmark for a broader set of money market transactions and could serve as a backup in contracts for the effective federal funds rate.	61	6
201410	170	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	The underlying data for this rate would also come from FR 2420, subject to establishing that we have the legal authority to collect data from foreign banking offices controlled from the United States.	61	6
201410	171	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	This blended rate is expected to differ little from the federal funds effective rate on most days, although on quarter- end dates or during times of stress there could be greater divergence between the two rates due to the different lender groups in Eurodollars and federal funds.	61	6
201410	172	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Both of these changes could be announced in the fourth quarter of 2014, and we would expect to implement them in late summer 2015.	61	6
201410	173	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	The time between announcement and implementation is needed to enhance the data collection process, including issuing a Federal Register notice and responding appropriately to any comments that we receive, as well as to ensure the quality of the data.	61	6
201410	174	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	In the interim, the staff will work on the development of internal systems, controls, and governance principles for the new rates.	61	6
201410	175	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Please let us know if you have any concerns about these plans.	61	6
201410	176	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Finally, I would like to mention a possible new service the Federal Reserve System could offer called segregated balance accounts, or SBAs, which is outlined in the middle-right panel and discussed in more detail in a memo you received before the meeting.	61	6
201410	177	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	SBAs are an arrangement that allows banks to borrow funds from a variety of lenders, including FHLBs, and place those funds in specific accounts at the Federal Reserve that earn the IOER rate.	61	6
201410	178	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	The transaction is designed to remove credit risk, as borrowed funds would be fully collateralized by an equal amount of reserves that are segregated from the bank’s other assets.	61	6
201410	179	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	This arrangement could allow additional banks to compete for money market funds, and as a result, money market rates and the rates paid on borrowings secured by SBAs could be pushed up closer to the IOER rate.	61	6
201410	180	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	SBAs, by allowing banks to provide accounts that safeguard invested funds, should facilitate competition among a wide set of banks based predominantly on offered rates.	61	6
201410	181	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	If successful, that should lead to greater pass-through of the IOER rate and a redistribution of reserves toward banks with relatively low balance sheet costs.	61	6
201410	182	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	While SBAs could help improve the magnetic pull of IOER, they would not require the Federal Reserve to pay interest to nonbank institutions directly.	61	6
201410	183	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Additionally, unlike overnight RRPs, SBAs do not require setting an additional administered rate.	61	6
201410	184	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	The balances held in an SBA would earn IOER for the borrowing bank, and the rate and terms paid on the loan secured by the balances in the SBA would be determined privately by the participating parties.	61	6
201410	185	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	However, as with other tools for the FOMC’s consideration, there are potential risks and uncertainties that must be considered.	61	6
201410	186	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	One concern is that SBAs may reduce arbitrage activity in the federal funds market and lead to lower volumes, potentially making the effective federal funds rate more sensitive to idiosyncratic trades.	61	6
201410	187	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	There are also a number of complex legal and regulatory issues that must be resolved.	61	6
201410	188	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	In addition, at this time, interest in these accounts is unknown, as banks would need to weigh the costs associated with establishing and managing these arrangements against the benefit of earning the spread between possible SBA rates and the IOER rate.	61	6
201410	189	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	More broadly, the Committee might also want to avoid additional complexity in the communication of its policy implementation framework during normalization and the possibility of unintended consequences.	61	6
201410	190	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	The final panel outlines some next steps that staff could take to lay the groundwork for SBAs, if there was sufficient interest from the Committee in the Federal Reserve System establishing these new accounts.	61	6
201410	191	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Some of these steps can proceed internally within the System whereas others would require engagement with other agencies and the private sector.	61	6
201410	192	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201410	193	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	That concludes our prepared remarks.	61	6
201410	194	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	61	6
201410	195	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s go to Q&A.	62	6
201410	196	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to propose that we first have Q&A on financial market developments covering Lorie’s presentation, and when we finish with that, let’s turn to questions on the matters that Simon discussed.	62	6
201410	197	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	So let’s start with any questions for Lorie.	62	6
201410	198	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	62	6
201410	199	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have a question on charts 7 and 8 about measures of US inflation expectations.	62	6
201410	200	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m a little bit puzzled by how to read these different things.	62	6
201410	201	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	As I understand it, the primary dealer five-year, five-year-ahead estimate of inflation hasn’t really moved.	62	6
201410	202	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The Board briefing said it’s little changed since the last FOMC meeting.	62	6
201410	203	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	So the primary dealers, the economists, haven’t changed their views.	62	6
201410	204	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And then when you look at the actual movement in the Board’s five-year, five-year-forward inflation compensation, the Board’s yield-curve model suggests in parsing the data that most of the decline is actually due to reductions in risk premiums while the estimates of changes in inflation expectations account for only a few basis points—again reading from the Monday morning Board briefing.	62	6
201410	205	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	So those two answers are the same.	62	6
201410	206	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Inflation expectations haven’t changed.	62	6
201410	207	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But then you have chart 8, and there you’re asking the primary dealers who have already self-identified that they don’t think there’s a change in longer-run inflation expectations, “Why do you think longer-term rates have come down?”	62	6
201410	208	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And they say, well, it must be the A, B, or C.	62	6
201410	209	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Maybe there’s a D, E, and F here, too.	62	6
201410	210	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I mean, what do I make of that?	62	6
201410	211	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	You’re asking people who themselves don’t believe something what they think the market’s doing, and how should we weigh evidence like that?	62	6
201410	212	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And how do you weigh the evidence from the yield curve model?	62	6
201410	213	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	I can’t speak about the yield curve models, but I think others will.	62	6
201410	214	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Looking at the series, you see that the dealers don’t often change those expectations.	62	6
201410	215	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	They’ve been very, very steady historically, even when we’ve seen other drops in breakevens.	62	6
201410	216	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	So it could be that they’re just very, very sticky in the way they’re filling out their survey responses.	62	6
201410	217	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	But I don’t really have a good explanation other than the fact that when they look at why market prices have moved and assume what other people think, they split it fairly evenly between the risk premium and inflation expectations, and the market commentary on those various factors fall into both of those buckets.	62	6
201410	218	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	So, I think there’s likely a mix of risk-premium changes and inflation-expectations changes.	62	6
201410	219	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	I don’t know if someone else wants to talk about the models.	62	6
201410	220	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	The question for panel 8 was, why do they think this has fallen, not what is their expectation.	62	6
201410	221	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But it’s their guess.	62	6
201410	222	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I mean, you used to fill this out, Bill.	62	6
201410	223	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	62	6
201410	224	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In the second chart, they’re not expressing their own views.	62	6
201410	225	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	No, I understand.	62	6
201410	226	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	They’re expressing the views of others.	62	6
201410	227	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Just like everyone around the table could have a view.	62	6
201410	228	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We could wrongly express our view of others, right?	62	6
201410	229	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s exactly my point.	62	6
201410	230	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	They’re just guessing, in some way.	62	6
201410	231	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	“Well, the market has gone down.	62	6
201410	232	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I guess it’s something—”	62	6
201410	233	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes.	62	6
201410	234	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s really what you’re getting out of chart 8.	62	6
201410	235	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	You also get the buy-side participants who haven’t done this as much, and so those responses are interesting in some ways.	62	6
201410	236	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	I think that’s right.	62	6
201410	237	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Some of the various stories behind these moves fall into “risk premium” and some of them fall into “inflation expectations.”	62	6
201410	238	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	I think that’s why they think there’s a combination.	62	6
201410	239	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	I don’t understand why what they’re filling out for their own inflation expectations doesn’t move more.	62	6
201410	240	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	I’m confused.	62	6
201410	241	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	So the question in chart 8 is asking the dealers, “Here’s a change in a market price.	62	6
201410	242	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	How do you parse that?”	62	6
201410	243	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Conditional on the fact that they don’t see inflation moving, how are they supposed to answer that?	62	6
201410	244	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Because it’s a market price that’s moved.	62	6
201410	245	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Is it supposed to be other risk premiums as all of it?	62	6
201410	246	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s a guess.	62	6
201410	247	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Or are they supposed to say, “Can’t do it because I don’t believe it.”	62	6
201410	248	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I would say it’s a little something more.	62	6
201410	249	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m just downplaying.	62	6
201410	250	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	They don’t know what the answers of other people are to the first question yet, right?	62	6
201410	251	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And so they see this market price moving and so they’re saying, “Well, I think other people have changed their expectations in some way, but I haven’t.”	62	6
201410	252	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s how I would parse this.	62	6
201410	253	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The model.	62	6
201410	254	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	In terms of the model, I think you had it exactly right:  Our preferred yield curve model parses this as only a pretty small decline, just a few basis points, in expected inflation.	62	6
201410	255	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Then there’s a piece having to do with inflation risk premiums.	62	6
201410	256	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	That also knocked inflation compensation down some.	62	6
201410	257	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	And then there’s a piece that the model attributes to liquidity premiums on TIPS, and that actually was a fair amount of it.	62	6
201410	258	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	That piece come in when you get big movements in rates.	62	6
201410	259	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	But the upshot is that the model, at least, would say there wasn’t a lot of evidence here for lower expected inflation 5 to 10 years out.	62	6
201410	260	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	62	6
201410	261	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	62	6
201410	262	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I just had a quick comment, which is that I think it’s useful to have these decompositions that are on figure 8.	62	6
201410	263	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But in my own thinking, I don’t like putting too much weight on them.	62	6
201410	264	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Even if the breakeven is declining because of risk premiums, we sometimes act like that’s something we can safely ignore.	62	6
201410	265	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The decline in risk premiums is coming because people are worried about a combination of low economic growth and low inflation happening at the same time.	62	6
201410	266	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s what drives down those risk premiums.	62	6
201410	267	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we should be more concerned about low inflation if it’s happening in a low-growth event than if it’s happening when other things are going well.	62	6
201410	268	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And that’s exactly what’s reflected in risk premiums.	62	6
201410	269	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So, at least in my own thinking, while I find these decompositions useful, I don’t like to let them drive my thinking about expected inflation.	62	6
201410	270	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Just one more word on that.	62	6
201410	271	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	There is interesting work that has been done here using inflation caps and floors to look at the risk-neutral distribution of inflation compensation that comes out of that.	62	6
201410	272	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	That’s shifted down—as you would expect from panel 7— but it’s really the high-inflation outcomes that seem to have been marked down.	62	6
201410	273	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	So you might see from that both reduced risk of an outcome in which there’s a boom and high inflation and maybe, as a result of the reduction in that tail, a lower risk premium as well.	62	6
201410	274	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	62	6
201410	275	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Just to complicate this discussion a little bit, we have the Board’s five- year, five-year inflation compensation measure.	62	6
201410	276	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Barclays also has a measure.	62	6
201410	277	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	And if you compare the two, the Board measure is, if I read this correctly, about 2.2-something percent.	62	6
201410	278	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	The low is 2.09 in the recent recovery.	62	6
201410	279	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Barclays’ measure, looking at your graph that I have here, is 1.79, well above, though not far from its recovery mean.	62	6
201410	280	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	So I’m curious,  Could you could just give us a quick brief on what the difference is between the two, and why ours is superior or why theirs is inferior, or why don’t we use both.	62	6
201410	281	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	If I get this wrong, Simon will correct me.	62	6
201410	282	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	But I think the Barclays measure is a tradable one under which they are picking particular securities—a particular TIPS and a particular nominal Treasury—whereas the Board staff uses a measure that’s estimated based on the whole yield curve.	62	6
201410	283	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	So the Board’s measure smooths through variation around the yield curve that we think is idiosyncratic, that is, that has to do with fitting errors related to factors influencing specific securities.	62	6
201410	284	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	In addition, our yield-curve estimation throws out the on- the-run and, I think, once-off-the-run nominal securities, which can trade at a premium in relation to other securities.	62	6
201410	285	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	We use our method because we think it’s better, because we think it’s pulling in all of the information from across the yield curve, and it’s smoothing out some idiosyncratic factors that can show up in the Barclays measure.	62	6
201410	286	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Does the Board differ from the New York Fed in terms of its conclusion of longer-term inflation expectations being well anchored, that most of the movement that took place was due to a reduction in the inflation risk premium?	62	6
201410	287	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	That’s what our model says.	62	6
201410	288	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The New York Fed staff agrees with that.	62	6
201410	289	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Yes.	62	6
201410	290	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	I think the evidence we have from the survey suggests it’s a mix.	62	6
201410	291	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	I don’t know if I would put a lot of weight on the distribution.	62	6
201410	292	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	The research staff at the New York Fed can replicate the result that the inflation risk premium is falling.	62	6
201410	293	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	It’s up to all of you how much weight you want to put on the model, the survey, or just the fact that it has fallen here on all the measures and in Europe.	62	6
201410	294	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Thank you for clarifying, I think.	62	6
201410	295	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	[Laughter]	62	6
201410	296	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	So, other questions for Lorie on financial market developments?	62	6
201410	297	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	I just wanted to follow up on this discussion.	62	6
201410	298	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	I do think it’s interesting to break down these five-year, five-year forwards, but they are talking about what is going to happen in the period 5 years from now out to 10 years.	62	6
201410	299	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	In my opinion, these things should never change.	62	6
201410	300	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	If we really had credible policy, they should never change.	62	6
201410	301	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	And you kind of see that in the primary dealer five-year, five-year-forward estimate.	62	6
201410	302	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	What they’re saying is 2.3 percent, which is basically 2 percent on the PCE.	62	6
201410	303	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	So I guess this is CPI-based for the dealers.	62	6
201410	304	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62	6
201410	305	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	62	6
201410	306	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	I would be interested in the future to break down the five-year because I think we should be able to control inflation over the five-year period.	62	6
201410	307	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	And that’s what I’ve been a little bit more concerned about recently.	62	6
201410	308	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	We also asked for the average probability distribution for the five-year, five-year-forward CPI inflation rate in the survey.	62	6
201410	309	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	And that distribution didn’t shift at all either.	62	6
201410	310	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	62	6
201410	311	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	On chart 7, the primary dealer five-year, five-year-forward estimate doesn’t seem to move much.	62	6
201410	312	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	That’s reminiscent of the Survey of Professional Forecasters.	62	6
201410	313	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Do they behave the same; is there really any difference between them?	62	6
201410	314	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	The dealers must contribute to the Survey of Professional Forecasters, too.	62	6
201410	315	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	I haven’t looked at the differences between them.	62	6
201410	316	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	The only difference is that you can get an implied five-year, five-year- forward estimate from the Survey of Professional Forecasters.	62	6
201410	317	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	You have to take the 10-year and the 5-year forecasts and basically subtract them; the Board staff will do that.	62	6
201410	318	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	The dealer survey has a direct question on the five-year, five-year forward, which might trigger in their minds, “The Fed is credible, I’m going to put down 2.3.”	62	6
201410	319	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Right.	62	6
201410	320	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	I ask because when I’m briefed on the Survey of Professional Forecasters, it doesn’t really move very much, and I’m not quite sure what to think about that.	62	6
201410	321	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	I can either take extreme comfort in it, that we’re locking down long-term inflation expectations, or it could be that nobody is paying attention and they just filled the survey out.	62	6
201410	322	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	And I know that, over a longer period of time, the Board staff has used the SPF inflation expectations, in the 1980s and whatnot.	62	6
201410	323	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	So I wonder if there is any analysis of the difference of those two—more out of curiosity than anything else.	62	6
201410	324	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	I think even when you look at our surveys and who fills them out, you find that parts of the surveys are filled out by the economists, and certain questions they take to the trading desk.	62	6
201410	325	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	And it could be that the economists, in filling them out, write down their own expectations, and they go ask the trading desk for the decomposition of the change.	62	6
201410	326	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	So you can be getting a mix of who is responding.	62	6
201410	327	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	That was my interpretation.	62	6
201410	328	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62	6
201410	329	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Then let’s turn to questions for Simon on the various programs.	62	6
201410	330	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	62	6
201410	331	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I think it’s a good idea to tell the market how we’re going to do things.	62	6
201410	332	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	In the current primary dealer program, if you become eligible you can apply to get in.	62	6
201410	333	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	So having reopened the ON RRP a couple of times now on an ad hoc basis, it would be an open question for market participants as to whether there is going to be another round.	62	6
201410	334	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	And I think we owe it to them to lay out a plan.	62	6
201410	335	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I think closing it and having it be a one-time deal is more consistent with the Committee’s view on this being a transitional arrangement to some extent—it might be a couple years, but a transitional arrangement—than would be a continual reopening.	62	6
201410	336	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	So I like Simon’s proposal for announcing publicly that it would be a one-time opening and then it’s closed.	62	6
201410	337	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Now, I took it that you were proposing that it would be open if people drop out.	62	6
201410	338	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Is that what you were saying, that it’s a constant number?	62	6
201410	339	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Just to correct one thing, I don’t think the previous openings were ad hoc in any way.	62	6
201410	340	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	We were building up a list, and we changed the criteria as we added them.	62	6
201410	341	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	That was presented to the Committee over a number of years.	62	6
201410	342	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	The difference this time is we’ve not really established a way in which the overnight RRP is available.	62	6
201410	343	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	You are correct that this will be a number of extended counterparties.	62	6
201410	344	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	We would find that number from how many that we will be adding, and we would then manage the list.	62	6
201410	345	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	In managing the list, the main issue would be for a money fund.	62	6
201410	346	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Can it keep its assets under management above $5 billion?	62	6
201410	347	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Currently, there are seven that don’t meet that criteria.	62	6
201410	348	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	We should think about whether we want to keep them on there if we have an application from, say, a money fund that has a large amount of assets under management, and we’re operating with that limit.	62	6
201410	349	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	That would be the kind of management that we are talking about.	62	6
201410	350	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	So it would not be the case that the list would stay static.	62	6
201410	351	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	That’s inappropriate, due to changes in business models and declines in assets and other things that the counterparties might have.	62	6
201410	352	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I think I heard you say there would be a fixed number.	62	6
201410	353	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62	6
201410	354	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	That would be an upper limit.	62	6
201410	355	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	I don’t think you’d want us to try and hit that upper limit.	62	6
201410	356	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Right.	62	6
201410	357	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	But we would make sure that we didn’t go above that upper limit.	62	6
201410	358	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	So people could roll off as they fell off eligibility, right?	62	6
201410	359	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Yes, if we thought that it was appropriate to do that.	62	6
201410	360	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	It would be the same with a primary dealer whose capital fell.	62	6
201410	361	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	That would be more stringent.	62	6
201410	362	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	But if a year from now a new participant who met all of the existing criteria wanted to get into this, could that happen?	62	6
201410	363	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Assuming there was space.	62	6
201410	364	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62	6
201410	365	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	They would.	62	6
201410	366	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	So this isn’t your last update?	62	6
201410	367	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62	6
201410	368	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If there was space.	62	6
201410	369	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	So it’s not a list that would just decline.	62	6
201410	370	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	We would keep it constant, because I think if it declined it wouldn’t meet some of your needs.	62	6
201410	371	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	And you also would have to think through what you’d like that list to look like if you want to use term RRPs as a more traditional draining tool.	62	6
201410	372	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	The reason we built it in the way that we did is we started with the money funds that had the most assets under management, because we felt they had the most capacity to drain.	62	6
201410	373	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	We went through various waves in which we added money funds with smaller assets under the management as a precaution that if it was decided that liftoff was going to be in, say, 2011—which some people thought at that time—we wanted to get the most capacity in place straightaway.	62	6
201410	374	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	This seems like a reasonable approach.	62	6
201410	375	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Just to clarify this, in principle, there could be a queue at some point, though.	62	6
201410	376	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	There could be a queue.	62	6
201410	377	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	There’re a lot of issues that we would address in terms of management.	62	6
201410	378	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	For a primary dealer, the performance metric is reasonably clear.	62	6
201410	379	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	How active are they in the operations that we have?	62	6
201410	380	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	In this case, imagine we have a really large money fund that’s not active, but that every day goes out and says, “Hey, I can put my money at the Fed, and I can get the overnight RRP offer rate.	62	6
201410	381	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	So offer me a better rate.”	62	6
201410	382	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Would we want to kick that money fund out?	62	6
201410	383	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Probably not, because it’s affecting the conditions in the money markets.	62	6
201410	384	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	So we’d have to look quite carefully at how to sequence that.	62	6
201410	385	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	If you wanted a small buffer above what we added, you could do that.	62	6
201410	386	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	But remember, we’ve got nearly the whole universe right now.	62	6
201410	387	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	If you look at the chart there, to be honest, it’s not a really big restriction.	62	6
201410	388	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	The big restriction is probably telling the market, “We’re done.	62	6
201410	389	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	We’re not changing the eligibility requirement in the future.”	62	6
201410	390	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That seems more important than the limits on the number, right?	62	6
201410	391	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62	6
201410	392	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	But I think one of the things people wanted is not to give a signal that somehow you’ve changed your mind on the overnight RRP being temporary.	62	6
201410	393	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	And this is a way of trying to help with that.	62	6
201410	394	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	62	6
201410	395	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’d like to switch gears over to the last two slides that you have on the segregated balance accounts.	62	6
201410	396	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In terms of the legal and regulatory issues that remain unresolved, is there any reason not to resolve them?	62	6
201410	397	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	It would seem, as for all our tools, we would want to at least have the option to be able to pull them off the shelf if necessary,  Is there a counterargument to why we wouldn’t get these things verified?	62	6
201410	398	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Having been involved in lots of these issues, I would say that we should do anything that we are able to resolve within our four walls.	62	6
201410	399	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Whenever we talk to outside groups—we’d have to talk to the FDIC, the OCC—we have to be careful how we talk to them.	62	6
201410	400	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	That’s a more significant step.	62	6
201410	401	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	But if there’s sufficient support, then it’s clearly fine, because there is no chance of the story getting out, which might be misleading about what the Federal Reserve might do.	62	6
201410	402	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	And I was trying to be clear, this is really a Federal Reserve service that we’d offer.	62	6
201410	403	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	It’s not an FOMC tool.	62	6
201410	404	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	One other point, just to be clear, one of the regulatory aspects would be actually changing regulations.	62	6
201410	405	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62	6
201410	406	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	When you did that, it would be a very public thing.	62	6
201410	407	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	And I think at that point it would be hard, then, to step back, if you went that far.	62	6
201410	408	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	There are some regulations the Federal Reserve would have to change itself.	62	6
201410	409	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	For those, though, we can do them within the Board until we announce it.	62	6
201410	410	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	62	6
201410	411	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Yes, just following up on this.	62	6
201410	412	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Did I read the memo correctly that this would require the Federal Reserve Bank to execute a contract with the customer of the bank who’s placing the deposit with the bank?	62	6
201410	413	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	I’m not a complete expert on the SBAs.	62	6
201410	414	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	There are other people in the room who might be better at this.	62	6
201410	415	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	This is my impression of what happens:  There would be an arrangement that the bank would want to make.	62	6
201410	416	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	They would bring this proposed bilateral relationship between the bank and the lender to the bank to the Federal Reserve for approval.	62	6
201410	417	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	The Federal Reserve would say it’s okay to have that.	62	6
201410	418	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Clearly, we would want to make sure that the standard rules that we have about who’s opening bank accounts would apply, and there could be other considerations as well as to what that counterparty looked like to the bank that was borrowing from them when they opened up the account.	62	6
201410	419	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	So there would be some involvement from the Federal Reserve in that sense, and if I got that wrong, someone in the room can correct me.	62	6
201410	420	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	I think there are five appendixes, and they have a lot of the details in them.	62	6
201410	421	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair, this seems like an involvement in the Reserve Banks on the other side of the banking industry with their customers that seems operationally cumbersome.	62	6
201410	422	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	We’ve talked about segregated balance accounts before, and we’ve got essentially two theories for why there’s a spread between the funds rate and IOER.	62	6
201410	423	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Balance sheet costs seems like a really compelling theory.	62	6
201410	424	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	The idea that competition in the United States banking system isn’t sufficient to narrow that wedge seems less persuasive.	62	6
201410	425	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	These are really only useful in that second case, and it seems like a lot of operational machinery for something that just doesn’t seem that useful.	62	6
201410	426	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I don’t know if this is the time in the meeting when you’re soliciting comments.	62	6
201410	427	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	We are soliciting comments.	62	6
201410	428	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	The FR 2420 has allowed us a lot of insight into who is borrowing in the federal funds market.	62	6
201410	429	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	The FHLBs clearly have lists of banks that they feel have very high credit status, and that is likely to produce a less competitive outcome than one in which all banks are treated on equal footing.	62	6
201410	430	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	If all banks are treated on close-to-equal footing, you would get a better distribution of reserves within the system.	62	6
201410	431	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	What you’re seeing is, it’s flowing to the foreign banking organizations because they have slightly lower balance sheet costs.	62	6
201410	432	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	There are other banks that might have that as well who aren’t as competitive with an FBO because they don’t look to the FHLBs to be as good a credit.	62	6
201410	433	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Isn’t there also, Simon, a second issue, which is the fact that the smaller banks would be less likely to be bound by the leverage ratio.	62	6
201410	434	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	That’s what I meant.	62	6
201410	435	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	They’re not as close to the leverage ratio.	62	6
201410	436	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So you’re accessing a different part of banking.	62	6
201410	437	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	They are subject to different regulatory rules than some of the large banks.	62	6
201410	438	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	We know a lot of the reserves are at the really big banks, and they clearly have a different regulatory environment than smaller banks.	62	6
201410	439	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	What we don’t know is whether smaller banks could be effective in attracting loans because they’re smaller banks, and they’re not as useful as a larger bank to most people with large amounts of money.	62	6
201410	440	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	If I could just respond, the phenomenon you’ve described has been part of the funds market forever.	62	6
201410	441	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Yes, it has.	62	6
201410	442	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	And we viewed the funds market as reasonably competitive back in the day when we were targeting the funds rate.	62	6
201410	443	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I’m sure there were spreads from time to time based on residual bank credit risk premiums, and I’m sure from time to time there was a basis point or two of maybe some competitive friction, but it’s hard for me to buy that this is a really gigantic effect.	62	6
201410	444	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	I agree.	62	6
201410	445	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	I would love to have the FR 2420 and see if the stability of funding flows that we see now—and I could probably name the top five banks who get most of this from the FHLBs—ever existed before.	62	6
201410	446	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Usually when you see that kind of stability, it’s probably not completely consistent with a perfectly competitive market, but it might be a very efficient market.	62	6
201410	447	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	62	6
201410	448	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I’d like to look at the memo on enhancements to the effective federal funds rate, and make a point on that.	62	6
201410	449	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I think the plans are thought out and sensible— substantially expand coverage, all the pro arguments.	62	6
201410	450	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	My only concern is the proposed timeline.	62	6
201410	451	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I wanted to ask a question on that because this memo indicates that the Desk proposes to announce sometime later this year its intention to change the FFER data source and publish the OBFR.	62	6
201410	452	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	But it’s not likely to be ready to actually begin publication until “late summer.”	62	6
201410	453	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Is there any way to accelerate that publication?	62	6
201410	454	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	My real concern here is, does this affect liftoff?	62	6
201410	455	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Because if we wait until late summer, and let’s assume we want to move earlier than that, is this going to be problematic?	62	6
201410	456	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Is there a way to accelerate the process?	62	6
201410	457	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	You went through putting it out for comment and so on.	62	6
201410	458	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Could you shift the publication of the revised FFER forward and delink it from preparation for the OBFR?	62	6
201410	459	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I’m just curious because that’s what caught my eye in reading this memo.	62	6
201410	460	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	I think that we can only go out for the changes in the data collection once.	62	6
201410	461	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	So that’s one of the constraints.	62	6
201410	462	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	We have to use the Federal Register.	62	6
201410	463	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	We have to take in the comments, and we have to respond to them.	62	6
201410	464	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	We have a project plan that’s tried to look carefully at that.	62	6
201410	465	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	I think—Josh, you can correct me—we’ve tried to take out as much time on that project plan as possible.	62	6
201410	466	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	I don’t believe that somehow delaying the publication of the overnight bank funding rate is going to affect the ability to use a different set of transaction data, but, Josh, you can correct me because you are closer.	62	6
201410	467	2014-10-29	meeting	FROST	In addition to giving the Federal Register notice some time, I think we also need to give the banks some time.	62	6
201410	468	2014-10-29	meeting	FROST	There’s a pretty substantial system change that they would need to make to make sure they were getting all of the data to us that we needed.	62	6
201410	469	2014-10-29	meeting	FROST	We tried to wring out as much of the fat as we could from that timeline.	62	6
201410	470	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I guess my real question is, is this going to affect liftoff at all?	62	6
201410	471	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	It will not affect liftoff.	62	6
201410	472	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Make adjustments to the data we’re collecting after liftoff?	62	6
201410	473	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	We have a number of contingencies in place if we have problems with the existing broker data, and we would implement those contingencies if that was the case.	62	6
201410	474	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Thank you.	62	6
201410	475	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Madam Chair, obviously I don’t want this as an excuse to delay liftoff.	62	6
201410	476	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	We should lift off when we’re supposed to lift off and the Committee agrees to lift off.	62	6
201410	477	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I just wanted to make that point.	62	6
201410	478	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Further comments?	62	6
201410	479	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	62	6
201410	480	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	On the SBAs, my understanding has long been that the FDIC looks ill on any kind of secured borrowing.	62	6
201410	481	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I see in the memo that we’re limiting it to 1-, 2-, and 3-rated institutions, but have we socialized this idea with them?	62	6
201410	482	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	I think there have been some discussions at the staff level.	62	6
201410	483	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	It’s obviously a little bit different taken as a formal proposal from the Federal Reserve to the FDIC, where I was careful to talk about what we can do within our four walls and what we do when we go outside, and there are always risks associated with that.	62	6
201410	484	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	I think that my understanding of the logic of the proposal would suggest that this doesn’t do any harm necessarily to the FDIC in terms of the deposit insurance fund, which is what they’d be concerned about because the notion would be that you would be attracting funds that wouldn’t be there.	62	6
201410	485	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	However, for a large bank that has an amount of reserves right now, they could switch that into an SBA, and that wouldn’t be available in resolution.	62	6
201410	486	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	I think, Bill, that’s one of the things that you thought was a possibility.	62	6
201410	487	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I could be wrong, and I guess there is one way to find out, but it may be sort of a principle thing to them that they just don’t want that kind of encroachment.	62	6
201410	488	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	The FDIC has been clear on certain principles with the Federal Reserve over the last six or seven years, yes.	62	6
201410	489	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Governor Powell, I think a key question here with regard to this issue is that there are two elasticities to worry about.	62	6
201410	490	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	One is, if you had SBAs, to what extent would that increase the number of small and medium-size banks that would sign up for SBAs with borrowers, provide extra competition, and boost market rates closer to the IOER rate?	62	6
201410	491	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The other elasticity is just as Simon was saying.	62	6
201410	492	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	You have large banks with a lot of reserves.	62	6
201410	493	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Some of their customers might say, “Gee, it would be appealing to have a secured deposit rather than an unsecured deposit.”	62	6
201410	494	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	So you’d get a shift of the funding into, I guess, not a deposit but secured funding and out of deposits.	62	6
201410	495	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	If that elasticity was large and the first one was small, this isn’t a great thing to do.	62	6
201410	496	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	If you thought that the second elasticity was small and the first one was large, then you get a lot of traction on rates.	62	6
201410	497	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	It’s very hard to know, but I think at some level that’s kind of the decision that you face.	62	6
201410	498	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	And it’s hard to test this because it’s a service rather than a tool.	62	6
201410	499	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Comments or questions?	62	6
201410	500	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62	6
201410	501	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Then let’s turn to Fabio, who is going to discuss testing of reverse repurchase agreement operations.	61	6
201410	502	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Thank you, Madam Chair; I will be referring to the exhibits labeled “Proposals for Reverse Repurchase Agreement Operations.”	61	6
201410	503	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	In my remarks, I will review the staff’s recommendations regarding additional RRP testing over the next intermeeting period.	61	6
201410	504	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	These tests were the subject of one of the memos you received ahead of the meeting.	61	6
201410	505	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	As noted in the top panel of your first exhibit, reflecting in part the experience gained since September, the staff now recommends that the Committee authorize a series of preannounced modest decreases and increases in the ON RRP rate after the October FOMC meeting.	61	6
201410	506	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	In particular, the ON RRP rate would first be lowered from the current level of 5 basis points to 3 basis points, then raised to 7 basis points, and finally increased to 10 basis points.	61	6
201410	507	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	The rate would be held at each of these levels for two weeks before finally being returned to 5 basis points.	61	6
201410	508	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	A draft resolution that would allow such testing by temporarily expanding the authorized range for the ON RRP rate to 0 basis points to 10 basis points is attached to your handout.	61	6
201410	509	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Varying the ON RRP rate would affect its spread relative to the IOER rate and could provide additional information about the effect of that spread on money markets and the demand for ON RRP.	61	6
201410	510	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	In addition, changes in the ON RRP rate could assist in the assessment of the effectiveness of the ON RRP rate as a floor for short- term interest rates.	61	6
201410	511	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Of particular interest may be the results of the testing at 7 basis points and 10 basis points, as these may provide greater insight into the extent to which the proximity of the ON RRP rate to the zero lower bound is influencing the strength of the floor.	61	6
201410	512	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	The staff recommends that a full schedule of any planned ON RRP rate changes be preannounced by the Desk following the October FOMC meeting to reduce the chance that rate variations would be read as signaling a change in the stance of monetary policy.	61	6
201410	513	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	The bottom panel discusses possible testing of term RRPs to address market pressures at year-end.	61	6
201410	514	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Most market participants expect that balance sheet constraints combined with high level of reserves in the system will once again exert downward pressure on money markets around year-end.	61	6
201410	515	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	In the past, dynamics similar to those visible around quarter-ends have been observed around year-ends, but generally with more pronounced effects.	61	6
201410	516	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	This anticipated pressure raises two questions.	61	6
201410	517	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	First, does the Committee desire to take action to address it? 	61	6
201410	518	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Second, if the Committee does desire to do so, what action could it take?	61	6
201410	519	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	The Committee may wish to test the ability of supplementary tools to improve control over short-term interest rates and to help prevent a deterioration in money market liquidity as pressures build near year-end.	61	6
201410	520	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	If so, the staff recommends that the FOMC consider conducting a series of term RRP operations that span December 31, 2014.	61	6
201410	521	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	These operations would provide one of relatively few remaining opportunities prior to liftoff to meaningfully test the utility of additional supplementary tools and determine their efficacy in helping to control short-term interest rates.	61	6
201410	522	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	By increasing the availability of safe money market instruments ahead of year-end, term RRP operations could temper the potential for a buildup of pressures in money markets in the final weeks of the year.	61	6
201410	523	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	For example, such operations could absorb some demand that would otherwise push down rates on term securities, such as Treasury bills, that mature after the turn of the year.	61	6
201410	524	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	In addition, these tests may also signal to the market that the Committee, while not inclined to increase the overall limit on ON RRP usage, does have additional supplementary tools available and is prepared to deploy them if warranted.	61	6
201410	525	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Finally, the Desk conducted open market operations in order to limit temporary market strains over quarter- and year-ends prior to the financial crisis, so doing so may not be seen as particularly surprising by market participants.	61	6
201410	526	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Such a term RRP exercise could be sized to try to offset the anticipated decline in the available stock of safe money market assets that tends to occur around year-end.	61	6
201410	527	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	A staff analysis suggests that on quarter-ends in 2014, the supply across a number of types of money market assets has declined, in aggregate, by about $150 billion to $200 billion.	61	6
201410	528	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	However, this staff analysis omits a number of significant asset classes, including bilateral federal funds and Eurodollar activity, due to a lack of daily data; in addition, the increase in demand observed at the September 30 ON RRP operation exceeded these amounts.	61	6
201410	529	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Accordingly, $300 billion of term RRP over year-end might be a more realistic estimate of what would be required to meet the increase in demand for safe money market assets.	61	6
201410	530	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	The Desk could announce following the October FOMC meeting that it has been authorized to conduct term RRP operations in December to cross year-end, with a cumulative size limit of up to $300 billion, and that it will announce specific operational details by early December.	61	6
201410	531	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	By helping to resolve some of the uncertainty regarding the availability of safe money market instruments ahead of year-end, and thus facilitating advanced planning by market participants, the early announcement should avoid the “scramble” that reportedly took place in the short period between the September FOMC meeting and quarter-end.	61	6
201410	532	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	The staff recommends that term RRP operations be conducted at several different times over the course of December.	61	6
201410	533	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	For example, fixed-quantity auctions could be conducted each Friday in December for $25 billion, $50 billion, $100 billion, and $125 billion, with each operation settling the Monday after the auction and maturing on January 2, 2015.	61	6
201410	534	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Bidding behavior and movements in money market rates associated with these operations could provide readings of year-end pressures over the course of December.	61	6
201410	535	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Of course, this proposal is preliminary, and should the Committee pursue this option, it would need to be refined based on market participants’ feedback, operational considerations, and evolving market conditions, including issuance plans by the Treasury Department.	61	6
201410	536	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Once the specific plan is determined, the staff could submit it to the Chair for approval, notify the Committee, and release the operational details to market participants.	61	6
201410	537	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	A draft resolution for such an approach is included in the handout.	61	6
201410	538	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Alternatively, the Committee may find it desirable to take no action to address year-end pressures, for example, if meeting participants are concerned about appearing to accommodate “window dressing” behaviors by banks and are comfortable with potentially significant downward pressure on short-term rates.	61	6
201410	539	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	This strategy would provide a second observation of the performance of the current framework on quarter-ends, without the potentially confounding surprise factor of an announcement relatively late in the quarter, as was the case in September.	61	6
201410	540	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	In addition, taking no action could reinforce the FOMC’s earlier communication that occasional day-to-day volatility in money market rates is acceptable and that the ON RRP facility will remain small.	61	6
201410	541	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Another possibility would be to mix these two approaches by testing term RRPs over year-end and then, so long as the test went well and liftoff did not appear imminent, allowing the March quarter-end to pass without Desk action.	61	6
201410	542	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Depending on your decisions regarding these testing issues, we will have copies of the Desk statement available for review tomorrow.	61	6
201410	543	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Thank you.	61	6
201410	544	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	That concludes my prepared remarks.	61	6
201410	545	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	We would be happy to take your questions.	62	6
201410	546	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	62	6
201410	547	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	I have a question on each part of the proposal.	62	6
201410	548	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Are you intending to recommend any further testing in December?	62	6
201410	549	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	If so, what would those tests be?	62	6
201410	550	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	And then, on the volatility and the term RRPs, we have always had year-end volatility in this market, and it seems to be the rule rather than the exception.	62	6
201410	551	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Is there some expectation that this year, in particular, it is going to be worse than it typically is?	62	6
201410	552	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	And that it’s going to actually have an effect on financial conditions or the macroeconomy?	62	6
201410	553	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Or is the proposal being made purely because you want to test a tool?	62	6
201410	554	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	I think your first question has to do with the change in the overnight RRP, and the plan here is to test changes in the overnight RRP rate down and up.	62	6
201410	555	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Right.	62	6
201410	556	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	I understand that.	62	6
201410	557	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	But are you going to come back to us in December with further tests?	62	6
201410	558	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	In addition to this?	62	6
201410	559	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	I think it’s possible we will think that there is something further that we want to test.	62	6
201410	560	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Probably not at the December meeting, because then we’re going into year-end and that’s going to be a strange enough period that I don’t think we’d learn anything from a test.	62	6
201410	561	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The current testing exercise expires at the end of January, so we may come back in January and want to talk about additional testing that we would do after that.	62	6
201410	562	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	But we don’t have a particular plan right now.	62	6
201410	563	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	On the second part, I think it would be interesting to do the testing for a couple of reasons.	62	6
201410	564	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	This is one of the last opportunities before we get to liftoff in which we know there are downward pressures on rates, and so testing the tool exactly when we could check whether it would be effective or not would be, I think, an interesting experiment.	62	6
201410	565	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	There is also the issue of intensifying balance sheet shrinkage over time, as has been evident with regard to regulatory constraints, particularly from foreign banks.	62	6
201410	566	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	So I think it’s a combination of the two.	62	6
201410	567	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	There is a sense that year-end is going to be very strong in terms of a restriction of the supply of safe assets, as well as providing one of the few opportunities at a time when we know there will be downward pressure, so it will be interesting to test the tool at that point.	62	6
201410	568	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	I do think it’s hard to get a neutral read from market participants on this, because they will always want us to help, and I think that was part of your point.	62	6
201410	569	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	To make their lives easier, we used to do operations to smooth the effective rate close to these financial reporting dates.	62	6
201410	570	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	We might think that it was difficult to hit the funds rate target exactly on year- end or at the end of a quarter, but in the old days we wouldn’t want the rate to be firm going into that.	62	6
201410	571	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	One of the other things that has changed is this $450 billion of cash from the asset purchases that you have added to the system over the past year relative to the previous year-end.	62	6
201410	572	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	That money has to find its way home.	62	6
201410	573	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	At some point, as we’ve seen at quarter-ends, some of the traditional, conventional ways start to freeze up and you have to find other ways of putting that cash into an asset or a bank account.	62	6
201410	574	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	And that could produce more disruptions, but it could go just as smoothly as the September quarter-end did.	62	6
201410	575	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	For example, suppose we told you there was a 20 percent chance that it would be more disruptive than usual.	62	6
201410	576	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Would you want to do something about it?	62	6
201410	577	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	The main thing here, I believe, is to test a tool that we think would be useful, and this would look like a really good circumstance to test that tool.	62	6
201410	578	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Just as raising the rate to 10 basis points will be a good test if repo rates, when we raise to 10, were actually below 10—if repo rates were at 20, that’s not going to be helpful for us.	62	6
201410	579	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	We view year-end as a set of conditions in which we could test how effective the term reverse repurchase agreements are.	62	6
201410	580	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	And we learn a lot from that testing, both operationally and how effective it could be in assisting interest on excess reserves, along with the other supplementary tool of overnight RRP.	62	6
201410	581	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	I just want to reiterate a point here.	62	6
201410	582	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	In July, we sent the Committee a memo that said basically, “What if the current plans for liftoff don’t work so well?	62	6
201410	583	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	What’s plan B?”	62	6
201410	584	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	And the first addition that you could do is move the administered rates higher.	62	6
201410	585	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The second was term tools, TDF and term RRP.	62	6
201410	586	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	We are testing TDF now.	62	6
201410	587	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The breakable TDF seems actually to be going pretty well.	62	6
201410	588	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	That’s pretty interesting.	62	6
201410	589	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Year-end would be a terrific time to do a test of term RRP at a time when we know there will be downward pressure on rates.	62	6
201410	590	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	You don’t know how big that downward pressure will be, but it seems like a really opportune time to get a good test in size of that term tool, which we may need when the time comes.	62	6
201410	591	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman Dudley.	62	6
201410	592	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If I could just add to what has been said, it seems to me that you want to test everything that you need to test to make sure that, when you do lift off you actually do have monetary control.	62	6
201410	593	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That would be point number one.	62	6
201410	594	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Point number two is, it is very likely that when we lift off it is going to be right before quarter-end and so we may want to have those tools in place and really understand how those tools are actually going to operate.	62	6
201410	595	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I would much prefer doing a test of term RRP before we get to liftoff than to use it sort of sight unseen.	62	6
201410	596	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, if I could just reinforce that.	62	6
201410	597	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	If the Committee is contemplating June as the time of liftoff, or alternatively September, these are quarter-ends.	62	6
201410	598	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Our meetings occur just before quarter-end.	62	6
201410	599	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	If you think about the practical difficulties, we decide to raise the target range for the first time, and immediately we are swamped with year-end pressures so that instead of our rate going up, it goes down.	62	6
201410	600	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	We don’t have anything in place to deal with that, and these term RRPs are an attractive way, without raising the size of the overnight RRP facility, to deal with pressures and create a better environment in which we have more confidence when we lift off.	62	6
201410	601	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Unfortunately, June, September, December, and March are our press conference key meetings, and so we have to face the fact that these quarter-end pressures are going to be with us probably at the moment we do decide to lift off.	62	6
201410	602	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Although you don’t care if this pressure shows through to the market once in a while, I think that would be problematic, at least the first time, and we should try to make sure we can deal with them.	62	6
201410	603	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	62	6
201410	604	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I want to talk a little bit about the pressure on rates in the couple of days before quarter-end.	62	6
201410	605	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	MarketSource provides a great set of descriptive information about what was going on in markets after our announcement.	62	6
201410	606	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	And it was pretty clear that after the announcement of our parameters, people placed a lot of weight on the probability that the RRP rate would be set below 5 basis points.	62	6
201410	607	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	The description led me to believe that people are essentially taking out insurance by locking up funds over that horizon and were willing to take a lower yield now on, say, five-day funds across the quarter-end in order to insure against maybe even getting a negative rate at the RRP.	62	6
201410	608	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Now, at a five-day horizon, that’s just a traditional sort of yield curve consideration.	62	6
201410	609	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Before, when we pegged the funds rate, it was the only rate we pegged.	62	6
201410	610	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Now we do peg the IOER rate, and we’re going to smooth that through the quarter-end.	62	6
201410	611	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	The IOER rate isn’t going to move over quarter-end.	62	6
201410	612	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	So what we’re talking about is this spread to IOER.	62	6
201410	613	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	If rates are going to be soft in the days leading into year-end, isn’t the natural response for us to raise the cap at year-end, so we’re sure we can nail the rate at 5 basis points?	62	6
201410	614	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	And if we do that and markets are pretty confident that the cap we have for year-end—and this is one of the staff’s proposals— is going to nail it, then we’re not going to get the softness in the days ahead.	62	6
201410	615	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	So I’m not sure why that’s not the best option for this.	62	6
201410	616	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Now, I understand that the Committee, in its discussion of the cap on the overall size of the facility, came to a judgment that reflected a variety of considerations about the footprint, financial-stability concerns, the idea of people running into this facility, and so forth.	62	6
201410	617	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Well, if that judgment leads us to want to leave the cap in place at year-end, then my understanding is that these term RRPs are not going to count against this cap.	62	6
201410	618	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	So they are sort of an end run around the cap; they are sort of loosening up the Committee’s decision about $300 billion being the optimal amount.	62	6
201410	619	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	To my mind, it seems like extending the cap on quarter-end or year-end is the logical solution, if we want to do this.	62	6
201410	620	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Now, personally, I think in the past we have let a lot of volatility show through at year-end, and it doesn’t affect the one-year rate, it doesn’t affect the six-month rate.	62	6
201410	621	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	We have generally lived with a fair amount of year-end volatility and haven’t viewed it as problematic until now.	62	6
201410	622	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Now I understand the consideration about the end of June.	62	6
201410	623	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes, what’s different is that this time we are going to be presumably taking off before a quarter-end and that would not be a good time to be unable to show monetary control.	62	6
201410	624	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	For one day?	62	6
201410	625	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	For one day, okay.	62	6
201410	626	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	For one day, let’s raise the cap.	62	6
201410	627	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Triple the cap for one day.	62	6
201410	628	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Can I respond for a second and maybe offer a different perspective?	62	6
201410	629	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	I think there’s a difference between overnight and term RRPs in terms of footprint and the financial-stability consideration.	62	6
201410	630	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	So in terms of footprint, this is a temporary thing that you do in that period, and it would end after quarter-end or after year-end.	62	6
201410	631	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	It doesn’t have the same footprint that raising a cap in general has.	62	6
201410	632	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	While it’s in place, it does.	62	6
201410	633	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I mean, it diverts intermediation flows while it’s in place.	62	6
201410	634	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	But only for a limited horizon, and the financial-stability consideration that we raised about the overnight RRP that generates the run dynamics is not in place here.	62	6
201410	635	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	This is a different settlement system.	62	6
201410	636	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	So it doesn’t generate the run dynamics that raising the cap or the expectation of an increase in the cap would.	62	6
201410	637	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	I also think there are a couple of differences between raising the overnight RRP cap and having term RRPs.	62	6
201410	638	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	One is that depending on the size, it’s not obvious that increasing the cap on one day at the end of the year would remove the same amount of uncertainty that having a series of term RRPs would.	62	6
201410	639	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	If I am a market participant, I’m not sure whether I have access to the auction or not.	62	6
201410	640	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	So some uncertainty stays.	62	6
201410	641	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	There’s no amount that—	62	6
201410	642	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Oh, there is, of course.	62	6
201410	643	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	As I said, the $300 billion in term RRPs amounted to the estimated increase in demand for safe money market assets.	62	6
201410	644	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Maintaining the constraints set by the Committee until year-end, the removal of uncertainty could not have the same effect.	62	6
201410	645	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	That’s the second piece, which is, you get readings of market prices if you do a series of term RRPs where you’re starting out in December and you can adjust the size.	62	6
201410	646	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	I agree with everything Fabio said, but the even more fundamental thing I took from earlier discussions around this table was you all really didn’t want to show a willingness to adjust the size of the overnight RRP program, and so I took as a basic assumption that we weren’t going to increase the size of the overnight RRP program.	62	6
201410	647	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Instead, we’d take this opportunity to test the term tool, which I wanted to do anyway, which I think is valuable.	62	6
201410	648	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	But I agree.	62	6
201410	649	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	As I think we pointed out in the memo, an alternative approach would be to greatly increase the size of the overnight RRP around year-end, and if the Committee wanted to do that, I think that would work.	62	6
201410	650	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	But we really did take seriously the thought that that could be read as a signal that the Committee was more willing than it actually was to adjust the size of that program.	62	6
201410	651	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	President Lacker, let me play out a scenario for you.	62	6
201410	652	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	We get to December 28, and we’ve told people we’re going to increase on New Year’s Eve.	62	6
201410	653	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	On December 28 we cap out.	62	6
201410	654	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Rates get lower.	62	6
201410	655	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	On December 29, we cap out again.	62	6
201410	656	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Then, on that next day, we suddenly raise it to $600 billion and it works quite well.	62	6
201410	657	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	There will be a lot of people at that point who say, “Well, why don’t you extend the $600 billion for the whole week between Christmas and New Year?”	62	6
201410	658	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	I think we’re trying to avoid that kind of dynamic.	62	6
201410	659	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	It’s not obvious to us when exactly would be the right time to start increasing the cap because at the year-end, it might not be as effective to do it, say, on this one day as it would be at a regular quarter-end.	62	6
201410	660	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	62	6
201410	661	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201410	662	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Fabio said a good bit of what I might have said, Jeff, in response to your observation.	62	6
201410	663	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I think there’s not going to be a perfect alternative here, and we have recognized that in our discussions over the last couple of meetings.	62	6
201410	664	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	We have aims that are somewhat in tension with one another.	62	6
201410	665	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Number one, as the Chair just stated a few moments ago, is wanting to have a lot of credibility at the point of liftoff and perhaps for a meeting or two thereafter.	62	6
201410	666	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Number two is not wanting to put in place a program which invites a significant change in the financial industry that may, in turn, increase the chances of runs in periods of stress.	62	6
201410	667	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I think what’s being proposed here is a way to avoid signaling in advance that we’re going to have a cap increase if there are any problems with the floor.	62	6
201410	668	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think anybody is taking that off the table, but what I think the staff is proposing here is a way to determine whether a mix of instruments will do the job sufficiently so that we don’t have to raise the cap.	62	6
201410	669	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	If what we learn in December is, notwithstanding the mix of instruments, there’s still an awful lot of softness that makes a majority of the Committee uneasy, then we might actually have to think about raising the cap when we lift off.	62	6
201410	670	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	But this is a way of giving ourselves a chance of not doing that.	62	6
201410	671	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	By doing this, we’re going to lose some information that we might otherwise have had by just keeping the $300 billion cap.	62	6
201410	672	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Suppose everything goes well in December.	62	6
201410	673	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	We’re not going to know whether that’s because participants adjusted and made arrangements beforehand or because of the term.	62	6
201410	674	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	We’re not going to know whether it was because September 30 was a special date, because that’s the day on which balance sheets are frozen for stress testing and CCAR purposes, or whether it’s just an end-of-quarter issue.	62	6
201410	675	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	So we’re not going to know some of that, but that’s what happens when you have to make policy decisions in real time.	62	6
201410	676	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	You’re not able to do everything you want.	62	6
201410	677	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Although there are elements of this that I sort of regret, I really do think this is the best way to try to balance those two ends which are potentially in tension with one another, and it gives us the best shot at an outcome that doesn’t compromise either of those goals.	62	6
201410	678	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	I guess one way to respond, to try to regain some of the information, would be not to do it in March.	62	6
201410	679	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	That’s a good point.	62	6
201410	680	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	So what I was going to say is after this is done, we can in January debate whether (a) we would like to have the cap, (b) we would like to keep everything that we had in December, or (c) we want to kind of “go cold” and see what happens in March without any program at all.	62	6
201410	681	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	But we can decide that in January on the basis of whatever information we get out of this.	62	6
201410	682	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	62	6
201410	683	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	A question on how you structure the ON RRP testing regime.	62	6
201410	684	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Did you think about whether it is operationally feasible, rather than to target specific overnight reverse repo rates, to actually target spreads to market rates and, therefore, tactically move with what’s going on in the market as you test these overnight reverse repo rates?	62	6
201410	685	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Is that possible?	62	6
201410	686	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	It seems to me that’s a more nuanced approach, but, at the end of the day, it’s closer to what a real- world outcome would be.	62	6
201410	687	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	I’ll let Simon respond, but I think the rate is easier because we have control where we want the rate to move.	62	6
201410	688	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Money market rates, in a sense, are exogenous to us.	62	6
201410	689	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Currently, they’re relatively high.	62	6
201410	690	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	You will have to move it quite a bit and get quite a lot closer to where we are now, for example, to target a specific spread.	62	6
201410	691	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	So, in some sense, that’s a limitation.	62	6
201410	692	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Just going after the ON RRP rate might limit the utility of the test because if rates are very high, you might not get much traction.	62	6
201410	693	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Simon’s reference to today, the GC repo rate of 20 basis points, or something like that, makes it unfeasible to target spreads.	62	6
201410	694	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Operationally, we could certainly do it.	62	6
201410	695	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	We could announce that we’re going to have a spread over a certain rate, which is publicly known.	62	6
201410	696	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	We have an internal rate that’s not publicly known.	62	6
201410	697	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	That would be the most useful one for us.	62	6
201410	698	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	I think it’d be a bit of a step to start publishing that rate.	62	6
201410	699	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	With all that said, I think one advantage of what we’ve proposed is that we can lay it all out in advance so people will know what’s coming, and I think there’s an advantage to that in two respects.	62	6
201410	700	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	One is it just lets people think about it and plan a little bit.	62	6
201410	701	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The other is that there’s no risk of any sort of surprise leading people to think that we’re signaling about policy or anything like that.	62	6
201410	702	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	We’re going to write down a path under which the overnight RRP rate goes down and then it goes up and then it comes back to 5 basis points, and it’s very clear that there’s nothing up our sleeve.	62	6
201410	703	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	We’re just going to do some testing of what happens when that rate moves around.	62	6
201410	704	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	The preannouncement is really a critical consideration, then.	62	6
201410	705	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	I think it’s very helpful.	62	6
201410	706	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	In terms of not confusing people.	62	6
201410	707	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	And the memo had an example of what could be a schedule, for example, a specific up and down, a specific guide through the month of December, mid- December.	62	6
201410	708	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	A two-hander, President Plosser?	62	6
201410	709	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Yes, please.	62	6
201410	710	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	To follow up on this point, do you think there’s any possibility that by announcing the schedule in advance—you’re going to go up, going to go down—that you’ll limit what you actually learn from the exercise because there will be some endogeneity that people will plan?	62	6
201410	711	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	How does that figure into how you would then interpret what you see?	62	6
201410	712	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	I think we’re hoping that it will be the reverse in the sense that people know that the rates will be low for a while and then high for a while.	62	6
201410	713	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	That gives them time to plan and adjust so that we’ll see a little bit closer perhaps to what we would see if there were more durable changes in rates, if we just raised the rate and left it high for a while.	62	6
201410	714	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	I think our hope was that we’d get a little bit better information, but I guess it’s hard to know.	62	6
201410	715	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	I think we note in the memo that there is some reason it might go in the other direction if you think that there are switching costs from moving away from your counterparties and coming to the Federal Reserve, and you know that it is going to be raised only for two weeks.	62	6
201410	716	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Then, in some sense you’re trading off that you don’t want to send any signal in terms of monetary policy.	62	6
201410	717	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	I think raising the rate above 5 basis points without telling people that you’re going to bring it back down would send a very confusing signal.	62	6
201410	718	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	62	6
201410	719	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201410	720	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I just want to come back to the basics in terms of what helps me decide this.	62	6
201410	721	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	The reason we placed a cap is that we were worried about the flight-to-safety demand.	62	6
201410	722	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	We wanted to focus on supply-driven demand, downward pressure.	62	6
201410	723	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	So a simple question:  By employing this, are we certain we won’t confuse the market between the two or will we be clarifying whether we really are providing this facility to deal with supply- driven demand pressures?	62	6
201410	724	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	I think the dynamics are different.	62	6
201410	725	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	For example, the financial- stability concern that we had was a situation in which the money funds or the cash lender would take money away from broker-dealers or other banks and come to the Federal Reserve, so the flow of money would go from the borrowers into the funds.	62	6
201410	726	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	At year-end, you have different dynamics.	62	6
201410	727	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Those are the dealers that are shrinking their balance sheets, and so the cash lenders left with uninvested cash are looking for a home, for a safe harbor.	62	6
201410	728	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	The directionality of flows, in some sense, is different.	62	6
201410	729	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	So that wouldn’t raise the financial-stability concern that we had.	62	6
201410	730	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	It’s the way that you said it.	62	6
201410	731	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	It’s not the flow in leaving, it’s trying to think about what the fluctuation of supply is, which is exogenous to this type of event.	62	6
201410	732	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Thank you.	62	6
201410	733	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	62	6
201410	734	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I want to follow up about the rate.	62	6
201410	735	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	You talked about wanting to learn more about the effect of the proximity of the rate to the zero bound.	62	6
201410	736	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	When you vary the rate, you’re also varying the distance between the interest rate on excess reserves and the RRP rate.	62	6
201410	737	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	And I think it’s not identified, right?	62	6
201410	738	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I mean, the econometric term—President Williams will correct me if I’m wrong, I’m sure—is I don’t think they’re separately identified.	62	6
201410	739	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	You’re not going to be able to disentangle the two.	62	6
201410	740	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I was wondering if you have a strategy for that.	62	6
201410	741	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	I think there is a problem, and it’s just there unless we move the IOER rate as well, and then it just looks like you’re tightening policy.	62	6
201410	742	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	So eventually we’ll do that experiment, too.	62	6
201410	743	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Do it for real.	62	6
201410	744	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	But I think that we may get at least some signal about the effects of the zero lower bound because we’re going to go down to 3 basis points; we’re going to go up to 10 basis points; going down to 3 is 3 basis points on the spread between IOER and overnight RRP, but also going closer to the zero lower bound.	62	6
201410	745	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	When you go up to 7 basis points, you go up to 10 basis points.	62	6
201410	746	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	For example, if there’s a nonlinearity, you could attribute that to the zero lower bound, right?	62	6
201410	747	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	But you need some auxiliary hypothesis.	62	6
201410	748	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	That’s right.	62	6
201410	749	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	It’s also good to move one thing and hold the other thing constant as well.	62	6
201410	750	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	There’s some econometrics related to that.	62	6
201410	751	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	62	6
201410	752	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	You get the point.	62	6
201410	753	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	It’s going to be hard to draw any independent inference, because you’re obviously looking for information about what happens when IOER rate is 125 basis points.	62	6
201410	754	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	And it’s going to be very imperfect information about that, but I think it’s better to have the information we can get than not.	62	6
201410	755	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	My recollection of the Committee discussion is that there wasn’t that much interest in a spread of 20 or 15 basis points between the IOER and ON RRP rates.	62	6
201410	756	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	So why are we interested in testing 15 basis points for the spread, and 10 basis points for the rate now?	62	6
201410	757	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Again, if we could move them both without implying monetary policy tightening, I think that would give us better information.	62	6
201410	758	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	But this is a way of getting a handle on how sound is the floor that we get from the overnight RRP rate, and what is the effect on demand for this facility.	62	6
201410	759	2014-10-29	meeting	NATALUCCI	Assuming you tried to pick points on the demand curve by moving the rate.	62	6
201410	760	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Yes, I know, but you’re also varying the spread to IOER.	62	6
201410	761	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	So it doesn’t tell you the effect of the rate alone.	62	6
201410	762	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	But the simple thing is, will repo rates move with the overnight RRP?	62	6
201410	763	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	That will tell us something.	62	6
201410	764	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	62	6
201410	765	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And will demand go up or down.	62	6
201410	766	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	The ideal would be demand doesn’t change, we just move the rates up.	62	6
201410	767	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	62	6
201410	768	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201410	769	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In the memo, on page 9, the staff suggests that the Committee could emphasize that it was employing term RRPs as a test of its term RRP tool, that the Committee had not decided whether or not such operations would be used in the future.	62	6
201410	770	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that kind of communication would be desirable, so should I take that as being part of what is being proposed?	62	6
201410	771	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	Well, that statement, if you approve this, would be crystal clear about this.	62	6
201410	772	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	This is just a test.	62	6
201410	773	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Okay.	62	6
201410	774	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I just wanted to be clear.	62	6
201410	775	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks.	62	6
201410	776	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62	6
201410	777	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Are we ready to decide these questions?	62	6
201410	778	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	We have before us two separate resolutions.	63	6
201410	779	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	So let’s go to resolution 1, which pertains to the offering rate.	63	6
201410	780	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Do I have a motion?	63	6
201410	781	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So moved.	63	6
201410	782	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Second?	63	6
201410	783	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Second.	63	6
201410	784	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63	6
201410	785	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	All in favor?	63	6
201410	786	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	[Chorus of ayes]	63	6
201410	787	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Any opposed?	63	6
201410	788	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	63	6
201410	789	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63	6
201410	790	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s go to resolution 2 on trying the term reverse repurchase operations at year-end.	63	6
201410	791	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Do I have a motion?	63	6
201410	792	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So moved.	63	6
201410	793	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Second.	63	6
201410	794	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	All in favor?	63	6
201410	795	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	[Chorus of ayes]	63	6
201410	796	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Any opposed?	63	6
201410	797	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	63	6
201410	798	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63	6
201410	799	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Great.	63	6
201410	800	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	So those two resolutions on year-end testing pass.	63	6
201410	801	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	And finally, we need to ratify domestic open market operations since the September meeting.	63	6
201410	802	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Do I have a motion?	63	6
201410	803	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	63	6
201410	804	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks.	63	6
201410	805	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	63	6
201410	806	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63	6
201410	807	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	The Board meeting is now ended.	63	6
201410	808	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	So let’s continue.	63	6
201410	809	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s go to the economic and financial situation, and I’ll ask Eric Engen to start us off.	11	1
201410	810	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	Thank you.	11	1
201410	811	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	I will be referring to the materials distributed for the US outlook.	11	1
201410	812	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	The net tightening in overall financial conditions since the September Tealbook projection led us to revise down our medium-term economic outlook.	11	1
201410	813	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	However, as you can see from the first panel of your forecast summary exhibit, the spending data that we received since the previous Tealbook resulted in our making only minor revisions to the near-term GDP projection.	11	1
201410	814	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	In particular, although the data on consumer spending that we received after the September Tealbook closed— and reported at the September FOMC meeting—surprised us to the upside, subsequent consumption data were weaker than we expected.	11	1
201410	815	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	As a result, our near- term PCE forecast is about unrevised from our previous Tealbook projection.	11	1
201410	816	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	Revisions to the other major categories of spending were relatively small, and more or less offset each other.	11	1
201410	817	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	The data we received this morning on orders, shipments, and inventories of durable goods had no material effect on our near-term forecast.	11	1
201410	818	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	Over the medium term, we adjusted down our projection for real GDP growth by about ¼ percentage point in each of the next three years.	11	1
201410	819	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	This revision primarily reflects financial conditioning assumptions that, taken as a whole, we see as less supportive of economic activity than those used in September.	11	1
201410	820	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	Specifically, in this Tealbook we have a higher projected path for the dollar and a somewhat lower trajectory for equity prices over the medium term; the negative effects of these revisions on economic activity are only partly offset by the downward revisions we have made to longer-term interest rates.	11	1
201410	821	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	In addition to these changes in financial assumptions, we also have a slightly slower projected pace of foreign economic growth, which is a small drag on US GDP growth, along with a lower expected path for oil prices that provides some boost to domestic economic activity.	11	1
201410	822	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	Since last Wednesday when the October Tealbook projection was closed, equity prices have retraced a portion—but not all—of their decline since the previous Tealbook; however, this would only shave a bit from the downward revision to our projection for GDP growth in the October Tealbook.	11	1
201410	823	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	Most of the revision to projected longer-term interest rates reflects a downward revision to our assumed path for the federal funds rate.	11	1
201410	824	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	We continue to assume that the federal funds rate will lift off from its effective lower bound in the second quarter of 2015.	11	1
201410	825	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	However, reflecting the wider output gap and slightly lower path for core inflation that we have in the current forecast, the inertial Taylor rule that we use to set our policy rate assumption prescribes a funds rate path that rises less steeply after liftoff than that in our September projection.	11	1
201410	826	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	Turning to conditions in the labor market, the September employment report was a little stronger than we had expected.	11	1
201410	827	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	In the household survey, the unemployment rate—shown in panel 2—declined to 5.9 percent in September; we had expected it to hold steady at 6.1 percent.	11	1
201410	828	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	Meanwhile, in the establishment survey, the level of total payroll employment—panel 3—was about 90,000 higher last month than in our previous Tealbook projection.	11	1
201410	829	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	We took some of this better-than-expected news on board in revisiting our near- term forecast for the labor market.	11	1
201410	830	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	Over the remainder of the projection period, however, we weakened our outlook for the labor market in line with the downward revisions we made to the pace of real output growth.	11	1
201410	831	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	In particular, we now expect the unemployment rate to be 5¼ percent at the end of 2017—¼ percentage point higher than in our September forecast, and equal to our estimate of the natural rate.	11	1
201410	832	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	Similarly, the projected level of payroll employment at the end of 2017 is about 700,000 lower than in our previous projection.	11	1
201410	833	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	The next two panels summarize our inflation projection.	11	1
201410	834	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	As you can see from panel 4, we have marked down our near-term projection for total PCE price inflation noticeably; this downward revision to headline inflation is mainly attributable to recent declines in crude oil prices, which we have fed through to our forecast for consumer energy prices.	11	1
201410	835	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	As you can see from panel 5, we also slightly lowered our near-term projection for core PCE price inflation; this revision reflects incoming data that have been a little softer than expected as well as a downward revision to core import prices over the second half of this year.	11	1
201410	836	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	Further out, our core inflation forecast is just a touch lower than in September, reflecting both the wider margin of slack in the current projection and the pass-through of lower core and energy prices.	11	1
201410	837	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	We continue to anticipate that core PCE inflation will move up gradually over the projection period—from 1.5 percent this year to 1.8 percent in 2017—as labor and product markets tighten.	11	1
201410	838	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	As always, numerous risks surround our outlook.	11	1
201410	839	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	The final panel notes two risks to our baseline projection that we presented as alternative scenarios in the Risks and Uncertainty section of the Tealbook.	11	1
201410	840	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	First, as you know, our medium-term inflation projection hinges on the assumption that the longer-term inflation expectations that are relevant for wage and price setting are currently at 1.8 percent.	11	1
201410	841	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	In the scenario titled “Lower Long-Term Inflation Expectations,” we considered the possibility that this assumption is wrong.	11	1
201410	842	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	Specifically, we assumed that the current level of these expectations is 1.5 percent—a value that is comparable to recent actual inflation—and that longer-term expectations are set adaptively with reference to the behavior of actual past inflation.	11	1
201410	843	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	Under these assumptions, core inflation runs about ¼ percentage point below the Tealbook baseline over the medium term and the unemployment rate falls to 4¾ percent by the end of 2017.	11	1
201410	844	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	Liftoff of the federal funds rate is delayed until early 2017; at that time, inflation one to two years ahead remains about ½ percentage point below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-term objective.	11	1
201410	845	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	A second scenario explored the possibility that, although the financial market volatility over the past few weeks seems to have eased, it may instead represent the first installment of what could prove to be a broader and more prolonged reassessment of risk.	11	1
201410	846	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	In particular, we considered a scenario in which heightened risk aversion results in a large reduction in equity prices, persistently wider risk spreads for longer-term interest rates, and lower consumer and business confidence.	11	1
201410	847	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	The resulting hit to economic activity yields an unemployment rate path that is more than a percentage point above the Tealbook baseline by the end of the medium term, with the federal funds rate stuck at the effective lower bound for the next five years.	11	1
201410	848	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	Interestingly, the pace of increases in unit labor costs, and thus price inflation, are essentially unchanged from our baseline, as slower wage growth stemming from a higher unemployment rate is roughly offset by the effect of reduced productivity growth from less capital deepening.	11	1
201410	849	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	Steve Kamin will now continue our presentation.	11	1
201410	850	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Thank you.	11	1
201410	851	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	I’ll be referring to the materials labeled “Material for the Foreign Outlook.”	11	1
201410	852	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	I find it extremely irritating when a company is rolling out a new product—for example, since it seems to be on my mind, Arby’s new Hawaiian BBQ brisket sandwich—and they run commercials for it on television every seven minutes.	11	1
201410	853	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	You may have felt the same way when you read about the effect of the dollar on the US economy in our note to the Committee, again in a box in the Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook section of the Tealbook, and then again in the Risks and Uncertainty section of the Tealbook.	11	1
201410	854	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	All I can say is that, like Arby’s new Hawaiian BBQ brisket sandwich, the dollar has been very much on our minds lately, given its sharp run-up in recent months and the implications of any future appreciation for US activity and prices.	11	1
201410	855	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	If it is any consolation, however, I will not be discussing the dollar until later in my remarks.	11	1
201410	856	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	In the meantime, I would like to address that other elephant in the room, the recent surge in financial volatility around the world.	11	1
201410	857	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Although financial newspapers were running stories to interpret the surge with headlines like “The Global Economy Stalling,” our assessment is that incoming data from abroad, while disappointing, on balance, were hardly weak enough to presage widespread retrenchment.	11	1
201410	858	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, as shown in panel 1, we have marked down our forecast for foreign economic growth just a bit beyond the near term.	11	1
201410	859	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Certainly, the global economic indicators that we follow, such as the index of new export orders shown in panel 2, do not signal an imminent global slowdown.	11	1
201410	860	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Moreover, the rise in the dollar and decline in oil prices we’ve seen in recent months should provide some support for economic activity abroad.	11	1
201410	861	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	To be sure, much of the concern in financial markets has focused on the euro area and China, but even there, the news has not been uniformly bad.	11	1
201410	862	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	In the euro area, as shown in panel 3, the Eurocoin coincident indicator continues to signal expansion, although it has weakened recently.	11	1
201410	863	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	The most recent data, including PMIs, German auto production, and consumer confidence, have been reasonably assuring, and we are projecting that euro-area GDP will continue its paltry recovery in the quarters to come.	11	1
201410	864	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	A second area of concern has been China, where a turndown in the property market, the red line in panel 4, has prompted fears of a financial sector bust, a sharp slowdown in growth, and spillovers to trading partners around the world.	11	1
201410	865	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Such concerns were especially pronounced when data for August showed a sharp decline in industrial activity.	11	1
201410	866	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	In the event, industrial production rebounded in September and third-quarter GDP came in, by our estimate, at a very solid 7¾ percent annual rate, allaying fears of an imminent hard landing.	11	1
201410	867	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Although we’ve marked down our forecast a bit, as domestic demand appears to have lost some momentum, we are still projecting solid growth.	11	1
201410	868	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	All told, as Lorie suggested earlier, our sense is that the earlier downdrafts in markets likely were prompted not so much by markdowns to investors’ modal forecasts for the global outlook but rather by a heightened focus on the downside risks to the outlook, coming after a period when investors had appeared quite sanguine.	11	1
201410	869	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Although markets probably overdid their mood swing, the downside risks are certainly significant.	11	1
201410	870	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	In the euro area, the economy’s underlying momentum is weak enough that it would not take much to push it back into recession.	11	1
201410	871	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Moreover, with headline inflation down to only 0.3 percent, additional declines, even if caused by falling energy prices, could further unhinge inflation expectations, boost real interest rates, and diminish confidence in the authorities’ willingness to do what it takes to support the economy.	11	1
201410	872	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	The ECB apparently is considering additional measures, such as corporate bond purchases, and the recent completion of the bank stress tests is an important achievement, but there are good reasons to be worried.	11	1
201410	873	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	The same is true of China.	11	1
201410	874	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	The recent declines in housing prices and sales are probably helpful in curbing excesses and should not, by themselves, lead to unmanageable stresses.	11	1
201410	875	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	But once begun, it is hard to know when this correction will end.	11	1
201410	876	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Although the Chinese government has the capacity to backstop the financial sector, a vicious cycle of falling property prices, mounting defaults, lending cutbacks, and contractions in spending could unwind so quickly that the authorities fall behind the curve.	11	1
201410	877	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	A hard landing in China, in turn, might trigger distress in other parts of the global economy.	11	1
201410	878	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	As I threatened earlier, these considerations bring us to the dollar, whose run-up in recent months appears attributable in large part to increased concerns about the foreign outlook.	11	1
201410	879	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	As shown in panel 5, the starting point for our forecast of the broad real dollar has moved up 3½ percent between the time of the July Tealbook, the green dashed line, and the present.	11	1
201410	880	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	As shown in panel 6, we anticipate further increases in the dollar against the AFE currencies as, in our baseline forecast, US short-term interest rates rise faster than markets currently expect.	11	1
201410	881	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	But the dollar declines against the EME currencies, panel 7, as the Chinese renminbi appreciates, dragging up the currencies of its Asian neighbors.	11	1
201410	882	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	All told, returning to the solid black line in panel 5, we continue to project some decline in the broad real dollar.	11	1
201410	883	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	However, we are now assuming a bit less dollar depreciation than we had previously.	11	1
201410	884	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	The note we circulated to the Committee last week describes how we have revised our forecasts for the EME currencies in three respects.	11	1
201410	885	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	We now assume that surprises to US interest rates will affect these currencies, we have scaled back the extent to which the Chinese renminbi appreciates over the next year, and we have scaled back how much other Asian currencies will respond to changes in the renminbi.	11	1
201410	886	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	As can be seen by comparing our current forecast with the red dashed line, which represents the forecast that we would have written down for this Tealbook had we not revised our approach, these revisions lead to only a slight lift to our dollar projection, but they should tie our exchange rate forecast more closely to the overall global outlook as well as to surprises in interest rates associated with policy normalization.	11	1
201410	887	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Of course, any forecasting process will have trouble capturing movements in asset prices such as the exchange rate.	11	1
201410	888	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	In consequence, we can hardly preclude the possibility of a further large run-up in the dollar.	11	1
201410	889	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Your next exhibit draws on our SIGMA general equilibrium model to explore the effects of a 10 percent appreciation shock to the dollar, similar to some of the analysis we presented in our note to the Committee and in the Tealbook.	11	1
201410	890	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Starting with panel 1, the blue line shows how the shock is phased in over several quarters and then gradually dies out, assuming that monetary policy (panel 2) follows the staff’s baseline projection and does not respond to the shock.	11	1
201410	891	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Note that the movement of the dollar in this scenario would be very large compared with its variation in recent years, but not entirely unprecedented.	11	1
201410	892	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	In response, and with no cushion from monetary policy, both output growth (panel 3) and core PCE inflation (panel 4) drop below 1 percent on a four-quarter basis.	11	1
201410	893	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Of course, in reality, monetary policy would not remain unchanged, and the red lines in the panels assume that policy responds to the shock in a manner consistent with the Taylor (1999) rule.	11	1
201410	894	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	As shown in panel 2, the federal funds rate lifts off one quarter later than in the baseline and is 50 basis points below baseline by 2016.	11	1
201410	895	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	In consequence, the dollar (panel 1) appreciates less in response to the shock than when monetary policy is held fixed.	11	1
201410	896	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Both GDP growth (panel 3) and, to a lesser extent, inflation (panel 4) fall by less as well.	11	1
201410	897	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Bottom line:  Movements in the dollar can indeed be an important influence on the US economy, although adjustments in monetary policy can moderate its effects.	11	1
201410	898	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Nellie Liang will now continue our presentation.	11	1
201410	899	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Thank you, Steve.	11	1
201410	900	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	I will be referring to “Material for Briefing on Financial Stability Developments.”	FS	FS
201410	901	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	My briefing today summarizes our recent QS financial stability assessment.	FS	FS
201410	902	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Recent financial market developments illustrate the potential for shocks to trigger sizable increases in volatility and declines in asset prices.	FS	FS
201410	903	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	However, the US financial system appears resilient to shocks of the magnitude we’ve seen to date, in line with our judgment that vulnerabilities remain, on balance, at a moderate level.	FS	FS
201410	904	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	While we view asset valuation pressures to be above average—a notable “orange” in our heat map—reflecting some reach-for-yield behavior in a low-rate environment, there is substantially more capital and less short- term wholesale funding in the financial system than in the mid-2000s.	FS	FS
201410	905	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Turning to your first exhibit, as shown in the top-left panel, the largest domestic banking firms reported in their third-quarter earnings releases that their capital exceeded their new fully phased-in Tier 1 common equity requirements, including the proposed international SIFI surcharge.	FS	FS
201410	906	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	For leveraged nonbank financial firms, for which we have much less data, leverage also appears relatively low, though likely it has been rising at hedge funds.	FS	FS
201410	907	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	And as shown to the right, net short-term wholesale funding for the broad financial sector, expressed as a ratio to GDP, has remained low and is back to levels of the early 1990s.	FS	FS
201410	908	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	The lower levels, combined with less leverage, suggest that the potential for fire-sale externalities is much diminished.	FS	FS
201410	909	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Our overall assessment is also supported by subdued growth in household sector debt, shown in the middle-left panel by the decline in the blue shaded area since the crisis.	FS	FS
201410	910	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	As we highlighted in a box in the QS summary, lower debt burdens of households at this time likely make the economy much less vulnerable to a sharp house price decline than in 2007, when high debt levels made spending especially sensitive to a house price collapse.	FS	FS
201410	911	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Turning to asset valuations, as shown in the middle-right panel, the expected real return on equity for the broad market remains in a range of about 6 to 7 percent, despite the recent decline in prices, rise in volatility, and some unwinding of leveraged positions.	FS	FS
201410	912	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Its gap to the real 10-year Treasury yield remains wide.	FS	FS
201410	913	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	While this estimated equity premium suggests a lack of valuation pressures, it is vulnerable to a scenario in which profit margins decline more than expected, which, as described in a box in the Tealbook, could cause a significant decline in stock prices.	FS	FS
201410	914	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	In addition, as we have noted for some time, there are pockets of valuation pressures.	FS	FS
201410	915	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Valuations are elevated for small cap stocks (not shown), and risk spreads are narrow and underwriting standards have been loose in the speculative-grade debt markets.	FS	FS
201410	916	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	As shown in the bottom left, the recent small rise in high-yield bond spreads was concentrated mostly in the near term, while far-term forward spreads, an indicator of investor sentiment toward risk, remained near the bottom end of their historical ranges.	FS	FS
201410	917	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Meanwhile, valuation pressures have broadened to the commercial real estate sector.	FS	FS
201410	918	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Property prices have been rising sharply, and as shown to the right, the price- to-income ratio for office properties, the black line, has been moving up.	FS	FS
201410	919	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	CMBS issuance, the yellow bars, has increased, and competition among lenders for loans has led to increases in loan-to-value ratios and more loans with full or partial interest-only periods, and there appears to be some “shopping” for ratings by CMBS issuers.	FS	FS
201410	920	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Investors have been pushing back, but these trends bear watching.	FS	FS
201410	921	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Turning to your next exhibit, as shown in the top-left panel, issuance of high-yield bonds and syndicated leveraged loans remained solid in Q3; total debt outstanding from these combined sources, the black line, has continued to increase and is now close to $2 trillion.	FS	FS
201410	922	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	In addition, the share of the lower-quality debt has been rising.	FS	FS
201410	923	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	As shown to the right, the fraction of leveraged loans with ratings of B-minus or lower at origination, the orange and red bars combined, continued to increase.	FS	FS
201410	924	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	The rise in debt outstanding is showing through to debt positions of some nonfinancial corporate businesses.	FS	FS
201410	925	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	As shown by the black line in the middle left, the net leverage ratio for speculative-grade firms is nearing the top end of its range over recent decades.	FS	FS
201410	926	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	This increase, however, is not evident for investment-grade firms, which account for most of the nonfinancial corporate debt.	FS	FS
201410	927	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	As noted to the right, models that predict defaults and bond returns suggest that a sustained rapid rise in riskier debt would lead to notably higher default rates and lower returns in a couple of years than in a scenario of moderate debt growth.	FS	FS
201410	928	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	The resulting increase in losses would likely reduce credit availability and contribute to a boom-bust credit cycle, and could increase the risks to your macroeconomic objectives.	FS	FS
201410	929	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	If the losses were borne by leveraged investors, the severity of a credit cycle could be greater.	FS	FS
201410	930	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	While banks mostly distribute the leveraged loans they originate rather than hold them, some banks purchase the triple-A-rated tranches of CLOs, though direct expected losses on such holdings appear, at this point, quite manageable.	FS	FS
201410	931	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Currently, other major buyers of these tranches do not appear to be funding them with short-term debt.	FS	FS
201410	932	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	However, in the June SCOOS, a significant number of dealers reported increased demand by hedge funds to fund CLO tranches, and there are reports of increased use of total return swaps (TRS) to gain exposure to loans and CLOs.	FS	FS
201410	933	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Repo financing and TRS are areas that bear watching, since a decline in collateral values could amplify the effects of higher defaults.	FS	FS
201410	934	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	In addition, any losses from credit or duration risk could be exacerbated by growing liquidity mismatch between corporate bond funds and the underlying assets.	FS	FS
201410	935	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	As shown in the bottom-left panel, bond mutual funds and ETFs have expanded relative to the total corporate bond market, implying that more of these bonds are being held with daily or intradaily claims against them.	FS	FS
201410	936	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	As a consequence, there is a greater risk of liquidity price discounts in the event that funds need to sell bonds to meet redemptions.	FS	FS
201410	937	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	However, while this risk looks to have risen notably, we are not sure if any price discounts or volatility this would generate would be substantial or sustained.	FS	FS
201410	938	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	The recent experience at Pimco provides only limited insight into this risk.	FS	FS
201410	939	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Pimco had nearly $2 trillion of assets under management, of which about $530 billion were in open-end mutual funds.	FS	FS
201410	940	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	As shown by the red line in the bottom-right chart, the unexpected resignation by Bill Gross was followed over subsequent days by substantial outflows from the flagship Total Return Fund (TRF), about 4 percent on the day of the announcement, and at a few other smaller funds that he had managed, shown by the green line.	FS	FS
201410	941	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Notably, other mutual funds at Pimco did not have such substantial outflows, showed by the yellow dashed line, suggesting a lack of contagion.	FS	FS
201410	942	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Moreover, the outflows appeared to have had few lasting imprints on market prices.	FS	FS
201410	943	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	The lessons learned from this episode, however, are limited because the TRF had built up a substantial liquidity cushion prior to the announcement well in excess of the withdrawals, and this event was idiosyncratic, rather than arising from more general concerns about asset prices.	FS	FS
201410	944	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Your final exhibit concludes by noting a few policy initiatives that the staff are pursuing related to specific financial vulnerabilities.	FS	FS
201410	945	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	On leveraged loans, supervisors continue to evaluate ways to improve adherence to the leveraged lending guidance.	FS	FS
201410	946	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	To date, our monitoring suggests only limited migration of underwriting to outside of the regulated banking sector, although some smaller credits are being underwritten and distributed by nonbank firms.	FS	FS
201410	947	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Last week, we released the macroeconomic scenarios for CCAR 2015 for the 31 largest BHCs to assess their ability to weather a severe recession.	FS	FS
201410	948	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Relative to last year, this year’s severely adverse scenario specified slightly more severe stresses in the riskier segments of corporate debt markets as well as higher oil prices.	FS	FS
201410	949	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	In the adverse scenario, which is also required under Dodd-Frank, we specified an up and flatter yield curve, which introduces some funding cost stresses.	FS	FS
201410	950	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Separately, the staff has been evaluating interest rate risk in the trading books at the six largest banks.	FS	FS
201410	951	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Our analysis suggests direct losses from interest rate shocks are quite limited, and we did not find in our limited screening that there is a significant concentration among sellers of interest rate protection.	FS	FS
201410	952	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	That is, we don’t find an “AIG” of interest-rate risk.	FS	FS
201410	953	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	That said, many banks’ trading books appear highly correlated.	FS	FS
201410	954	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	On asset management, we are working with other FSOC agencies to evaluate possible systemic risks associated with asset management activities, including the use of debt and derivatives, liquidity transformation, and operational risks.	FS	FS
201410	955	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Finally, the sharp price moves in Treasury and other futures on October 15, which Lorie described earlier, suggest that high-frequency and algorithmic trading activity may contribute in perhaps unexpected ways to intraday volatility and elevated correlations across asset markets.	FS	FS
201410	956	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	The staff are continuing to work to better understand the events of that day.	FS	FS
201410	957	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are happy to take any questions.	FS	FS
201410	958	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for any of our presenters?	12	1
201410	959	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman Dudley.	12	1
201410	960	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thanks.	12	1
201410	961	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I have two questions.	12	1
201410	962	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	First, I want to thank the staff for doing all of the work on the dollar.	12	1
201410	963	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I raised it at the last meeting.	12	1
201410	964	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I wanted to see what would happen if the dollar went up a lot.	12	1
201410	965	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	You did a lot of work describing that.	12	1
201410	966	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I have one very short question on the dollar.	12	1
201410	967	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	What probability would you put on the 10 percent appreciation scenario materializing?	12	1
201410	968	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s the question for Steve.	12	1
201410	969	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Then I have sort of a meta question about the Tealbook forecast.	12	1
201410	970	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t know that anyone can actually answer this question.	12	1
201410	971	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Maybe I actually got it wrong.	12	1
201410	972	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But it seems to me, when I’ve been watching how the Tealbook updates their forecast meeting to meeting, it seems like the Tealbook takes on movements in the real economic variables only partially.	12	1
201410	973	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So if payroll employment is really strong in a quarter, they think, well, it’s going to be weaker next quarter.	12	1
201410	974	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And they do seem to take on the 10-year Treasury yield only partially, because the Treasury yield is sort of anchored by the path of the federal funds rate.	12	1
201410	975	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But when I look at how the Tealbook reacts to movements in the dollar and the stock market, it seems that the staff takes it on to a much greater degree.	12	1
201410	976	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In other words, they sort of mark to the current value of the dollar and the current value of the stock market.	12	1
201410	977	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess I don’t completely understand.	12	1
201410	978	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	First, is it true that there is this difference?	12	1
201410	979	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And, second, if there is this difference, what’s the logic behind it?	12	1
201410	980	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me if the forecast, in fact, is the right forecast, then shouldn’t the stock market and the dollar, just like the 10-year yield, adjust to how the forecast materializes?	12	1
201410	981	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Is my supposition correct?	12	1
201410	982	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And if it’s not, tell me why.	12	1
201410	983	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And, if it is correct, then why the difference for some aspects of the Tealbook forecast?	12	1
201410	984	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I ask because I notice the Tealbook seems to move around a lot meeting to meeting based on how these financial variables move.	12	1
201410	985	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I ask myself the question, should we be reacting so much to market developments?	12	1
201410	986	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s sort of a meta question.	12	1
201410	987	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Why don’t I start with the dollar to buy time for my colleagues?	12	1
201410	988	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	On the dollar, I think there are two questions.	12	1
201410	989	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	First, what is the probability of it indeed increasing by 10 percent?	12	1
201410	990	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	I think our staff actually looked into these variations in the dollar historically using our data and came up with a number in the neighborhood of 10 percent.	12	1
201410	991	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	So a 10 percent chance of it rising that much.	12	1
201410	992	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Over what period?	12	1
201410	993	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Actually, maybe Chris over there could answer that.	12	1
201410	994	2014-10-29	meeting	ERCEG	Three quarters.	12	1
201410	995	2014-10-29	meeting	ERCEG	That it would rise 10 percent within three quarters.	12	1
201410	996	2014-10-29	meeting	ERCEG	Some of our staff ran a random walk model of the dollar and assessed the probability that it would rise at least 10 percent within three quarters.	12	1
201410	997	2014-10-29	meeting	ERCEG	It came up with a number on the order of 10 percent.	12	1
201410	998	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Okay.	12	1
201410	999	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	I thought Vice Chairman Dudley’s question was, over what historical period did you do that analysis?	12	1
201410	1000	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	ERCEG:  I think they went back roughly 30 years.	12	1
201410	1001	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	All right.	12	1
201410	1002	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Fine.	12	1
201410	1003	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s a good answer.	12	1
201410	1004	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Let’s put it this way.	12	1
201410	1005	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	If you have to think of choosing a random date in that 30-year period compared with now, it seems to me, based on the evolution of the economy, that now it might have a higher likelihood.	12	1
201410	1006	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes.	12	1
201410	1007	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I would think it would probably be higher than that.	12	1
201410	1008	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	So 10 percent will be the low number there.	12	1
201410	1009	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	And then, your other question is, well, how do we adjust our forecast in light of these changes in asset prices?	12	1
201410	1010	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Certainly, for the dollar, I think our view takes into account a couple of things.	12	1
201410	1011	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Number one, the basis for our forecast, before we add things onto it, is a random-walk model generated under the assumption that the current level of the dollar incorporates all expectation of future developments that the market already perceives.	12	1
201410	1012	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But isn’t that future expectation based on their view of how the economy is going to evolve?	12	1
201410	1013	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And our view of how the economy would evolve might be different.	12	1
201410	1014	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Right.	12	1
201410	1015	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	And when that is true, that is when we add to that.	12	1
201410	1016	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Okay.	12	1
201410	1017	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	You do.	12	1
201410	1018	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Exactly.	12	1
201410	1019	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	That’s when we look at how we think interest rates are going to evolve.	12	1
201410	1020	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	We compare it with how the market thinks interest rates are going to evolve.	12	1
201410	1021	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	And if, for example, we think that US interest rates are going to rise more than the market expects, then we expect that in the future the markets will be surprised by interest rates rising.	12	1
201410	1022	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	In that circumstance, the dollar will rise, and we will build that into our current forecast.	12	1
201410	1023	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But there are these level shifts.	12	1
201410	1024	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Yes.	12	1
201410	1025	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	But then when the level shifts happen, we basically, in that random walk way, start with the new level and then add our “surprise factors” on top of that, just because we think that it incorporates all of the incoming information that has occurred.	12	1
201410	1026	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	And an important point to make, which I think will distinguish this from the 10-year bond yield, is that we don’t really have any good anchors for what the exchange rate ought to be.	12	1
201410	1027	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	In other words, you can come up with measures of the equilibrium exchange rate or an equilibrium dollar based on, for example, current account considerations or things like that.	12	1
201410	1028	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	But we think that those are extremely poor attractors of the actual dollar.	12	1
201410	1029	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	In other words, the dollar tends not to move toward whatever equilibrium you pick.	12	1
201410	1030	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I can see that.	12	1
201410	1031	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And how about the stock market?	12	1
201410	1032	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	ENGEN:  As you correctly pointed out, our longer-term interest rates are anchored by our assumed path for policy rates.	12	1
201410	1033	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	On the stock market, we do not have an anchor that is as hard and fast, say, as an assumed path for the policy rate, but we do have a view that is informed by models on what the equity premium will be moving toward.	12	1
201410	1034	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	One way to think about it is, if our view on the equity premium at the end of the medium term is unchanged, then our path will not level-shift for stock prices.	12	1
201410	1035	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The current changes will be retraced at some other time.	12	1
201410	1036	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And indeed, in this Tealbook, the reduction in current equity prices, at least at the time of the Tealbook, was greater than the reduction in the endpoint further out.	12	1
201410	1037	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We actually have slightly faster assumed equity price increases over the medium term.	12	1
201410	1038	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	To give a little bit of advertising, not in this next round but the round after, we are planning one of our framework memos that will discuss how we put together the models we use for our financial assumptions.	12	1
201410	1039	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But that equity-premium model is informed by earnings projections as well as projections for the economy.	12	1
201410	1040	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Okay.	12	1
201410	1041	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Good.	12	1
201410	1042	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	12	1
201410	1043	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201410	1044	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I had a comment and a question.	12	1
201410	1045	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My comment builds on the conversation we had earlier about market-based measures of inflation compensation.	12	1
201410	1046	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I know that Tealbook, Book A, makes significant use of market-based measures of inflation expectations.	12	1
201410	1047	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And as I talked about earlier, I find these market-based measures particularly helpful.	12	1
201410	1048	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I especially like what the Tealbook calls their “model-free” nature.	12	1
201410	1049	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is the language used in figure 1 in the box “Recent Declines in Inflation Compensation” on pages 52–53.	12	1
201410	1050	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	These market-based data are reflecting the assessments that actual households and firms are putting on the likelihood of events, but also the nature of the losses that are going to be affecting them during those events.	12	1
201410	1051	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we see that risk premiums are moving around, as I indicated earlier, it is telling you something about how bad the households and firms expect those events to be, not just how likely they are going to be.	12	1
201410	1052	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I think that’s something we should be taking into account in our own assessments of policy.	12	1
201410	1053	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I hope the analysis presented to the FOMC by the staff will continue to feature these market-based probability distributions.	12	1
201410	1054	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My own staff would be happy to work with the Board staff or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York staff on increasing the use of such data.	12	1
201410	1055	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s my comment.	12	1
201410	1056	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My question is about the long-run inflation outlook.	12	1
201410	1057	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So we get back to 2 percent, even though underlying inflation right now is at 1.8 percent.	12	1
201410	1058	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What makes that happen?	12	1
201410	1059	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	In both this Tealbook and prior Tealbooks, the factor that is the most important—it’s the key factor—is the credibility of the Committee.	12	1
201410	1060	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	With an understanding that we certainly don’t have great ideas and knowledge of how expectations are formed and what influences them, we assume that the credibility of the Committee will eventually get inflation expectations of wage and price setters back up to 2 percent.	12	1
201410	1061	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	Now, the longer-term projection in the previous Tealbook had the unemployment rate going below the natural rate, and that helped to move actual inflation back to 2 percent more quickly.	12	1
201410	1062	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	But it was still based on our assumption of credibility.	12	1
201410	1063	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	And it’s our assumption of credibility now that gets inflation eventually back up to 2 percent, but, I would note, at a much slower speed than what we had even in the previous Tealbook.	12	1
201410	1064	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	Then, with some undershooting on the unemployment rate, it was 2020 when the longer-term projection got back to 2 percent.	12	1
201410	1065	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	It now is only 1.9 percent, still below 2 percent, in 2020, and it’s not back until the end of 2021 or 2022.	12	1
201410	1066	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	So it’s a slower process, but it’s that assumption of credibility that is the key.	12	1
201410	1067	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But statistically, I guess that’s some kind of autonomous movement in underlying inflation?	12	1
201410	1068	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I mean, you don’t really have a good way to model it.	12	1
201410	1069	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll let you answer that.	12	1
201410	1070	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	That’s basically correct.	12	1
201410	1071	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	It’s an assumption that it will eventually move up to 2 percent.	12	1
201410	1072	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	We do not have a good model by any means on how those expectations will change.	12	1
201410	1073	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	12	1
201410	1074	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Do you think that the 0.3 percentage point difference between the PCE price index and the CPI could explain how we get to 1.8 percent, and the markets get stuck there because the markets think we’re looking at the CPI?	12	1
201410	1075	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	I guess that’s possible.	12	1
201410	1076	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	In terms of market-based expectations, say, from TIPS, clearly those are based on CPI.	12	1
201410	1077	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	So they should be adding a differential in terms of about one-third of a percentage point, the difference between CPI and PCE inflation, on average.	12	1
201410	1078	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	I don’t know whether the expectations of actual wage and price setters—aside from people in financial markets—are taking account of that.	12	1
201410	1079	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201410	1080	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	12	1
201410	1081	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201410	1082	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I, too, have two questions.	12	1
201410	1083	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I’ll start with the question that builds on really quite a notable markdown in economic growth in the first quarter and the first half of next year from the September Tealbook.	12	1
201410	1084	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	The question is:  How and when will we be able to confirm which track we’re on?	12	1
201410	1085	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	The October Tealbook has solid 3 percent growth in the final quarter with payroll gains at about 225,000, and then starting at the beginning of the year, we slow down.	12	1
201410	1086	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I think that’s the basic narrative.	12	1
201410	1087	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Would it be fair to say that it’s not clear whether the data are coming in closer to the October or the September Tealbook until well into the first quarter at best, and maybe quite a bit later?	12	1
201410	1088	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	And if we’re thinking about a liftoff decision, my question is:  What will you look at to distinguish which track we’re on?	12	1
201410	1089	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	Well, first of all, on your first point that things are slowing going into next year, the main changes in this Tealbook were to the financial conditioning assumptions.	12	1
201410	1090	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	Those take a little time to start to build in, and so at least right now, because of some other factors, we don’t see large effects in this second half of the year.	12	1
201410	1091	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGEN	I guess, as always, we’ll look at the incoming data and make some assessment of what we think it implies as we move forward, so no different process than normal in terms of trying to assess which track we’re on.	12	1
201410	1092	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	The second question is to Steve on how SIGMA models the exchange rate sensitivity of US exports.	12	1
201410	1093	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	You seem to have concluded that there’s potential, at least, for a fairly strong effect over the next three years of a higher dollar, particularly if we get the shock of 10 percent.	12	1
201410	1094	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I took a look at the structure of exports, and 27 percent of them are to North America, essentially two-way flows around supply chain effects, so arguably probably not all that sensitive.	12	1
201410	1095	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Some of them are commodities, and the commodity prices themselves have gone south as the exchange rate has gone north.	12	1
201410	1096	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	So how do you think about that?	12	1
201410	1097	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I mean, the basic question is:  How price-sensitive do you think exports really are, and how does that then translate into a GDP effect?	12	1
201410	1098	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	The results that we’ve recorded in the papers and in the Tealbook, first of all, are based on actual physical regressions of our exports on exchange rates and foreign output.	12	1
201410	1099	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	So to the extent that there are issues like two-way trade, a heavy commodity component, and other factors that might end up reducing the responsiveness to price of these exports, that will show up in our regressions.	12	1
201410	1100	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Our parameters in some sense already incorporate that.	12	1
201410	1101	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Broadly speaking—and I’m happy to be corrected by our experts over there—a 1 percent rise in the dollar will depress exports in the neighborhood of 1 percent; is that right, Joe?	12	1
201410	1102	2014-10-29	meeting	GRUBER	Yes, that’s about right.	12	1
201410	1103	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	And then, with exports being only a little over 10 percent of US GDP, that translates effectively into about one-tenth on GDP.	12	1
201410	1104	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Then, in terms of the judgmental forecast that we discussed and showed you in the paper that went to the Committee, that gets ramped up by about another half, taking into account spending multipliers.	12	1
201410	1105	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	12	1
201410	1106	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	My question is for Nellie, and it’s really on your last two bullets.	12	1
201410	1107	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Two weeks ago when the 10-year Treasury fell below 2 percent, I assumed that the Bloomberg feed was wrong and thought it was quite peculiar that something that was so actively traded and is generally viewed as so liquid could move so much.	12	1
201410	1108	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	And when I tried to find the economic news, there wasn’t really anything that struck me—there were some soft reports, but nothing that seemed two standard deviations out of what anybody would have expected.	12	1
201410	1109	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	So understanding how that market could move so much relates to your last two bullets, and I was wondering, do we have position data on broker-dealers?	12	1
201410	1110	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	What kind of information are you using?	12	1
201410	1111	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because when we start thinking about exiting and there actually is news about rates going up as opposed to rates going down, the same processes in reverse could be very destructive of what we’re trying to accomplish.	12	1
201410	1112	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think these last two bullets have become increasingly important as we’ve seen such a big and liquid market move so much.	12	1
201410	1113	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	So what kind of data are you pulling in to try to think about that?	12	1
201410	1114	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’d just be curious whether we have the data we need to do that.	12	1
201410	1115	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Let me start by saying we are still very much looking at this, and we want to be careful not to suggest that we know.	12	1
201410	1116	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	In the data that we have available, at least if you look at Treasury futures, say, at the CME, you can see moves—Treasury prices started to rise and yields fell on the retail sales, and then there was a window starting around 9:34 where you saw some big moves.	12	1
201410	1117	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	There are data from the CME that are at 100 milliseconds or some kind of unit like that.	12	1
201410	1118	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	You do not know who is on what side, but you can see to a limited extent the size of order books, and you can see volumes and, of course, prices.	12	1
201410	1119	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	There are some data from the Treasury market—for example, BrokerTec, which we have access to—and there are people pulling that together now.	12	1
201410	1120	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	There are limitations on us receiving the actual position data the CFTC would have.	12	1
201410	1121	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	There are, literally, indemnification clauses in the Dodd-Frank Act that require us to do some work, but we are talking to CFTC staff and working on that.	12	1
201410	1122	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	If we had all three of those, and maybe one more, we would get a pretty good picture.	12	1
201410	1123	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Whether we can get them all together is hard to know, but I do think we’ll be able to develop a reasonable picture, maybe not exact, but if we have the CFTC data we could probably do it better.	12	1
201410	1124	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Just to add to Nellie’s comments, we have the two big electronic trading platforms in the over-the-counter market, eSpeed and BrokerTec.	12	1
201410	1125	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Right.	12	1
201410	1126	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	And we have some order book data, and we suspect we’ll be able to get those with names that would identify who was an algorithmic trading shop and who was not.	12	1
201410	1127	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	That may be useful in understanding what a typical trade day looks like and then what these days look like.	12	1
201410	1128	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	We have some positioning data that we get from the primary dealers, but that’s just the primary-dealer entity within the institution, and those are usually weekly in terms of the actual security.	12	1
201410	1129	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	Then we have broader data that we can look at in coupon buckets of Treasury securities that they have.	12	1
201410	1130	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	The MarketSource piece on Friday is worth reading for what we knew as of Friday.	12	1
201410	1131	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	It gives you a feeling for how big the moves were.	12	1
201410	1132	2014-10-29	meeting	POTTER	The move between 8:30 and 9:00 in the Treasury market was about a six-standard-deviation move relative to retail sales, and then after that I think, well, all hell broke loose in some sense.	12	1
201410	1133	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	And I think what’s interesting from the data we’ve looked at thus far is the volumes were record sizes.	12	1
201410	1134	2014-10-29	meeting	LOGAN	So the trade sizes were very small, but there were very many trades going through at much smaller sizes, which was maybe different than the big price gap that we were hearing about on the phones when we first also looked at Bloomberg screens and thought there was a mistake.	12	1
201410	1135	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Right, and then you see a correlation across assets as well, such as at 9:30.	12	1
201410	1136	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	The S&P 500 E-mini futures and some of the FX contracts did the same thing at the same time.	12	1
201410	1137	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	So there are some things to track down.	12	1
201410	1138	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	12	1
201410	1139	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Any further questions?	12	1
201410	1140	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	12	1
201410	1141	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	President Rosengren asked one of the questions I was going to ask.	12	1
201410	1142	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	And there have been a lot of questions asked, so I have a comment disguised as a question.	12	1
201410	1143	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	It goes back to your comment about the Treasury.	12	1
201410	1144	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	When I was at the Carter Administration Treasury Department and then went to Brown Brothers—this is in the last century—I joined the Foreign Exchange Advisory Group.	12	1
201410	1145	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	It was a great business then, even though the markets were less sophisticated, because we had fewer currencies to worry about, we had a G-6.	12	1
201410	1146	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	One thing you learned is that it’s notoriously difficult to predict exchange rates, even then, especially short-term movements over a one-year time horizon.	12	1
201410	1147	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	And most models don’t—or didn’t then, at least— significantly do better than a forecast of no change.	12	1
201410	1148	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Of course, you didn’t tell your clients that, because they paid you to recommend different strategies.	12	1
201410	1149	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I don’t think things have much changed.	12	1
201410	1150	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I read both papers very carefully.	12	1
201410	1151	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	The one thing I learned back then, which I still think is to be considered and which the paper in terms of the effect of the dollar on US GDP and inflation did not really deal with, is, in the very end, why.	12	1
201410	1152	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I’d like to see a fuller explanation of that.	12	1
201410	1153	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	The one thing that matters is whether price movements move according to endogenous developments or exogenous developments.	12	1
201410	1154	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I enjoyed reading both papers.	12	1
201410	1155	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	And I don’t mean to be too critical, but it was rather uninformative on that front, because you have a chicken-and-egg situation.	12	1
201410	1156	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	You could argue that one of the reasons that the dollar has appreciated is because our economic outlook has improved.	12	1
201410	1157	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	And indeed, the paper goes back to July.	12	1
201410	1158	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Well, since July, I think by most measurements, compared with the assumption at the beginning of July, the outlook for the US economy has improved.	12	1
201410	1159	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	That’s an endogenous development.	12	1
201410	1160	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Let me pose a question.	12	1
201410	1161	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Could you do a little bit better or more on that last part of the paper and try to answer that in a fuller manner?	12	1
201410	1162	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I think that would give us more insight than the observations that existed in the earlier part.	12	1
201410	1163	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	If it’s endogenous, then it is led by the fact that we are outperforming, or we have surprised to the upside.	12	1
201410	1164	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	And I think it makes a big difference.	12	1
201410	1165	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	It is less worrisome to me that we have dollar strength as a result of our output increases or improved economic performance than if it is the other case.	12	1
201410	1166	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	We very much take that point, and that’s in fact why we added that section at the end of one of the memos.	12	1
201410	1167	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	That’s a tiny section.	12	1
201410	1168	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Right.	12	1
201410	1169	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Why was it so tiny?	12	1
201410	1170	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	There are a couple of issues.	12	1
201410	1171	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	First of all, this is an issue of how to parse out the changes in the forecast that we have made, let’s say between July and now, and their effect on the US economy.	12	1
201410	1172	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	And in that regard, you certainly have to take into account, what are these impulses that tend to drive economic growth up, and thus, lift the dollar?	12	1
201410	1173	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	And then, what might be the partial equilibrium direct effect of the rise in the dollar once it occurred, even an endogenous response to the US economy’s better outlook?	12	1
201410	1174	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Let’s put it this way.	12	1
201410	1175	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Even if you fully took on board that much of the rise in the dollar might have been an endogenous response to the US economy, in doing the exercise of parsing out the different influences on the US outlook, you’d still want to know what that direct effect was.	12	1
201410	1176	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	That was one of the considerations in play.	12	1
201410	1177	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	The other one was, when we took a serious look at what were the factors that lifted the dollar over the course of the last four months or so, we came to the view that there was some favorable incoming data on the United States that was indeed tending to boost the dollar, as well as unfavorable data for foreign economies.	12	1
201410	1178	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	But that was not the whole picture, and by our reckoning that wasn’t even most of the run-up in the dollar.	12	1
201410	1179	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	By our reckoning, most of the run- up in the dollar seemed to reflect worries or uncertainties about the outlook rather than markdowns to agents’ modal forecasts for the economies.	12	1
201410	1180	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	And so in terms of parsing through the effects, insofar as that wasn’t a genuine increase in US growth, but was rather changes in agents’ distributions over future likelihoods of economic growth, we thought that a lot of that run-up in the dollar could thus be treated as if it were exogenous, at least in the growth process.	12	1
201410	1181	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	So that’s one of the other reasons why we tend to focus on explaining the exogenous run-up in the dollar.	12	1
201410	1182	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Thank you.	12	1
201410	1183	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12	1
201410	1184	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest we take a break and resume at 3:45.	12	1
201410	1185	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	There will be an opportunity then for comments on financial stability, and then we’ll go into the economic go- round.	12	1
201410	1186	2014-10-29	meeting		[Coffee break]	12	1
201410	1187	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Next, there is an opportunity to comment on financial stability.	FS	FS
201410	1188	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	We won’t have a full go-round, but anybody who would like to make a comment, please feel free to do so.	FS	FS
201410	1189	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	FS	FS
201410	1190	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Just to follow-up, my last question was on high-frequency data, and I did have an opportunity in the Supervision Committee to talk a little bit about data that doesn’t come out with such high frequency.	FS	FS
201410	1191	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Both the Chair and Governor Tarullo have talked about wholesale funding, but there really isn’t very much data on the Y–9 or the Call Report, particularly the Y–9, where broker-dealers are.	FS	FS
201410	1192	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	And I think it actually would be useful to have a little bit more information on both the maturity structure of repurchase agreements and other wholesale financing arrangements, as well as to think about the collateral arrangements, because I believe it gets to some of the same issues that we were just talking about in terms of how sensitive interest rates are to movements, and how a very important intermediary might react when there starts to be a fairly large movement in interest rates.	FS	FS
201410	1193	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	So there is an opportunity to think more broadly, not only about the high-frequency data, but also about quarterly data that perhaps would give us a better feeling of how some of this financing occurred.	FS	FS
201410	1194	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	FS	FS
201410	1195	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Eric and I had this discussion in the Supervision Committee yesterday.	FS	FS
201410	1196	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I both agree with Eric and would note that there is going to be an opportunity, almost a necessity, to do something along these lines, as we have more regulations that take account of maturity structures, either for liquidity regulation purposes, or if, as is quite possible, we go ahead with a surcharge for the GSIBs that includes a component based on vulnerability to funding runs.	FS	FS
201410	1197	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	And this is actually the right time to think about how we want to standardize reporting, which would align with the regulatory categories that will get created.	FS	FS
201410	1198	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I think there is not only an opportunity to do it, but that this is the time to do it.	FS	FS
201410	1199	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	And following up on yesterday’s discussion, we’re going to try to get input from certainly the LISCC supervising Reserve Banks, but also anybody else who wants to contribute, as to how exactly we want to make those changes.	FS	FS
201410	1200	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	FS	FS
201410	1201	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	FS	FS
201410	1202	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll be brief.	FS	FS
201410	1203	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’d like to thank the staff for their excellent assessment of the financial-stability situation.	FS	FS
201410	1204	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As we know all too well from past experiences, financial-system shocks can do long-lasting harm to achievement of our inflation and employment goals.	FS	FS
201410	1205	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And adjustments to monetary policy do have the potential to reduce the probability of such shocks.	FS	FS
201410	1206	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I continue to see financial-stability analysis as vital in evaluating whether the current path of policy is appropriate.	FS	FS
201410	1207	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I want to make two comments on that.	FS	FS
201410	1208	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One is about the linkage between our dual- mandate risks and financial stability.	FS	FS
201410	1209	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would encourage the staff to continue to integrate analysis of financial stability into the assessment of risks in the Tealbook.	FS	FS
201410	1210	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The QS report, quite appropriately, focuses on vulnerabilities, but ultimately the FOMC needs to know how those vulnerabilities translate into risks to prices and employment, as I was describing.	FS	FS
201410	1211	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	To go even further, of course, it would be desirable, too, for us to know what monetary policy can do about those risks in the event that supervision and regulation are not adequate to control them.	FS	FS
201410	1212	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is obviously work in progress, an agenda that I know we all want to get to, but I think it will start to become more and more pressing as the economy improves.	FS	FS
201410	1213	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My second comment builds on something I said last time about the benefits of confidential supervisory information as an input into this kind of analysis.	FS	FS
201410	1214	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I had some prepared remarks on this, but actually the point has already been made for me by Nellie’s presentation.	FS	FS
201410	1215	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we look at exhibit 2, at the bottom right, I thought the discussion of fund redemptions at Pimco was very nice and very helpful to the Committee, and that built on confidential supervisory information—information that is not in the QS report directly, but I think, nonetheless, could be of use to us.	FS	FS
201410	1216	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	FS	FS
201410	1217	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	FS	FS
201410	1218	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	FS	FS
201410	1219	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Nellie, if I could just ask about the first and third charts on exhibit 2.	FS	FS
201410	1220	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t quite remember how you described what was happening in chart 1 on exhibit 2.	FS	FS
201410	1221	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	That’s a pretty impressive rise in the total outstanding of leveraged loans and high-yield bonds since 2004, and even since 2007.	FS	FS
201410	1222	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	So it just kept on going.	FS	FS
201410	1223	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	And the high yield spread, as seen in chart 5 on exhibit 1, is about 6 percentage points.	FS	FS
201410	1224	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	That’s a pretty high yield.	FS	FS
201410	1225	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	What are these bonds doing?	FS	FS
201410	1226	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Starting with exhibit 2, chart 1 and chart 3, that is the outstandings of leveraged loans and high-yield debt combined.	FS	FS
201410	1227	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	It grew in the early part of the 2000s, from 2004 to 2007.	FS	FS
201410	1228	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Then we had a crisis.	FS	FS
201410	1229	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	There was a spike in default rates.	FS	FS
201410	1230	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	It flattened out.	FS	FS
201410	1231	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	It has now been growing again pretty rapidly.	FS	FS
201410	1232	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	This is something we look at because it tends to be a predictor of defaults in models that we use and a predictor of bond returns.	FS	FS
201410	1233	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Following through to chart 3 on exhibit 2, the black line has the leverage ratios for speculative-grade firms.	FS	FS
201410	1234	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	These are the below-investment-grade, the single-B kind of entities.	FS	FS
201410	1235	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	And you can see their leverage ratios are picking up from, say, 2011, when they had bottomed out.	FS	FS
201410	1236	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	So these are designed to think about default rates rising over the next couple years.	FS	FS
201410	1237	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	Usually, there is a lag in the process.	FS	FS
201410	1238	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	The high-yield bond spread at the bottom of exhibit 1 is currently about 350 to 400 basis points, and we decompose that into a near-term and a far-term piece.	FS	FS
201410	1239	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	The far-term spread is between years 9 and 10, where the assumption is that investors don’t have views about how defaults will change between years 9 and 10.	FS	FS
201410	1240	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	And so any differences in spreads presumably reflect a change in risk sentiment, and that’s the lighter blue line.	FS	FS
201410	1241	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	That’s at a low level, and we think of that as investor risk sentiment.	FS	FS
201410	1242	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	The near-term spread reflects the risk and the risk premium between years 2 and 3, and it’s a bit higher.	FS	FS
201410	1243	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	And it has turned up since July.	FS	FS
201410	1244	2014-10-29	meeting	LIANG	It could be capturing some expectation of higher credit risk.	FS	FS
201410	1245	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	FS	FS
201410	1246	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks.	FS	FS
201410	1247	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Any further comments on financial stability?	FS	FS
201410	1248	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	FS	FS
201410	1249	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, why don’t we go into our economic round, and we’ll start with President Rosengren.	13	1
201410	1250	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	1251	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	My forecast for the real economy has not changed much from the last FOMC meeting, despite the financial market turbulence.	13	1
201410	1252	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	While some of the international data proved to be softer than expected, that surprise did not seem commensurate with the financial market movements of the last several weeks.	13	1
201410	1253	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	My current expectation is that some of the recent asset price movements will prove fleeting, leaving at most a small imprint on real domestic conditions.	13	1
201410	1254	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In effect, I am assuming that there was a temporary flight to quality that will abate as incoming data show only a modest reduction in global growth.	13	1
201410	1255	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	While the dollar has appreciated, my forecast had already built in some appreciation.	13	1
201410	1256	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	As a result, I’ve only marked down my net exports slightly to reflect the somewhat greater appreciation of the dollar and somewhat weaker data in Europe than I had previously expected.	13	1
201410	1257	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I do have some concerns that the combination of an appreciated dollar and reduced prices for oil, grain, and other commodities makes it unlikely we will reach 2 percent inflation as quickly as many of our SEP forecasts predict.	13	1
201410	1258	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Adding in the very modest increases in wages to date, it is quite likely that we will see both core and total PCE inflation rates remaining at 1½ percent or less for several quarters.	13	1
201410	1259	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because I believe that liftoff should not occur until there’s clear evidence that full employment is within reach and inflation is trending toward our 2 percent goal, my monetary policy assumption differs from that of the Tealbook in that it both defers liftoff and assumes a more gradual increase in interest rates after liftoff from the zero lower bound.	13	1
201410	1260	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The longer we remain well below our 2 percent target, the more risk we take that inflation expectations drift down, implying a loss of credibility with the public.	13	1
201410	1261	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The experience from Japan and now Europe indicates that indifference to very low inflation rates can generate a significant loss of confidence in the ability of a central bank to hit its 2 percent target.	13	1
201410	1262	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is hard to rationalize a 10-year German bond trading around 85 basis points and a 10-year Japanese bond trading below 50 basis points with any confidence that 10-year average inflation rates will be anywhere close to the publicly announced targets.	13	1
201410	1263	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The financial market attention to inflation breakeven rates highlights an increased focus on our ability to hit our 2 percent inflation target.	13	1
201410	1264	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I currently believe the flight to quality has temporarily distorted Treasury prices in a way that obscures the inflation expectations embedded in them, were the low inflation breakevens to persist, I’d become more concerned that they were signaling a downward drift in longer-run inflation expectations.	13	1
201410	1265	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	While my baseline forecast for real variables has not changed significantly, I would say that the financial market turbulence has led me to place more weight on potential downside risks to my forecast.	13	1
201410	1266	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	There are at least two possibilities here.	13	1
201410	1267	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	First, it could be that the financial market movements correctly portend weaker global economic growth, in which case we will all be revising our forecasts downward over time.	13	1
201410	1268	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	But it’s also possible that a global tightening of financial conditions could weaken developed economies enough to cause a slowdown in growth.	13	1
201410	1269	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In either case, I would become more concerned about whether we can reach our employment and inflation goals within the forecast horizon.	13	1
201410	1270	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	As many have noted, because of our limited ability to offset negative shocks when the funds rate is at the zero lower bound, the costs from the downside risks are much greater than those from risks to the upside.	13	1
201410	1271	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	This highlights the advantage of a patient monetary policy, which underlies my current forecast.	13	1
201410	1272	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	1273	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201410	1274	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13	1
201410	1275	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	1276	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Economic conditions in the Eighth District have been mixed since our previous meeting.	13	1
201410	1277	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Anecdotal reports are generally upbeat concerning shipments, sales, and commercial real estate.	13	1
201410	1278	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Contacts in the transportation industry expect to be operating near capacity due to a large fall harvest, increased imports, and e-commerce holiday sales growth.	13	1
201410	1279	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	The growth in transportation and e-commerce activity has also helped fuel a boom in industrial construction.	13	1
201410	1280	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	In the farm sector, our contacts reported record yields for corn and soybeans and near-record yields for rice.	13	1
201410	1281	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	This year, about half the nation’s rice crop will come from Arkansas, the highest share ever.	13	1
201410	1282	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Labor market and residential housing data were generally weaker than in previous months.	13	1
201410	1283	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	The District’s unemployment rate fell to 6.4 percent but remained higher than the unemployment rate in the nation as a whole.	13	1
201410	1284	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Residential construction remains soft, but construction in the multifamily segment has shown considerable growth.	13	1
201410	1285	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Some of our contacts think that multifamily construction may decline in 2015 because many projects have already been completed.	13	1
201410	1286	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Employment in the health care services sector, which is a relatively large part of the District’s economy, has continued to decline in recent months.	13	1
201410	1287	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	This is a trend that we will watch carefully in the months and quarters ahead.	13	1
201410	1288	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Turning to the national outlook, the St Louis Fed’s financial stress index increased during the intermeeting period as global markets apparently priced in a slower global economic growth outlook.	13	1
201410	1289	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	This repricing was driven in part by a very gloomy IMF meeting here in Washington and by weaker-than-expected data from Europe, including a sharp downward revision in German growth prospects.	13	1
201410	1290	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Indeed, in preparation for this meeting my staff looked at the Eurocoin GDP data.	13	1
201410	1291	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Eurocoin is a real-time cyclical indicator for the euro area constructed using 1,000 macroeconomic time series from the major countries of the euro area.	13	1
201410	1292	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	We saw a little bit of it earlier from the staff.	13	1
201410	1293	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Its most recent value is the lowest in a year.	13	1
201410	1294	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	My staff constructed a simple regime switching model to estimate the probability that Europe is in recession based on this data.	13	1
201410	1295	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	The main finding is that the estimated probability that Europe is in recession as of September 2014 is about 63 percent.	13	1
201410	1296	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	The model fits past European recession data fairly well.	13	1
201410	1297	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	At any point in the past when the recession probability has reached this level, Europe actually was in recession.	13	1
201410	1298	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	While certainly far from definitive, I take this type of result as suggestive of a real risk that Europe had reentered a recession state or will enter into such a state shortly.	13	1
201410	1299	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	The Europe-in-recession story seemed to get an extra boost in financial markets when many began to argue that the United States would also suffer from slower-than-expected growth or even outright recession.	13	1
201410	1300	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	This argument was, in my opinion, a bridge too far.	13	1
201410	1301	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	The US macroeconomic outlook remains fairly robust.	13	1
201410	1302	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Our tracking estimates for real GDP remain at 3 percent for the second half of 2014, and the St Louis forecast continues to project 3 percent growth in 2015.	13	1
201410	1303	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Labor market data, including revisions to previous months, have been encouraging.	13	1
201410	1304	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Unemployment claims are extraordinarily low, and consumer confidence is at a post-recession high.	13	1
201410	1305	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	I expect the unemployment rate to continue to fall in coming jobs reports, moving into the central tendency of the Committee’s estimate of the longer-run normal rate in the first half of next year.	13	1
201410	1306	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	At the current pace, unemployment may be well below 5 percent by this time next year.	13	1
201410	1307	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	In addition to relatively strong US data and a good outlook for 2015, two factors should provide an important tailwind.	13	1
201410	1308	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	One is that recent global financial turmoil left longer-term US interest rates lower: the 10-year Treasury rate is trading around 228 basis points this morning.	13	1
201410	1309	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Lower longer-term rates are normally an important bullish factor for US growth prospects.	13	1
201410	1310	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	In addition, the dramatic fall in oil prices should put additional cash in the pockets of US consumers and cut costs for US producers.	13	1
201410	1311	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	This, too, is a bullish factor for US economic growth.	13	1
201410	1312	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Given these considerations, I have not changed my outlook for the appropriate path of the policy rate.	13	1
201410	1313	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	I continue to expect macroeconomic developments, as I have outlined them, to push the Committee toward a somewhat earlier liftoff than commonly assumed.	13	1
201410	1314	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	The outlook I have just described is somewhat more optimistic than the marked-down path for GDP described in the Tealbook baseline.	13	1
201410	1315	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	In my view, the current Tealbook baseline overemphasizes possible effects through dollar appreciation.	13	1
201410	1316	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	I do not think that we can reliably predict exchange rate movements, at least not to the point at which the Committee can rely on these forecasts for a major part of its policy strategy, and in this respect I agree with President Fisher’s earlier comments.	13	1
201410	1317	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Indeed, the staff has been revamping its dollar forecast models, and we have little experience with the new methodology.	13	1
201410	1318	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Also, I have long regarded the empirical evidence concerning the effects of exchange rate movements on important macroeconomic variable as extraordinarily weak.	13	1
201410	1319	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thus, even if we could gain some confidence in a particular path for the dollar, the real implications are only estimated with a very large confidence band.	13	1
201410	1320	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	And finally, the changing nature of global production, as hinted at earlier by President Lockhart, has likely altered the interpretation of any empirical evidence we do have.	13	1
201410	1321	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Factory location, in particular, has changed dramatically since the 1980s, a factor that I am not convinced has been appropriately incorporated into the empirical work in this area that I have seen.	13	1
201410	1322	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	This leaves me with a relatively optimistic outlook for the US economy, and this is the same outlook I described in my interview with Bloomberg on October 16.	13	1
201410	1323	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	However, there is a problem with the story as I have it.	13	1
201410	1324	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Presumably, expected inflation should be rising or staying constant in this environment, but some measures of expected inflation are falling.	13	1
201410	1325	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Indeed, the TIPS-based five-year breakeven inflation rate has declined about 60 basis points since the July– August time frame.	13	1
201410	1326	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	In the last 10 days, this measure has stabilized in the 145 to 150 basis point range.	13	1
201410	1327	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	The two-year is in the 120 to 125 basis point range.	13	1
201410	1328	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	If we subtract out the difference between CPI and PCE inflation, which my staff puts at 30 to 35 basis points, one could interpret the market as suggesting that PCE inflation will be perhaps 1.1 percent or 1.2 percent over the next five years.	13	1
201410	1329	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	I know there are subtleties in this calculation, but this is roughly true, provided investors are close to risk neutral.	13	1
201410	1330	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	This level of expected inflation concerns me because I regard expected inflation as one of the primary determinants of actual inflation and because, in my view, the Committee should be able to attain its inflation target over a period as long as five years.	13	1
201410	1331	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Even an expected inflation rate of 1.1 or 1.2 percent over five years may not be that bad, but the direction is concerning.	13	1
201410	1332	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	These expectations have been falling since the summer.	13	1
201410	1333	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	I know longer-term five-year, five-year- forward inflation expectations are more stable, but that’s far in the future.	13	1
201410	1334	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	That’s just a measure, in my mind, of the ultimate credibility of the Committee.	13	1
201410	1335	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	As I was saying earlier, I don’t think those expectations should ever change.	13	1
201410	1336	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Still, I think we should be able to hit our inflation target over a period as long as five years.	13	1
201410	1337	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Undoubtedly, the drop in inflation expectations in the recent data has been wrapped up in the deteriorating global growth outlook.	13	1
201410	1338	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Nevertheless, it’s important that US monetary policy remains nimble enough to react to changing macroeconomic circumstances, if necessary.	13	1
201410	1339	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	This is the source of my suggestion that the Committee could use its state-contingent clause regarding tapering at this time.	13	1
201410	1340	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	After all, we have stated repeatedly that policy is not on a preset path.	13	1
201410	1341	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Unfortunately, I think that despite our best efforts, financial markets do think that policy is on a preset path and that deviations from that path would require such dramatic changes in the incoming data as to be all but impossible.	13	1
201410	1342	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Would recent events meet such a high-bar criterion?	13	1
201410	1343	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	That is, is this a major macroeconomic event?	13	1
201410	1344	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	I think that the specter of renewed recession in Europe is an important macroeconomic development.	13	1
201410	1345	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	If this had led to further declines in inflation expectations via continued market turmoil, the Committee might have exercised this state-contingent option at this meeting, possibly with an important effect.	13	1
201410	1346	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	As events have actually unfolded, inflation expectations have stabilized for now, but at an uncomfortably low level.	13	1
201410	1347	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	I think that this is sufficient for us to go ahead and complete the tapering process at this meeting.	13	1
201410	1348	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	I will provide further comments on this in the policy go-round.	13	1
201410	1349	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	1350	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201410	1351	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13	1
201410	1352	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	1353	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	An all too familiar story may be unfolding.	13	1
201410	1354	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	The economic data on the domestic economy since our latest meeting have been mostly in line with our relatively optimistic forecast, but at the same time we have seen a notable increase in pessimism and nervousness about the economic outlook for the rest of the world.	13	1
201410	1355	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	These global worries undoubtedly impart greater risk to the outlook for the US economy, but it’s still unclear how much weakness to take on board in our baseline forecast.	13	1
201410	1356	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	If this was our first experience with this storyline, I’d say it’s too early to express substantial concern.	13	1
201410	1357	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	But we’ve seen this movie before.	13	1
201410	1358	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	When it comes to communicating an upbeat outlook that is later crushed by reality, we have already crossed the “three strikes” threshold, so I’m nervous.	13	1
201410	1359	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Let me turn to specifics.	13	1
201410	1360	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	As most of us expected, the initial release of weaker August job numbers was an aberration.	13	1
201410	1361	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Data through September, including revisions, indicate that employment growth remains robust.	13	1
201410	1362	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Consumer spending appears to have been a little on the soft side this summer but not by enough to change the outlook by itself.	13	1
201410	1363	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	After all, the improved job market should support stronger consumption.	13	1
201410	1364	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Moreover, the consumer should get a little boost from the fall in energy prices.	13	1
201410	1365	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Meanwhile, even with today’s numbers, business order books continue to be solid, which should support decent investment spending, at least over the near term.	13	1
201410	1366	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	We still see the labor and spending indicators as being in line with our relatively upbeat projection from September that real GDP growth will run at about a 3 percent pace over the next 18 months or so.	13	1
201410	1367	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	This relatively optimistic assessment continues to be consistent with what I heard from my directors and other business contacts.	13	1
201410	1368	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Bankers are reporting strong loan growth.	13	1
201410	1369	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Almost all of my nonfinancial contacts reported solid third-quarter results and a healthy outlook for their domestic business lines.	13	1
201410	1370	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	The agricultural equipment business is an exception.	13	1
201410	1371	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	One large manufacturer is in the midst of laying off 20 percent of his production workforce, both in the United States and worldwide.	13	1
201410	1372	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Much of the story is that this year’s big harvest is depressing crop prices and farm income, which will restrain sales of farm equipment.	13	1
201410	1373	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	This is good news that becomes bad news for that sector.	13	1
201410	1374	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	However, as I said, this market is a bit of an outlier with the reports about recent activity for most other sectors being relatively upbeat.	13	1
201410	1375	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	But these anecdotes, like the incoming data, are largely backward looking.	13	1
201410	1376	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Since our latest meeting, we have also seen a deterioration in the outlook for the rest of the world, an appreciation of the dollar, and increased volatility in financial markets.	13	1
201410	1377	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	That is quite some list.	13	1
201410	1378	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Risks have increased that worldwide events may lead to greater caution on the part of large US multinational corporations.	13	1
201410	1379	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, the reports I got about the rest of the world became quite a bit darker this time.	13	1
201410	1380	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	No one had anything upbeat to say about economic growth in China or emerging market economies.	13	1
201410	1381	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Europe is a mess.	13	1
201410	1382	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	As President Bullard indicated, there is a 63 percent chance that they are in a recession.	13	1
201410	1383	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	One construction equipment manufacturing CEO that I spoke with said that at a recent sales meeting his previously optimistic European distributors now all look like deer caught in the headlights.	13	1
201410	1384	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	The only optimism I heard was at a recent breakfast meeting with a German policymaker who expressed strong confidence in the outlook for the German economy and pointed to continuing improvements elsewhere around the euro zone.	13	1
201410	1385	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	He didn’t seem too concerned about current low euro-zone inflation, and he seemed to think that every single European country either was or was on the verge of running a current account surplus.	13	1
201410	1386	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	I can’t say I know he’s wrong, but this seems worrisome.	13	1
201410	1387	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Another indicator of weak global demand is the strong downward cost pressure I’m hearing about from manufacturers.	13	1
201410	1388	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	The demand for commodities has declined, and my contacts were pretty much unanimous in reporting substantially lower material costs for this year and next.	13	1
201410	1389	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Meanwhile, labor cost pressures remain subdued.	13	1
201410	1390	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	The lack of reported price pressures is consistent with the results from a suite of inflation models we run.	13	1
201410	1391	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Forecasts from both our economic indicator models and those that use the term structure of interest rates point to inflation remaining roughly flat, near 1½ percent.	13	1
201410	1392	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Although we’ve nudged down our near-term forecast some, we continue to override the model’s implications, and we expect better.	13	1
201410	1393	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Like the Tealbook, we project core PCE inflation rising to 1.8 percent by 2017, but this is hardly a victory.	13	1
201410	1394	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	It is three years from now, and we are still below target.	13	1
201410	1395	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	To get there, my assumption for appropriately realistic policy doesn’t start to tighten the funds rate until 2016.	13	1
201410	1396	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	That’s a good deal later than in the Tealbook.	13	1
201410	1397	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	To sum up, as I mentioned at the outset, the incoming data to date, all backward looking, provide good support for solid economic growth over the next 18 months.	13	1
201410	1398	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	But to get there, either the global risks will have to diminish or the US economy will have to strongly decouple from a very weak global economy.	13	1
201410	1399	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	I can’t say these assessments are wrong.	13	1
201410	1400	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	I have that decoupling in the contour of my baseline projection.	13	1
201410	1401	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	But my takeaway from recent history is either one of the following scenarios:  One, we have been wrong before, and are we ever due for a run of better luck.	13	1
201410	1402	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Or, two, we might consider fastening our seatbelts and convey a bit less complacency in our public projections of economic growth and perhaps be more explicit in warning of the increased likelihood that we will undershoot our inflation objective for another three years.	13	1
201410	1403	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	1404	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201410	1405	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13	1
201410	1406	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	1407	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The recent spike in market volatility may have been somewhat unsettling, but it wasn’t really too surprising.	13	1
201410	1408	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	During the preceding months, we heard concerns about how markets were priced for perfection, how unusually low the VIX was, how thin high-yield spreads were, and how markets were whistling past various pitfalls and global risks.	13	1
201410	1409	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Despite the changes in financial markets, I see nothing that alters my basic view that the recovery is on track, still with solid momentum.	13	1
201410	1410	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Particularly, the US real-side data have come in, on balance, in line with expectations, and the further labor market improvement is really quite encouraging.	13	1
201410	1411	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Job gains have been downright robust, and the unemployment rate is finally getting that first digit right with a 5, after so many years of getting that wrong.	13	1
201410	1412	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	All in all, real GDP growth looks to be coming in around a solid 3 percent for the second half of this year and going into next year.	13	1
201410	1413	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The cyclical dynamic of the US recovery also appears to be fairly well entrenched.	13	1
201410	1414	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, although I remain upbeat about the prospects for growth, there are notable risks.	13	1
201410	1415	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	This being an even-numbered year, I am going to mention one in particular that involves the Bay Area.	13	1
201410	1416	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	If you recall, in the 2012 World Series, I mentioned the risk to the US economy if the Giants did not win.	13	1
201410	1417	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In 2010, my alter ego John Moore mentioned that we didn’t actually have any experience of knowing what would happen if the Rangers won a World Series.	13	1
201410	1418	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But we did know that if the Tigers won in 2012, that would be catastrophic for the US economy, while when the Giants win the World Series that is actually very positive for growth.	13	1
201410	1419	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have some good news on this front.	13	1
201410	1420	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	By the way, this is President Evans’s fault.	13	1
201410	1421	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I wasn’t going to do this comparison until he reminded me of it.	13	1
201410	1422	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The good news is, the Royals have won a World Series.	13	1
201410	1423	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s good.	13	1
201410	1424	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We have at least some data.	13	1
201410	1425	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Economic growth in 1986, the next year, was actually 3½ percent.	13	1
201410	1426	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s pretty good.	13	1
201410	1427	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Well, “pretty good” isn’t what we’re looking for here.	13	1
201410	1428	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	When the Giants win the World Series, the average growth rate of real GDP in the next year is 7¾ percent.	13	1
201410	1429	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I beg of you, all of you, put aside your parochial concerns, put aside your regional views, and support the US economy, and I will be doing that tonight as I wave my rally cap.	13	1
201410	1430	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay.	13	1
201410	1431	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Sorry, Jay.	13	1
201410	1432	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13	1
201410	1433	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Importantly, on a serious note, the risks that I do see to the US economy have shifted predominantly outside of our borders, as many of us have already discussed.	13	1
201410	1434	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	It is really about the external sector, and the global recovery is in some danger of stalling—Europe, Japan, and China—to say nothing of geopolitical risks from outbreaks of war and disease.	13	1
201410	1435	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Based on these developments so far, I view global factors as likely to have a fairly limited effect on US economic growth.	13	1
201410	1436	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Fundamentally, when it comes to real trade flows, the US economy still acts more or less like a closed economy, and the appreciation of the dollar and the slowing demand from abroad will cut into our net exports a bit but won’t derail the recovery.	13	1
201410	1437	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s important to remember, as the staff mentioned, that this negative effect will be at least partially offset by the improved domestic demand from the collapse in oil prices that we have seen.	13	1
201410	1438	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In contrast with the solid domestic growth outlook, the near-term inflation outlook is somewhat more worrisome.	13	1
201410	1439	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In particular, a variety of external factors are lining up together to grind down US prices.	13	1
201410	1440	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Cheaper imports stemming from the stronger dollar, slack abroad, and falling commodity prices will all exert disinflationary pressures at least through next year.	13	1
201410	1441	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	A lot of countries, like Japan and those in the euro area, seem likely to be exporting low inflation for quite some time.	13	1
201410	1442	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	With inflation already running below our target, this situation warrants close attention, particularly if it were to spill over into longer-run inflation expectations and ultimately affect the perceived nominal anchor.	13	1
201410	1443	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	For now, however, I remain cautiously optimistic, especially about the anchoring of inflation expectations.	13	1
201410	1444	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Inflation expectations do appear to be well anchored in two dimensions.	13	1
201410	1445	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	First, the perceived inflation target is anchored in the right place, and that’s at 2 percent.	13	1
201410	1446	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Second, the anchor still has significant attraction and holding power for inflation.	13	1
201410	1447	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Regarding the first point, as I mentioned numerous times at our past few meetings, I am unpersuaded that inflation expectations are currently anchored below the 2 percent target as assumed by the Tealbook.	13	1
201410	1448	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The Tealbook view is, in part, based on an estimated constant in a Phillips-curve regression, and these estimates can be sensitive to model specification and the period of the sample.	13	1
201410	1449	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	My staff generated a range of model-based estimates of long-run inflation expectations, similar to the analysis conducted by the Board staff.	13	1
201410	1450	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In this analysis, it turns out that the key determinant of measured long-run inflation expectations is the regression sample.	13	1
201410	1451	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In particular, if you look at the past 15 years, a period during which surveyed inflation expectations have been well anchored, that implies that longer-run inflation expectations are more or less overlapping with our 2 percent target.	13	1
201410	1452	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, you might ask, why focus on the past 15 years?	13	1
201410	1453	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s a relatively short sample.	13	1
201410	1454	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s because there’s a well-documented shift in inflation expectations that took place back in the 1990s.	13	1
201410	1455	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Before then, we were still in the process of gaining credibility.	13	1
201410	1456	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	As a result, inflation expectations were consistently above realized inflation.	13	1
201410	1457	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	There was a sustained gap between the two.	13	1
201410	1458	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Over time, as we built our credibility and it firmed, inflation expectations have moved closer to realized inflation.	13	1
201410	1459	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	This enhanced credibility is evident in rolling Phillips-curve regressions over various subsamples, and they show that earlier samples actually had the estimated longer-run inflation expectations being about 1½ percent, but now show that to be closer to 2 percent.	13	1
201410	1460	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I agree with President Kocherlakota that we don’t want to just assume that longer- run inflation expectations are fixed, and we must carefully monitor various survey- and market- based measures of these expectations.	13	1
201410	1461	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	So far, however, the declines in the various measures that we have seen are within the historical range, albeit at the low end that we have seen.	13	1
201410	1462	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In looking at these models, I do want to say—and I think President Kocherlakota made a really important point about thinking about risk premiums—I think they do distinguish between a risk premium and an inflation premium and a liquidity premium.	13	1
201410	1463	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	If a liquidity premium is just a result of market functioning, you wouldn’t want to take that as a serious sign of a shift in economic conditions.	13	1
201410	1464	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	On the inflation risk premium, I think the evidence that we have so far suggests some of it may be coming down to a reduction in the risk of high inflation.	13	1
201410	1465	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, I agree with your point that we want to take this seriously and study it carefully.	13	1
201410	1466	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But so far I, at least, am not as concerned.	13	1
201410	1467	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I guess I agree with some other comments about the decline we have seen so far in inflation expectations.	13	1
201410	1468	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The one caveat in interpreting the survey-based measures is that they are often overly influenced by the latest inflation data.	13	1
201410	1469	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	For this reason, I wouldn’t be surprised if survey measures fall further in the coming months because the price of oil prices is falling and energy prices are falling.	13	1
201410	1470	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	My staff at the San Francisco Fed has found that longer-run survey expectations, particularly from household surveys, can be excessively sensitive to changes in energy prices.	13	1
201410	1471	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	This was especially true back in 2008, for example, when the jump in oil prices pushed up survey measures of long-run inflation expectations.	13	1
201410	1472	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	You actually see this in the SPF, too.	13	1
201410	1473	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think it’s a little warning not to necessarily take any movement one-tenth or two-tenths one way or the other in the SPF or any of these other surveys as literally a loss of credibility.	13	1
201410	1474	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	There just seems to be some excessive sensitivity in there that we have seen even in the past 15 years.	13	1
201410	1475	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Importantly, after the jump in oil prices, you saw a jump in survey responses regarding views of longer-run inflation expectations; once those energy prices stabilized, that bulge in longer-run inflation expectations disappeared.	13	1
201410	1476	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	They went back to where they were once the oil price stopped moving around.	13	1
201410	1477	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We may see the converse of this situation in the months ahead, with the drop in energy prices pushing down survey measures for a while.	13	1
201410	1478	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But then, once the energy prices flatten out, these dips in longer-run inflation expectations will likely be temporary.	13	1
201410	1479	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, I’m not trying to downplay the role of inflation expectations.	13	1
201410	1480	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I, too, think it’s critically important.	13	1
201410	1481	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think we want to monitor it carefully, and we also have to be aware that those measures do move around a little bit due to transitory factors.	13	1
201410	1482	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13	1
201410	1483	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201410	1484	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	13	1
201410	1485	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	1486	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Other than the barb about the Texas Rangers, I agree completely with what President Williams just said.	13	1
201410	1487	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	What, did they win the World Series?	13	1
201410	1488	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	They never have won the World Series.	13	1
201410	1489	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	But anyway, I would echo what President Williams said.	13	1
201410	1490	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I agree nearly completely with what he just commented on.	13	1
201410	1491	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I’m going to talk a little bit about the Texas economy, my regional economy.	13	1
201410	1492	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I want to make a special comment on oil, maybe refer to what I have heard from some of my interlocutors, and then just conclude.	13	1
201410	1493	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Now, I realize that when you talk about the Texas economy, which is 98 percent of my District, to Texans, it’s like driving down the street with your windows open with your favorite song going full blast and annoying absolutely everybody else who is near you.	13	1
201410	1494	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	But bear with me for a second.	13	1
201410	1495	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	[Laughter]	13	1
201410	1496	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Our third-quarter job growth, which we have just calculated, was very strong at 3.9 percent.	13	1
201410	1497	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Year-to-date is 3.5 percent.	13	1
201410	1498	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	More jobs have been created in Texas this year to date—304,300 according to my staff, and we have adjusted the data we get from the BLS and from the state—than the entire year last year.	13	1
201410	1499	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	It’s important to understand that employment gains have been broad based, not concentrated in energy.	13	1
201410	1500	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Professional and business services have posted much stronger job gains this year along with another pickup in trade and transportation and, believe it or not, leisure and hospitality as a tourism spot, as well as even government spending.	13	1
201410	1501	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	These sectors take up a much larger share of the regional economy than energy.	13	1
201410	1502	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	We have been helped by economic growth in Mexico, and I’ll come back to that just in a second.	13	1
201410	1503	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Our exports from the 11th Federal Reserve District are extremely strong.	13	1
201410	1504	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I want to correct a misinterpretation by the New York Fed of the October release for our Texas manufacturing output survey that was just released on Monday.	13	1
201410	1505	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	It was not weak; it was strong.	13	1
201410	1506	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	It indicated that manufacturing activity continued at a robust pace with strong positive readings in our production, general business activity, and company outlook indexes.	13	1
201410	1507	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Wage pressures remain elevated in my District.	13	1
201410	1508	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Wages and benefits are increasing at a 3.6 percent rate.	13	1
201410	1509	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Initial unemployment claims were down 9.6 percent in the third quarter.	13	1
201410	1510	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Our unemployment rate is at 5.2 percent.	13	1
201410	1511	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	That is because our denominator in the calculation has been growing at 10 times the rate of that in the rest of the United States.	13	1
201410	1512	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	We have high growth in those seeking work.	13	1
201410	1513	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Otherwise you would expect our unemployment rate to be somewhere in the 4s, or whatever it may be.	13	1
201410	1514	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I think it’s important to understand that we are very much a diversified economy, growing very strongly, with very high job growth and an enormous supply of workers coming into our work system.	13	1
201410	1515	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Now, having said we are not energy concentrated, I do want to talk about energy, and the reason for that is because even though it’s only 2.6 percent of our employment, including support services, it is about 12 percent of the output of our District—I do have 990 wells in my District out of the 1,900 that operate in the country.	13	1
201410	1516	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I pretend to know something about business, and I’d like to share that with you.	13	1
201410	1517	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I think it’s very important to understand that when you think about the effect of lower energy prices domestically, it has a different effect on different sectors of the energy sector.	13	1
201410	1518	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	For example, horizontal wells, which are the hot new thing, typically have a very big burst of production the first year or two, and then they have rapid declines from that point onward.	13	1
201410	1519	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Whereas the vertical wells tend to produce over a much longer period.	13	1
201410	1520	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I want to point to the example of the Haynesville Shale in Louisiana, where when US natural gas prices began to crater in 2011, drillers just moved out of the area, and production is now 35 percent lower than it was at its peak level in 2011.	13	1
201410	1521	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	That said, it may not be as damaging to our domestic production as we think.	13	1
201410	1522	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	There are offsets, and there are silver linings.	13	1
201410	1523	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	For example, as I have mentioned at many, many meetings here, a Beige Book retail contact noted that you just cannot find mechanics or technicians or truck drivers or welders or pipefitters in areas of the state in which the energy sector was booming.	13	1
201410	1524	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	We do now expect to see some relief on that front because of the horizontal well aspect.	13	1
201410	1525	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Indeed, if you go through the cycle of those wells and these prices maintain, you might be able to have some release on some of the wage price pressures that we’ve seen.	13	1
201410	1526	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	There’s a little silver lining there.	13	1
201410	1527	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	In fact, the CEO of Fluor called to say that he realized I was about to retire sometime within the next year, and he offered me that I could probably make more money as a master welder working for his firm than I did at the Federal Reserve.	13	1
201410	1528	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	There’s a good anecdotal example for you.	13	1
201410	1529	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You don’t have the training, Richard.	13	1
201410	1530	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I know I don’t.	13	1
201410	1531	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	[Laughter]	13	1
201410	1532	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I’m absolutely useless from that standpoint.	13	1
201410	1533	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Or truck driving, for that matter.	13	1
201410	1534	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	We do find that people complain they can’t expand their small businesses because of the unavailability of workers.	13	1
201410	1535	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	So there might be some release that comes from this.	13	1
201410	1536	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Now, I want to talk about the international side of it.	13	1
201410	1537	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Two iterations before you,  Madam Chair, every time the Chairman was called upon to make a statement or go to the White House to talk about energy, he would call me and say, “Call Exxon and find out what’s going on.”	13	1
201410	1538	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I do talk to Exxon, as you know, and I indeed refreshed that memory talking to its CEO this morning—after having talked at length last week plus the other energy independent smaller operators and the larger integrateds.	13	1
201410	1539	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I think it’s important to bear in mind that, from the standpoint of the Saudis, the Kuwaitis, and the Emiratis, they are not uncomfortable with $70 to $80 oil.	13	1
201410	1540	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	They’re not uncomfortable because their budgets will still work within that price range.	13	1
201410	1541	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	There is the added plus that it gives them a little shove for the Iranians and the Russians and gets rid of the nuisance of the Venezuelans.	13	1
201410	1542	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	It is their expectation, according to my interlocutors, that this price level could well maintain itself all the way through 2016.	13	1
201410	1543	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	It would not make them feel uncomfortable to do that.	13	1
201410	1544	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	They are building, indeed, their own budgets around $80 oil, and we are beginning to see in the oil sector some companies begin to build their budgets around $70 to $80 oil, which means a slight reduction in workforce, but not a dramatic one.	13	1
201410	1545	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	We will have to see how that obtains.	13	1
201410	1546	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I just wanted to comment on that.	13	1
201410	1547	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	From the standpoint of the retailers and those that operate shopping malls, which has been the weakest performing sector of the economy, this decline in oil prices, which translates into motor gas after a certain time interval—a time interval that depends, frankly, on how long they wish to capture margins.	13	1
201410	1548	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	When prices go up, typically the distributors and the retailers will have to move quickly because they have cash flow problems.	13	1
201410	1549	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	When prices go down, they spend as much time as possible capturing the margin.	13	1
201410	1550	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	We are beginning to see prices at the tank go below $3.	13	1
201410	1551	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	There’s a big article in the Wall Street Journal yesterday or today on that.	13	1
201410	1552	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Indeed, the expectation among the large companies that I speak to, and the small operators, is that motor gas will be well below $3 in fairly quick order.	13	1
201410	1553	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	There are positive knock-on effects, and I am hearing that from my interlocutors, certainly from the retailers and certainly from those that depend on the price of energy.	13	1
201410	1554	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I think we need to take into account in our modeling—and I don’t know the degree to which we do—the positive effect of a decline in energy prices and how it might affect retail sales and consumption, as well as be an offset on employment or have counter crosscurrents on unemployment.	13	1
201410	1555	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Other interlocutors indicate that July and August were very strong months, that there was a slight tailoff in September, but that October is picking up.	13	1
201410	1556	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I found most interesting my discussion with a very large retailer, whose name I won’t mention, but it is the largest in the world and is located in Arkansas.	13	1
201410	1557	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	In terms of its layaway sales—mind you, this is the bottom income quartile to the second income quartile—it has seen that basically 73 percent of the people that used that facility last year no longer feel the need for it.	13	1
201410	1558	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	If the company goes through its surveys and focus groups on what counts the most to its customer base—and, again, these are the bottom two income quartiles with a little bit of the surveys in the beginning of the third income quartile—the ranking in terms of the greatest concerns or interests are the price of gas, the price of heating and cooling, and then employment.	13	1
201410	1559	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	But when the company takes a deep dive into what the surveys say about employment, it’s no longer worry about finding a job or having a job.	13	1
201410	1560	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	It’s a question about wages and will their wages be raised.	13	1
201410	1561	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Again, it may be backward-looking, as President Evans mentioned.	13	1
201410	1562	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	It is the most recent survey, and the company polls a survey and does focus groups almost weekly and, in some cases, daily.	13	1
201410	1563	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	The bottom line, Madam Chair, is my view of the modal outlook for the US economy has changed very little since our September meeting.	13	1
201410	1564	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I have already factored in—or I had already factored in, and I refer to you to the previous meeting’s transcript—the likelihood of some financial volatility and some market correction.	13	1
201410	1565	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Beyond that, the asset price changes we have seen over the past five weeks, I don’t believe, are really that large or have such a great effect on the economy.	13	1
201410	1566	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	With regard to the dollar, I think it is important, as President Bullard and President Lockhart pointed out, that we are very North America–centric.	13	1
201410	1567	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Only 8 percent of our exports go to Europe, and I think we have to take that into account.	13	1
201410	1568	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I’m less worried about the movement that has taken place in the dollar as well.	13	1
201410	1569	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I will add, to conclude, that I remain highly skeptical of the Tealbook’s assumed level of longer-term inflation expectations, and so remain highly skeptical regarding the baseline inflation forecast.	13	1
201410	1570	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	As to recent declines in market measures of longer-term expectations, I think that President Williams had a very good point, and I also accept the judgment of the New York Fed staff, who in their recent MarketSource report said that these reflect mostly a falling inflation risk premium rather than expected inflation.	13	1
201410	1571	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	As we go forward, though, I would agree with President Williams that we need to be alert to any indication that longer-term expectations are de-anchoring.	13	1
201410	1572	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	1573	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201410	1574	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13	1
201410	1575	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Can I ask a quick question?	13	1
201410	1576	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Oh, yes.	13	1
201410	1577	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I take your point that the drop in energy prices has a benefit for households and then has a negative consequence for oil investment.	13	1
201410	1578	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Where do you see the tipping point?	13	1
201410	1579	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	It is very hard, Vice Chairman Dudley, and I keep asking this question, and I think part of it has to do with how our economy is currently geared and how it affects confidence.	13	1
201410	1580	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	One of the confidence pluses is the fact that we’re viewed as more energy- independent, and here’s where North America comes into play.	13	1
201410	1581	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	North America is energy independent if you take Mexico’s potential, Canada’s output, and our own.	13	1
201410	1582	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Then you have a different equation from a geopolitical standpoint, and it also has a significant meaning for the 500 million people, which is the critical mass who live in those three countries.	13	1
201410	1583	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I will add parenthetically that Canada is no bigger than Texas population-wise, but it is certainly bigger geographically.	13	1
201410	1584	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Barely.	13	1
201410	1585	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter.]	13	1
201410	1586	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I do think it’s important to take into account the confidence-building factor that takes place here.	13	1
201410	1587	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess the question I’m asking is if energy prices fell to $80 a barrel, presumably consumers would benefit, but the oil production wouldn’t be really much affected, but if it fell to $60 a barrel, yes, you’d still get a benefit for consumers, but then you’d start to actually see an effect on production.	13	1
201410	1588	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Yes, what I’m hearing is the $70 number seems to be the crossing point.	13	1
201410	1589	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Nobody knows, and the reason for that is because it not only varies field by field, but it varies within fields.	13	1
201410	1590	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	The Saudis have a two-year study effort on right now to determine the marginal lifting cost of oil in the United States.	13	1
201410	1591	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Right.	13	1
201410	1592	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	As best as I  understand it, both from listening to people in my region and talking to those that deal with the Middle Eastern governments in particular, the expectation is that we might get a dip below $70.	13	1
201410	1593	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	This is pure expectation, and, again, I don’t think they know any better than we do.	13	1
201410	1594	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	They’re just practitioners.	13	1
201410	1595	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	But the expectation is that it could dip below $70 briefly, but it’s likely it will stay in the $70 to $80 range for quite a sustained period.	13	1
201410	1596	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	What is a sustained period?	13	1
201410	1597	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Don’t know.	13	1
201410	1598	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	What are they budgeting?	13	1
201410	1599	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Out to as much as two years, but certainly one year, at least.	13	1
201410	1600	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I can’t answer any more clearly than that.	13	1
201410	1601	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	13	1
201410	1602	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201410	1603	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13	1
201410	1604	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	1605	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Over the intermeeting period, my Bank focused our intelligence efforts on business sentiment, confidence in a 3 percent growth outlook, reaction to global risk developments, and indication of wage growth.	13	1
201410	1606	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We had 65 one-on-one interviews across the Southeast, 14 roundtables, 4 advisory committee sessions, 6 board meetings, 2 of which were joint meetings with other Branches in other Districts.	13	1
201410	1607	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I mention all of this simply to convey that our soundings were extensive.	13	1
201410	1608	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Reports of our business contacts confirmed a modestly improving tenor of business activity.	13	1
201410	1609	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Demand conditions have generally improved, and the outlook over the short and medium term is for continued steady but not accelerating economic growth.	13	1
201410	1610	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Optimism appears to have spread to locales that were previously less upbeat, such as southern Mississippi.	13	1
201410	1611	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Of course, football rankings helped as well.	13	1
201410	1612	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Reports from retail contacts were mixed and reflected continuation of the previously reported bifurcated recovery.	13	1
201410	1613	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Low- and middle-income households remained conservative with discretionary spending.	13	1
201410	1614	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	However, as has already been pointed out, the lower gasoline prices are expected to ease some of the strain on lower-end consumers and allow for more discretionary spending.	13	1
201410	1615	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Worthy of note, I think, were reports from logistics contacts.	13	1
201410	1616	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	They reported the accumulation of inventories of consumer goods in anticipation of strong holiday sales.	13	1
201410	1617	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	A year ago, retailers reported they were keeping inventories intentionally lean as a precaution against the weak holiday sale season.	13	1
201410	1618	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding wages, we picked up no evidence of broad-based acceleration of wage pressures, although there are sporadic reports of growing wage pressures in the category of lower-skilled jobs.	13	1
201410	1619	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Where there is competitive pressure for labor, we heard reports of employers altering total compensation packages by increasing incentive pay or enhancing benefit structures rather than raising base pay.	13	1
201410	1620	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Credit across the Sixth District seems to be readily available to qualified borrowers.	13	1
201410	1621	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Credit constraints continue to be reported by small businesses, but there are no suggestions that credit has tightened.	13	1
201410	1622	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I’ve not changed my economic growth outlook from that submitted in September.	13	1
201410	1623	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I continue to expect medium-term growth around 3 percent, and I interpret the incoming data to be broadly in line with this expectation.	13	1
201410	1624	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Our tracking estimate for the third quarter is near 3 percent.	13	1
201410	1625	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Along with this growth forecast, I see employment conditions continuing to make progress as best evidenced by sustained payroll job numbers above 200,000 a month.	13	1
201410	1626	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding inflation, I marked my near-term projection lower in response to falling gasoline prices and the expected consumer price effect of the run-up of the dollar.	13	1
201410	1627	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	For the medium term, I’m still holding to the projection of gradual firming in wage and price growth, with some risk to the downside.	13	1
201410	1628	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I am not seeing anything in the data nor hearing anything material in reports from contacts in my District to question this basic outlook.	13	1
201410	1629	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	That said, it’s obvious there have been economic developments since the latest meeting that give pause, namely, the perception of slower global growth, appreciation of the dollar, and increased financial market volatility.	13	1
201410	1630	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Some of our contacts did express mild concerns about slowing global economic growth and market volatility but did not mention the dollar.	13	1
201410	1631	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	In this meeting’s Tealbook, the first half of next year has GDP growth tracking only around an annual rate of 2¼ percent, net jobs growth slowing to around 150,000 a month, and core inflation remaining stuck at 1.5 percent.	13	1
201410	1632	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	The Tealbook seems to incorporate effects of adverse international developments into the baseline forecast.	13	1
201410	1633	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	In contrast, I’m treating these concerns as downside risks to my growth and inflation outlook rather than taking them on board as aspects of the baseline.	13	1
201410	1634	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I think the sometimes ritualistic exercise we go through contrasting our forecast to the Tealbook serves, in this case, quite a good purpose.	13	1
201410	1635	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We are setting up in this meeting a forward- guidance framework for moving toward a decision to initiate normalization.	13	1
201410	1636	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We’re likely to agree on verbiage that, whether we like it or not, puts that decision to some extent “on the clock.”	13	1
201410	1637	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	This is the reality, I think, even with our strong admonitions that liftoff is data- dependent.	13	1
201410	1638	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	If the Tealbook is right about the first half of 2015, the weight of the policy decision next year would likely be on a projection of improvement versus my more optimistic, and hopefully data-confirmed, track of economic performance.	13	1
201410	1639	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	The Tealbook environment would be a very challenging circumstance in which to signal initiation of normalization of the policy rate.	13	1
201410	1640	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thanks to the staff for calling out a possible dilemma, I’ll have more comments on communication scenarios and strategy and forward guidance in the next round.	13	1
201410	1641	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	1642	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201410	1643	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	13	1
201410	1644	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	1645	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	There has been little change in the outlook for the Fourth District economy since our latest meeting.	13	1
201410	1646	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Moderate economic growth continues and the reports from business contacts remain positive despite the turbulence in financial markets and the Ebola scare, which had Cleveland, in particular, on edge because of one patient’s travel schedule.	13	1
201410	1647	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Fifty-five percent of our contacts reported an improvement in business conditions over the past six to eight weeks compared with 8 percent reporting a deterioration.	13	1
201410	1648	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Those responses yielded a diffusion index of 47, the same as in September but up from 10 last December.	13	1
201410	1649	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	The manufacturing sector is playing a leading role in the improvement of the District’s economy.	13	1
201410	1650	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	About half of our manufacturing contacts reported better business conditions consistent with moderate expansion.	13	1
201410	1651	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Although they were slightly less bullish than in September, many of our manufacturers expect demand for their products to remain healthy over the remainder of the year.	13	1
201410	1652	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	In the construction sector, nonresidential builders are doing very well, so well, in fact, that some are turning down work, and there are concerns about the availability of subcontractors.	13	1
201410	1653	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	As in the rest of the country, multifamily housing activity is strong, while single- family residential construction is slowly improving after a weak summer.	13	1
201410	1654	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Continued growth is reflected in the steady strengthening of District labor markets.	13	1
201410	1655	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Employment in the District is growing at an annual pace of nearly 1 percent this year, up from just over ½ percent in the past two years.	13	1
201410	1656	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	The District unemployment rate fell over the intermeeting period and is down more than 1 percentage point from the start of the year.	13	1
201410	1657	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	At 5.6 percent, the District unemployment rate is now slightly less than its average over the 2001– 07 expansion.	13	1
201410	1658	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	There continue to be few signs of price pressures either building or diminishing among District firms, though firms have noticed the lower oil prices.	13	1
201410	1659	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	We continue to hear anecdotal reports of hard-to-fill jobs.	13	1
201410	1660	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	There are few reports of significant compensation pressures, but some are now increasing benefits to retain and attract some types of workers and others are planning to increase wages.	13	1
201410	1661	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Turning to the national economy, I have not made any material change to my modal economic growth forecast.	13	1
201410	1662	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	I see moderate growth of about 3 percent, which is somewhat above trend for the next two years.	13	1
201410	1663	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Incoming data have been mixed but largely as expected.	13	1
201410	1664	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Financial markets have been volatile, but I’m not taking too much signal from that yet.	13	1
201410	1665	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	I have not marked my forecast down as much as the Tealbook in response to the stronger dollar and recent variability in other financial market conditions.	13	1
201410	1666	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	The weakness in the European economy and slowdown in China are not new information.	13	1
201410	1667	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	I had already incorporated much of that into my forecast.	13	1
201410	1668	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Still, the chance these economies may be weaker than expected has increased the downside risk to my forecast.	13	1
201410	1669	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Lower oil and commodity prices will temporarily lower headline inflation over the near term, but as these prices stabilize, I expect inflation to move back up and to continue gradually moving toward our goal.	13	1
201410	1670	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Most models suggest that monetary policy shouldn’t respond to these relative-price shocks.	13	1
201410	1671	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	My forecast that inflation will gradually return to our goal reflects anchored inflation expectations.	13	1
201410	1672	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland Fed’s 10-year CPI inflation expectations measure and survey-based measures of medium- to longer-run inflation expectations remain quite stable near 2 percent.	13	1
201410	1673	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Measures of inflation expectations based on asset prices suggest some decline, but I’m wary of reading too much into these measures because during periods of heightened volatility like we’ve seen, flight-to-quality flows into Treasury securities affect the risk premiums on those assets, making it harder to draw a conclusion about inflation expectations from market prices.	13	1
201410	1674	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Nothing over the intermeeting period has changed my view that we’ve made significant progress in labor markets since the start of the asset purchase program in September of 2012, which was set as one of the important conditions for ending the program.	13	1
201410	1675	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Recent research by Cleveland Fed staff suggests that the degree of underutilization of labor resources has been significantly reduced.	13	1
201410	1676	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Our research has estimated the so-called longer-run, normal level of unemployment using five different conceptual approaches.	13	1
201410	1677	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Most of the approaches were more statistical in nature.	13	1
201410	1678	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	One was consistent with the concept from a New Keynesian sticky-price model.	13	1
201410	1679	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Over the past few years, the estimates of underutilization varied quite a bit depending on the concept being used.	13	1
201410	1680	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	However, all of the estimates indicate that underutilization has declined, and they all suggest relatively little underutilization remains today.	13	1
201410	1681	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Of course, these estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty, and they’re based on the unemployment rate rather than on broader measures of labor market activity, but even these broader measures, as summarized in labor market condition indexes, show improvement.	13	1
201410	1682	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	In thinking about the implications of the broader index of labor market conditions for policy, I took advantage of the fact that one of the creators of the Board’s index is now a Cleveland Fed economist and asked him to examine what a Taylor-type rule would look like if instead of using the unemployment rate we used the broader conditions index.	13	1
201410	1683	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	This turned out to be a more complicated exercise than I had anticipated because the conditions index is constructed to indicate a change in conditions rather than a level of activity.	13	1
201410	1684	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	One way to get around this issue is to focus on monetary policy difference rules.	13	1
201410	1685	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	What we find is that currently a policy rule based on the conditions index and a policy rule based on the unemployment rate would yield pretty similar levels of the federal funds rate and point to a federal funds rate slightly above the current level.	13	1
201410	1686	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Now, this is work in progress, but so far the results support the view that judged by either the unemployment rate or the broader labor market conditions index we are getting nearer the liftoff.	13	1
201410	1687	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	1688	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201410	1689	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13	1
201410	1690	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	1691	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	The most striking economic development of the intermeeting period was the spike in financial market volatility.	13	1
201410	1692	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Movements in prices of stocks, bonds, and commodities as well as the foreign exchange value of the dollar seemed to largely reflect concerns about slower economic growth in Europe and China, which would, in turn, suggest the possibility of lower growth in US exports.	13	1
201410	1693	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	That said, my outlook for the United States has not materially changed.	13	1
201410	1694	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I’m still expecting GDP growth between 2 and 2½ percent over the next year or two.	13	1
201410	1695	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I recognize the downside risks to economic growth abroad do appear to have risen and would imply at least some increase in the downside risk to US growth.	13	1
201410	1696	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	But, all else equal, lower commodity prices and lower long-term interest rates should tend to bolster growth.	13	1
201410	1697	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Moreover, the recent data flow for the United States has been positive.	13	1
201410	1698	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	The fact that US equity markets have basically retraced over the past week or two seems consistent with little net change in US growth prospects over that period.	13	1
201410	1699	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	The fact that Treasury yields remain lower suggests that safe-haven flows represented the more persistent shift in views about growth prospects for Europe and China.	13	1
201410	1700	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	A few comments on the recent data.	13	1
201410	1701	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Some observers have been expecting substantial acceleration in consumer spending, and they saw the September retail sales report as an unwelcome downside surprise.	13	1
201410	1702	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	But others have been projecting consumption to grow at rates in line with recent trends, and against that more modest expectation, the latest retail sales report was not so discouraging.	13	1
201410	1703	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Similarly, some observers have been anticipating a surge in housing activity.	13	1
201410	1704	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Against a more modest expectation, however, the recent residential investment data have not been as disappointing.	13	1
201410	1705	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	On the brighter side, investment in equipment and intangibles has been reasonably strong for several years, and reports for recent months have been promising.	13	1
201410	1706	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	New orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft, are up more than 8 percent over the past year, despite a downtick in the most recent month released this morning, and equipment investment seems poised to make a strong contribution to third-quarter GDP.	13	1
201410	1707	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	New orders also look robust in the ISM indexes and in our own Fifth District indexes.	13	1
201410	1708	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Speaking of our indexes, they’ve been remarkably strong lately.	13	1
201410	1709	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Our composite index of manufacturing activity measured as a three-month average is at its highest level in more than three years, and our index of service sector revenues is at its highest level in 17 years.	13	1
201410	1710	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	These figures are especially notable in light of the sizable dependence of our District on federal government contracts and employment, as a result of which much of the area around D.C. and southeast Virginia has been lagging the nation as a whole.	13	1
201410	1711	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	To give you a feel for these differences, over the past 12 months, employment grew by less than 1 percent each in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia.	13	1
201410	1712	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	In contrast, employment is up year over year by more than 2 percent in West Virginia and North and South Carolina.	13	1
201410	1713	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Much of the growth in the Carolinas has been in relatively high-wage occupations.	13	1
201410	1714	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	For example, over the past year, employment in professional and business services grew by more than 7 percent in North Carolina, while it fell 1.8 percent in Virginia.	13	1
201410	1715	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	The heavy drag from federal expenditures makes the strength in our Districtwide indexes even more impressive.	13	1
201410	1716	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I should add that our surveys also show over the past few months an uptick in the reported change in current prices paid and received, as well as in expectations for price changes over the next six months.	13	1
201410	1717	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	These inflation indicators have been relatively subdued for several quarters, and so the recent moves may signal some emerging firming of inflation.	13	1
201410	1718	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Too soon to say, of course, but worth watching.	13	1
201410	1719	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I do expect inflation to move back toward 2 percent after this energy price move plays out.	13	1
201410	1720	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I agree very much with the comments and perspectives of President Williams on inflation analysis.	13	1
201410	1721	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	13	1
201410	1722	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201410	1723	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	13	1
201410	1724	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	1725	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Economic activity in the Third District continues to grow moderately, and expectations of future activity remain very optimistic.	13	1
201410	1726	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Our Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey’s current activity index for October came in slightly higher than expected at 20.7 and remains considerably above its nonrecession average of 10.1.	13	1
201410	1727	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Growth is broad based across a wide range of manufacturing goods.	13	1
201410	1728	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Strength is mirrored in our new Nonmanufacturing Business Outlook Survey.	13	1
201410	1729	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Its current activity index rose to 44.1, again, a very high level, but the sample is more limited.	13	1
201410	1730	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	With respect to future expectations, the future activity index for manufacturing came in at 54.5 in October, which is a very high number by historical standards.	13	1
201410	1731	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	The nonmanufacturing side also indicated optimism, with its index coming in at 79.4.	13	1
201410	1732	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Interestingly enough, our contacts across the region remain very optimistic, and surprisingly none of them have focused on or raised issues concerning international developments—either financial or nonfinancial developments.	13	1
201410	1733	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	The District is showing some signs of moderating, however.	13	1
201410	1734	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Unlike the nation, employment was flat over the three months ending in September.	13	1
201410	1735	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	That was mostly due to some decline in jobs in Pennsylvania, obviously one of the larger of our states.	13	1
201410	1736	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Unemployment rates in Pennsylvania are 5.7 percent, slightly below the US average, but in New Jersey and Delaware, the unemployment rates remain about 6.5 percent, somewhat higher than the national average.	13	1
201410	1737	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	The recent softness in the District’s labor markets is also reflected in the current employment index, as I said, which pulled back to 12 from 20 in September, but that, too, remains well above the nonrecessionary average of only 2.	13	1
201410	1738	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Residential real estate is a sector that continues to exhibit weak growth in our District.	13	1
201410	1739	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Single-family permits and existing-home sales remain below a year ago’s average, although multifamily activity remains well above and is growing quite briskly.	13	1
201410	1740	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	On a more upbeat note, auto sales continue to be robust in the region, and consumer confidence is, in fact, rising.	13	1
201410	1741	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	At the risk of sullying President Williams’s reputation further, I, too, agree with almost everything that he said about the national economy and his assessments of inflation.	13	1
201410	1742	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Hang onto your hat, John.	13	1
201410	1743	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	My view of the national economy is still fairly positive.	13	1
201410	1744	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	A portion of that optimism revolves around the continued strength in the labor markets.	13	1
201410	1745	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Progress is steadily being made on both employment and unemployment fronts.	13	1
201410	1746	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	This should support somewhat stronger- than-trend growth in 2015.	13	1
201410	1747	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Moreover, long-duration unemployment and U-6 continue to decline.	13	1
201410	1748	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	The four-week moving average of the level of initial claims is at its lowest level since 2000.	13	1
201410	1749	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Given the ongoing strength in labor markets, the continued decline in debt-to-income ratios of households, and improving credit scores, I project that consumption will grow slightly above trend over the rest of this year and next.	13	1
201410	1750	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Given above-trend consumption demand and easier lending conditions, I also continue to anticipate that business fixed investment will grow somewhat above trend.	13	1
201410	1751	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	The only near-term weakness that I foresee is in residential real estate, particularly single- family construction, and nonresidential structures.	13	1
201410	1752	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	And to summarize and sort of use a horse analogy:  The labor market seems to be galloping along; investment is kind of trotting along; consumption is kind of moving at a steady pace and walking; and residential investment doesn’t know whether to walk or simply to graze.	13	1
201410	1753	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	[Laughter.]	13	1
201410	1754	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Putting these broad features together leads me to continue to anticipate aggregate growth of about 3 percent, no change since my September forecast, over the second half of this year and into next year.	13	1
201410	1755	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Weakness in Europe and the appreciating dollar may result in a modest drag on net exports.	13	1
201410	1756	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	On the other hand, the decline in energy prices, as many have already said, is likely to support some sectors of the economy to the good.	13	1
201410	1757	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Once again, I think that, as President Williams said, we are still largely a closed economy.	13	1
201410	1758	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I think weakness in Europe and around the world could have some modest effects, but by and large, I remain optimistic about the US economy.	13	1
201410	1759	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you very much, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	1760	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201410	1761	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13	1
201410	1762	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	1763	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	The District economy continues to expand, and our business contacts remain generally optimistic about the future.	13	1
201410	1764	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Consumers have accelerated the pace of spending, and businesses in the services sector are reporting stronger growth.	13	1
201410	1765	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, manufacturers’ capital spending plans remain solid.	13	1
201410	1766	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Unemployment is 5 percent or less in most District states, and contacts continue to report difficulty in finding qualified labor, both low skilled and for skills in demand.	13	1
201410	1767	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Still, wage pressures remain mostly limited to select occupations and to new hires.	13	1
201410	1768	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Plans for base wage increases for 2015 remain at about 3 percent according to our contacts.	13	1
201410	1769	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Falling oil prices are a concern for the region as a whole, although the District is much less dependent on oil and gas than it was in the 1980s boom-and-bust period.	13	1
201410	1770	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Firms responding to our quarterly energy survey reported needing an average price of $79 per barrel in active fields to make a profit.	13	1
201410	1771	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	In the most productive shale plays, the profitable price is closer to $65 per barrel with the cutoff even lower in the sweet spots.	13	1
201410	1772	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	At current prices, most firms, especially large ones, plan to continue drilling.	13	1
201410	1773	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Although prices are generally expected to remain in the $75 to $90 band, our contacts suggested a decline to $70 to $75 per barrel that persisted beyond their hedged positions could cause activity to plummet.	13	1
201410	1774	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	In the agriculture sector, weak crop prices continue to weigh on farm income and demand for farm operating loans is up substantially.	13	1
201410	1775	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Food processing and agriculture machinery and related businesses are slowing as a result of lower farm income and a drop in exports.	13	1
201410	1776	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Recent financial volatility, renewed concerns about growth, and low inflation in Europe bear watching but have not yet fundamentally changed my view about economic growth.	13	1
201410	1777	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Notwithstanding President Williams’s wildly optimistic World Series forecast [laughter], I continue to expect moderate growth of around 3 percent for the remainder of this year and into 2015.	13	1
201410	1778	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Solid Midwestern growth.	13	1
201410	1779	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	While the stronger dollar and weaker foreign growth may tend to damp US growth, I see the decline in both oil prices and longer-term interest rates providing a countervailing impetus to economic growth.	13	1
201410	1780	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Fundamental indicators of employment and production remain solid, and I remain encouraged, like others, by recent labor market developments.	13	1
201410	1781	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	For example, the decline in the unemployment rate this year has been almost entirely due to increases in household employment rather than declining labor force participation as in previous years, and job openings are at a 13-year high with the number of unemployed workers per job opening down to 2, its lowest level since the recession.	13	1
201410	1782	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Looking across these and a host of other labor market indicators, the Kansas City Fed’s Labor Market Conditions Indicators registered another increase in the level of activity in September and continued strong momentum near its historical high.	13	1
201410	1783	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	The level of activity was the highest since October 2008 when the unemployment rate was 6.5 percent, and for the past six months the momentum indicator has remained at high levels relative to what can be considered normal.	13	1
201410	1784	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, my staff recently looked at wage growth among jobs switchers, as reported by ADP.	13	1
201410	1785	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	This is potentially an important signal about the extent to which businesses are competing more aggressively to attract existing workers away from their current employers.	13	1
201410	1786	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Based on the ADP data, wage growth for these workers has risen from 4 percent to 5.3 percent over the past 18 months as the quit rate has increased from 1.5 to 1.8.	13	1
201410	1787	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	As more workers voluntarily seek alternative employment and employers compete to hire them, the wages of job switchers are rising at a faster pace.	13	1
201410	1788	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	I expect this trend to continue and increasingly to put pressure on overall wage rates.	13	1
201410	1789	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Turning to inflation, I expect to see some softness in the near term due to the stronger dollar and lower oil prices.	13	1
201410	1790	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	And although the recent decline in longer-term inflation expectations as measured by the five-year, five-year forward breakeven rate bears watching, survey-based measures of inflation expectations remain well anchored.	13	1
201410	1791	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	As the unemployment rate is expected to fall to its natural rate by late 2015 and longer-term inflation expectations remain anchored, it seems reasonable to assume that inflation will move toward the 2 percent target.	13	1
201410	1792	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	13	1
201410	1793	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201410	1794	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	13	1
201410	1795	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	1796	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I will focus my remarks on the evolution of the inflation outlook and market-based measures of inflation expectations.	13	1
201410	1797	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In December of 2013, when we initiated the taper, the FOMC statement made reference to watching for evidence that inflation was moving back to target over the medium term.	13	1
201410	1798	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In the first part of this year, there were such signs, as inflation rose more rapidly than many forecasters had expected.	13	1
201410	1799	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	These signs have proven to be transitory.	13	1
201410	1800	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	At this point, the medium-term inflation outlook is no better than it was last December.	13	1
201410	1801	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Indeed, in December 2013, the Tealbook projected that inflation would be back to target by 2018.	13	1
201410	1802	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Tealbook now projects that inflation will remain below target until early in the next decade.	13	1
201410	1803	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This more subdued inflation outlook comes even though the Tealbook’s outlook for monetary policy is considerably more accommodative than it was a couple of months ago.	13	1
201410	1804	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We have a 2 percent inflation target, and that target is like any other goal.	13	1
201410	1805	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Its credibility relies on our consistently taking clear actions to push inflation back toward that target.	13	1
201410	1806	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I am concerned that failing to react to the ongoing subdued inflation outlook has begun to create significant downside risks to the credibility of that target.	13	1
201410	1807	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We can see that downside risk reflected in the behavior of longer-term market-based inflation expectations.	13	1
201410	1808	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As of last week, the five-year, five-year forward inflation breakevens—measured by spreads between TIPS and nominal Treasuries—fell to under 2.2 percent.	13	1
201410	1809	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It is very low by historical standards, lower than all but 1 percent of the daily observations in the previous 10 years.	13	1
201410	1810	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, as many have noted, the potential variation over time and the relative liquidity demand for TIPS and nominal Treasuries sort of reflect quality issues in the Treasury market.	13	1
201410	1811	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It means we should interpret these data with care, and it’s useful to supplement this observation about Treasury inflation breakevens by looking at the recent behavior of five-year, five-year forward inflation expectations embedded in zero coupon inflation swaps.	13	1
201410	1812	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The current reading on that measure is also unusually low, lower than all but 3 percent of the daily observations of the previous 10 years.	13	1
201410	1813	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I focused on market-based measures of inflation expectations.	13	1
201410	1814	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As many of you have noted, survey-based measures of inflation expectations have been considerably more stable, but I do not think we should be overly sanguine about this stability.	13	1
201410	1815	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As a January 2014 memo on the staff inflation outlook described, survey-based measures of inflation expectations remained surprisingly stable in Japan, even as the credibility of that central bank eroded.	13	1
201410	1816	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	To sum up, Madam Chair, the inflation outlook remains subdued.	13	1
201410	1817	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I see little evidence that inflation is, indeed, trending upward over the medium term.	13	1
201410	1818	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I am concerned that our failure to respond to the subdued inflation outlook is creating a substantial downside risk to the credibility of our inflation target.	13	1
201410	1819	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Consistent with this concern, market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are unusually low by historical standards.	13	1
201410	1820	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	13	1
201410	1821	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201410	1822	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13	1
201410	1823	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	1824	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	My view of the economy hasn’t changed much despite the turbulence in financial markets.	13	1
201410	1825	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We’ve marked down our forecasts for economic growth and inflation slightly, but the fundamental narrative regarding the outlook remains intact.	13	1
201410	1826	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Fiscal restraint is ending.	13	1
201410	1827	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Financial conditions remain very accommodative.	13	1
201410	1828	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Banks are well capitalized and tending to ease lending standards.	13	1
201410	1829	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Moreover, fuel for continued gains in consumer spending is evident in solid job gains and lower energy prices—lower energy prices that are likely to boost the growth rate of real income.	13	1
201410	1830	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Moreover, we have a saving rate that still seems relatively high compared with the underlying trend in net worth to income.	13	1
201410	1831	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	A growth trajectory of just short of 3 percent still seems the most likely outcome.	13	1
201410	1832	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In particular, I’d be very hesitant to put too much weight on recent financial market developments.	13	1
201410	1833	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes, financial market conditions are slightly tighter than where we were the previous FOMC meeting, but they’re still very accommodative, and what we’ve seen could reverse quickly, and, in fact, already has reversed to a significant degree.	13	1
201410	1834	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the labor market side of our mandate, I want to just offer a couple of brief thoughts.	13	1
201410	1835	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, some have argued that the large increase in job vacancy rates that we’ve seen, which are above and beyond what one would expect given the unemployment rate, indicates a significant tightening of the labor market and a potential precursor of faster wage growth.	13	1
201410	1836	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That was brought up by President George and was part of the weekly briefing at the Board this week.	13	1
201410	1837	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that’s certainly a possible explanation, but I think there is an alternative explanation worth considering.	13	1
201410	1838	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The end of the extended unemployment compensation benefits at the end of last year essentially led to a significant expansion in the effective supply of labor, as people basically had to start really looking for work.	13	1
201410	1839	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	This meant that the ability to hire someone at a given wage increased, as there was a larger effective pool of potential employees available.	13	1
201410	1840	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Put differently, firms had an incentive to post more job openings because the prospect of actually making a match and bringing someone on board increased.	13	1
201410	1841	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	What did we see?	13	1
201410	1842	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We saw payrolls growing rapidly relative to the underlying growth base.	13	1
201410	1843	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It sort of fits what we actually saw in terms of the economic data.	13	1
201410	1844	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In other words, some of the increase in job vacancies reflects an increase in demand responding to the increase in effective supply.	13	1
201410	1845	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It would not have happened to the same degree if extended unemployment compensation benefits had not been ended.	13	1
201410	1846	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	This alternative explanation, and the fact that compensation trends haven’t accelerated, makes me less concerned that the decline in job vacancy rates is a sign of tightness in the labor market.	13	1
201410	1847	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	On the inflation side, I think we need to carefully distinguish between the fall in actual inflation and developments in terms of inflation expectations.	13	1
201410	1848	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Overall inflation has fallen and will fall considerably more next month, reflecting the recent sharp decline in gasoline prices, but it strikes me this is mostly a positive for the outlook, assuming that oil prices stabilize at or above $70 to $80 per barrel, as the drop in energy prices will boost real income and the effect on overall inflation will likely be transitory.	13	1
201410	1849	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In contrast, I would put somewhat more weight on the decline in market-based measures of inflation compensation.	13	1
201410	1850	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	However, even here there are few signs that what’s going on in the TIPS market is feeding through into survey-based measures of inflation expectations.	13	1
201410	1851	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In fact, an analysis by our research economists in New York suggests that most of the decline in forward TIPS-based breakevens that is beyond the next year or two is due to a decline in the inflation risk premium, in other words, what investors are willing to pay for inflation protection rather than reflecting an actual decline in expected inflation.	13	1
201410	1852	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, although I said it before, I think it bears repeating.	13	1
201410	1853	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The dangers of too-low inflation are considerably less when the economy is growing and nominal incomes are rising at a decent rate.	13	1
201410	1854	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The risk of the United States getting locked into a debt–deflation dynamic seems very low to me.	13	1
201410	1855	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In contrast, in Europe the risks are considerably higher—lower actual inflation, much slower nominal income growth, very high debt burdens, very little deleveraging having actually taken place, and a greater decline in inflation expectations.	13	1
201410	1856	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If I was going to worry about it, I would be much more worried about it with respect to Europe than the United States.	13	1
201410	1857	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, the European outlook obviously was important in provoking the risk-off trade we saw a few weeks ago, but even here I think it’s important to highlight that it isn’t all negative.	13	1
201410	1858	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	On the positive side of the ledger for Europe, the impulse toward fiscal contraction does seem to be fading.	13	1
201410	1859	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In addition, although we didn’t discuss it, I think the early read on the asset quality review and the supervisory stress test seems, at worst, neutral and possibly even favorable because the exercises, I think, are viewed as mostly credible, and the fact is that the net capital need for the banking system appears very manageable.	13	1
201410	1860	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	One more broad question, in terms of risks to the outlook, it seems like we’re going through a pretty significant regime shift in terms of what’s happening to commodity prices and what’s happening to terms of trade around the world—a regime shift that’s the first major change in this for many, many years, and I’d like to highlight it and encourage the Board staff to maybe look into this a little bit.	13	1
201410	1861	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It strikes me that there’s going to be quite a bit of collateral damage associated with this, especially to some emerging market economies.	13	1
201410	1862	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it would be very interesting to just sort of do a deeper dive into this issue to sort of see what kind of things could actually happen in terms of bad macroeconomic performance, but also financial-stability consequences, corporate failures, et cetera, because I think this shift in commodity prices is pretty noteworthy.	13	1
201410	1863	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	My own story about what’s happening is basically that we had this huge impetus to commodity demand as China was rapidly urbanizing, and commodity supply took a long time to catch up.	13	1
201410	1864	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But commodity supply has finally caught up with demand, and so we’re actually seeing pretty much a sea change in terms of the sustainable level of commodity prices.	13	1
201410	1865	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we’re just seeing the very early signs of what this means, and I’d like to delve into this a little deeper because I don’t really understand what the implications are, and I think the implications potentially could be pretty significant for the global economic outlook.	13	1
201410	1866	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	13	1
201410	1867	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201410	1868	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13	1
201410	1869	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	1870	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I can agree with almost everyone, because we seem to have all been saying roughly the same thing.	13	1
201410	1871	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	The economy is growing pretty well, somewhere between 2½, or 2¼ percent, according to President Lacker, to 3 percent and possibly a little more.	13	1
201410	1872	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Unemployment is declining.	13	1
201410	1873	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	However, inflation is below target.	13	1
201410	1874	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Some of that is temporary, but the core was also marked down a bit, and it’s the inflation behavior that is a concern relative to the dual mandate.	13	1
201410	1875	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	There are a lot of reasons to believe this may be temporary, and a lot of reasons to hope that it’s temporary, but it’s been there a while.	13	1
201410	1876	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	We have to keep watching that very, very carefully.	13	1
201410	1877	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I’m inclined to put more weight than most people are on what comes out of the TIPS, adjusted for the two premiums, but I don’t have a good idea of how we measure those premiums.	13	1
201410	1878	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t know how accurate our measures are.	13	1
201410	1879	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	It is clear if you look at the two surveys you’re going to get that they’re reasonably flat for expected inflation over the longer term.	13	1
201410	1880	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I’d like to just discuss two or three of the issues that are in the background.	13	1
201410	1881	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I think President Lockhart said he thinks of these issues as downside risks and hasn’t built them into his baseline forecast:  We’re talking about the weakness in foreign economies, the appreciation of the dollar, and the other big change, the decline in the price of oil and energy.	13	1
201410	1882	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	More generally, and finally, I’d like to ask about how we should think of the implications of the recent market turbulence, which, if this meeting had taken place a week ago, we’d all be talking about and worrying about.	13	1
201410	1883	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	On the exchange rate, I’m not sure where in the whole set-up this comes in, but I think the exchange rate has been a sign that those countries that we’re worried about who had weak economies actually have a factor going in their favor.	13	1
201410	1884	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I just gave a lecture a few weeks ago in which I explained that when we cut our interest rates and/or engage in QE, on balance, we’re doing good for foreign economies because the output effect is quite large and typically outweighs the substitution effect of the exchange rate.	13	1
201410	1885	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	In some countries the exchange rate is declining because of expansionary monetary policy, and that means they’re acting in a way that will cure some of the effect on us of the foreign growth decline that we’re worried about very much.	13	1
201410	1886	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Secondly, I think that in Europe the big fear at the IMF meetings was based on the decline in German output of automobiles in September, and all of a sudden if you look at the numbers, that’s sort of mostly disappeared, and it looks like a one-time shot.	13	1
201410	1887	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	And China, we were all very worried until we got a number that essentially was close to 7½ percent, and now we’re all feeling much better.	13	1
201410	1888	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I have a feeling that the dynamics of what we’re seeing in the foreign economies, both in terms of what is likely to happen from their side as a result of their depreciations and of what’s been happening in the data is less bad than we had thought until a few days ago.	13	1
201410	1889	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	On the implications of market turbulence, I just want to talk about it.	13	1
201410	1890	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	When it was happening there was a lot of concern—something is going on.	13	1
201410	1891	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I think that’s a bit strange in the sense that we’ve been saying for a long time that risk premiums are far too low and yields are compressed and all sorts of unhealthy developments are taking place in the capital markets.	13	1
201410	1892	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Then we get a sign that they’re changing, and the premiums are rising, and we all get upset because there’s a lot of turbulence.	13	1
201410	1893	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Then there was a discussion that I had with myself—I said to myself, I wouldn’t say this about the possibility that, if we did anything, we’d hear about a new, let me call it a “Fed put.”	13	1
201410	1894	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Well, the next day I saw it in all the headlines so I realized that it wasn’t a particularly original thought.	13	1
201410	1895	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I’ve been thinking about that put.	13	1
201410	1896	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Some puts are very healthy.	13	1
201410	1897	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	When you talk about stabilization policy, we are in fact giving people who invest the belief that if things go wrong, we’ll act.	13	1
201410	1898	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	That’s encouraging and that’s stabilizing and that’s not a problem.	13	1
201410	1899	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	But nobody says this—a “Fed output put”—because it would indicate that the Fed is doing something useful.	13	1
201410	1900	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	13	1
201410	1901	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I think if we look at the capital markets, the reason we don’t want to have a Fed put is that we rely on the capital markets, particularly the equity markets, to also send price signals.	13	1
201410	1902	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	If every time a signal is appearing we suddenly go in and wipe it out, in a way that doesn’t change the underlying realities—and maybe it could change the underlying realities—then we stop the capital markets working as they should.	13	1
201410	1903	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I think we need to recognize on this put issue that if the economy gets into really bad trouble—October 1987, 22 percent decline in one day—you might actually want to do something rationally, and it will be good for the economy.	13	1
201410	1904	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	But on things that look reasonable—I know that there was a six standard deviation move, which doesn’t look reasonable, but which relative to recent behavior looks reasonable—we should just let it go by.	13	1
201410	1905	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I think that’s particularly important now because we need to expect that as we move ahead there is going to be a lot more volatility in the capital markets.	13	1
201410	1906	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	We more or less agree with the path of market interest rates, and that gives a nice impression that as we move along that path it will all be a nice, smooth thing, and everybody will be very happy because we are just going down this gradually rising path.	13	1
201410	1907	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	But actually the way it happens is that there are different groups of people with different sets of expectations making up the market.	13	1
201410	1908	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	At some point, a bunch of them get an idea and realize they misdiagnosed and they move.	13	1
201410	1909	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	They don’t move one after the other in line delicately; they all try to jump.	13	1
201410	1910	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	We’ll see quite a lot of volatility, and we’d better be ready for it.	13	1
201410	1911	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	We’d better just take it in stride and not get ourselves too upset about something that I think is waiting for us for quite a few months.	13	1
201410	1912	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I’m also sort of worrying about the following.	13	1
201410	1913	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I am very impressed that we are focused on liftoff, and liftoff is very important.	13	1
201410	1914	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	You’ve got to do it if you want to raise the rate to some higher level.	13	1
201410	1915	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	But it’s only the first step of a process.	13	1
201410	1916	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	It is not the end of the story.	13	1
201410	1917	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	We need to prepare ourselves.	13	1
201410	1918	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Once we’ve understood it properly, we also need to start preparing the markets for what is likely to happen or for the range of things that could happen, because those standard errors in the handout we got today and in the Tealbook are pretty broad around almost every variable in which we’re interested.	13	1
201410	1919	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I think that’s the way it’s going to work.	13	1
201410	1920	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	But on the whole, I am impressed that economic growth remains more or less constant.	13	1
201410	1921	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I’ll throw a question onto the table and just ask somebody to reply to it.	13	1
201410	1922	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	We are way more pessimistic about the third quarter than the other two groups of researchers who give quarterly forecasts and update them every day—that is, Macroeconomic Advisers and Capital Economics.	13	1
201410	1923	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	They come in at 3.5 percent and 3.3 percent for GDP growth, and we are coming in at 2.7 percent this quarter.	13	1
201410	1924	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	The difference, it has been explained to me, is inventory investment, which we think is going to move more into the fourth quarter, and they were all putting it in the third quarter.	13	1
201410	1925	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	As a question, would the dynamics of what happens after this look different if we were growing at 3.3 percent in the third quarter?	13	1
201410	1926	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Is there somewhere in the dynamics a lagged growth rate in the equation with a positive sign?	13	1
201410	1927	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Or is it totally irrelevant to anything that happens in the future?	13	1
201410	1928	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	That’s a footnote question.	13	1
201410	1929	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	But, on the whole, I think we are doing pretty well.	13	1
201410	1930	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Despite the concerns about inflation, like the others who have discussed it, I think we’ve got to watch it very carefully.	13	1
201410	1931	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	If it doesn’t rise, it could well affect the pace at which we go after departing the ELB.	13	1
201410	1932	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	But I think if we keep delaying that departure, we are going to probably have a negative effect on economic growth rather than a positive one.	13	1
201410	1933	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I’m not allowed to say my policy views, Madam Chair, so I won’t.	13	1
201410	1934	2014-10-29	meeting		[Laughter]	13	1
201410	1935	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	People occasionally do allow policy comments in the economic round.	13	1
201410	1936	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	But we give them dirty looks when they do it.	13	1
201410	1937	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	That’s what your gavel is for.	13	1
201410	1938	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	[Laughter]	13	1
201410	1939	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	For hitting the table, that’s right.	13	1
201410	1940	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13	1
201410	1941	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	1942	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	As Governor Fischer noted, I think almost everybody has reaffirmed that the outlook for the United States has not changed that much, notwithstanding some increases in downside risks abroad and the turbulence of a couple of weeks ago.	13	1
201410	1943	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	A number of you have said things that I had noted, so I won’t repeat them.	13	1
201410	1944	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I think I’ll just make two points, which at some level are both about aggregate demand, but one is a bit of an upside and one is a bit of a downside.	13	1
201410	1945	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	The first point picks up on something to which President Plosser alluded but didn’t elaborate, which is capital expenditures, business fixed investment.	13	1
201410	1946	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I think a number of us noted at the beginning of the year that there was some potential upside with cap-ex this year after a number of years of really quite low levels.	13	1
201410	1947	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	That, to date, has been realized.	13	1
201410	1948	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	It’s still a little hard, at least for me, to figure out how to decompose the increases in capital expenditures among three kinds of expenditures.	13	1
201410	1949	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	One, just to be a little homey about it, is when whatever you’ve got breaks down and you’ve got to buy something new; it does increase spending in the economy, but it doesn’t have a particular effect on productivity or capacity.	13	1
201410	1950	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	The second is when you replace existing stock with more efficient capital stock, thereby enhancing productivity, even if you don’t increase capacity.	13	1
201410	1951	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Then, obviously, the third is when you’re increasing capacity.	13	1
201410	1952	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	As I say, it has been a little hard for me to get a sense of how the uptick in spending has broken down among those categories, but I would assume that after several years of categories 1 and, to some extent, 2 being dominant, category 2 is probably now a little bit more dominant.	13	1
201410	1953	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I think there is still not much evidence of increases in capacity.	13	1
201410	1954	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	What would it take to sustain the higher levels of capital expenditure?	13	1
201410	1955	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Almost surely an increase in aggregate demand or expected aggregate demand.	13	1
201410	1956	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Given where we have been getting increases in income over the past couple of years, which I think has been predominantly from more people at work but not from higher compensation for the people at work, the logical place to expect that we could have an even greater push on income and thus aggregate demand would be from rising wages.	13	1
201410	1957	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I just wanted to state that, although many of us have been talking about the absence of increases in wages over a period of sustained job growth, we sometimes are almost implicitly acting as though once you start getting wage growth there is going to be a problem.	13	1
201410	1958	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I just want to say, I think it’s quite the contrary.	13	1
201410	1959	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	We’re in need of wage growth right now in order to provide the boost to aggregate demand, which will perhaps, in turn, push capital spending more into what I classified as category 3, and certainly into category 2.	13	1
201410	1960	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Let’s remember that we have quite a ways to go before average wage increases are equal to inflation plus productivity growth.	13	1
201410	1961	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Even if we get to that point, given how relatively high profitability has been, it is quite possible that competition for workers will pull some returns to capital into returns to workers, although as John pointed out a meeting or two ago, that’s not at all clear.	13	1
201410	1962	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	But there is at least some possibility that that would happen.	13	1
201410	1963	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Of course, in any case, the relationship between wage increases and overall inflation is not the easiest thing in the world to pin down in recent years.	13	1
201410	1964	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	That’s the potential upside, but I think it does depend significantly on wage increases that would contribute to increased aggregate demand.	13	1
201410	1965	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I see the downside risks, like many of you, in the international economy.	13	1
201410	1966	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Here I’m a little less sanguine than Stan, although maybe that means I’m just placing the risk level slightly higher—it’s still a risk, not a reality.	13	1
201410	1967	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	We’ve obviously seen some slowing of foreign economic performance.	13	1
201410	1968	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	That’s not just a downside risk; it’s part of the background now.	13	1
201410	1969	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	But, like many of you, I do see some further risks.	13	1
201410	1970	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I won’t repeat what many of you have said but just add to it by saying that I do think when you talk to people who are doing business in Europe, Japan, China, and Asia outside of China, one is struck by the absence of upside stories or risks at all.	13	1
201410	1971	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	It is all downside, and it’s just a question of how much.	13	1
201410	1972	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	You don’t find anybody who says, “Oh, the euro zone will bounce back in a big way next year,” or “China has got another surge of growth right around the corner.”	13	1
201410	1973	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	On the contrary, during the gloomy IMF weekend—it was almost like they were hanging funeral bunting on the 13th floor of HQ1.	13	1
201410	1974	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I mean, everybody was just gloomy.	13	1
201410	1975	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	But one thing I was struck by was how, at least in private conversations, European policymakers were basically saying, “We don’t really have any particularly effective tools that are going to get deployed.”	13	1
201410	1976	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	A number of them wished for some sort of fiscal action but thought it was highly unlikely.	13	1
201410	1977	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Even in monetary policy, I think expectations are pretty modest for what can be done.	13	1
201410	1978	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	With all the issues, the risks of deflation that Vice Chairman Dudley mentioned, the downside risks, the structural problems, and the fact that I don’t think that stress tests are going to give much of a boost to the economy, you do have a circumstance in which such risks as there are decidedly downside.	13	1
201410	1979	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	China had a good number; that is true.	13	1
201410	1980	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	But I was struck by the fact that every international banker with whom I spoke—and they came by for supervisory meetings, so I saw about a dozen—who has significant China business was basically saying, “We see more of a slowdown than is apparent in the existing data.”	13	1
201410	1981	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I think that was probably a prospective observation.	13	1
201410	1982	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	They weren’t necessarily saying the data, as reported, is wrong.	13	1
201410	1983	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	But they are bankers, and they were seeing a substantially reduced level of inquiry about lending for future activities, for financing activities domestically.	13	1
201410	1984	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	The only exception was help in doing acquisitions abroad, so that a number of Chinese companies are now following the old Japanese pattern of saying, “We don’t see much growth potential here.	13	1
201410	1985	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	We’ve got to go and buy something abroad.”	13	1
201410	1986	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	No one seemed to see a significant upside risk in the next year.	13	1
201410	1987	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Nobody was thinking this is going to be an area of growth for us in the near term.	13	1
201410	1988	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	On Japan, I don’t think there is a particularly convincing upside story to tell either.	13	1
201410	1989	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Again, although they can get some boost from the depreciation of their currencies, when so many countries seem to be relying on currency depreciation and increased exports, it feels as though the only source of aggregate demand in any big way is us.	13	1
201410	1990	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Under those circumstances, I am a little less sanguine about the sort of self-correcting nature of their economic performance.	13	1
201410	1991	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Finally, I wanted to say a complimentary word about the memo that we got on the dollar and the dollar effects, because I thought the staff who wrote it were trying to be very careful and actually slightly conservative.	13	1
201410	1992	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I think they were stipulating for us an increase and then trying to trace through what the effects would be.	13	1
201410	1993	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	It’s true that it’s hard to capture all of the effects, but my own reading was the staff was on the conservative side.	13	1
201410	1994	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I think they did try to build in some things other than export and import prices.	13	1
201410	1995	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	That is, I think they tried to assume some effect on primary income, which is, again, hard to pin down.	13	1
201410	1996	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	But I don’t think they are able to project the negative wealth effects that are associated with the decline in the dollar value of assets that are held in markets whose currencies depreciate significantly against the dollar, the effect on balance sheets.	13	1
201410	1997	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	All of those things that do happen and that we’ve seen in the past can have an effect are really, I think, hard to incorporate and model, but they are probably going to have some effect.	13	1
201410	1998	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I actually found it quite useful, sort of as a level-setting exercise.	13	1
201410	1999	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Again, I actually assume a slightly greater rather than slightly lesser effect.	13	1
201410	2000	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	As I think Chris or somebody said earlier, they’re not saying there is going to be a 10 percent appreciation of the dollar.	13	1
201410	2001	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	They are just trying to tell us what the channels for transmitting those effects would be.	13	1
201410	2002	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	And we can bring down the amount of expected appreciation and still trace through some of those effects.	13	1
201410	2003	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	2004	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201410	2005	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13	1
201410	2006	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	2007	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Like others, the broad picture I see is one of continued US strength threatened in the medium term by weakness abroad and accompanied not only by more volatile financial conditions and a stronger dollar, but also by lower commodity prices, lower interest rates, and a still-strong equity market.	13	1
201410	2008	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Markets are focused on the possibility of a synchronized slowdown in global growth and the likely effects on economic growth and inflation here if that happens.	13	1
201410	2009	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Without making a prediction, I’m going to join others in suggesting that the risks run on both sides of that case.	13	1
201410	2010	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I guess I would say I have a low level of conviction that the significant effects on economic growth that are in the baseline will turn out to have been justified, and I would tend to look at them more as real downside risks.	13	1
201410	2011	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	On US performance since the last meeting, that has been well covered around the table.	13	1
201410	2012	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I would just say it suggested overall continued strength, and in the aggregate was pretty close to expectations.	13	1
201410	2013	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I would add to what others have pointed out that the Michigan survey, the Conference Board survey, and the Gallup US Economic Confidence Index all stand at their highest levels since before the crisis.	13	1
201410	2014	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Fiscal headwinds are all but gone.	13	1
201410	2015	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	GDP growth has been 3 percent, really, since the beginning of 2013 and through 2014.	13	1
201410	2016	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I am ignoring for this purpose the puzzling crater that was the first quarter of this year; I realize that.	13	1
201410	2017	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	But I’m just going to do that and say it has been 3 percent.	13	1
201410	2018	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I believe lower oil prices are going to increase economic growth, on net.	13	1
201410	2019	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Of course, housing is disappointing, and overall we are looking at 3 percent for the second half of this year, and I guess not much has changed.	13	1
201410	2020	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	In the Tealbook forecast, economic growth is marked down, and employment growth is marked down substantially.	13	1
201410	2021	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Monthly payroll growth is marked down from 220,000 to 150,000 in 2015, and I guess I would say that seems like a big markdown to me.	13	1
201410	2022	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	That would push out the time to full employment by about 50 percent, and it just feels to me like there is significant upside risk there, the mistake being that for any quantum of GDP growth, we’re underestimating the amount of payroll growth.	13	1
201410	2023	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Turning to inflation briefly, it is declining and now thanks to lower energy prices and a strong dollar, the forecast has moved down.	13	1
201410	2024	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	As I think someone else mentioned, those are good reasons.	13	1
201410	2025	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	On the market inflation expectations, I would wait and let markets settle out, because we know that liquidity plays probably the biggest role.	13	1
201410	2026	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I have seen a decomposition of the Board’s model, and the single biggest piece of the move in breakevens was the liquidity premium, which accounted for almost half of the move.	13	1
201410	2027	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	That’s something that should not persist.	13	1
201410	2028	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	It clearly bears close watching, but I’m inclined to look through what are probably temporary effects.	13	1
201410	2029	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I continue to see inflation returning gradually to 2 percent, assuming that we hit our economic growth projections.	13	1
201410	2030	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I do see that the real risk to inflation is lower growth, and I do believe that if we hit our growth projections we will see inflation move back to 2 percent as we get around full employment.	13	1
201410	2031	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	On financial conditions, they clearly have become more volatile, although I guess I’m not really ready to say that they have tightened significantly on net.	13	1
201410	2032	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	In fact, I would say that financial conditions remain highly accommodative.	13	1
201410	2033	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Treasury rates are much lower.	13	1
201410	2034	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Market readings of expectations at liftoff are way out.	13	1
201410	2035	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Equities are almost back where they started, and the equity market, I wouldn’t say, cuts either way right now.	13	1
201410	2036	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Mortgage lending standards remain tight for less creditworthy borrowers but continue to loosen modestly for most others.	13	1
201410	2037	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	You can sort of think of the strong dollar as being offset by lower interest rates and lower energy prices.	13	1
201410	2038	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	On volatility, I want to join Governor Fischer in pointing out that many around the table, including myself, bemoaned the lack of volatility.	13	1
201410	2039	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Now it’s here, and I just want to say that I continue to expect and welcome more normal levels of volatility, albeit not compressed into the space of one hour as it was.	13	1
201410	2040	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	[Laughter]	13	1
201410	2041	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Not exactly what we were thinking of.	13	1
201410	2042	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Turning to the big risk, it clearly is that of a synchronized weakening in global economic growth.	13	1
201410	2043	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I don’t see it as the most likely case.	13	1
201410	2044	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Our own forecast for Europe is for 1½ percent growth next year, then 2 percent for the next two years after that.	13	1
201410	2045	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I think if that level of growth materializes or is seen as likely to materialize, the dollar could easily retrace some of its recent strength, which seems to have been driven by increased perceptions of tail risk in Europe.	13	1
201410	2046	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	China has consistently shown the ability to avoid a hard landing, although there are certainly major structural issues to be dealt with in the medium term.	13	1
201410	2047	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	To wrap up, financial markets are sending strong signals of concern about global weakness and the resulting effects on the US economy, but there is a disconnect between the actual performance of the economy and what the markets are pricing in ahead.	13	1
201410	2048	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I would close by saying it is worth remembering that markets often overshoot and may have done so here.	13	1
201410	2049	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	2050	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201410	2051	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13	1
201410	2052	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201410	2053	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The data on the domestic economy since September have been about as expected.	13	1
201410	2054	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	In contrast, the continued appreciation of the dollar and growing concern about growth of foreign demand in particular suggest the balance of risks for activity and inflation are somewhat more tilted to the downside.	13	1
201410	2055	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I think the added uncertainty and that downside risk validate our strategy of remaining patient about removing accommodation, recognizing the asymmetry of our policy toolkit, and argue for caution in adjusting communication in any way that might signal otherwise.	13	1
201410	2056	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I see the news on financial stability since July as somewhat mixed.	13	1
201410	2057	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	We have seen a return to somewhat more normal levels of volatility, and I think it is notable that the market absorbed very large outflows from an asset manager with very little difficulty.	13	1
201410	2058	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	On the other hand, we saw a massive price move and huge volumes in a market that is among the most liquid in the world for reasons that we still don’t really understand, which I view as somewhat concerning.	13	1
201410	2059	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	On the inflation front, as everyone has noted, we have seen a fall in inflation due to energy prices, which I think should not be a concern, and has some positive potential, particularly for lower-income consumers.	13	1
201410	2060	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The market-based measures of inflation expectations, which have fallen, do bear careful watching.	13	1
201410	2061	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I think it is too early, really, to be able to tell how much of that is due to a change in expectations versus the other liquidity and risk premiums that people have discussed.	13	1
201410	2062	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	But I do also think we should continue watching it in the context in which some of the other large economies in the world are exporting disinflationary pressures.	13	1
201410	2063	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent data on the labor market, overall, signal that conditions continue to improve, although not as rapidly as we saw earlier in the year.	13	1
201410	2064	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The unemployment rate, as has been noted, has declined by 0.2 percentage point over the most recent three-month period, which is encouraging.	13	1
201410	2065	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The share of employees working part time for economic reasons has moved lower since June, but the current level remains well above pre-recession norms, suggesting slack not captured in the unemployment rate.	13	1
201410	2066	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Reinforcing the evidence of slack, the labor force participation rate edged down again in September, and it seems possible that a nontrivial part of that movement and the weakness in participation remains cyclical given continued essentially flat real wages.	13	1
201410	2067	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Taken together, I think the moderate pace of increases in employment, together with the potential for slack to be somewhat larger than indicated by the unemployment rate, counsel continued patience in adjusting the stance of monetary policy.	13	1
201410	2068	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Although the data on aggregate spending have been about as expected, stubbornly weak data in the single-family housing market, in which starts have changed little in recent months, is worrisome.	13	1
201410	2069	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	One might think, given the low level of interest rates, some recent improvement in the availability of mortgage credit, and the large scope of increases in household formation, that this historically interest-elastic sector would be more robust.	13	1
201410	2070	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Instead, the housing recovery remains painfully slow.	13	1
201410	2071	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I commend the staff for reevaluating its method of projecting movements in the dollar.	13	1
201410	2072	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I found the analysis on this subject, together with the alternative simulations on a higher dollar and lower foreign growth, informative in trying to size the possible headwinds to US growth and inflation from the gloomier foreign outlook.	13	1
201410	2073	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I agree with the decision to revise up the projected path of the dollar and lower the outlook for foreign growth.	13	1
201410	2074	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	In fact, I would probably be inclined to go a little further with an emphasis on very weak growth in foreign domestic demand, which I think is the relevant concept.	13	1
201410	2075	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The recent stagnation in euro-area activity in the context of monetary policy at the zero lower bound, and both inflation and inflation expectations heading lower, calls for fiscal action as well as monetary policy action.	13	1
201410	2076	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The staff did some interesting simulations that suggest that such a policy, in conjunction with further monetary policy stimulus, could provide a meaningful boost to demand and could alter the economic trajectory of the euro area.	13	1
201410	2077	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Unfortunately, I think the very likely scenario is one in which monetary policy gets no help from fiscal policy.	13	1
201410	2078	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	While more accommodative monetary policy may keep the euro area out of severe recession, it is likely to operate primarily through the export channel, and it is unlikely on its own to produce robust domestic demand.	13	1
201410	2079	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, I think there are significant downside risks around even this gloomy outlook.	13	1
201410	2080	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Given the fact that debt-to-GDP ratios remain very elevated for some important euro-area countries, the prospect of policy paralysis, stagnant growth, and deflation could reignite concerns about debt sustainability in important economies, in particular, Italy.	13	1
201410	2081	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Most immediately, there may be some turbulence as Greece attempts to negotiate the next chapter beyond its current IMF and euro-area program.	13	1
201410	2082	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	On top of this, the prospect of ongoing stagnant growth in Japan is very real, and the support that China will be able to provide to global demand growth will diminish.	13	1
201410	2083	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Putting the risks to the US economy from shocks or negative developments originating at home in this broader context of weak global demand and disinflationary pressures from abroad only reinforces the asymmetry in the risks to our economy.	13	1
201410	2084	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	If, as in the faster recovery scenario in the Tealbook, demand growth in the United States is significantly greater than the baseline, it’s very plausible that much of this added demand could be absorbed globally, with the United States kind of playing its traditional role as the residual provider of global demand.	13	1
201410	2085	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	If, by contrast, as in the increased financial turbulence scenario, domestic demand is considerably weaker than in the baseline, I think the ability of the global economy to buffer any US weakness is very limited.	13	1
201410	2086	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	13	1
201410	2087	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	2	2
201410	2088	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	What I propose is that we go have dinner.	2	2
201410	2089	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I gather there is some baseball game or something tonight?	2	2
201410	2090	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	2	2
201410	2091	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, there is.	2	2
201410	2092	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I surely would want to do nothing to make it difficult for you to watch.	2	2
201410	2093	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I thought you said you needed to get home to watch the game.	2	2
201410	2094	2014-10-29	meeting		[Meeting recessed]	2	2
201410	2095	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I’m not promising, myself, to watch.	2	2
201410	2096	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	2	2
201410	2097	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I’ll start off tomorrow by trying to sum up this discussion and make a couple of comments, and then we’ll go to our policy round.	2	2
201410	2098	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll break for now for the reception, and tomorrow we’re starting at 9:00 am October 29 Session .	2	2
201410	2099	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Well, we’re two minutes early, but everybody is here.	2	2
201410	2100	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s get going.	2	2
201410	2101	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	What I’d like to do is start with a summary of yesterday’s discussion and a few comments, and then we’ll turn to policy.	13	1
201410	2102	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I want to thank everyone for a very thoughtful round of observations on the economic outlook.	13	1
201410	2103	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Our presumptive decision to end our asset purchases marks a milestone to me.	13	1
201410	2104	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	The sobering experience of the past six years has taught us to be cautious with declarations of victory.	13	1
201410	2105	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Yet we should also recognize that the economy has made a good deal of progress since the depths of the recession.	13	1
201410	2106	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I believe that the highly accommodative policies that this Committee has pursued since then, including our asset purchases, have made crucial contributions to these outcomes.	13	1
201410	2107	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Nonetheless, the job of returning the economy to maximum employment and price stability is not yet finished.	13	1
201410	2108	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let me now try to summarize some main themes in your economic comments by noting how they bear on the progress we have achieved in closing the employment and inflation gaps and the question of whether incoming evidence suggests any meaningful change in the likely future pace of progress.	13	1
201410	2109	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Starting with the labor market, I think we all agree that conditions have continued to improve, and that the degree of underutilization of labor resources is diminished.	13	1
201410	2110	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Payrolls posted a solid gain in September, and the low initial August reading was revised up.	13	1
201410	2111	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Three- and six- month average gains remain well above 200,000 a month.	13	1
201410	2112	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	The unemployment rate declined 0.2 percentage point, even though the labor force participation rate also declined 0.1 percentage point, but the employment-to-population ratio edged up.	13	1
201410	2113	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	The share of employees working part time for economic reasons continued to edge down, and, although it remains very high, it has declined about ½ percentage point since the start of the year.	13	1
201410	2114	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Even though the labor force participation rate ticked down again in September, it has leveled off, on balance, since last fall rather than continuing to decline, which suggests some progress in reducing the cyclical shortfall in participation.	13	1
201410	2115	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Job openings have risen, although, as Vice Chairman Dudley pointed out, this increase could be partly related to the ending of extended unemployment benefits.	13	1
201410	2116	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	As some of you noted, firms report somewhat greater difficulty in filling some jobs.	13	1
201410	2117	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Broad measures of labor market indicators, such as those produced by the Kansas City Fed and the Board, also show improvement.	13	1
201410	2118	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	In some areas and sectors, a pickup in wage growth is now evident, and President George noted research by her staff suggesting that larger wage gains are being achieved by workers who switch jobs, as the quit rate has gradually risen.	13	1
201410	2119	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	This may be a sign of improving labor market conditions, but we’re not yet seeing broad-based evidence of stronger wage gains.	13	1
201410	2120	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	For the purpose of the goals we established for the asset purchase program, my sense is that everyone around the table sees a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market as now having been achieved.	13	1
201410	2121	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	The sustainability of labor market improvements depends importantly on the outlook for economic growth.	13	1
201410	2122	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	In this regard, I heard most of you express reasonable confidence that growth will be adequate in the period ahead to sustain continued improvement in the labor market over coming months.	13	1
201410	2123	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	US spending data, on balance, have come in largely as we expected in September, and most of us appear to anticipate economic growth running near 3 percent in the second half of the year.	13	1
201410	2124	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Indeed, many of you noted that your outlook for the US economy has not changed much.	13	1
201410	2125	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	There has been some downgrading of the modal outlook for global growth, but the resulting downgrade to the US modal outlook is relatively modest, especially if, as in the Tealbook baseline, monetary policy responds by raising the funds rate somewhat more gradually than previously anticipated.	13	1
201410	2126	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, many of you noted that the decline in oil prices provides an offset to the factors restraining demand.	13	1
201410	2127	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Consumers, especially low-income consumers, will benefit from the decline in energy prices.	13	1
201410	2128	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	That said, an assessment of the overall effects of lower energy prices also needs to take into account the effects of price declines on producers and the effects that lower prices may have on their production and investment.	13	1
201410	2129	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	On balance, energy price declines of the magnitude seen so far seem likely to be a positive for the outlook.	13	1
201410	2130	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Recent readings on consumer confidence remain quite high, and you noted that businesses remain reasonably optimistic.	13	1
201410	2131	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Financial conditions also remain highly supportive of economic growth.	13	1
201410	2132	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Although financial markets have been volatile and there has been some decline in the stock market and increases in credit spreads and the dollar, Treasury yields and mortgage rates have also declined, and credit conditions seem to be easing somewhat.	13	1
201410	2133	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Turning to inflation, we also specified that a condition for ending the asset purchases is that incoming data continue to support our expectation of inflation moving back toward 2 percent.	13	1
201410	2134	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Several of you emphasized that inflation has been running well below our 2 percent objective and noted that there hasn’t been any significant progress in closing the shortfall.	13	1
201410	2135	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	On a 12-month basis, both total and core PCE inflation are running at about 1½ percent.	13	1
201410	2136	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Over the next few months, we will almost certainly see a substantial deceleration in headline PCE prices from lower energy costs.	13	1
201410	2137	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, several of you pointed to downward pressure on inflation from dollar appreciation and hence lower non-energy commodity and imported goods prices.	13	1
201410	2138	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	On the question of whether lower energy prices and the higher dollar will leave an imprint on inflation beyond the next couple of quarters, however, I heard mixed views.	13	1
201410	2139	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you argued that inflation will move back to 2 percent over time, in an environment of continued reductions in resource slack and well-anchored expectations, but a number of you noted worrisome downside risks.	13	1
201410	2140	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, there is the question of just how well anchored inflation expectations really are.	13	1
201410	2141	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Many of you noted that measures of longer-term inflation expectations are challenging to assess at this time.	13	1
201410	2142	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Survey-based measures, including the latest reading from the dealer survey, have remained stable, but both five-year and five-year, five-year- forward breakevens have declined noticeably since our September meeting.	13	1
201410	2143	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	As President Bullard and others noted, this is a concerning development.	13	1
201410	2144	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	However, a large share of the decline in breakevens could be attributable to factors other than a reduction in longer-term inflation expectations, such as a decline in the inflation risk premium, perhaps partly reflecting lower probabilities of high-inflation outcomes, the appreciation of the dollar, and liquidity effects.	13	1
201410	2145	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Even in survey-based measures, we may see some movements in the near term.	13	1
201410	2146	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	As President Williams noted, we’ve often seen in survey measures a relatively short-lived overreaction of longer-term expectations to events that should produce only a transitory increase in inflation, particularly an increase in oil prices.	13	1
201410	2147	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thus, we should be aware that survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations could decline in coming months, but that such effects could well prove transitory.	13	1
201410	2148	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	In all, while most of you see these recent developments as largely transitory, and thus continue to expect that inflation will move gradually back toward 2 percent, some of you are concerned that we may be seeing the beginning of a worrisome downward adjustment in inflation expectations.	13	1
201410	2149	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	As President Kocherlakota emphasized, a failure on our part to take decisive action could exacerbate this risk by diminishing the credibility of our commitment to our 2 percent inflation objective.	13	1
201410	2150	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Inflation developments will certainly bear close watching.	13	1
201410	2151	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	With regard to risks to the outlook, almost all of you discussed risks pertaining to the global outlook.	13	1
201410	2152	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Markets have been quite focused on foreign developments, and economic news from abroad since the September meeting has, on balance, been less reassuring.	13	1
201410	2153	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Many of you mentioned downside risks from China and Europe.	13	1
201410	2154	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Because the euro area is at the zero lower bound and fiscal policy options are limited, the risks to economic growth and inflation seem asymmetric and weighted to the downside.	13	1
201410	2155	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	In terms of the spillovers to the United States, some of you noted that the United States is still a relatively closed economy, and thus the risks to the US outlook are not outsized.	13	1
201410	2156	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	However, several of you worried that with the United States also operating at the zero lower bound, it would be difficult to respond to weakness in the US economic growth or inflation outlook if there was a more significant downgrade in the foreign outlook.	13	1
201410	2157	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you also commented on the recent spell of financial market volatility.	13	1
201410	2158	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	You noted that because many of us at past meetings have expressed concerns about signs of complacency in some market segments, some increase in volatility could arguably be a healthy development from a financial-stability standpoint, and several of you noted that we’re likely to see further episodes of volatility as normalization approaches.	13	1
201410	2159	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	While movements in financial markets that significantly threaten the economic outlook could certainly require some response, many of you cautioned that we should take market movements like those we recently saw in stride.	13	1
201410	2160	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there and see if anybody would like to comment on this summary.	13	1
201410	2161	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	13	1
201410	2162	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	If not, I have just a couple of very brief comments.	13	1
201410	2163	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, I think we’ve reached the point at which we can declare that there’s been a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market since the inception of our asset purchase program, and I think it’s also important that we acknowledge the recent progress that we have seen in labor market conditions.	13	1
201410	2164	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Alternative B proposes to do that by eliminating the reference to “significant” slack.	13	1
201410	2165	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I support that change, but I would note that in my assessment appreciable slack still remains in the labor market, so we do have some way to go before reaching our goal of maximum employment.	13	1
201410	2166	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	On inflation, the recent declines in oil and other commodity prices, along with the effects of the dollar appreciation on prices of other imported goods and services, will surely hold down inflation in the near term.	13	1
201410	2167	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	My own medium-term inflation outlook, however, is little changed, and I continue to believe that the risks of inflation running persistently below 2 percent have diminished since earlier in the year.	13	1
201410	2168	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	In our December 2013 SEP, the central tendency for four-quarter PCE inflation in 2014 was 1.4 to 1.6 percent.	13	1
201410	2169	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	This projection appears to be right on the mark, but our central tendency for the unemployment rate in the current quarter was 6.3 to 6.6 percent.	13	1
201410	2170	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Given that we’ve revised down our estimate of the longer-run normal rate since December by only a small amount, we seem to be on the path of measurably tighter resource utilization than we expected at the beginning of this year, which, in my view, diminishes the downside risk to inflation.	13	1
201410	2171	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	The shift down in TIPS inflation compensation was nontrivial, and if longer-term inflation expectations were to shift down, this would clearly be a concern.	13	1
201410	2172	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	However, I would join those who pointed out that recent readings on five-year, five-year-forward breakevens are difficult to parse.	13	1
201410	2173	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Indeed, the dealers were about evenly split on the question of whether the decline mostly reflects inflation expectations or other factors.	13	1
201410	2174	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Clearly, we must pay very close attention to this issue as we go forward, but at this point, like many of you, I think we should be cautious about reading too much into the recent market moves.	13	1
201410	2175	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, despite the recent flare-up in financial market volatility, I view financial conditions as remaining highly accommodative.	13	1
201410	2176	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	On approach to liftoff, we are very likely to encounter further pockets of turbulence, and I think we should set a high bar before we decide to lean against such developments.	13	1
201410	2177	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there, and with that I think we’re ready to turn to our policy round.	13	1
201410	2178	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I will now turn to Bill for his briefing.	21	2
201410	2179	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21	2
201410	2180	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21	2
201410	2181	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The alternatives are the same as those distributed on Monday but with all of the changes now shown in the usual Tealbook format.	21	2
201410	2182	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The first page of the handout provides information relevant to some of the key issues you face today.	21	2
201410	2183	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The top two panels address recent progress in the labor market.	21	2
201410	2184	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	According to the staff’s composite measure, shown to the left, labor market conditions have improved further over the past three months, albeit at a somewhat more gradual pace than earlier in the year.	21	2
201410	2185	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	September’s unemployment rate (the black line in the exhibit to the right), at 5.9 percent, was about ½ percentage point above the middle of the central tendency of your estimates of its longer-run normal level but just below the top of the range of your estimates.	21	2
201410	2186	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Longer-duration joblessness has been coming down noticeably; however, the rate of involuntary part- time work remains well above levels previously associated with an unemployment rate in the vicinity of 6 percent.	21	2
201410	2187	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Other indicators, such as hiring plans and wages, are still relatively soft.	21	2
201410	2188	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Turning to inflation, as we’ve discussed over the past two days, TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation, shown in the middle-left panel, have moved lower.	21	2
201410	2189	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	As Lorie noted yesterday, models and market commentaries offer mixed views about the extent to which the decline in the forward measure of inflation compensation reflects lower longer-term inflation expectations as opposed to a reduction in inflation risk premiums or other risk premiums.	21	2
201410	2190	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	As she also noted, and as shown to the right, survey-based measures of expected longer-term inflation remained fairly stable as of mid-October.	21	2
201410	2191	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The bottom panel summarizes the approach to revising the forward guidance that emerged from your discussions during the intermeeting period.	21	2
201410	2192	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Reflecting the completion of the asset purchase program, the proposed new language focuses on the target range for the federal funds rate rather than on accommodation more broadly.	21	2
201410	2193	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	In alternative B, to avoid the tendency for qualitative guidance to roll forward over time, as well as the substantial market reaction that might be associated with changing such guidance, the statement would retain the reference to “considerable time” but start the clock at the end of the asset purchase program “this month”—an approach that could be retained in future statements by changing “this month” to “in October.”	21	2
201410	2194	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	In addition, to reflect participants’ desire to be clearer that policy decisions are contingent on the economic outlook, the statement would add language emphasizing the data dependence of the timing of the first rate increase.	21	2
201410	2195	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Regarding the updating of this forward guidance over time, the Committee could use paragraphs 1 and 2 of future statements to update its assessment of whether economic conditions were evolving as anticipated or were deviating significantly from its modal outlook.	21	2
201410	2196	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The forward-guidance memo distributed on October 3 proposed options for adjusting the reference to “considerable time” as the anticipated timing of liftoff approaches.	21	2
201410	2197	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Turning to the alternatives for this meeting, despite the recent volatility in financial markets and concerns about the downside risks to economic activity abroad, you may view the US economy as likely to stay more or less on the track you expected at the time of your past few meetings.	21	2
201410	2198	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	If so, you may see the language in alternative B, page 6, as appropriate.	21	2
201410	2199	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The first paragraph of alternative B indicates that the Committee continues to see economic activity “expanding at a moderate pace.”	21	2
201410	2200	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	It goes on to note that “labor market conditions have improved somewhat further,” citing both the lower unemployment rate and solid job gains reported during the intermeeting period.	21	2
201410	2201	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The reference to “significant underutilization” of labor resources is replaced by “underutilization of labor resources is gradually diminishing.”	21	2
201410	2202	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	That new language conveys the Committee’s judgment that the labor market is not yet fully healed while recognizing the progress that has occurred.	21	2
201410	2203	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Alternative B also recognizes the somewhat divergent signals on inflation expectations from market-based measures of inflation compensation and from survey-based measures, with the revised language treating the two observations in parallel.	21	2
201410	2204	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Paragraph 2 notes that the drop in energy prices, along with other factors, is likely to hold down inflation in the near term but reaffirms the Committee’s view that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent is somewhat lower than early this year.	21	2
201410	2205	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	With respect to balance sheet policy, alternative B announces the conclusion of asset purchases this month citing “a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market” since the program began.	21	2
201410	2206	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	It also incorporates the changes to the forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate that I discussed earlier.	21	2
201410	2207	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Market participants would not be greatly surprised by a statement like alternative B.	21	2
201410	2208	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The decisions to end asset purchases and to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate are widely anticipated.	21	2
201410	2209	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The forward guidance in alternative B is broadly in line with the expectation of respondents to the Desk’s survey.	21	2
201410	2210	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The new language regarding the dependence of the timing of liftoff on realized and expected progress toward the Committee’s objectives will no doubt garner attention, but because the language closely tracks earlier communications from the Chair and others, it probably will not be seen as signaling a shift in policy.	21	2
201410	2211	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	For the most part, the updates to paragraphs 1 and 2 seem in line with expectations, although market participants will note the removal of the reference to “significant” labor underutilization and the addition of a reference to lower longer-term inflation compensation.	21	2
201410	2212	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	All told, a decision like alternative B would likely have relatively minor effects on financial markets, although after last week’s volatility, that outcome is more than usually uncertain.	21	2
201410	2213	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Alternative C, page 8, may appeal to those of you who believe that a solid and durable expansion in economic activity is under way, and that any remaining labor market slack is likely to be absorbed fairly quickly.	21	2
201410	2214	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Accordingly, you may think it is appropriate not only to end asset purchases at this meeting but also to adjust the forward guidance to signal an earlier liftoff than financial markets currently expect.	21	2
201410	2215	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	In characterizing the incoming information and the outlook, alternative C states more positively that labor market conditions have improved, that underutilization of labor is diminishing, and that inflation expectations have remained stable.	21	2
201410	2216	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	It does not mention the transitory effects of energy and other factors on inflation.	21	2
201410	2217	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	In paragraph 4, “for a considerable time” is replaced by “for a time” in order to convey that liftoff is likely to occur sooner than the Committee anticipated in September.	21	2
201410	2218	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The final sentence of paragraph 5, which characterizes the Committee’s expectations for the path of the funds rate after liftoff, is rephrased to indicate that the period of below-normal policy rates may end somewhat ahead of the time that the Committee’s objectives are achieved.	21	2
201410	2219	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	A statement along the lines of alternative C would surprise investors, likely causing them to pull forward the expected timing of the first rate hike and to anticipate a steeper subsequent path of the funds rate.	21	2
201410	2220	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The market responses would likely include a rise in medium- and longer-term interest rates, a fall in inflation compensation, a decline in equity prices, and a further appreciation of the dollar.	21	2
201410	2221	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Finally, alternative A, on page 4, may appeal to policymakers who are concerned that inflation will remain significantly below 2 percent over the medium term and who see the information received since the September meeting as pointing to greater downside risks and to increased uncertainty about the economic outlook.	21	2
201410	2222	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Paragraph 1 paints a less sanguine picture of incoming data.	21	2
201410	2223	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	It retains the reference to “significant underutilization of labor resources,” indicates that “financial conditions have tightened,” and points to a decline in market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations without noting that survey-based measures have remained stable.	21	2
201410	2224	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The second paragraph indicates that developments in financial markets here and abroad have “increased the downside risks to the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation,” making the outlook “more uncertain.”	21	2
201410	2225	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	In response to these developments, alternative A would maintain asset purchases at their current pace and retain the earlier guidance governing the pace of purchases and the conditions for ending the program.	21	2
201410	2226	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Regarding the timing of the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate, alternative A would replace the current qualitative guidance with a 2 percent inflation floor.	21	2
201410	2227	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	An announcement along the lines of alternative A would come as a surprise to market participants, likely pushing further into the future the anticipated timing of liftoff and perhaps flattening the expected subsequent trajectory of the funds rate.	21	2
201410	2228	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Medium- and longer-term interest rates would likely fall, the dollar could depreciate, and equity prices and inflation compensation might rise.	21	2
201410	2229	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	However, depending on the size of the negative signal investors took from the statement about the economic outlook, equity prices might not rise as much, or could even fall, and inflation compensation might decline.	21	2
201410	2230	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Draft directives for these alternatives are presented on pages 11 through 13 of your handout.	21	2
201410	2231	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Thank you Madam Chair.	21	2
201410	2232	2014-10-29	meeting	ENGLISH	That completes my prepared remarks.	21	2
201410	2233	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	21	2
201410	2234	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any questions for Bill?	22	2
201410	2235	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	22	2
201410	2236	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	22	2
201410	2237	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, why don’t we begin our round, and I’ll call first on President Williams.	23	2
201410	2238	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2239	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I support alternative B as written.	23	2
201410	2240	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Recent developments do not alter my expectation of an ongoing moderate expansion, with inflation gradually returning to our 2 percent objective.	23	2
201410	2241	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Performance in the labor market has been impressive, with virtually every indicator signaling that the outlook has improved substantially since the start of our asset purchase program, and it’s fairly clear that the broader economy will make continued progress toward our maximum employment goal, implying that our asset purchase program has done its job and further purchases can be stopped.	23	2
201410	2242	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	There are cautionary flags.	23	2
201410	2243	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Perceived weakness in economic conditions overseas has contributed to recent volatility in stock markets and a rising dollar.	23	2
201410	2244	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	These unfavorable factors have to be balanced against lower oil prices, and overall they do not appear sufficient to significantly alter the path of recovery.	23	2
201410	2245	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, the inflation data and outlook do raise concerns.	23	2
201410	2246	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, the downdraft in the inflation data is likely to be transitory, as the effects from the decline in oil prices and the rise in the dollar fade.	23	2
201410	2247	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Alternative B provides a nice balance of recognizing recent developments while sending the signal that the medium-term outlook of progress toward our goals remains intact.	23	2
201410	2248	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I would also just mention in this context that with alternative B we still have an extremely accommodative policy stance.	23	2
201410	2249	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We have a $4½ trillion balance sheet.	23	2
201410	2250	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	According to the Board staff analysis, it has a significant effect on longer-term yields.	23	2
201410	2251	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We have negative short-term real rates.	23	2
201410	2252	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In thinking about going forward, we are still very accommodative to the economy.	23	2
201410	2253	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	More generally, the statement provides an excellent foundation for the required adjustment of monetary policy in the future.	23	2
201410	2254	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s important for the public to understand the data dependence of our decisions, and I do think that the language that is written in alt-B gives us that flexibility for people’s market expectations to change as economic conditions change, and the two added sentences at the end of the new paragraph 4 amplify this message.	23	2
201410	2255	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, in the past, I have been an advocate for shorter statements, not longer statements, and the extra two sentences do add a lot of words that describe opposite sides of the same coin.	23	2
201410	2256	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But given the importance of this message, I do think it’s okay this time to sacrifice word count and brevity in favor of directness and emphasis.	23	2
201410	2257	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	These sentences leave no doubt that the timing of liftoff and our policy, more generally, will be determined by economic conditions.	23	2
201410	2258	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, I think that’s a very important message to reiterate.	23	2
201410	2259	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23	2
201410	2260	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201410	2261	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	23	2
201410	2262	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	23	2
201410	2263	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2264	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	A couple of general comments before I go into my prepared remarks.	23	2
201410	2265	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Actually, I have a third comment, which is that I’m surprised President Williams didn’t downgrade his forecast in light of events last night.	23	2
201410	2266	2014-10-29	meeting		[Laughter]	23	2
201410	2267	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But a quick comment on inflation breakevens and compensation.	23	2
201410	2268	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You can think about dividing inflation breakevens and compensation, as President Williams pointed out yesterday, into three components—expected inflation, risk premiums, and liquidity premiums.	23	2
201410	2269	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it’s very important for us to strip out liquidity premiums as best we can.	23	2
201410	2270	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Those are due to market function issues that we do want to get rid of.	23	2
201410	2271	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s why I think it’s useful to supplement what is going on in the Treasury market with what’s happening in zero-coupon inflation swaps as a market-based measure of expected inflation.	23	2
201410	2272	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I want to reiterate a point I made yesterday, which is that I would counsel against stripping out risk premiums.	23	2
201410	2273	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Risk premiums are telling you about the co-movement of what is happening with inflation and what is happening with anticipated economic growth, and, basically, how scary things are going to be when inflation is low.	23	2
201410	2274	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	When we see the market-based measure of expected inflation go down, even though our statistical models are forecasting inflation remaining the same, that’s telling us that when growth is going to be low and times are going to be bad, inflation is more likely to be low.	23	2
201410	2275	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As Bill English pointed out yesterday, some of this is just due to people putting less weight on the outcome of high inflation with low economic growth in bad times.	23	2
201410	2276	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But that’s still telling us that low inflation is going to be viewed as more of a problem because it’s going to be taking place with low growth.	23	2
201410	2277	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If an event like low inflation is taking place with low growth, that’s what we should be putting more weight on.	23	2
201410	2278	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we want to be including risk premiums, not stripping them out.	23	2
201410	2279	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The other comment I will quickly make is that I was very struck by Governor Fischer’s comment on thinking about liftoff as but one component of interest rate policy.	23	2
201410	2280	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I agree with him.	23	2
201410	2281	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We need to be thinking through liftoff to the meetings beyond.	23	2
201410	2282	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The markets, and the public will want us to be thinking about this as a sequence of interest rate moves, but it’s important for us not to get into that.	23	2
201410	2283	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it’s very important for us to be thinking about this as a strategy of how we’re adjusting interest rates to the data, especially in terms of downside risks.	23	2
201410	2284	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Because we remain close to the zero lower bound, we’re going to have to be very sensitive to the timing of interest rate moves in response to downside shocks.	23	2
201410	2285	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	With that as prelude, Madam Chair, at this meeting I favor alternative A.	23	2
201410	2286	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	At the launch of the taper in December, the FOMC statement said that the Committee would be monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation moved back toward its objective over the medium term.	23	2
201410	2287	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I see no such evidence.	23	2
201410	2288	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I described in the earlier go-round, the medium- term outlook for inflation shows no signs of improvement since last December and is, indeed, arguably worse.	23	2
201410	2289	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The outlook has deteriorated especially markedly since July, and the staff now projects that inflation will not return to target until the next decade.	23	2
201410	2290	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Failing to act in response to this ongoing subdued inflation outlook creates a downside risk to the credibility of our inflation target.	23	2
201410	2291	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In my view, we see that downside risk reflected in the recent fall of market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations to unusually low levels by historical standards.	23	2
201410	2292	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Madam Chair, under your leadership and that of your predecessor, this Committee has made an explicit commitment to a 2 percent inflation target, but we cannot take the credibility of that commitment for granted.	23	2
201410	2293	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As we have seen in Europe, as we have seen in Japan, the credibility of central banks depends on their taking actions on an ongoing basis to ensure that inflation does indeed stay at 2 percent.	23	2
201410	2294	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In my view, the evolution of the data over the past few months means that we need to take such actions today.	23	2
201410	2295	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	To summarize, in light of the continued sluggishness in the inflation outlook and the recent slide in market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, I support alternative A.	23	2
201410	2296	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In particular, I believe that the Committee should commit to keeping the federal funds rate target range at its current level, at least until the one- to two-year-ahead inflation outlook has returned to 2 percent, and that the Committee should continue the asset purchase program at its current level.	23	2
201410	2297	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2298	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201410	2299	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	23	2
201410	2300	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2301	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B as written.	23	2
201410	2302	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The primary focus of the bond purchase program was to achieve substantial improvement in labor markets.	23	2
201410	2303	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	With the unemployment rate at 5.9 percent and the strong payroll employment growth over the past several quarters, labor markets are substantially improved relative to when we began the purchase program.	23	2
201410	2304	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, I think it is appropriate that we now end the purchase program.	23	2
201410	2305	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The addition of the two sentences at the end of paragraph 4 that highlight data dependence makes it easy for me to support alternative B.	23	2
201410	2306	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	While my own personal preference would be to expunge calendar-based language at this meeting, the current language is clear that liftoff will depend on incoming data.	23	2
201410	2307	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The low current inflation rate and the disinflationary pressures we are currently experiencing indicate we may not make much progress toward our inflation goal in the near term, which is certainly consistent with the Tealbook forecast.	23	2
201410	2308	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	With inflation expected to remain below our target for some time, we are provided an opportunity to probe how tight labor markets need to be for us to achieve our inflation target in a reasonable time period.	23	2
201410	2309	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would not be in favor of lifting off the zero lower bound until we are clearly making progress toward our 2 percent inflation target.	23	2
201410	2310	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	This could result in liftoff occurring later than I expected at the previous meeting, although, of course, I will make that assessment in a data-dependent manner.	23	2
201410	2311	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	23	2
201410	2312	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201410	2313	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	23	2
201410	2314	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Well, first, Madam Chair—RIP, QE3.	23	2
201410	2315	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I am thrilled that we are ending this program, as you know, and I hope it does rest in peace.	23	2
201410	2316	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Time will tell, depending on how we manage our exit over time.	23	2
201410	2317	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I pray that it will rest in peace permanently.	23	2
201410	2318	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	With regard to alternative B, first, I’m very pleased that in this draft we dropped what I consider to be risky references to financial conditions.	23	2
201410	2319	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I really believe that’s wise, particularly from the standpoint of avoiding the risk of developing the notion of what I call a “Yellen put.”	23	2
201410	2320	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	The Vice Chairman and Governor Fischer referred to that yesterday.	23	2
201410	2321	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I hope you’ll recall that Governor Stein and I long ago argued the need for volatility to resume, although obviously you don’t want to see extreme out-of-control volatility, or one-day volatility like we did.	23	2
201410	2322	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	But I think we don’t wish to look like nervous Nellies because we have seen some long-overdue volatility or because of a market correction, which I have, as you know, repeatedly warned as a distinct possibility.	23	2
201410	2323	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Although the statement, as written, is far from ideal from my personal perspective, it is, without a doubt, an improvement over September’s statement.	23	2
201410	2324	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	In particular, paragraph 1, as you point out, no longer talks of significant underutilization of labor resources, but instead acknowledges that the underutilization of labor resources is gradually diminishing.	23	2
201410	2325	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Paragraph 4 includes what I consider still to be the objectionable calendar guidance “considerable time” phrase that has been pointed out by Bill English and others.	23	2
201410	2326	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	It emphasizes more strongly than before that the timing of liftoff will depend on incoming data.	23	2
201410	2327	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	On these grounds, because I am on record as stating that it’s my policy to move on once I have registered an objection except when new grounds for objection arise, I will support option B at this meeting, unless the wording is changed during this meeting.	23	2
201410	2328	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	That said, my remaining concern is the very last sentence of the statement.	23	2
201410	2329	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I have used in speeches, and I think in this room, an analogy to duck hunting.	23	2
201410	2330	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	That is, you want to lead your mallard rather than aim right at it when you shoot.	23	2
201410	2331	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Otherwise, you’re not going to bag it.	23	2
201410	2332	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I worry that if we stick with the last sentence, as written, it could result in our overshooting, and then be followed by a tightening ex post that in every instance I know about historically has resulted in recession.	23	2
201410	2333	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	This is the conclusion of the Economic Letter that Evan Koenig—as the staff would say, exhibit 1, seated behind me—and I wrote recently.	23	2
201410	2334	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I think it’s also in keeping with the sentiment you expressed in your most recent speech in Jackson Hole.	23	2
201410	2335	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I would urge us to reexamine that last sentence at our next meeting.	23	2
201410	2336	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Let me add just one last comment.	23	2
201410	2337	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I am very skeptical about the Tealbook policy simulations.	23	2
201410	2338	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Built into the inflation forecast is the assumption that long-term expectations are anchored at 1¾ percent, which holds down the trajectory of inflation over the next couple of years by approximately ¼ percentage point.	23	2
201410	2339	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Also, the simulations don’t reflect or acknowledge the recessionary momentum that kicks in once the unemployment rate begins to rise.	23	2
201410	2340	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	One last comment.	23	2
201410	2341	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	In my opinion, the Tealbook, Book B, optimal policy simulations on page 8 show yet again why calendar-based forward guidance is a bad idea.	23	2
201410	2342	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	The optimal policy rate path today—which at least the copy I have in front of me is showing in that red line in the top left-hand box—is markedly different from the one calculated in September, because the optimal policy is very sensitive to changes in economic conditions.	23	2
201410	2343	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Given the sensitivity, I don’t want to be locked into a particular timing of liftoff or pace of subsequent rate increases.	23	2
201410	2344	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	You don’t want to give the impression that only a big change in the outlook will get you to change course, which is why I consider “considerable time” as having been, and continuing to be, a bad idea.	23	2
201410	2345	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I believe that we need to consider this in December.	23	2
201410	2346	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	If economic conditions improve between now and then, that will certainly condition my vote then.	23	2
201410	2347	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	But for now, Madam Chair, I support alternative B.	23	2
201410	2348	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	With regard to the concerns about inflation, I do note that the trimmed mean has been constant the past six months.	23	2
201410	2349	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	The trimmed mean is calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and is 1.65 percent.	23	2
201410	2350	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Thank you very much.	23	2
201410	2351	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201410	2352	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23	2
201410	2353	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2354	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Let me begin by discussing alternative A today.	23	2
201410	2355	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Alternative A contains language that would delay the end of tapering at this meeting.	23	2
201410	2356	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	This would mean maintaining a small amount of purchases into our next meeting.	23	2
201410	2357	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Because the amount of purchases is small, the direct macroeconomic effect would be minimal.	23	2
201410	2358	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	However, such a move would maintain some additional optionality for the Committee in the event that the Committee felt the current meeting is not an appropriate one to close a major program.	23	2
201410	2359	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	With QE1 and QE2, we closed programs based on calendar timetables, not macroeconomic conditions.	23	2
201410	2360	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	In both of those cases, the Committee was forced to reopen QE at a later date.	23	2
201410	2361	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	In retrospect, I consider both of those occasions as suboptimal policy decisions by the Committee.	23	2
201410	2362	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Are we making a similar mistake today?	23	2
201410	2363	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Certainly QE has been quite successful compared with the goals that the Committee set out in September 2012.	23	2
201410	2364	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	As I detailed at the previous meeting, forecasts of the Committee and the staff as of September 2012 have been largely accurate, except for unemployment, which has been a very large surprise.	23	2
201410	2365	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	The short version of this is the following:  The level of GDP today is about as expected in the September 2012 forecast.	23	2
201410	2366	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Inflation remains below target, as expected in the September 2012 forecast.	23	2
201410	2367	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	But unemployment, at 5.9 percent, is much lower than expected.	23	2
201410	2368	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	The staff forecast for the end of 2014, as of September 2012, was 7.6 percent, more than a point and a half above where we actually are.	23	2
201410	2369	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	The SEP had a somewhat lower unemployment forecast, but it was still much higher than what actually happened.	23	2
201410	2370	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	If you don’t want to look at unemployment and you want to look at more of the broader measures of labor market conditions, you could look at a labor market conditions index, but such indexes also show substantial improvement in labor markets.	23	2
201410	2371	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	We definitely saw substantial improvement in labor markets relative to expectations, and in this sense the program was quite successful.	23	2
201410	2372	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	I think that the open-ended nature of QE3 was very successful as well.	23	2
201410	2373	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	This feature enabled the Committee to continue with the program until goals could be achieved instead of maintaining an artificial calendar end date as with QE1 and QE2.	23	2
201410	2374	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	When the QE3 program was launched, many around the table probably expected it to end in the summer of 2013, a timetable that would have been similar to the one that we used for QE2.	23	2
201410	2375	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	However, Committee attempts to pull back on the program at that juncture proved premature, as the taper tantrum of the summer of 2013 pushed up longer-term rates by around 100 basis points globally.	23	2
201410	2376	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	The open-ended nature of the program allowed the Committee to recommit to QE at the September 2013 meeting.	23	2
201410	2377	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	It would have been much harder to end the program in June 2013 and then restart the program in the fall of 2013.	23	2
201410	2378	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Despite the taper tantrum, I think we avoided a lot of unnecessary volatility by having an open-ended program that could be adjusted.	23	2
201410	2379	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	The bottom line is that I think QE3 was a very successful open-ended QE program, and if we have to go to QE in the future, I would advocate that we again adopt the open-ended nature and set explicit goals for what we’re trying to achieve with the program.	23	2
201410	2380	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	For today, should we delay the end of tapering as outlined in alternative A?	23	2
201410	2381	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	During the intermeeting period, there was substantial market turmoil brought on by rising recession probabilities in Europe.	23	2
201410	2382	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	The effects on the United States are questionable, in my view, but at one point markets were signaling dire consequences for the United States as well.	23	2
201410	2383	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Financial markets have retreated from that view over the past 10 days to two weeks.	23	2
201410	2384	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Had we come into this meeting with markets still pricing in a major slowdown in US GDP growth and further downward movements in US inflation and inflation expectations, alternative A might have been a reasonable response.	23	2
201410	2385	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	It is, after all, a low-cost option.	23	2
201410	2386	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	You’ve got a low level of purchases that you’re maintaining for one more meeting.	23	2
201410	2387	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	It would buy time for the Committee to see how data evolve.	23	2
201410	2388	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee would retain the option of simply ending the program at the December meeting instead of at this meeting, provided that our forecast of the US economy is the correct one, as opposed to the market view.	23	2
201410	2389	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	And then if things did turn into a very dire situation, as markets were pricing in 10 days ago, we would have the option of ramping up QE again instead of starting a new program or being forced to consider the start of a new program.	23	2
201410	2390	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	However, because markets have retreated from their Europe-US contagion view and because the decline in market-based measures of inflation expectations has stabilized, albeit at an uncomfortably low level, I think we can go ahead with alternative B today and end the asset purchase program at this meeting.	23	2
201410	2391	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	As for the details on alternative B, I support all of its major elements.	23	2
201410	2392	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	The statement removes the word “significant” in the characterization of the underutilization of labor resources.	23	2
201410	2393	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	I definitely support that in paragraph 1.	23	2
201410	2394	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	The statement would include a mention of market-based inflation expectations in conjunction with survey-based inflation expectations.	23	2
201410	2395	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	I think this is also appropriate in paragraph 1.	23	2
201410	2396	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	In paragraph 2, there’s a remark about near-term inflation developments, which I think is appropriate because it does appear that inflation will, at least temporarily, be weaker in the months ahead.	23	2
201410	2397	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	We have a statement in paragraph 3 that there has been “substantial improvement” in labor markets as the reason for the ending of the QE3 program.	23	2
201410	2398	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	I think that’s appropriate.	23	2
201410	2399	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Finally, on “considerable time,”	23	2
201410	2400	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	I think we’ve done a lot of work on that and reached a reasonable consensus around the table to try to make that more state- contingent than it’s been up to now in paragraph 4.	23	2
201410	2401	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	I also think that that’s appropriate.	23	2
201410	2402	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	I can support alternative B for today, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2403	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201410	2404	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23	2
201410	2405	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2406	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I support the policy prescription laid out in alternative B.	23	2
201410	2407	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	While I see scope for further improvement in labor market conditions, I agree that the cumulative improvement in labor markets so far justifies concluding the asset purchase program at this meeting, and I think the draft statement is satisfactory as written.	23	2
201410	2408	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I view the “considerable time” formulation of the forward-guidance language as consistent with my current assessment that projection of a funds rate liftoff in the third quarter of 2015 is appropriate.	23	2
201410	2409	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Looking forward to the December statement, I anticipate wanting to keep the “considerable time” language.	23	2
201410	2410	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	However, I do not see the value of staying with the phrase “considerable time” following the end of the asset purchases in October as suggested in the staff memo.	23	2
201410	2411	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	The fixing of “considerable time” to a past date instead of the current meeting strikes me as problematic, given the intended emphasis on data dependence.	23	2
201410	2412	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I think we should lean against the interpretation that the reference to October is intended to signal a likely change in March or the second quarter.	23	2
201410	2413	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I think we have to drive home the point that “considerable” only means something in the context of the data and the outlook.	23	2
201410	2414	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I asked one of my colleagues to plot what we will know in data terms at each meeting next year.	23	2
201410	2415	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	In March, first-quarter tracking estimates will be firming up.	23	2
201410	2416	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We will have January data and some key February data.	23	2
201410	2417	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	At the June meeting, we’ll probably have several key May reports, some actually received during the meeting.	23	2
201410	2418	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	The second-quarter tracking estimates going into that meeting will have only April data in reality.	23	2
201410	2419	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	As I said in the economic go-round, recent developments suggest more downside risk.	23	2
201410	2420	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	If the Tealbook forecast is right or even half right, we’ll be facing an ambiguous situation through much of the first half.	23	2
201410	2421	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I don’t expect to be able to make a data-grounded judgment on the path of the economy with much confidence until the third quarter.	23	2
201410	2422	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I think we should, therefore, put in place a flexible approach.	23	2
201410	2423	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2424	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201410	2425	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23	2
201410	2426	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2427	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Regarding alternative B, I agree that our open- ended asset purchases have served their purpose and we can end them today.	23	2
201410	2428	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	With regard to the forward-guidance language, I’m fine with that as well.	23	2
201410	2429	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	But I am worried about the language in paragraph 2 regarding inflation, and I share the low-inflation concerns expressed by President Kocherlakota.	23	2
201410	2430	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	In September I talked about why I think the risks of tightening too quickly and too aggressively far exceed those of moving too late and too cautiously.	23	2
201410	2431	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	This robust control perspective still leads me to think that we should not be tightening rates for more than a considerable time.	23	2
201410	2432	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	If we stay accommodative but the economy turns out to have more strength than we think, inflation may rise somewhat above 2 percent, but we know how to fix that.	23	2
201410	2433	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	However, if we tighten early and the economy encounters further unexpected headwinds, we have much less room to maneuver.	23	2
201410	2434	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Our unconventional monetary policy tools are likely to be less effective after an unceremonious retreat back to the zero lower bound.	23	2
201410	2435	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	As a result, we could find ourselves in a very difficult spot.	23	2
201410	2436	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	The economy could be stuck in a bad state for a very long time, with attendant damage to its future productivity.	23	2
201410	2437	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	This perspective means we should be highly attentive to downside risks, which today, especially, seem to be to our price stability goal.	23	2
201410	2438	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	We’ve underrun our 2 percent inflation target ever since we announced it in January 2012, almost three years ago.	23	2
201410	2439	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	We continue to express optimism that we will fulfill our obligation, but the time by which we expect to do so keeps receding further and further into the future.	23	2
201410	2440	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Since the September meeting, we’ve encountered some further potential impediments to meeting our policy objectives.	23	2
201410	2441	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	I don’t want to claim that they are major game changers.	23	2
201410	2442	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	I haven’t changed my forecast very much.	23	2
201410	2443	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	The downside risks are stronger today.	23	2
201410	2444	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	I think we should avoid sounding complacent.	23	2
201410	2445	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	That means acknowledging that the risks of lower-for-longer inflation have ratcheted up a notch.	23	2
201410	2446	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	I also want to mention that our discussion of long-run inflation expectations has taken on perhaps greater prominence than I’m comfortable with.	23	2
201410	2447	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	I think it’s somewhat unsatisfactory that our inflation forecasting models rely so heavily on long-run inflation expectations.	23	2
201410	2448	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Our statistical models are crafted in terms of this more stable, long-run inflation expectation as far out as 10 years, but the economic theories that we tend to write down would place much more emphasis on short-term inflation expectations, things having to do with how marginal costs are expected to change over the future horizons and wage contracts and things like that.	23	2
201410	2449	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Yet there’s no good empirical traction that those models can gain for forecasting inflation.	23	2
201410	2450	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	That’s why we end up with the models that we have.	23	2
201410	2451	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	It’s a tough compromise, and I understand how we end up with long-run inflation expectations being there, but I think we should be uncomfortable with those models leaning so extensively on long-run expectations.	23	2
201410	2452	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Having been below our 2 percent objective for so long should make us even more uncomfortable as the horizon is extended.	23	2
201410	2453	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	As a policymaker, I’m just not as comforted by constant and unchanging survey measures of inflation expectations at the 10-year horizon.	23	2
201410	2454	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	I worry that alternative B as written is overly complacent in suggesting that inflation is heading back to our objective within an acceptable period of time.	23	2
201410	2455	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	It fails to mention additional risks of low inflation.	23	2
201410	2456	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Specifically, the last sentence in paragraph 2 worries me.	23	2
201410	2457	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Given developments in Europe, the rest of the world, and perhaps most importantly our own recent low inflation data, the compromise wording that the Committee adopted in September now seems problematic.	23	2
201410	2458	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	This language states “that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat since early this year.”	23	2
201410	2459	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	It said that in September.	23	2
201410	2460	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	While it’s still possible that this is true, it now seems dated and a bit out of touch.	23	2
201410	2461	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	I think it is highly likely that inflation will underrun our 2 percent objective for at least another three years.	23	2
201410	2462	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	The best anyone has at this point is an optimistic forecast and a belief in the magical pull of long-run inflation expectations.	23	2
201410	2463	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, with the markdown in the Tealbook, its inflation projection is still below 2 percent in 2019.	23	2
201410	2464	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	I think this sentence is really only viable if it says “well below 2 percent,” but that’s not helpful today.	23	2
201410	2465	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	The issue is, when do we think we will return to target?	23	2
201410	2466	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	I prefer the language that served us in our statements from December 2013 to June 2014:  “The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.”	23	2
201410	2467	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	This statement seems far more consistent with today’s heightened inflation risk, while the proposed alternative B sentence seems to have become overcome by events.	23	2
201410	2468	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	That’s my opinion.	23	2
201410	2469	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	I prefer changing that language.	23	2
201410	2470	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2471	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201410	2472	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23	2
201410	2473	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2474	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	I support the action in alternative B today.	23	2
201410	2475	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	The forecast for the economy is largely unchanged since the September meeting.	23	2
201410	2476	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	There has been substantial improvement in labor markets since the asset purchase program was announced in September 2012, so the conditions for ending the program have been met.	23	2
201410	2477	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	I can also support the language in alternative B today.	23	2
201410	2478	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Although some aspects of the statement still concern me, I welcome some of the changes in language.	23	2
201410	2479	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	In general, I believe the characterization of the economy in the statement should not be just a recitation of movements in the data since the previous meeting, but an indication of the Committee’s view of the implications of changes in the data for the economic outlook and progress toward our goals and, therefore, for policy.	23	2
201410	2480	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	I actually thought that the draft statement language circulated before the Tealbook, Book B, got us closer to this ideal.	23	2
201410	2481	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Nevertheless, the suggested change in the characterization of labor markets in paragraph 1 seems consistent with the improvement we’ve been seeing for some time and supports ending the purchase program.	23	2
201410	2482	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	In paragraph 2, I think it is appropriate to acknowledge that near-term inflation will be held down by the drop in energy prices, but that our consensus outlook of inflation rising gradually back to target remains intact.	23	2
201410	2483	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	In contrast to President Fisher, I would have preferred that we include some reference to financial market volatility in paragraph 1 along with our evaluation that overall financial market conditions remain highly supportive of economic growth.	23	2
201410	2484	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	The volatility has been front and center in the minds of the public, and I believe it would be appropriate for us to give our interpretation of what it means for the outlook.	23	2
201410	2485	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Moreover, although we have signaled an end to the purchases, I could imagine the end of the program will still be met with some volatility, as may occur as we approach liftoff.	23	2
201410	2486	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Giving the public some idea of how we interpreted the intermeeting volatility we have seen might help them assess our likely reaction to volatility of this type in the future.	23	2
201410	2487	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	In our forward guidance on the path of interest rates, the addition of the two new sentences provides some welcome emphasis that our policy is state contingent.	23	2
201410	2488	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	I personally would still prefer that we remove the reference to “considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program.”	23	2
201410	2489	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Leaving it in poses problems for our forward guidance at subsequent meetings, especially if the intention is to continue to use the end of the purchase program as the benchmark, even as that event recedes increasingly into the past.	23	2
201410	2490	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	This is one of the suggestions in the staff memo on forward guidance, but it would not be my preference.	23	2
201410	2491	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	On this issue, I agree with President Lockhart.	23	2
201410	2492	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	I don’t believe there is any economic rationale for tying liftoff to the end of the purchase program, and doing so seems to link the timing of liftoff to that particular event rather than to economic conditions.	23	2
201410	2493	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	In addition, continuing to use the end of the purchase program as our reference state would muddy our communications.	23	2
201410	2494	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	For example, suppose, for the sake of argument, liftoff is to occur next June, which we are going to characterize as a “considerable time from the end of the purchase program.”	23	2
201410	2495	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Such guidance would technically be correct next May, but this would be a month before liftoff, and I don’t think anyone would want to use that forward guidance in May.	23	2
201410	2496	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	It would be very misleading.	23	2
201410	2497	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	So we would need to change the benchmark at some point well before liftoff.	23	2
201410	2498	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	My hope is that in December we will find a way to omit the reference to the conclusion of the purchase program in our forward guidance, replace “considerable time” with a more generic “a time.”	23	2
201410	2499	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	And if there is concern that the public will misinterpret the change in guidance, we should include a sentence clarifying that the change in the Committee’s guidance doesn’t indicate a change in the Committee’s policy intentions.	23	2
201410	2500	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	If that is indeed the case, we should be able to point to the December SEP for confirmation of that.	23	2
201410	2501	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	There is precedent for this, as the Committee included such a sentence in March when it replaced the threshold forward guidance with the current formulation.	23	2
201410	2502	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2503	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201410	2504	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23	2
201410	2505	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2506	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I strongly support ending our asset purchase program at this meeting.	23	2
201410	2507	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	As for the statement, I think the modifications to the first paragraph are appropriate and useful, particularly the characterization of labor market conditions.	23	2
201410	2508	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I believe acknowledging the decline in inflation expectations is reasonable as well, and the statement nicely balances that concern by noting the stability of survey-based measures and maintaining the language in the second paragraph expressing the Committee’s judgment that “the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished.”	23	2
201410	2509	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I think that’s the right stance because, even though inflation expectations have fallen, they’re still within ranges we’ve seen over the past few years.	23	2
201410	2510	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	The market-based measures don’t seem to have broken out on the downside.	23	2
201410	2511	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	A key choice for this meeting, of course, concerns the forward guidance.	23	2
201410	2512	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	The strategy on the table is to retain “considerable time” but backdate it, as it were, to the end of the asset purchase program, although I guess we don’t have to make a call on that until December.	23	2
201410	2513	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	The sequence sketched out in the staff memo would be to maintain that formulation until a meeting or two just before liftoff, and that approach has the advantage of sparing us—mainly the staff, I suppose—the task of finding a lengthy sequence of adjectives to employ as we count down to liftoff.	23	2
201410	2514	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	But I do find compelling the arguments of Presidents Lockhart and Mester and see some advantages in considering in December the dropping of “considerable” and moving ahead on that basis.	23	2
201410	2515	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Either way, we’re still going to face the critical task of describing economic conditions as time goes by, and I think the way we’re going to approach forward guidance is by pulling away from these little mechanisms and using our description of the economy more.	23	2
201410	2516	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	There’s going to be more weight on the description of the economy.	23	2
201410	2517	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Overall, this statement strikes me as more positive in telling about the economy, and I think that’s a good thing.	23	2
201410	2518	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Part of the reason for the more positive cast is that, at the beginning of paragraph 3, we call out “a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.”	23	2
201410	2519	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Based on the data, we could have easily made that statement at earlier meetings if it weren’t for the fact that we tied our asset purchase program to a substantial improvement in labor market conditions and we hadn’t ended our asset purchase program yet.	23	2
201410	2520	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Ending the asset purchase program, in a sense, released us from that inhibition and let us upgrade the tone of the statement a bit, in a way we might not otherwise have done.	23	2
201410	2521	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	More broadly, my sense over the course of this recovery is that our statements have been a bit on the dour side and have tended to convey a sense of dissatisfaction with the recovery— sort of a “glass half-empty” tone.	23	2
201410	2522	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	And, assuming that the data come in as most of us are expecting and we head toward raising rates sometime next year, I think it’s going to be useful to set the table by gradually shifting to a more positive characterization of the economy—more of a “glass half-full” tone.	23	2
201410	2523	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	We don’t want to go so far as to strain our credibility, obviously, but I believe we have room to work with as we describe economic conditions.	23	2
201410	2524	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2525	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201410	2526	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23	2
201410	2527	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2528	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	I support alternative B.	23	2
201410	2529	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Ending the asset purchase program is a positive step as the Committee looks ahead to policy normalization, and I support the statement as written.	23	2
201410	2530	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	As the recent staff memo on the forward-guidance approach highlights, between now and the time of the first rate increase, we face some challenging communication to adjust our forward guidance.	23	2
201410	2531	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	The staff memo discussing the progression of guidance strikes me as a sensible and workable plan.	23	2
201410	2532	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	After liftoff, however, it seems to me that the special role for forward guidance at the zero lower bound argues for it to be retired and the communication returned to a focus on economic conditions, the forecast, and related risks.	23	2
201410	2533	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	In this regard, I found recent comments by the governor of the Bank of Canada instructive on forward guidance.	23	2
201410	2534	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Regarding the timing of liftoff, my preferred approach is to move in the second quarter of next year if the labor market continues to tighten and inflation makes progress in moving toward 2 percent.	23	2
201410	2535	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Many of the policy rules already point to a tighter stance of policy.	23	2
201410	2536	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	And, while an accommodative stance of policy was certainly appropriate—on account of the constraint posed by the zero lower bound, as we were coming out of the crisis—if we lift off in June, we will have been below prescriptions advocated by the standard policy rules for more than a year.	23	2
201410	2537	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	While I don’t see events necessarily running ahead of our policy now, I do see a risk that economic conditions may warrant a more aggressive action down the line than markets are currently expecting.	23	2
201410	2538	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	23	2
201410	2539	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201410	2540	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	23	2
201410	2541	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2542	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I support the ending of the asset purchase program at this meeting.	23	2
201410	2543	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	At the last meeting, I repeated my dissent over the forward-guidance language in alternative B.	23	2
201410	2544	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	That language is now improved.	23	2
201410	2545	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	The new wording in paragraph 1 is improved, as it accurately reflects the economic progress we’ve made and eliminates the “significant” from the description of the degree of underutilization.	23	2
201410	2546	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	While I still don’t see the need for or the desirability of clinging to this “considerable time” language, the additional language in paragraph 4 now stresses the data-dependent nature more forcefully, and I support that.	23	2
201410	2547	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I do prefer the language in paragraph 4 of alternative C somewhat.	23	2
201410	2548	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I would actually prefer the elimination of all references to time when we discuss our forward guidance.	23	2
201410	2549	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	It has not served us well.	23	2
201410	2550	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	It continues to create problems for us, and I think we need to strive to just eliminate it entirely.	23	2
201410	2551	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	However, I can support alternative B at this meeting as a transitional step, in my view, toward a better effort at articulating a reaction function that describes how we will respond if the data move.	23	2
201410	2552	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	My view remains that our statement needs a great deal of reworking, because its effectiveness as a communication device has been diminished over time as it has become ever more complex and ever more unclear.	23	2
201410	2553	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	For example, I think our next task is paragraph 5, which needs considerable revision.	23	2
201410	2554	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	It’s unclear in paragraph 5 if we’re referring to the pace at which we are returning to a normal funds rate, or to what we consider to be level of the normal funds rate, or both.	23	2
201410	2555	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	As was alluded to earlier today by President Kocherlakota and yesterday by Governor Fischer, we need to start thinking about our post-liftoff policy, how we approach that, and how we want to describe it as we go forward.	23	2
201410	2556	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I think we have a lot of work to do in that arena.	23	2
201410	2557	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I would actually prefer that we blow up the statement entirely and start all over again.	23	2
201410	2558	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	That’s going to be the only way we can purge ourselves of some of the legacy language that’s come to be a yoke around our necks at various times, and I would urge the subcommittee on communications to tackle this immediately.	23	2
201410	2559	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	[Laughter]	23	2
201410	2560	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	From a policy perspective, I believe we are very close to our goals, and we’re moving toward them at a steady, if perhaps unremarkable, pace.	23	2
201410	2561	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Monetary policy rules that I’ve used to benchmark my views on policy and those that are reported in the Tealbook do indicate a somewhat tighter stance of future policy than is implied by our current forward guidance in the statement, as President George just articulated.	23	2
201410	2562	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I remind people that such rules fully acknowledge that inflation is running below our target.	23	2
201410	2563	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	They take that into account, yet they still suggest that policy may be more accommodative than it needs to be.	23	2
201410	2564	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I remind everybody that, as President Williams said, even after we end the asset purchase program, we will still have a very accommodative policy by any standard.	23	2
201410	2565	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I become more nervous that, as these various policy rules suggest, we may be overly accommodative, and that we might find ourselves in the position later of having to raise rates rather aggressively in response to an improving economy.	23	2
201410	2566	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	That would prove somewhat at odds with the gradual adjustment that seems to be implied in paragraph 5.	23	2
201410	2567	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Historically, when the FOMC has gotten “behind the curve,” it’s led to monetary-policy-induced recessions on occasion.	23	2
201410	2568	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I remain somewhat concerned that our current anticipated policy rate path is steadily increasing the risk of just such an outcome.	23	2
201410	2569	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	We say that we’re data dependent and that we will react to better-than-expected outcomes, yet we have not shown much affinity for doing so in the past.	23	2
201410	2570	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Indeed, as I argued back in July and as the Chair reiterated just a little while ago, the economy has performed better than we’ve expected over the past year, the first quarter notwithstanding.	23	2
201410	2571	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	But we have yet to adjust policy in response to that improvement.	23	2
201410	2572	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Finally, today we’re taking a positive step in that direction, I hope.	23	2
201410	2573	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Given that the Committee has more forcefully stated that, as we go forward, we will be responsive to data in a symmetric manner, I will support alternative B at this meeting as a transitional step.	23	2
201410	2574	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	However, I look forward to seeing further improvements in December that remove all references to time in our forward guidance.	23	2
201410	2575	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I think this would usefully serve the Committee—both those who anticipate an earlier liftoff and those who anticipate that the data will drive us toward a later liftoff.	23	2
201410	2576	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	That can only be good for the Committee.	23	2
201410	2577	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2578	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201410	2579	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23	2
201410	2580	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2581	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I support alternative B as written but would like to make a few comments on issues related to the statement.	23	2
201410	2582	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I think we should all remember the cardinal rules of central banking.	23	2
201410	2583	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	One is, we’re supposed to look dour.	23	2
201410	2584	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	23	2
201410	2585	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	The second is—and it’s the most important rule I’ve found in my experience—never say “never.”	23	2
201410	2586	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	We may have to reintroduce QE.	23	2
201410	2587	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	We’d better think about that, and we’d better not make it the greatest defeat in the history of science if we are driven to that.	23	2
201410	2588	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I was moved to look around, hoping to see the jersey that President Williams brought yesterday and thinking about what we could raise to the ceiling in memory of QE.	23	2
201410	2589	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	But we really ought to think of it as a victory and something that we look at from time to time in case we ever need to use it again.	23	2
201410	2590	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I am concerned about low inflation.	23	2
201410	2591	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	But there are going to be policy decisions after liftoff, and I suspect that if inflation fails to react, we’ll be slower to move, with a longer gap between our decisions.	23	2
201410	2592	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I agree with President Mester about the draft text concerning what happens after this decision.	23	2
201410	2593	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t like that very much, either.	23	2
201410	2594	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I think of it as really being somewhat of an insult to the intelligence of people—that is, saying, “It’s going to be a long time after October, but we’re not telling you anymore.”	23	2
201410	2595	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	That’s what “considerable” means—it’s sometime after October.	23	2
201410	2596	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	And it will look very odd after we get there.	23	2
201410	2597	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	With regard to volatility, if we show that we’re not willing to react to bouts of volatility, which is what I believe we want to show, I think it’s 50-50 whether the best way to do it is to mention it and say we’re not changing anything on that account or to just ignore it and pretend that we didn’t notice it, which is probably not that good of an idea.	23	2
201410	2598	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	But I haven’t been able to persuade myself that one is better than the other, so I’m willing to go with what my colleagues want.	23	2
201410	2599	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	We are very tied up, as President Plosser said, with the language we’ve had to develop over the past X years.	23	2
201410	2600	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	And I thought that, when we came to the discussion afterward of the consensus statement, I could just say that the subcommittee is busy at the moment trying to recast the statement for future use.	23	2
201410	2601	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	But it would be useful to have something that starts off much simpler.	23	2
201410	2602	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	It won’t stay that way, but we might want to do it.	23	2
201410	2603	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	In any case, we’ve reached an important stage.	23	2
201410	2604	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	It’s important that we’re doing it more or less as we implied we would when we started the tapering.	23	2
201410	2605	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I think it’s also useful to take out the word “significant” at this stage, and, at some point, we’re going to have to take out “considerable.”	23	2
201410	2606	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I hope events justify that happening soon.	23	2
201410	2607	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2608	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201410	2609	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23	2
201410	2610	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2611	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I want to begin, actually, by referring to something President Plosser said a minute ago when he mentioned that the “considerable time” language had not served us well and that it created problems.	23	2
201410	2612	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I disagree with the first, but not the second, part of that statement.	23	2
201410	2613	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I think it actually has served and did serve an important purpose at the time it was adopted, but it has caused problems, and that’s in the nature of most policy decisions.	23	2
201410	2614	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	As I said yesterday, sometimes when I listen to the discussion around the table, I hear people almost saying that their preferred policy approach has only benefits and no costs, and that’s just not the way policy decisions are going to be made.	23	2
201410	2615	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	That is where we are, I think, on ending the tapering today.	23	2
201410	2616	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	It’s pretty clear that there’s been substantial improvement in the labor market over the period of time in which we’ve had it in place.	23	2
201410	2617	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Narayana makes a very potent point, which I don’t think was anticipated by those who wanted the language “in a context of price stability.”	23	2
201410	2618	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I believe the people who wanted “in a context of price stability” were thinking that maybe there would be too much inflation from QE and thus would want to adjust it.	23	2
201410	2619	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	But as Narayana points out and as we’ll have occasion to discuss a little later this morning, that gets us back to our concept of what the inflation language in the longer-run goals statement actually means.	23	2
201410	2620	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Having said that, though, I think President Lacker’s point about signaling is quite important here.	23	2
201410	2621	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	To not end the QE program at this juncture, given the path we’ve been on for some time and how much has relatively changed over the past six or seven weeks, would send a signal that doesn’t actually reflect where the Committee is.	23	2
201410	2622	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I think the Committee is at about the same place where we’ve been over the past few meetings, and to not end it now would send a more dire signal than people here, as a whole, probably believe.	23	2
201410	2623	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Some of the issues President Kocherlakota raises are very important, but they actually reflect difficulties or problems in our practice over the past six meetings rather than today.	23	2
201410	2624	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	The one thing, Madam Chair, that I miss in the statement and hope we could find a way to include is some reference to international developments.	23	2
201410	2625	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	As I listened yesterday, I think there’s a range of views on how much of a risk is posed by what’s going on in Europe, Japan, China, Asia excluding China, and elsewhere, but I didn’t hear any dissent from the proposition that whatever downside risks are out there, that’s high on the list.	23	2
201410	2626	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think there would be an appetite for, nor would it be appropriate to include anything as strong as, the language that we had back in 2012, when we said that “strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.”	23	2
201410	2627	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	My preference would be something in paragraph 2, such as “Developments in global markets may pose some downside risks to the economic outlook.”	23	2
201410	2628	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	But I’d be content with something in paragraph 1 that was pretty neutrally stated, such as “Uncertainty around global economic prospects has increased”—something that just indicates that there is a negative potential out there.	23	2
201410	2629	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	And we can avoid the use of who thinks it’s increased, how much we think it’s increased, or how high the risks can be—but just take note of that.	23	2
201410	2630	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Finally, with respect to the forward-guidance language, as I suggested at the beginning, there are disadvantages to the approach that’s being taken here, even though I was an advocate of it.	23	2
201410	2631	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	There’s no question about it.	23	2
201410	2632	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	There’s a certain clunkiness that comes with it, and that clunkiness will be felt, if not in December, then sometime early next year.	23	2
201410	2633	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	But I think the reason why those of us who supported it did so was not because we thought it was perfect, but because, first, we thought there were greater risks associated with, for example, removal of “considerable” today and the potential effect on markets that that would have had even if we had qualitative language in there.	23	2
201410	2634	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Second, at least from my point of view—as someone, I think, already referred to—the debate over the right adjective at each succeeding FOMC meeting seemed one that would elicit mostly frustration among a lot of people.	23	2
201410	2635	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	So, again, I don’t think it’s perfect.	23	2
201410	2636	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Nobody thinks it’s perfect.	23	2
201410	2637	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	It’s just a question of, is there a better alternative?	23	2
201410	2638	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	And I don’t think there is, even though it’s going to, in President Plosser’s language, create some problems for us over the next few meetings.	23	2
201410	2639	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2640	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201410	2641	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23	2
201410	2642	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2643	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I do support alternative B as written.	23	2
201410	2644	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I think it’s clear that there has been a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.	23	2
201410	2645	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	And I can say “in a context of price stability” with a straight face because, as I said yesterday, I do believe that, given our forecast for economic growth, we will see a return to 2 percent inflation in the medium term.	23	2
201410	2646	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I believe strongly that low inflation remains a risk, but it’s one to be addressed with our other tools.	23	2
201410	2647	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I would also say that financial conditions remain highly accommodative.	23	2
201410	2648	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Turning to the language, on “considerable time,” my hope is that the market will see starting the clock, as Bill English put it this morning, in October as a modest downgrade of the term, which would set us up for continued opportunistic downgrading.	23	2
201410	2649	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	It may well be that in December, depending on conditions and expectations, we can take it out of the statement completely, but I would hope that we would have downgraded it somewhat at this meeting— whereas if you were to say it again in December, it would say a whole new period is set.	23	2
201410	2650	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	So if we all want to get rid of “considerable time,” the hope is that this would be a start on that.	23	2
201410	2651	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	On what Governor Tarullo just raised, a reference to global economic conditions, I see that as a really close call, and it comes down to what goes in the statement versus what goes in the minutes.	23	2
201410	2652	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I can see that the second of the two alternatives that Dan mentioned, in paragraph 1, might work.	23	2
201410	2653	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	The benefit is, we don’t look clueless for 10 days until the minutes come out.	23	2
201410	2654	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	The risk is that we send a signal of concern about the global economy, and I think you have to weigh those two.	23	2
201410	2655	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	So that’s where I would be on that.	23	2
201410	2656	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2657	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201410	2658	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23	2
201410	2659	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201410	2660	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I think alternative B does a pretty good job of making clear that we see developments in the domestic economy proceeding much as we had anticipated while recognizing some risks.	23	2
201410	2661	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The progress on employment is appropriately acknowledged both in paragraph 1 and in paragraph 3.	23	2
201410	2662	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I do have some concerns about the movement in the market-based measures of inflation expectations, but it’s very early to take too much information from that.	23	2
201410	2663	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	There, too, I think it’s appropriately called out cautiously in paragraph 1, but I also want to convey that we will be carefully watching that.	23	2
201410	2664	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I see some downside risks, as I stated yesterday, of further strengthening of the dollar and weaker-than-expected growth of foreign demand, which is not currently noted.	23	2
201410	2665	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	And I recognize that putting something in there on downside risks may be too strong a signal.	23	2
201410	2666	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	But, given the uncertainty about global growth prospects, continued slack in the labor market, and the news on inflation, which is not good, I continue to favor holding our fire for a few more meetings before signaling we will initiate liftoff.	23	2
201410	2667	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Again, because we have very limited ability to respond to risks of greater-than-expected slack and disinflationary pressures when we’re at the zero lower bound, as compared with a much greater ability to tighten faster if inflation or the elimination of slack were to accelerate, I think our strategy of vigilant patience is very appropriate.	23	2
201410	2668	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The global environment of weak demand growth and disinflationary pressures only reinforces that asymmetry.	23	2
201410	2669	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Alternative B does an admirable job of clearly communicating that strategy of vigilant patience.	23	2
201410	2670	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I support it as written, although I would prefer some neutral reference in paragraph 1 to the increase in uncertainty surrounding global economic prospects, which I view as both factually accurate and relevant to our outlook.	23	2
201410	2671	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The alternative, which will be to say nothing and again have the minutes be the mechanism for communicating that, has some risks, as we saw last time around.	23	2
201410	2672	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I think the approach of anchoring “considerable time” to the end of purchases this month is the best option, while acknowledging that all options have some risks.	23	2
201410	2673	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	It corresponds to my current expectations, and I believe it holds the best prospect for providing a message of continuity and clarity to the markets and provides less risk of misinterpretation and having markets respond in ways that we don’t fully anticipate.	23	2
201410	2674	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	We will need to revisit this language if the pace of convergence to our inflation and employment goals changes materially, and that is very clearly stated in the two new sentences that amplify the data dependence of our stance.	23	2
201410	2675	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	23	2
201410	2676	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201410	2677	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23	2
201410	2678	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B as written.	23	2
201410	2679	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Ending the asset purchase program is appropriate because of what we’ve seen in terms of the substantial improvement in the labor market outlook.	23	2
201410	2680	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I certainly wouldn’t want to say “mission accomplished.”	23	2
201410	2681	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s a scary proposition.	23	2
201410	2682	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But regarding what the program was designed to do, I think we’ve been successful in that endeavor.	23	2
201410	2683	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	My views about the likely timing of monetary policy haven’t changed much.	23	2
201410	2684	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Slightly weaker growth and lower inflation would argue for more patience, which, to my mind, takes March off the table.	23	2
201410	2685	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But economic growth still seems likely to be strong enough to generate sufficient job gains to continue to tighten the labor market as we go through 2015.	23	2
201410	2686	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So I see June as remaining, still, the most likely date, with some risk that the date could slip later.	23	2
201410	2687	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	With that in mind, it strikes me that alternative B as written is just about right.	23	2
201410	2688	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, I think the markets will receive it as somewhat hawkish in three respects, and we should be clear about that as our going-in proposition.	23	2
201410	2689	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	First, the thing that will be received as hawkish is the removal of the “significant underutilization” language.	23	2
201410	2690	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the surveys were split on whether that would be removed or not, and so, obviously, if you do remove it, it’ll be a change that will be noted.	23	2
201410	2691	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s a change that didn’t have to be made at this meeting, because, obviously, “significant” has a vagueness to it, and we could have chosen to wait.	23	2
201410	2692	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The fact that we’re not waiting will be noted by the markets.	23	2
201410	2693	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The second aspect that I think will be noted is the fact that there’s nothing in paragraph 1 or 2 that references the financial market turmoil or the downside risks to economic growth abroad.	23	2
201410	2694	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s probably appropriate because what I was struck by yesterday in the go-round was that people’s views really hadn’t changed very much about the US outlook despite those two developments.	23	2
201410	2695	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But the fact that they’re not mentioned will be noted by markets.	23	2
201410	2696	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The third thing that I think is going to be noteworthy is that the new sentences at the end of paragraph 4 are essentially undercutting the commitment of the “considerable time” language.	23	2
201410	2697	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	They’re basically saying, “Yes, you anticipate it’s going to be a considerable time, but you’re really saying that the economic data matter.”	23	2
201410	2698	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That, again, will be read, I think, as a little bit hawkish.	23	2
201410	2699	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	This is all appropriate.	23	2
201410	2700	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not arguing with that.	23	2
201410	2701	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But the fact that market prices have moved pretty far away, I believe, from where the Committee is means that there could be a significant reaction in the fixed-income markets.	23	2
201410	2702	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Lastly, I want to talk briefly about the issue of what happens after liftoff, because I think Governor Fischer raised this yesterday.	23	2
201410	2703	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We really need to be careful about how we discuss what we’re going to do after liftoff, in terms of how fast we’re going to go, because it seems to me that it really depends on two things that are highly uncertain:  one, how the economy itself evolves; and, two, how financial conditions react to tightening.	23	2
201410	2704	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	As we tighten monetary policy, financial conditions are going to respond.	23	2
201410	2705	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If they respond very mildly, like what happened over the past year in response to the asset purchase taper, then we’re probably going to have to do more.	23	2
201410	2706	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If they respond really a large amount, like the taper tantrum, then we’re going to have to do less.	23	2
201410	2707	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we really don’t want to lock ourselves in with markets in terms of how fast we’re going to go once we actually lift off, because it depends on these two things.	23	2
201410	2708	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And I’m just totally uncertain about how these things are actually going to evolve.	23	2
201410	2709	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	23	2
201410	2710	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201410	2711	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	23	2
201410	2712	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought Vice Chairman Dudley’s comments about post- liftoff decisionmaking were really useful.	23	2
201410	2713	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	For my taste, I don’t think we should be committing to a pace of liftoff or the sequence of interest rate moves but rather trying to communicate, as you just did, the factors that will be entering into our decisions.	23	2
201410	2714	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought what you just said was very helpful.	23	2
201410	2715	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So that’s what I think we should be doing more of.	23	2
201410	2716	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks.	23	2
201410	2717	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks.	23	2
201410	2718	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Well, thanks for a very good set of comments on the policy issues before us.	23	2
201410	2719	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	In terms of the statement, there were several things.	23	2
201410	2720	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	First of all, I did hear a good deal of support for alternative B as written, but, nevertheless, there were a number of suggestions, so let me turn to those.	23	2
201410	2721	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	On inflation, President Evans suggested modifying the language in paragraph 2 to essentially suggest that the risk of inflation persistently running below 2 percent has not diminished or has arguably increased.	23	2
201410	2722	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I did not hear, as we went around, a great deal of support for that, although I did hear a great deal of concern expressed about the inflation outlook.	23	2
201410	2723	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I think a number of you share the concern that I have as well—that inflation may persistently run below our objective, and, if that turns out to be the case, we may need a policy response.	23	2
201410	2724	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	It could be deferring rate increases until later than we currently expect.	23	2
201410	2725	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	We may have to recognize that in the statement in the future.	23	2
201410	2726	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	The sense I have is, we’ve opened the door in the statement to telling markets we are concerned about that in two different places, particularly in paragraph 1, noting that market-based measures have gone down.	23	2
201410	2727	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	And, to me, not simply dismissing the fact that that’s a meaningless development will be interpreted as a sign.	23	2
201410	2728	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	So unless I hear a flurry of support to change the characterization of inflation in paragraph 2, as President Evans suggested, I would say, why don’t we consider that in the future and watch what happens with inflation developments but leave that as is?	23	2
201410	2729	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	On whether to mention financial volatility, President Mester suggested that maybe what we should do in paragraph 1 is to include it and then basically say, “Yes, but we’re not really paying attention to that, because financial conditions are still quite accommodative.”	23	2
201410	2730	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	As Governor Fischer noted, there are two ways to go on this, both essentially saying the same thing.	23	2
201410	2731	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	We could mention it and dismiss it or not mention it at all, and the proposal here is, don’t mention it.	23	2
201410	2732	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I think I heard several people supportive of taking the approach the statement does of not mentioning it, but, please, if there are others who would prefer to add a sentence in paragraph 1 of the type that we had and got rid of, speak now or forever hold your peace.	23	2
201410	2733	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, let’s turn to the question about the global outlook.	23	2
201410	2734	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Suggestions there came late in the round—from Governors Tarullo and Brainard—and most of you didn’t really have a chance to react to this.	23	2
201410	2735	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	So let me put on the table the suggestion that I think both of them endorsed.	23	2
201410	2736	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I think Governor Tarullo suggested some language in paragraph 1 that would say something like “Uncertainty around foreign economic prospects has increased.”	23	2
201410	2737	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Or we could just say something like “The foreign economic outlook has become somewhat more uncertain.”	23	2
201410	2738	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	It would be a way of acknowledging what many of you mentioned, but, again, I’d be interested in your reactions.	23	2
201410	2739	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	One thing I would think about is, if I were sitting in one of those foreign places, would I be pleased by having this in the statement or displeased?	23	2
201410	2740	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think I’d be slightly displeased, frankly.	23	2
201410	2741	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Well, you could always say it was in the other countries.	23	2
201410	2742	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	23	2
201410	2743	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m serious.	23	2
201410	2744	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we’d be pointing to other people’s problems and highlighting them, in a way.	23	2
201410	2745	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	But wait a second, Bill.	23	2
201410	2746	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	We did that for a year and a half.	23	2
201410	2747	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I know.	23	2
201410	2748	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But the question is whether what has happened has risen to a similar level of concern.	23	2
201410	2749	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Well, I think that’s a different question, though, than whether a foreign country is pleased with the fact that we say something.	23	2
201410	2750	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	No, no, no.	23	2
201410	2751	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If you look at the outlook for global economic growth, my understanding is that, basically, we were expecting a slight acceleration and now we’re expecting it to be flat.	23	2
201410	2752	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s really what’s changed since the September meeting—is that correct?	23	2
201410	2753	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Yes.	23	2
201410	2754	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Since the September meeting, we’ve marked down our forecast around ¼ percentage point in the second half of this year and a little bit less after that.	23	2
201410	2755	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	So it has not been a large markdown over the intermeeting period, but a somewhat larger markdown going back earlier in the year.	23	2
201410	2756	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	And, while the uncertainties about the outlook have not increased demonstrably over the past six weeks, if you looked at our position earlier in the year—before the euro economy slumped back, before the Japanese economy started running into its problems, and before property prices in China started to move down—I think you could make the argument, looking over a longer period than just the intermeeting period, that, yes, our uncertainties have increased somewhat.	23	2
201410	2757	2014-10-29	meeting	KAMIN	Then what we’ve observed is the markets, as they often do, catching up to that all at once.	23	2
201410	2758	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Comments?	23	2
201410	2759	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	23	2
201410	2760	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I guess my inclination is, these two are actually tied together, the financial-stability and international developments, because they’re both recent events.	23	2
201410	2761	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	They both were clearly discussed within the Committee, and I, frankly, am of the opinion that we ought to treat them the same way in the following sense.	23	2
201410	2762	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	If we’re going to leave them out, I think it’s certainly appropriate to talk about both of these conditions in the minutes—to convey that the Committee talked about them.	23	2
201410	2763	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Particularly on the financial-stability issues and volatility issues, as President Mester said, it was important that we talked about them.	23	2
201410	2764	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	We also can explain that we are not reacting to them.	23	2
201410	2765	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	It’s important to get both sides of that.	23	2
201410	2766	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	By the same token, while we changed the forecast ever so slightly because of the international events, I don’t think we’re reacting a lot to them.	23	2
201410	2767	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Perhaps from that perspective, making sure that both are discussed in the minutes and leaving the statement as it is might be a path forward.	23	2
201410	2768	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23	2
201410	2769	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	I was going to say that my preference would be to have it in the minutes.	23	2
201410	2770	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	But then in December, we’re going to have new SEPs, and I think everyone will be sitting around assessing how big a change they want to make to their own forecast because of the foreign economy.	23	2
201410	2771	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	So my preference would be not to put it in today but to leave it on the table as something to think about when we meet again in December.	23	2
201410	2772	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23	2
201410	2773	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I’m in the same place because I believe it hasn’t crossed the threshold of being a change of sufficient magnitude, and I’d suggest we think about how it evolves.	23	2
201410	2774	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	If this is elevated uncertainty, what’s it going to take for us to decide that we’re willing to drop it and indicate that uncertainty has gone down?	23	2
201410	2775	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	It’s likely to be there for quite a while.	23	2
201410	2776	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	And I’m afraid it’s going to be one of these statement carbuncles [laughter]—hard to scrape off.	23	2
201410	2777	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	23	2
201410	2778	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I agree with Governor Powell’s initial suggestion.	23	2
201410	2779	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	It’s a thoughtful idea.	23	2
201410	2780	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I think it should be in the minutes.	23	2
201410	2781	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	If we started to write out how we do it, we’d have to make an exception for Mexico and Canada—the NAFTA countries—because they aren’t experiencing the kind of turbulence that we’re seeing elsewhere.	23	2
201410	2782	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	It’s very Eurocentric or, perhaps, Asiacentric.	23	2
201410	2783	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	So it should be reflected in the minutes, but I don’t think it’s appropriate for this statement, and I would not support it.	23	2
201410	2784	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Does anybody else want to weigh in on this topic?	23	2
201410	2785	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	23	2
201410	2786	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201410	2787	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I guess, having listened to the set of comments, my proposal would be to leave alternative B as it stands.	23	2
201410	2788	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Obviously, there will be a discussion in the minutes about the concerns that everyone has expressed about Europe, in particular; China; and the global economic outlook.	23	2
201410	2789	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	When the minutes had such a discussion last time they certainly received a good deal of attention, and there was a market reaction to them.	23	2
201410	2790	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to propose that we just vote on alternative B as written, without changes.	23	2
201410	2791	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Matt, do you want to call the role?	23	2
201410	2792	2014-10-29	meeting	LUECKE	Yes.	23	2
201410	2793	2014-10-29	meeting	LUECKE	The vote will be on alternative B, as shown on pages 6 and 7 of Bill English’s handout and in the directive on page 12.	23	2
201410	2794	2014-10-29	meeting	LUECKE	Chair Yellen   Yes Vice Chairman Dudley  Yes Governor Brainard   Yes Governor Fischer   Yes President Fisher   Yes President Kocherlakota  No President Mester   Yes President Plosser   Yes Governor Powell   Yes Governor Tarullo   Yes .	23	2
201410	2795	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Great.	1	1
201410	2796	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Do we want to take a break?	1	1
201410	2797	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	1	1
201410	2798	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’ve done a good slog of work so far, and we have more to do, but let’s reward ourselves with a 15-minute break.	1	1
201410	2799	2014-10-29	meeting		[Meeting break]	1	1
201410	2800	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s shape up and get on with it.	1	1
201410	2801	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	1	1
201410	2802	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	1	1
201410	2803	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I would like to call on Governor Fischer to introduce our next topic, which is longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy.	92	9
201410	2804	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks very much, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	2805	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I’d like to begin by thanking the members of the communications subcommittee—Loretta Mester, Jay Powell, and John Williams—for their good work and collegiality in leading me through the graveyard of buried bodies and buried ideas, as I understand are there.	92	9
201410	2806	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	92	9
201410	2807	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I also want to thank the staff who supported our efforts:  Bob Tetlow, who you’ll hear in a while; Todd Clark from the FRB of Cleveland; and Stacey Tevlin.	92	9
201410	2808	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	And there was helpful participation from a changing cast of several people.	92	9
201410	2809	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I’m never quite sure on what basis people show up to meetings, but I was very glad to have them there.	92	9
201410	2810	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	At Ben’s last meeting, I think it must have been, he referred to the need to revise the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, so there seemed to be an extra need to get it done this year.	92	9
201410	2811	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	But it’s also been three years since the first consensus statement was issued.	92	9
201410	2812	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	It is a very important component of the transparency of Federal Reserve policy.	92	9
201410	2813	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I know that because I read it from a long distance, and it actually clarified enormously relative to my understanding of what the FOMC was doing before I saw this statement.	92	9
201410	2814	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I even managed to identify what “a balanced approach” means—or at least I thought I did—and I think it’s the interpretation we’re going to hear in a while.	92	9
201410	2815	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Now, Loretta sent me a note at the end of it saying that, in essence, we may not be able to change anything, but that that would just show how good a statement the original statement was.	92	9
201410	2816	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	There’s something to that—it is a very good statement.	92	9
201410	2817	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	And there are, no doubt, reasons for some formulations that are less than totally transparent on first reading.	92	9
201410	2818	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	You received a list of questions that we chose to take up in this first attempt to change, or at least to review, the original consensus statement, and we were guided by discussions with several of you—especially with the Chair, who had chaired this subcommittee previously—about the issues to take up.	92	9
201410	2819	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	The three, which Bob Tetlow will introduce in greater detail soon, were the symmetry of the 2 percent inflation goal, what the “balanced approach” characterization of policy strategy means, and the relationship between the objective of financial stability and the dual-mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment.	92	9
201410	2820	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	We do not have legislation that puts financial stability on an equal footing with the dual-mandate goals, but it’s being talked about more and more in many central banks, and we thought it was worth taking that up.	92	9
201410	2821	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	This is not a meeting to decide on the statement.	92	9
201410	2822	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	This is a meeting to decide on the work that we will do before January.	92	9
201410	2823	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	If there is sufficient support for at least looking at these views or others that people may suggest, we’ll take them up and come back with a formulation in January.	92	9
201410	2824	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	We have in mind an approach that is similar to the one that was used on the normalization principles.	92	9
201410	2825	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	If the discussion at this meeting indicates that there’s some common ground, the subcommittee will prepare and circulate a memo before the December meeting outlining some possible revisions to the consensus statement, with a request for feedback via the SDS comment system.	92	9
201410	2826	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Taking these comments into consideration, the subcommittee will then provide a draft revised consensus statement for consideration at the December meeting, and that’ll give us time for discussion of and comfort with any proposed changes before the scheduled renewal, which is at the January 2015 meeting.	92	9
201410	2827	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Any suggestions you might want to make for us to examine additional issues connected with the Federal Reserve’s communications and communications policy would be welcome, but we’d expect to begin to deal with them after the January FOMC meeting.	92	9
201410	2828	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	You have all received the staff background paper, and Bob Tetlow will now introduce the topic and the considerations relating to these three issues that we’ve begun to consider.	92	9
201410	2829	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Bob— thank you.	92	9
201410	2830	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	Thank you, Governor Fischer.	92	9
201410	2831	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	I’ll be referring to the handout titled “Material for Briefing on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (‘Consensus Statement’).”	92	9
201410	2832	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	My briefing will summarize the memo that Todd Clark, Stacey Tevlin, and I prepared under the auspices of the subcommittee on communications.	92	9
201410	2833	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	As you know, the subcommittee identified three topics for discussion at this meeting.	92	9
201410	2834	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	As shown at the top of the handout, these topics were the clarification of the symmetry of inflation preferences around the Committee’s 2 percent goal, the clarification of the “balanced approach” monetary policy strategy, and the clarification of the role of financial stability in achieving the dual mandate.	92	9
201410	2835	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	I will go through each of these topics in order and then close with a few words on why you might prefer to leave the statement as it is now.	92	9
201410	2836	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	The memo first explored the case for preferring symmetry—or asymmetry—of inflation around the Committee’s announced 2 percent longer-run goal and for communicating that preference to the public.	92	9
201410	2837	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	The memo argued that a symmetric target would provide a clear focal point for longer-term inflation expectations.	92	9
201410	2838	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	This is so in large part because a symmetric target would be more likely to deliver a record of inflation that aligns with the announced level of the target.	92	9
201410	2839	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	An asymmetric target—a “ceiling,” for example—would tend to render inflation that averages less than 2 percent, with the shortfall of inflation from 2 percent likely to be a function, in part, of the variances of the shocks that are affecting the economy.	92	9
201410	2840	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	In this way, a symmetric target facilitates clear communications by generating outcomes consistent with the stated goal of 2 percent inflation.	92	9
201410	2841	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	This, in turn, fosters transparency and public accountability.	92	9
201410	2842	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	It might be worth noting that the evidence from surveys and financial market expectations suggests that at least a portion of the public currently regards the Committee’s preferences as being symmetric.	92	9
201410	2843	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	This may be because some policymakers have said as much, including Chairman Bernanke in his April 2012 press conference.	92	9
201410	2844	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	We also identified reasons why participants might have asymmetric preferences for inflation around the 2 percent goal.	92	9
201410	2845	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	First, while participants may agree that 2 percent is the best single target for inflation, they might view the costs of the distortionary effects of inflation above 2 percent as higher than the costs of inflation below 2 percent.	92	9
201410	2846	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	Second, as the memo noted, the history of inflation in the United States during the 1970s and 1980s might lead policymakers to fear that long-term inflation expectations are more likely to become unanchored when inflation is above 2 percent than when it is below that level.	92	9
201410	2847	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	Of course, a case could also be made for the opposite—namely, that inflation is more likely to be costly when it is persistently below 2 percent than when it is above.	92	9
201410	2848	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	This might be so because, all else being equal, lower inflation increases the likelihood of the zero lower bound becoming a binding constraint.	92	9
201410	2849	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	The staff memo also reported on possible benefits of clarifying the meaning of the “balanced approach” monetary policy strategy.	92	9
201410	2850	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	On the one hand, “balanced approach” could be a statement about the Committee’s loss function, without specific reference to what that function implies for the conduct of monetary policy.	92	9
201410	2851	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	Alternatively, “balanced approach” could describe how the Committee might respond to deviations of variables from their target levels in a dynamic setting; that is, it could be seen as a statement about the reaction function.	92	9
201410	2852	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	Regarding the loss-function interpretation, “balanced approach” might mean that equal weights are applied to the inflation and employment arguments of the Committee’s loss function.	92	9
201410	2853	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	The memo noted that there is little in the research literature that provides reliable guidance on what the proper loss-function weights should be; results tend to be idiosyncratic to the model under consideration, although some recent research suggests that at least some popular, mainstream models are consistent with roughly equal weights on the two objectives.	92	9
201410	2854	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	Finally, a number of policymakers have at times alluded to “balanced approach” being consistent with, or equivalent to, the two legs of the dual mandate having equal footing as objectives in monetary policy.	92	9
201410	2855	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	Regarding the reaction-function interpretation, “balanced approach” might suggest that the time horizons over which the Committee would aim to return the two goal variables to target, conditional on “appropriate monetary policy,” would likely be similar.	92	9
201410	2856	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	Alternatively, the Committee could provide information about the conditions that would lead it to tolerate an overshooting or undershooting of one mandate variable relative to its longer-run goal in order to facilitate the more rapid convergence of the other mandate variable to its goal.	92	9
201410	2857	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	At a more modest level, a statement to the effect that tradeoffs between mandate variables always matter—so that the public understands that one variable is never subordinated to the other— might be helpful.	92	9
201410	2858	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	On financial stability, the memo discussed whether the consensus statement could address the possibility that monetary policy could respond to financial-stability concerns, as a way of promoting the Committee’s dual-mandate goals.	92	9
201410	2859	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	The memo took as given that macroprudential and supervisory tools would be operative and noted that these tools presumably would be the first line of defense against financial instability.	92	9
201410	2860	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	At the same time, we also argued that it would be imprudent to assume that these nonmonetary tools could be relied on to consistently achieve their goals.	92	9
201410	2861	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	The memo devoted some space to considering why financial instability might warrant special attention from monetary policy, in view of the fact that financial stability is not directly a part of the dual mandate.	92	9
201410	2862	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	Or, to put the same point in the form of a question, what makes financial instability different from other asymmetric risks?	92	9
201410	2863	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	We identified two main reasons.	92	9
201410	2864	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	First, monetary policy may be able to affect the probability of an episode of financial instability, its likely cost, or both.	92	9
201410	2865	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	And, second, an episode of financial instability can reduce the efficacy of monetary policy for offsetting the effects of that episode or the effects of other shocks.	92	9
201410	2866	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	Either of these reasons provides a prima facie case for using monetary policy to mitigate a buildup of financial market vulnerabilities.	92	9
201410	2867	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	We argued that this prima facie case is not one that is operational at all times.	92	9
201410	2868	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	Financial instability is an episodic phenomenon.	92	9
201410	2869	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	As such, emerging instability might induce policymakers to set aside temporarily their direct pursuit of maximum employment and price stability in order to temper the likelihood or severity of a possible episode of financial instability.	92	9
201410	2870	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	At the same time, however, it bears noting that identifying the appropriate monetary policy response to incipient instability might not be a straightforward exercise.	92	9
201410	2871	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	The staff memo closed by listing three reasons why participants might choose to retain the current consensus statement language—even if policymakers largely agree with the affirmative arguments outlined in the memo.	92	9
201410	2872	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	First, any change in policy communications runs the risk of being misinterpreted.	92	9
201410	2873	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	Second, to the extent that policymakers view changes in consensus statement language as likely to be costly to reverse, there is some value in retaining the option value of waiting until the appropriate change in language becomes clearer.	92	9
201410	2874	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	And, finally, the current language of the consensus statement is the product of compromise.	92	9
201410	2875	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	Participants may judge that the comity of the Committee is best served by not perturbing that compromise.	92	9
201410	2876	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	That concludes my prepared remarks.	92	9
201410	2877	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	I am, together with Todd and Stacey, happy to answer your questions.	92	9
201410	2878	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Bob?	92	9
201410	2879	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	92	9
201410	2880	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Bob, I thought you said that economic models come out with roughly equal weights, and my comments are different from that.	92	9
201410	2881	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	So I’m wondering what you meant by that statement.	92	9
201410	2882	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	There’s a reference in the full memo to a paper by Debortoli, Kim, Lindé, and Nunes.	92	9
201410	2883	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	They took the Smets-Wouters model and looked at what the optimal Ramsey policy was in there.	92	9
201410	2884	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	Then they said, what would the loss-function weight on the output gap be for the kind of loss functions that, for example, we use to carry out optimal control scenarios for the Committee?	92	9
201410	2885	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	It turns out that the coefficient in that case would be a coefficient of unity, which would actually be much higher in unemployment space.	92	9
201410	2886	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	This is one of these cases in which, once the model starts to get sufficiently complex, there are some more channels through which monetary policy works, and, more important, there are more shocks that break the “divine coincidence.”	92	9
201410	2887	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	Then you get the result in which a higher weight on resource utilization becomes appropriate.	92	9
201410	2888	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	92	9
201410	2889	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	So you would agree that, in the broader literature, it would be maybe more coincidental that you would come out with exactly equal weights, because these models have preferences and all kinds of assumptions in them, and then you have to figure out what the optimal weights are.	92	9
201410	2890	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	They might come out one way, or they might come out another way, but they wouldn’t come out exactly equal.	92	9
201410	2891	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Is that fair?	92	9
201410	2892	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	Yes, that’s certainly fair.	92	9
201410	2893	2014-10-29	meeting	TETLOW	And I think that’s what we said.	92	9
201410	2894	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Are there other questions?	92	9
201410	2895	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	92	9
201410	2896	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201410	2897	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Then let’s begin our go-round.	92	9
201410	2898	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo is first.	92	9
201410	2899	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	2900	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Let me apologize in advance for doing what I always say we shouldn’t do, which is to read statements.	92	9
201410	2901	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	But because I knew I was going first and I wanted to make sure I made the points I wanted to make, I did write this one out.	92	9
201410	2902	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	When we were debating the original version of this statement nearly three years ago, I suggested that its practical benefits would be limited.	92	9
201410	2903	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	And I think this has turned out to be the case.	92	9
201410	2904	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	The statement has received relatively little attention, in large part because the agreed-upon text did not reflect an actual consensus on the Committee and was necessarily drafted with significant ambiguities, as I believe are well explained in the staff memo.	92	9
201410	2905	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I suspect most people who read it already knew that a 2 percent target was in some way or another assumed by most, if not all, FOMC members.	92	9
201410	2906	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Sometimes, of course, agreed-upon wording turns out to have a life of its own, particularly when that wording is committed to later interpretation or implementation by actors other than those who originally agreed to it.	92	9
201410	2907	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	That’s why, for example, vague statutory language can, over time, acquire reasonably well-specified meanings.	92	9
201410	2908	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	But there are no such authoritative interpreters of the goals statement, with one quasi-exception that I’ll mention in a bit.	92	9
201410	2909	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	All members of the FOMC are able to stick to their own preferred interpretations, contradictory as they might be, and I think this is precisely what’s happened.	92	9
201410	2910	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	There is a case for changing the statement so that it will have some information content.	92	9
201410	2911	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Three years ago, I was largely focused on the meaning of “balanced approach” in paragraph 5.	92	9
201410	2912	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	This paragraph purported to address, albeit in a very general way, how the Committee would deal with situations in which circumstances create policy tension between the inflation and unemployment goals.	92	9
201410	2913	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I’ll return to this issue in a moment.	92	9
201410	2914	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	But the intervening period has revealed, at least to me, that there is not even consensus on the most basic goal articulated in the statement.	92	9
201410	2915	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	And, while there has always been disagreement on the unemployment goal, the differences in the past year or two have surprisingly centered on the inflation goal.	92	9
201410	2916	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Of course, the reason most emphasized by our former Chairman for adopting a statement was that it ratified in a formal way the Committee’s embrace of a flexible inflation target.	92	9
201410	2917	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I would have anticipated that disagreement would arise when some argued that temporary toleration of above-target inflation would lead to higher employment in the steady state, and others would have weighted more heavily the risks of nontransitory above-target inflation.	92	9
201410	2918	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	But, instead, over the past few years, we’ve had discussions in this Committee during which some participants have seemed to suggest that, because they find slack in labor markets to have diminished substantially, it is time to raise rates even though inflation has persisted below target for much of the period since adoption of the goals and strategy statement.	92	9
201410	2919	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Now, one’s first reaction to this circumstance might logically be to conclude that perhaps estimates of the natural rate are too high, given the absence of wage pressures or above-target inflation.	92	9
201410	2920	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	But let’s put that issue aside for a moment in order to note that those taking this position have essentially converted our two goals into a single goal.	92	9
201410	2921	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	But here’s the irony, at least to me:  Implicitly, that single goal is not the inflation target, which is usually the aim of those on the hawkish side of monetary policy who don’t like the dual mandate.	92	9
201410	2922	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Instead, the single goal appears to be, while maybe not maximum employment, enough employment.	92	9
201410	2923	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	How does this circle get squared for those taking this position?	92	9
201410	2924	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	It happens in one of two ways, I think, which are, in practical terms, consistent with one another.	92	9
201410	2925	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	One is to treat the 2 percent inflation number as a ceiling, not a target, with no policy response being called for unless inflation threatens to exceed the target.	92	9
201410	2926	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	The other is to stipulate, as a formal matter, that there is an inflation target but to assume that inflation will somehow and always, almost gravitationally, move upward in periods of even modest economic growth.	92	9
201410	2927	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	So, again, policy attention to measures to increase inflation is never needed.	92	9
201410	2928	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I disagree with both of these propositions, as I suspect many of you do.	92	9
201410	2929	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	There may be other reasons for the position taken, and I suspect I’d disagree with those as well.	92	9
201410	2930	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	But for present purposes, the issue is not who’s got the better policy position.	92	9
201410	2931	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	The issue is whether there is a shared commitment to an inflation target.	92	9
201410	2932	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Given current and, possibly, future conditions, it would be useful to clarify, if we could, that the controlling view on the Committee is that we do have a flexible inflation target, which contemplates policy action in at least some circumstances in order to raise inflation from a level that is persistently below 2 percent as well as to lower or stave off inflation that would rise above 2 percent on a nontransitory basis.	92	9
201410	2933	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	While I hope I am proven wrong, I suspect that not everybody would agree with such an articulation.	92	9
201410	2934	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Still, for a healthy majority of the Committee to adopt it would be to communicate some significant information to the public.	92	9
201410	2935	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	On the symmetrical issue raised in the staff memo, I think the fact that the Japanese experience of the past 20 years seems at present more threatening in parts of the world than the stagflation of the 1970s might actually argue for asymmetrically worrying more about inflation risks on the downside.	92	9
201410	2936	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	But that perspective is obviously time contingent.	92	9
201410	2937	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	An explicitly symmetrical position seems better suited for a statement of longer-run goals and strategy.	92	9
201410	2938	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	As to the “balanced approach” issue, the illustrations I suggested to elaborate the very general statement in paragraph 5—I suggested these three years ago—are perhaps of less immediate relevance today, though they may, again, be so in the future.	92	9
201410	2939	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	In any case, I would anticipate considerable difficulty in agreeing on such illustrations, even among those who could agree on much else in the statement.	92	9
201410	2940	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	So I’d be happy with a statement such as that crafted on the top of page 8 of the staff memo, indicating that the Committee is equally concerned about deviations from both mandates.	92	9
201410	2941	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to financial stability, I’ve done a good bit of thinking about the role of financial stability in monetary policy.	92	9
201410	2942	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	And, to be honest, I still don’t have a formulation that even I’m satisfied with.	92	9
201410	2943	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	So I’d anticipate that even a subset of us who more generally agree on broader monetary policy matters would have a lot of difficulty agreeing among ourselves, certainly in the next couple of months.	92	9
201410	2944	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	A threshold issue, of course, is that, unlike price stability and maximum employment, financial stability is not even an explicit statutory goal.	92	9
201410	2945	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Important as the issue is, I think it probably requires more discussion, analysis, and, perhaps, experience before we’d be ready to integrate financial-stability considerations in succinct form into the current or revised statement elaborating on the statutory mandate.	92	9
201410	2946	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	That’s the case for making a change.	92	9
201410	2947	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I actually think that the case for not making a change is somewhat stronger, and I’m going to turn briefly to that now before ending.	92	9
201410	2948	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	I do think that the views on goals and policies offered by our former Chairman and current Chair have been noted by market actors and commentators, and this is what I meant earlier by the one quasi-authoritative interpreter.	92	9
201410	2949	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	In that sense, the statement has provided some useful color in public understanding of the goals and strategy of a majority of the Committee.	92	9
201410	2950	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	We didn’t necessarily need the statement to accomplish that, but the statement has been a vehicle for Chairman Bernanke and then-Governor, now Chair, Yellen to articulate a shared general—if not, perhaps, unanimous—interpretation.	92	9
201410	2951	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Given the large and fractious nature of this Committee, making any noncosmetic changes would likely be a difficult process, and any changes coming out of that process might, as Bob was warning us, actually risk injecting confusion rather than more clarity into public understanding of FOMC proclivities.	92	9
201410	2952	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	So even though I have, in the past, advocated for changes in what is the current statement, I think there’s a good argument—and, as I say, in the end, I believe this is the better argument—for following Hippocratic principles and leaving it alone.	92	9
201410	2953	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	It’s not all that relevant, but, for that very reason, it’s not having a negative effect on public understanding of Fed policies.	92	9
201410	2954	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	And if this is the outcome in January, I’ll be content to abstain once again, rather than to dissent, again on the ground that the statement does not affirmatively advance the understanding of Fed policies.	92	9
201410	2955	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	2956	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201410	2957	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	92	9
201410	2958	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	2959	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	As someone who was deeply involved in trying to craft the earlier statement in the subcommittee on communications, I know, as does Chair Yellen, how difficult that was to get to where we ended up.	92	9
201410	2960	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I think that, for those reasons and some other reasons, I’d prefer that we not attempt changes at this time.	92	9
201410	2961	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m concerned that, in doing so, we might inadvertently signal a shift in policy.	92	9
201410	2962	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Should this occur, it would be particularly disruptive at this stage of the normalization process.	92	9
201410	2963	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m actually not opposed to considering changes, in principle, to the statement, but I think doing so at a time when policy is more nearly under normal circumstances would be a more fruitful way to proceed.	92	9
201410	2964	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m just concerned that attempts to change it could lead to an unraveling of the delicate consensus and the vagueness of what we’ve achieved.	92	9
201410	2965	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	That said, I do have some reactions to the memo, and I’ll try to share those a little bit.	92	9
201410	2966	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m not averse to specifying the symmetry of our objectives.	92	9
201410	2967	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I always thought that that symmetry was implicit in what we had said.	92	9
201410	2968	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	We could even go further by stating a target range that is symmetric around 2 percent.	92	9
201410	2969	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Again, I wouldn’t have any real, serious objections to that.	92	9
201410	2970	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	In fact, the subcommittee did consider such language at one point.	92	9
201410	2971	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I do have some trepidation as to what that might imply regarding how we might then go about discussing the symmetry of the employment mandate in a similar way, if we really wanted symmetry.	92	9
201410	2972	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	And what that might devolve into could be quite complicated and very confusing.	92	9
201410	2973	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	So I would approach that with a bit of caution.	92	9
201410	2974	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I also suggest we leave “balanced approach” as is.	92	9
201410	2975	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Trying to parse out or agree on a loss or objective function would be extremely difficult in a Committee this big.	92	9
201410	2976	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	The economic viewpoints on the Committee are very diverse at this point, and trying to get it to a common loss function or weights on the objective function could be quite difficult.	92	9
201410	2977	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	It would be like opening Pandora’s box.	92	9
201410	2978	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	In particular, trying to do so in such a short time frame would be very difficult.	92	9
201410	2979	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	To approach this, we would need many careful discussions and thoughtful alternatives and approaches, because if we did it on short notice, we would undoubtedly regret it at some point down the road.	92	9
201410	2980	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I do regard the diversity of views on this Committee as a strength.	92	9
201410	2981	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	And, while I understand and appreciate that “balanced approach” is a bit vague, it does indicate that the Committee weighs both nominal and real factors as an important part of its policy deliberations.	92	9
201410	2982	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	As Governor Tarullo just mentioned, both our former Chairman and our current Chair have articulated that message quite clearly.	92	9
201410	2983	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	So I think it does have some content.	92	9
201410	2984	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	All told, the language of the current document was carefully and painfully crafted.	92	9
201410	2985	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Upsetting that balance at a time when policy is in flux would not be a very wise approach.	92	9
201410	2986	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	With regard to financial stability, I oppose elevating financial conditions to the same level as our fundamental goals of maximum employment and stable prices.	92	9
201410	2987	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I think they should be used primarily as an indicator of economic conditions that we would respond to when activities in financial markets are worrisome and when monetary policy can perhaps have a direct effect on that behavior or perhaps is precipitating that behavior.	92	9
201410	2988	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	At a minimum, different financial developments will likely entail differential monetary responses of various kinds.	92	9
201410	2989	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Reacting to a bank panic might be one response, whereas reacting to a stock market crash or a currency crisis in some part of the world could be very different responses.	92	9
201410	2990	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	We have no systematic way of thinking about that.	92	9
201410	2991	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	How the Committee would act in such circumstances is best left to particular episodes and to the FOMC statement, which would presumably describe or explain why policy was being set, perhaps, in an unusually tight or unusually loose stance or maybe not reacting at all.	92	9
201410	2992	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Determining appropriate monetary policy in response to financial market conditions is a more complex undertaking, and I would rather that we not get engaged in that in our statement of longer-term strategies.	92	9
201410	2993	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Finally, I don’t think the material in the memo devoted to how the Committee would act in a precise way in some hypothetical examples really belongs in a statement of longer-run goals and objectives.	92	9
201410	2994	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Those tend to be tactics, and we should avoid those.	92	9
201410	2995	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Thus, at this juncture, I believe it would be wise to avoid upsetting the apple cart.	92	9
201410	2996	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	We should simply leave the statement as is for the time being.	92	9
201410	2997	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	2998	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201410	2999	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	92	9
201410	3000	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	3001	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Let me start with an endorsement of a characterization of the consensus statement as a delicately crafted compromise.	92	9
201410	3002	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	We each bring particular frameworks to bear on monetary policy questions we face, and then some of these frameworks conflict, as Governor Tarullo pointed out.	92	9
201410	3003	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I think the consensus statement we drafted did a masterful job of articulating as much as it could by way of areas of agreement while allowing each of us to read the statement as compatible with his or her own framework.	92	9
201410	3004	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	In a sense, it’s the smallest tent we could get all of us—or all but one of us—into.	92	9
201410	3005	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I don’t see this as a weakness.	92	9
201410	3006	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I see this as a strength.	92	9
201410	3007	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I see this as just a recognition of the reality of the scientific uncertainty about many of the questions that face us when we do monetary policy, about which reasonable people—reasonable, well-informed economists—can disagree.	92	9
201410	3008	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	And I think it strengthens policy that we have a framework that encompasses different views.	92	9
201410	3009	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	The fourth paragraph, the one about our maximum-employment mandate, is an illustrative case in point.	92	9
201410	3010	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	There are serious differences of opinion around the table about how to interpret the natural rate of unemployment, though we all agree that it makes sense to think of maximum employment in terms of some form of what you would call a natural rate.	92	9
201410	3011	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	There are different meanings of that term, though.	92	9
201410	3012	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Paragraph 4 is careful not to call the question.	92	9
201410	3013	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	It’s agnostic about whether maximum employment does or does not correspond to the “estimates of the longer-run normal rates of output growth and unemployment” that are published in the SEP.	92	9
201410	3014	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	The proponents of any of a variety of views about the behavior of the natural rate can thus read the consensus statement as not inconsistent with their views.	92	9
201410	3015	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I’m deeply skeptical about prospects for modifying the consensus statement in a coherent way.	92	9
201410	3016	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Let me first say that I think the consensus statement should be a relatively permanent document, conveying what we believe to be timeless principles.	92	9
201410	3017	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	It shouldn’t reflect commentary on current or passing issues in monetary policy.	92	9
201410	3018	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Accordingly, there’s a risk involved if we’re to make regular, substantive changes to the statement.	92	9
201410	3019	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Observers could come to doubt whether the Committee is going to stick to its precepts long into the future—that what’s in the statement represents precepts that will guide our behavior long into the future.	92	9
201410	3020	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	This risk would be particularly acute if we were seen as making opportunistic changes motivated by this year’s issues du jour.	92	9
201410	3021	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	The current shortfall of inflation strikes me as one such preoccupation.	92	9
201410	3022	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	It’s legitimate to debate what to do about it.	92	9
201410	3023	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	We’ve been doing that every meeting.	92	9
201410	3024	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	But if we choose this time to add some forceful language about the symmetry of our inflation preferences, I think it could look a bit contrived—it could look a bit oriented toward where inflation is now relative to 2 percent.	92	9
201410	3025	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I’m dubious about the notion of symmetry on more fundamental grounds as well.	92	9
201410	3026	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	In our standard theoretical models, there are a variety of costs and benefits.	92	9
201410	3027	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	They vary asymmetrically about the optimal inflation rate, and the symmetry that we see in a lot of reduced forms is an artifact of the linear-quadratic approximations, a popular analytical technique.	92	9
201410	3028	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	But it’s really a shortcut, and so it essentially imposes symmetry when there often is none in the fundamental underlying models.	92	9
201410	3029	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Beyond that, these frameworks reflect equilibrium, in which we have perfect credibility, and it’s quite plausible to think that, if our credibility erodes, we’d be quite likely to be different above 2 than below 2.	92	9
201410	3030	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	So I’d oppose attempting to articulate some sense of symmetry around our inflation goal.	92	9
201410	3031	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I haven’t advocated 2 percent inflation as a ceiling.	92	9
201410	3032	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I’m not quite sure I’ve heard that around here, and I’m not sure it isn’t something of a straw man.	92	9
201410	3033	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	But I could be wrong about that.	92	9
201410	3034	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I’m skeptical about going beyond the current “balanced approach” language.	92	9
201410	3035	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	One’s mind is instantly drawn to the notion of equal weight in a policymaker’s objective function.	92	9
201410	3036	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	However, as the staff memo points out, in the models we use—and there was an exchange between President Bullard and Mr Tetlow about this—for applied policy analysis, the policy objective function that maximizes household welfare generally places much larger weight on inflation, and we have just a couple of examples in which they’re roughly equal.	92	9
201410	3037	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	So it would take a very special coincidence of model parameters to deliver equal algebraic weights in a reduced-form policy objective function that policymakers thinking about household welfare can be thought of as acting as if they’re maximizing.	92	9
201410	3038	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Remember, this is a Committee that can’t agree on what constitutes maximum employment.	92	9
201410	3039	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	We’re talking about a weight on deviations from something, and we can’t agree on what the thing is that we’re taking deviations from.	92	9
201410	3040	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	So it’s hard to believe we’re going to agree on weights to place on deviations from maximum employment.	92	9
201410	3041	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	We should stick with “balanced approach”—it’s hard to imagine a smaller tent we can all fit in.	92	9
201410	3042	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Adding language to our consensus statement about financial stability strikes me as equally hopeless.	92	9
201410	3043	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Here the economics are even less developed and even more contentious.	92	9
201410	3044	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I don’t think we have a clear sense of how much financial stability or instability we want or is optimal.	92	9
201410	3045	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	So I don’t see us finding a consensus way of doing that.	92	9
201410	3046	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	I’m not unalterably opposed to amending the consensus statement, in principle.	92	9
201410	3047	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Maybe with the passage of time and the accumulation of greater insights, we will be able to collectively improve on it.	92	9
201410	3048	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	But for now, I think that it’s served us reasonably well and we should leave well enough alone.	92	9
201410	3049	2014-10-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	92	9
201410	3050	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	92	9
201410	3051	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	3052	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	First, let me also thank Todd Clark, from my staff in Cleveland, and Bob Tetlow and Stacey Tevlin, from the Board, for the useful background memo and helpful advice and counsel.	92	9
201410	3053	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	I’d also like to thank my fellow subcommittee members.	92	9
201410	3054	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	In my own view, the consensus statement has served the Committee well, and I commend the earlier communications subcommittee on their careful crafting of the statement.	92	9
201410	3055	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	January marked the third year in which a statement was issued, and, as indicated in the January meeting, the Committee decided that this year would be an appropriate time to consider whether the statement could be enhanced in any way.	92	9
201410	3056	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	So I view the discussion today as following through on that decision.	92	9
201410	3057	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	However, I want to reiterate that a decision to make no changes to the statement should not be viewed as a failure to complete that mission.	92	9
201410	3058	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	We should be open to considering changes, but I think we should set a high bar for making changes to the statement.	92	9
201410	3059	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	For one thing, the consensus around the current statement is valuable and worth preserving.	92	9
201410	3060	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	I agree with President Lacker’s view that the statement is meant as a set of principles, and I think it means it should be fairly static.	92	9
201410	3061	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	If it’s changed too often, it could lose its effect.	92	9
201410	3062	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Finally, as President Plosser pointed out, depending on the nature of the changes, it might be better to delay any changes to a time when we are closer to our goals and normalization is well under way, lest we be accused of changing the rules of the game midstream and confusing matters rather than clarifying them.	92	9
201410	3063	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	So I personally don’t see a compelling reason to change the language of the consensus statement, but I do see value in having the discussion on longer-run goals and strategy.	92	9
201410	3064	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Regarding the inflation goal, I believe the public perceives our inflation goal as a symmetric target.	92	9
201410	3065	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	A number of Committee participants have said in speeches that persistent inflation above our goal and persistent inflation below our goal are both undesirable.	92	9
201410	3066	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	But I want to note that a shared view on the symmetry of the 2 percent inflation target does not necessarily mean that there’s agreement on the policy to achieve it.	92	9
201410	3067	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	I don’t think there’s that much to be gained by changing the language on this.	92	9
201410	3068	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	But should there be a consensus to do so, I would not object to an appropriate revision acknowledging symmetry and clarifying that inflation can be expected to vary in the short to medium run, but that, over the longer run, we aim for 2 percent inflation.	92	9
201410	3069	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Regarding financial stability, before making changes to the consensus statement, I would prefer the Committee to have a fuller discussion of its approach to financial stability, the tools that it will use and their efficacy in addressing financial-stability issues as they arise, and the nexus between monetary policy and financial stability.	92	9
201410	3070	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	I think we’d benefit from further work on these issues by Governor Fischer’s Committee on Financial Stability and others at the Board and in the System.	92	9
201410	3071	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	The FOMC might then discuss its preferred approach and, in light of that discussion, consider potential revisions to the consensus statement later next year or further in the future.	92	9
201410	3072	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	I am perhaps most trepidatious about making changes to the “balanced approach” language.	92	9
201410	3073	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	I admit that it is ambiguous, and, in the abstract, it perhaps would be desirable to clear up some of that ambiguity.	92	9
201410	3074	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	On the other hand, it is not clear to me that the language could be clarified in a satisfactory way to encompass the nuances of various interpretations, economic models, and approaches to monetary policy around the table.	92	9
201410	3075	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	So before making such a change, we might do well to have a fuller discussion of loss functions.	92	9
201410	3076	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Before we can even ask about the weights in the loss function, we need to first agree on the form of the loss function and its components.	92	9
201410	3077	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Do we agree that the loss function is quadratic?	92	9
201410	3078	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	How do we think about the treatment of financial stability in the loss function?	92	9
201410	3079	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Unless we have such a discussion, it would be premature to change the “balanced approach” language, which, in the end, seems to have done a very good job of balancing many considerations.	92	9
201410	3080	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	The last question on the agenda was about the SEPs.	92	9
201410	3081	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	I do think the SEPs are valuable.	92	9
201410	3082	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	I could see that they could be improved with further enhancements.	92	9
201410	3083	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	And perhaps we should think about a consensus forecast again.	92	9
201410	3084	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	We took this up in 2012.	92	9
201410	3085	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	We were not successful.	92	9
201410	3086	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	As we approach normalization, we have fewer tools on the table.	92	9
201410	3087	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Now that policy is getting to a more normal footing, maybe we can take this up again.	92	9
201410	3088	2014-10-29	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	3089	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201410	3090	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	92	9
201410	3091	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	3092	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The longer-run policy statement is a consensus document that is intended to capture broad agreement by the Committee.	92	9
201410	3093	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because it’s a longer-run statement, I would have a high threshold for making any changes to the statement.	92	9
201410	3094	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I agree that more precise language is possible that makes even clearer that our inflation target is symmetric and not a ceiling, I think the previous Chairman made that quite clear in his press conference.	92	9
201410	3095	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Similarly, his press conference made clear that there was a balanced approach to the dual mandate, a position I strongly endorse.	92	9
201410	3096	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Given the broad acceptance of the previous Chairman’s comments in the markets, I see little advantage in relitigating these issues.	92	9
201410	3097	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The risk is that, rather than simply clarifying what I see as critical elements of the framework—symmetric attention to inflation deviations and balanced responses to both pillars of the dual mandate—we could raise a question in the markets as to whether we are now or continuously reconsidering one or both of these elements.	92	9
201410	3098	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In my view, any uncertainty about symmetry and balance would be counterproductive.	92	9
201410	3099	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In terms of financial stability, I think this is a good area in which to seek a broader consensus on how we define financial stability, as well as the appropriate responses of the central bank to incipient or full-blown instability.	92	9
201410	3100	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I am not optimistic that a consensus can be reached by January.	92	9
201410	3101	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, I do think it would be productive to have a special session in which we can have a structured discussion on the role that financial stability should play in our monetary policy deliberations.	92	9
201410	3102	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I also believe that it might be useful to consider whether there is a consensus that there are times when we would make monetary policy to address financial-stability concerns even though it might move us away from our inflation and employment targets.	92	9
201410	3103	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Once we have a clearer, common understanding of what financial stability means and when it would affect monetary policy decisions, we could then discuss how it might be incorporated into the longer- run policy statement.	92	9
201410	3104	2014-10-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Also, there might be some advantage to thinking about a consensus forecast over time as well.	92	9
201410	3105	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201410	3106	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	92	9
201410	3107	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	3108	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	My comments are going to strongly echo what’s already been said here, so I’ll be brief.	92	9
201410	3109	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	The consensus statement established an inflation target for the United States.	92	9
201410	3110	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Therefore, it’s quite an important document for this Committee.	92	9
201410	3111	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Previous to that, the FOMC did not have an official inflation target.	92	9
201410	3112	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	I think that establishing an inflation target has been quite valuable to the Committee during this era of very low inflation.	92	9
201410	3113	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	It could have gone very differently if there had been some doubt that maybe a large fraction of the Committee thought 1 percent inflation or 0 percent inflation was okay.	92	9
201410	3114	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	That could have led to very different dynamics for the US economy.	92	9
201410	3115	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	So it’s actually been quite helpful to adopt the inflation target, as former Chairman Bernanke predicted at the time.	92	9
201410	3116	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	My general feeling, echoing many of the previous comments, is that the statement does not require modification.	92	9
201410	3117	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	The statement is written in a way to garner widespread consensus around the table—I would not want to disturb that consensus.	92	9
201410	3118	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	I think that trying to change the consensus statement before we return to a more normalized policy environment—that is, this coming January—carries substantial risk of muddling our near-term policy intentions in the minds of financial market participants and the general public.	92	9
201410	3119	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	So I recommend no change.	92	9
201410	3120	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	I have a few comments on specific issues that also echo the previous comments.	92	9
201410	3121	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	I regard the inflation target as symmetric, and I’ve said so publicly on many occasions.	92	9
201410	3122	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Hitting the inflation target, on average, is closer to price-level targeting.	92	9
201410	3123	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	In this sense, it’s closer to optimal policy in many leading theories.	92	9
201410	3124	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	I think the “balanced approach” language is brilliant and should not be altered.	92	9
201410	3125	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	It may seem fair to say that the weights on inflation and unemployment are equal or should be equal, but research on the topic suggests otherwise.	92	9
201410	3126	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	If you read the literature, the actual weights on the two objectives are going to depend on details of modeling assumptions, preferences, technology, and frictions that are in the model.	92	9
201410	3127	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Those parameters are all going to come together in a way to determine what the right weights are on the two objectives from the point of view of household utility, as President Lacker was saying.	92	9
201410	3128	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	So it’s just not clear that it always comes out to be exactly equal.	92	9
201410	3129	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	That is something that seems as though it would be the right thing, but it’s not.	92	9
201410	3130	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	As an example, I’ll point out a favorite paper I like to quote to all of you here—Ravenna and Walsh.	92	9
201410	3131	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	That’s a New Keynesian model with explicit search-theoretic unemployment in it.	92	9
201410	3132	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	You have the unemployment friction in there.	92	9
201410	3133	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	You have the sticky price friction in there.	92	9
201410	3134	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	You might have thought you were going to get roughly equal weights to balance the two frictions.	92	9
201410	3135	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	That isn’t what they got.	92	9
201410	3136	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	They got pretty heavy optimal weight on inflation.	92	9
201410	3137	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	That’s just the outcome of one piece of research, but I think the nature of research shows you that it’s not going to come out to be equal and it could go the other way.	92	9
201410	3138	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	It could be that other types of models with other types of assumptions would put heavy weight on the unemployment side and less weight on the price-stability side.	92	9
201410	3139	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	So it’s just not something that naturally falls out of models, at least in my experience.	92	9
201410	3140	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Another example, one from the older research literature, is Rotemberg and Woodford, who calculated optimal weights in their model that certainly were not equal.	92	9
201410	3141	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	On financial stability, I agree with the previous comments that this would be very difficult.	92	9
201410	3142	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Anything beyond what’s in the existing consensus statement would be very difficult.	92	9
201410	3143	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	There’s a clear lack of consensus on models or even approach on this issue around the table.	92	9
201410	3144	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	It’s an issue of our time.	92	9
201410	3145	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	It’s a macroeconomic issue of first-order importance.	92	9
201410	3146	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	But I don’t think we have anything like the right approach or language to be able to put it into a statement of this kind.	92	9
201410	3147	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	How the Committee should react to asset price bubbles remains a vexing issue, as it has been for this Committee since the 1990s, and I don’t believe we’re likely to resolve it anytime soon.	92	9
201410	3148	2014-10-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	3149	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201410	3150	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	92	9
201410	3151	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	3152	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I tend to agree with those who’ve already argued to leave the statement unchanged at this juncture.	92	9
201410	3153	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I think the benefit versus the cost of changing the statement at this time doesn’t add up for me.	92	9
201410	3154	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	But should the Committee—and it doesn’t appear to be the trend—decide to consider adjustments, here are my views.	92	9
201410	3155	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Our preferences should be symmetric around the 2 percent inflation objective.	92	9
201410	3156	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I’d object to any change that suggests an asymmetric preference.	92	9
201410	3157	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I think there is some risk in fiddling with the language that is already interpreted in a way consistent with the Committee’s intentions.	92	9
201410	3158	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m satisfied with the current “balanced approach” language.	92	9
201410	3159	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	It adequately captures the general principle that the Committee gives due consideration to both elements of the dual mandate.	92	9
201410	3160	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I don’t think more explicit language is likely to do justice to the diversity of views about how that principle would be applied tactically by various members of the Committee across a wide range of circumstances.	92	9
201410	3161	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	In my view, tactical flexibility—in which more emphasis is put on one element or the other, depending on circumstances—should be preserved.	92	9
201410	3162	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I don’t think risk-management nuances, for instance, are easily captured by a more narrowly constructed explanation of “balanced approach.”	92	9
201410	3163	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Also, in reaction to a deviation of inflation from our objective, my emphasis on the inflation side would depend on my reading of how solidly inflation expectations are anchored.	92	9
201410	3164	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	As regards further clarification of how financial-stability considerations relate to the dual-mandate goals, I am comfortable with the current language.	92	9
201410	3165	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	In my view, financial-stability concerns should be given consideration in monetary policy, as opposed to macroprudential policy, to the extent that there’s a threat to the attainment of our price-stability and employment objectives.	92	9
201410	3166	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I think the current language is flexible enough to accommodate incorporating financial-stability considerations into policy decisions if, in the Committee’s judgment, the threat to our statutory objectives is sufficient and we believe monetary policy tools can be effective.	92	9
201410	3167	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding SEPs, I’ve already said in earlier meetings that I favor a review of this element of our communication tool set.	92	9
201410	3168	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I’d like to see another try at a consensus forecast.	92	9
201410	3169	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	In a conversation with President Rosengren—and correct me if I misinterpret what you said—he noted that the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee actually votes on whether the forecast is the consensus, as opposed to agreement with the forecast.	92	9
201410	3170	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	That’s a distinction that struck me as providing some potential for us to take another look at this and possibly succeed.	92	9
201410	3171	2014-10-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	3172	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201410	3173	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	92	9
201410	3174	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	3175	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I think Governor Tarullo summarized this adequately and appropriately.	92	9
201410	3176	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	The better argument is the Hippocratic argument, which is to do no harm in the end.	92	9
201410	3177	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	And I would suggest that we worked very hard, as was mentioned earlier, to achieve a very delicate balance here.	92	9
201410	3178	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I’m worried that if we open this up, centrifugal force might just tear it apart at a very delicate time as we approach liftoff.	92	9
201410	3179	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Having said that, I want to make a couple of comments very quickly.	92	9
201410	3180	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	With regard to the first question and the 2 percent longer-run objective, just to clarify in my antepenultimate meeting, I have no problem with a strategy that has policy respond symmetrically to above-target or below-target inflation, as long as inflation is appropriately measured.	92	9
201410	3181	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I think we want to be very careful not to give the impression, though, that deviations of inflation from target are always undesirable.	92	9
201410	3182	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Supply-driven inflation deviations can actually improve resource allocation and the distribution of risk in the economy.	92	9
201410	3183	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Accordingly, I don’t think we should deduct price- stability penalty points from the grade we assign policy just because realized inflation is off target over a period.	92	9
201410	3184	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	To me, genuine signs of poor policy are significant fluctuations in medium- term average inflation that are not linked to real activity and any indication that, as President Lockhart just said, expected average inflation at medium-term horizons and even longer is not firmly anchored.	92	9
201410	3185	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	That’s what I worry about.	92	9
201410	3186	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	But I have no problem with having a symmetrical approach to inflation.	92	9
201410	3187	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	With regard to the case for changing the use of “balanced approach,” the memo—I thank you and the subcommittee for putting it together—appropriately says that the primary reason the Committee might determine that it would like to change the “balanced approach” sentence is that it is vague.	92	9
201410	3188	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	However, I view specificity as also having a downside.	92	9
201410	3189	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	It can take us to a stated plan of action, and, if we deviate from said stated plan, it could undermine our credibility.	92	9
201410	3190	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I’ve argued many times at this table, as any businessperson would, that certainty clearly helps decisionmaking, uncertainty undermines decisionmaking, and false certainty is a destructive force.	92	9
201410	3191	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	And, for what it’s worth, I view central banking and economics to be a judgmental art form and definitely not a science.	92	9
201410	3192	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I think the mathematization and quantification of economics have helped but are no substitute in the end for judgment, and I would not argue for anything more specific than what’s already in the consensus statement as written.	92	9
201410	3193	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Lastly, with regard to the issue of financial stability, there is some wiggle room for doing this, in that the act calls for us to maintain moderate interest rates, but I’d be very careful here.	92	9
201410	3194	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	First of all, financial stability is not exogenous to monetary policy.	92	9
201410	3195	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	In fact, it’s implicit in it.	92	9
201410	3196	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	I would suggest that we not tamper with the way the statement currently reads.	92	9
201410	3197	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Here’s the bottom line, Madam Chair:  My approach is, do no harm—leave it as it is.	92	9
201410	3198	2014-10-29	meeting	FISHER	Thank you.	92	9
201410	3199	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201410	3200	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	92	9
201410	3201	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	3202	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	I appreciate the work of the subcommittee and staff to give us a head start on considering whether changes to the statement are needed.	92	9
201410	3203	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	My own conclusion is that the statement has done a pretty good job of representing a consensus at this table and has held up well in the public eye over the past few years.	92	9
201410	3204	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Given that, I would not revise the statement, particularly at a time of heightened interest in and attention to policy normalization and related communications.	92	9
201410	3205	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Quickly, in terms of the questions, I view the Committee’s goal of longer-run inflation at 2 percent as a symmetric target.	92	9
201410	3206	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	If inflation moves above 2 percent, as it did throughout most of 2011, it warrants the same level of concern and monitoring as when it’s running below 2 percent.	92	9
201410	3207	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Regarding the balanced approach, my view is that paragraph 3 of the consensus statement offers the necessary context because it rightly notes that firmly anchored inflation expectations are key to meeting our objectives.	92	9
201410	3208	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Determining the relevant monetary policy stance by ascribing weights to either inflation or employment could be misleading and oversimplifies the policymakers’ considerations.	92	9
201410	3209	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, I am comfortable with the current statement’s treatment of financial stability.	92	9
201410	3210	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	While I firmly believe the setting of interest rate policy should avoid promotingconditions of undue risk-taking and potential financial imbalances, I would question whether we can credibly elevate financial stability as a primary objective of monetary policy rather than a necessary condition for achieving our longer-run goals.	92	9
201410	3211	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	However, to the extent that we rely on macroprudential and supervisory tools as the first line of defense, I do think we should have a clear understanding and confidence that these mechanisms can effectively perform, even if it is imprudent to assume that they can be consistently relied on.	92	9
201410	3212	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of other areas for improved communication, I’m open to considering again the value of a consensus forecast, but I think the Committee already made a serious effort in that direction and encountered substantial obstacles.	92	9
201410	3213	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	So I’m mindful that, with policy normalization and its attendant communication challenges, we might be ahead to maintain some consistency and defer further adjustments to the SEP or a consideration of a consensus forecast until after we deliver a successful exit and return to more normal policy stances.	92	9
201410	3214	2014-10-29	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	92	9
201410	3215	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201410	3216	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	92	9
201410	3217	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	3218	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	There doesn’t seem to be a lot of disagreement, but I prepared these comments, so let me go ahead.	92	9
201410	3219	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Turning to the specific questions we were asked to address, on the first, regarding symmetry, I’d always thought our original Committee agreement was that the inflation objective is symmetric.	92	9
201410	3220	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	I don’t recall anyone disagreeing during our subsequent FOMC deliberations when we have discussed that longer-run inflation expectations are supposed to be 2 percent, according to our monetary policy strategy.	92	9
201410	3221	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Symmetry and “balanced approach” clearly support this expectation for the public.	92	9
201410	3222	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Chairman Bernanke publicly stated that our 2 percent was not a ceiling—it was symmetric.	92	9
201410	3223	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Many of us around the table have said the same.	92	9
201410	3224	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Any hint that the Committee is unsure about the symmetry of our inflation objective would make its achievement vastly more difficult now.	92	9
201410	3225	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	To date, the only sustainable achievement of our 2 percent objective has been in our years-ahead forecasts.	92	9
201410	3226	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	So I can see a case for further clarifying our current commitment to symmetry.	92	9
201410	3227	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Although I recognize there’s not much taste for this, I think it would be a positive step for expanding transparency.	92	9
201410	3228	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	One way to accomplish this would be to add a new third sentence in paragraph 3:  “The inflation goal is symmetric, and the Committee expects inflation to average 2 percent over sufficiently long time periods.”	92	9
201410	3229	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	The public can easily understand that success with respect to our inflation objective will lead to 2 percent inflation, on average.	92	9
201410	3230	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	On the second question, I currently see no reasonable path for the Committee to elaborate on the “balanced approach” language in paragraph 5.	92	9
201410	3231	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	It was a difficult task to get to this very general language in 2012.	92	9
201410	3232	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	This language encompasses the range of views on the Committee in a workable fashion.	92	9
201410	3233	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	On the issues of weights on our dual-mandate objectives, I believe our current “balanced approach” language captures well the equal footing of maximum employment and price stability as codified in the Federal Reserve Act.	92	9
201410	3234	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Stating numerical weights would give an illusory precision for our policy strategy, especially as details such as changes in the Okun’s law relationship could modestly alter the numerical mapping between output and employment and unemployment over time.	92	9
201410	3235	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Now, on financial stability, I do not think we’re intellectually close to a point at which we can go beyond what is currently in the consensus statement .	92	9
201410	3236	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	But let me talk about that at greater length for the benefit of the newer FOMC members, who weren’t here for our March 2013 discussions, which I think are pretty informative on the range of policy considerations.	92	9
201410	3237	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Financial instability risk is an important concern for public policymakers, but I’ve not heard a convincing argument for why it should be another separate objective for the FOMC.	92	9
201410	3238	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Yes, I strongly support the use of our supervisory and macroprudential tools.	92	9
201410	3239	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	This approach falls under the category of using financial instruments to address financial-stability objectives and reserving monetary instruments to address our dual-mandate monetary policy goals.	92	9
201410	3240	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Although it sounds important to at least acknowledge the possibility that, at some time, the FOMC might have to make a difficult financial-stability call to tighten monetary conditions at a time of low inflation and low employment, I cannot yet imagine supporting even hinting about this unless we had a much better analysis of the likely effectiveness of such actions.	92	9
201410	3241	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Recent efforts to use modestly higher interest rates in Norway and Sweden were ineffective for addressing the stated financial risks, and, in Sweden, inflation has been well below its target.	92	9
201410	3242	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Chairman Greenspan spoke of this type of action back in 2002, I believe, at the annual Jackson Hole symposium.	92	9
201410	3243	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	He essentially concluded that the kind of rate increases needed to rein in excessive financial market risks would require cracking the economy.	92	9
201410	3244	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	That’s my paraphrasing of what he said.	92	9
201410	3245	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	He said it would engender a bad economic outcome.	92	9
201410	3246	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Both of these comments are simply reminders that, if monetary policy tools are called on, being effective at rooting out financial instability risks will almost certainly require substantial increases in short-term policy rates.	92	9
201410	3247	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	That means higher unemployment, and lower inflation, than our objectives.	92	9
201410	3248	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Using the blunt tool of monetary policy to address financial instability risks reminds me of treating a sick patient.	92	9
201410	3249	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	After discovering a growing malignancy in a relatively already unhealthy patient, doctors are considering two tools—surgery to remove the malignancy or chemotherapy.	92	9
201410	3250	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Chemotherapy is a blunt tool and will damage the overall health of the already sick patient, but the hope is to rid their body of the malignancy.	92	9
201410	3251	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Surgery is a more direct tool, and you can imagine that that’s preferred.	92	9
201410	3252	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	But the malignancy may be inoperable, and surgery is not feasible.	92	9
201410	3253	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	In situations like this, blunt tools may be the only hope anyone has.	92	9
201410	3254	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	If the FOMC faced an analogous extreme situation and contemplated raising short-term policy rates against the best interest of our employment and inflation objectives, I would expect we would also state very loudly that, first, a malignancy on the financial system had made this imperative; and, second, there was no choice but to remove the root causes of those malignancies as soon as possible.	92	9
201410	3255	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	I can’t imagine taking this action without stating how dangerous the financial market structure was for the US economy that we had had to take such action.	92	9
201410	3256	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	To sum up, we just aren’t anywhere close to the point of being able to describe the conditions for tightening monetary policy to address financial-instability concerns that would result in a better path for unemployment and inflation relative to our mandated goals.	92	9
201410	3257	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Until we are sure of that, we shouldn’t change the reference to financial stability in the consensus statement.	92	9
201410	3258	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Finally, although I’d like to see the subcommittee explore enhancements to the SEP, I’m not optimistic that we’d be able to get to a consensus forecast.	92	9
201410	3259	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	But it’s a worthy objective, if somebody has the time to try to pursue that.	92	9
201410	3260	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	3261	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Can we mobilize him for the subcommittee?	92	9
201410	3262	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	He served on the subcommittee that drafted the statement.	92	9
201410	3263	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	Oh, and I agreed with President Plosser’s comments.	92	9
201410	3264	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I was just wondering whether we could get you onto the subcommittee as an additional member.	92	9
201410	3265	2014-10-29	meeting	EVANS	I’m happy to do whatever you’d like.	92	9
201410	3266	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201410	3267	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	3268	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I want to thank the communications subcommittee as well as the authors of the accompanying memo—Bob, Stacey, and Todd—for their hard work in setting up this discussion.	92	9
201410	3269	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Even though we may end up not making changes—and it seems as though we’re heading that way—I think it’s important for us to have this conversation to understand where we stand.	92	9
201410	3270	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In thinking about the statement, the value of the statement is not simply that it is a consensus, but that it actually provides a description of our longer-run goals and strategies.	92	9
201410	3271	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And it’s helpful for us to talk about what that means to us on a not infrequent basis.	92	9
201410	3272	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	With all of that said, as many have noted, there’s a very high bar for changing the document.	92	9
201410	3273	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s a quasi-constitutional document.	92	9
201410	3274	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We should treat it with that kind of respect.	92	9
201410	3275	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I will make a couple of recommendations for changes—one that I feel very strongly about and one that I feel less strongly about—but those recommendations are made with the idea that this is a quasi-constitutional document.	92	9
201410	3276	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me turn to the issues raised by the subcommittee.	92	9
201410	3277	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of symmetry, I’m very glad to hear the enthusiastic endorsement of symmetry that I’ve heard around the table, and I think it would be helpful for the minutes to reflect that strong endorsement.	92	9
201410	3278	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m very comfortable with where we stand on that.	92	9
201410	3279	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As Governor Tarullo hinted, sometimes it’s hard to see that strong endorsement of symmetry in all of the communications that are coming out of the Committee.	92	9
201410	3280	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I think that having the minutes reflect that is going to be very helpful.	92	9
201410	3281	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of “balanced approach,”	92	9
201410	3282	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m sympathetic to Governor Tarullo’s view that the language in paragraph 5 is vague.	92	9
201410	3283	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But as I’ve talked about on other occasions, I actually have found this language very helpful in providing valuable structure to my decisionmaking.	92	9
201410	3284	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it emphasizes a key point that’s often forgotten—that our mandates are typically complementary.	92	9
201410	3285	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It recognizes that tradeoffs can exist in our mandates.	92	9
201410	3286	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It informs the public that we will not favor one exclusively over the other.	92	9
201410	3287	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And, finally, it appropriately emphasizes that monetary policy is based on a forward-looking evaluation of mandate-relevant macroeconomic variables—one based on projections—not on a backward look at the economy.	92	9
201410	3288	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think all of these are very valuable.	92	9
201410	3289	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I do have a small word change that would be helpful.	92	9
201410	3290	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In the first sentence of paragraph 5, there are two uses of the word “from.”	92	9
201410	3291	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would recommend changing the second “from” to the word “below.”	92	9
201410	3292	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think this would clarify that we are concerned about employment being too low and not too high.	92	9
201410	3293	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As it is, people could read the statement as saying that the FOMC is working toward not having economic activity be too high.	92	9
201410	3294	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So that would be my suggestion.	92	9
201410	3295	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Is it clear what I’m trying to describe?	92	9
201410	3296	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	It’s absolutely clear.	92	9
201410	3297	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Okay.	92	9
201410	3298	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Paragraph 5 says “In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal and deviations of employment from the Committee’s assessments of its maximum level.”	92	9
201410	3299	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would say “deviations of employment below the Committee’s assessments of its maximum level.”	92	9
201410	3300	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So that’s my suggestion for a small change.	92	9
201410	3301	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I don’t feel strongly about that, but, certainly, I think it’s more in keeping with what the second mandate, the full employment mandate, really should mean.	92	9
201410	3302	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The issue I do feel more strongly about is on financial stability.	92	9
201410	3303	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ve heard a number of people suggest that it’s too early to talk about this, and that the intellectual foundations of that are not clear.	92	9
201410	3304	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The intellectual foundations of much of what is in the statement also remain unclear, and I think President Lacker spoke to this very well.	92	9
201410	3305	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We’ve crafted a consensus statement that has served us well despite that, and I think we have to do that on financial stability as well.	92	9
201410	3306	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Over the longer run, I expect that the federal funds rate will converge to about 3¼ percent.	92	9
201410	3307	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s low by historical standards.	92	9
201410	3308	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And there’s uncertainty around my longer-run estimate.	92	9
201410	3309	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There’s a distinct risk that the longer-run federal funds rate could be 1 or even 2 percentage points lower than my estimate.	92	9
201410	3310	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If interest rates do remain this low, I am sure that policymakers will be concerned about risks to financial stability.	92	9
201410	3311	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would expect that the FOMC will put weight on these financial-stability considerations, at least insofar as it perceives that that incipient instability creates a risk for the achievement of its dual-mandate objectives.	92	9
201410	3312	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Indeed, as I understand their comments, some participants in the FOMC may already be putting weight on those considerations.	92	9
201410	3313	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The issue, then, is, does the current language accurately capture this role for financial stability?	92	9
201410	3314	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think paragraph 2 is quite helpful along these lines, and President George and President Rosengren were very helpful in originally getting us to this point about “including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.”	92	9
201410	3315	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s the way it’s referred to in the second paragraph.	92	9
201410	3316	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The problem is that once we get to what I see as the action paragraph of the statement, paragraph 5, the link between financial stability and our policy decisions is less clear.	92	9
201410	3317	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Actually, this is a more general issue.	92	9
201410	3318	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Paragraph 2 describes how risks to the outlook, including those for financial stability, play a role in our deliberations.	92	9
201410	3319	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But then when we get to paragraph 5, that reference to risks is dropped.	92	9
201410	3320	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So let me suggest adding a sentence to the end of paragraph 5:  “The Committee also takes account of the risks to its projections, including risks related to financial instability, as well as the impact of monetary policy on those risks.”	92	9
201410	3321	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think this is very much in keeping with the dialogue I hear around the table all of the time referring to risk-management issues.	92	9
201410	3322	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It takes into account the possibility that we’re able to affect risks; it’s not just that we’re reacting to them.	92	9
201410	3323	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And it reflects what we have in paragraph 2.	92	9
201410	3324	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I say, I feel more strongly about this.	92	9
201410	3325	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I understand that the sense of the Committee is, “Boy, we’ve got the perfect statement—or at least perfect enough that we don’t want to change it.”	92	9
201410	3326	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I think the statement should reflect the factors that are actually going into our decisionmaking, and financial stability is likely to play an increasing role as we move on.	92	9
201410	3327	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me mention three other issues.	92	9
201410	3328	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And this is going beyond amending the consensus statement.	92	9
201410	3329	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I don’t think the consensus statement—what I would call the longer-run goals statement—is playing the role that it could and should play in our decisionmaking.	92	9
201410	3330	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The FOMC statement routinely makes little reference to it, except to the 2 percent target.	92	9
201410	3331	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I’d really encourage the communications subcommittee to explore ways in which the longer-run goals statement, and especially paragraph 5, could be better used.	92	9
201410	3332	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We should always be able to explain how our current decisions are fitting into the framework described in the longer-run goals statement.	92	9
201410	3333	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We should be able to give that explanation in the FOMC statement itself.	92	9
201410	3334	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m a big fan of the idea of a consensus forecast.	92	9
201410	3335	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought President Lockhart’s idea was a very interesting one—that maybe we could be ascribing what we all agree is the consensus, even though we don’t agree with the consensus.	92	9
201410	3336	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s a very interesting idea that’s worth exploring.	92	9
201410	3337	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Even if we don’t get to a quantitative consensus forecast, I’d really encourage us to work toward having a qualitative one.	92	9
201410	3338	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In the consensus statement, paragraph 5 talks about employment and inflation projections, implying that a forecast of some kind is playing a role in our decisions.	92	9
201410	3339	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think the Committee should be able to provide a verbal description of that forecast and its attendant risks in justifying our decision.	92	9
201410	3340	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The September FOMC statement has a partial description along those lines.	92	9
201410	3341	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It refers to labor market indicators and inflation moving back toward our dual-mandate objectives.	92	9
201410	3342	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But we could be more detailed.	92	9
201410	3343	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Do we expect that that convergence will take a few years, less, or more?	92	9
201410	3344	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The final comment I’ll make will, I suspect, have very little support in the Committee, but I would hope that we can work toward this over time.	92	9
201410	3345	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Our 2 percent target will be much more meaningful if it has some notion of a benchmark time horizon.	92	9
201410	3346	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	President Lacker referred to a preoccupation with low inflation, which I assume was somewhat directed at me.	92	9
201410	3347	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We could also have a preoccupation with high inflation, and the inflation target will be more meaningful on the high side if we’re thinking about getting back to target within a benchmark time horizon.	92	9
201410	3348	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Other central banks have that benchmark time horizon.	92	9
201410	3349	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It doesn’t mean we have to get back there in that time horizon.	92	9
201410	3350	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But it’s a benchmark—say, two years.	92	9
201410	3351	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We talk about that.	92	9
201410	3352	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We explain to the public why we’re not able to do that at this current time.	92	9
201410	3353	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it would make our description of having a target have much more content.	92	9
201410	3354	2014-10-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	3355	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201410	3356	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	92	9
201410	3357	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	3358	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The consensus statement has served the Committee well over the past three years.	92	9
201410	3359	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	It facilitates clear communication by providing a publicly agreed-upon, shared language to describe the overarching principles that guide our decisionmaking.	92	9
201410	3360	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, importantly, it has helped clarify the terms of our debates and disagreements.	92	9
201410	3361	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	When we disagree, it’s not about the longer-run goals or strategies but how they apply to a specific situation.	92	9
201410	3362	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	As a concrete example, if inflation is 1½ percent, it’s not just my personal view that inflation is too low.	92	9
201410	3363	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s the Committee’s clearly articulated view that inflation is too low.	92	9
201410	3364	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, because of this shared language, the consensus statement is a foundational document for all of our communications—including our statements, press conferences, speeches, and interviews—so it’s important that we review the consensus statement regularly.	92	9
201410	3365	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m echoing comments by President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201410	3366	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We want to make sure that it’s well aligned with our decisionmaking and with our other communications.	92	9
201410	3367	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even though I am hearing a lot of comments about there being no need for a change, I still think this process is a healthy one, and I’ve learned a lot from the comments I’ve already heard so far today.	92	9
201410	3368	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	With those comments in mind, I’ll now say a few words about the three questions.	92	9
201410	3369	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	First, I personally view the 2 percent goal as symmetric in that inflation should, on average, over time, be close to 2 percent.	92	9
201410	3370	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And then our desire to return to 2 percent inflation does not depend at all on whether inflation is running above or below the target.	92	9
201410	3371	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think this message is sharp, clean, and clear.	92	9
201410	3372	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	When clearly communicated, symmetry provides a consistent anchor for inflation whether we’re above or below our objective.	92	9
201410	3373	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In contrast, a lack of a clear statement of symmetry can be confusing, and here I’ll give the example of the ECB.	92	9
201410	3374	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	It has articulated in the past an inflation target of below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term.	92	9
201410	3375	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	This opaque formulation has led to various interpretations.	92	9
201410	3376	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Is this a ceiling or a target?	92	9
201410	3377	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	So we want to avoid that.	92	9
201410	3378	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Second, the “balanced approach” language respects the principle that both of our mandates are important for our decisionmaking, and that neither is subordinate to the other—that is, they’re on equal footing, and, importantly, we don’t have a hierarchical mandate.	92	9
201410	3379	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I don’t see a great deal of benefit, even if it were possible, in getting more precise about whether the weights in the loss function are literally equal.	92	9
201410	3380	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	After all, even with somewhat different weights, we can still reach broad agreement on policy decisions most of the time.	92	9
201410	3381	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In thinking about both symmetry and “balanced approach,”	92	9
201410	3382	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I find it hard to think through concrete examples of this language because, in doing so, you start realizing we are not truly symmetric in our preferences over different outcomes.	92	9
201410	3383	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	For example, zero percent inflation carries with it a lot of different costs and potential risks, compared with 4 percent inflation.	92	9
201410	3384	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	So the “balanced approach” language actually does serve us well—it’s accurate.	92	9
201410	3385	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Third, concerns about financial stability are best viewed as part of the broader category of longer-term probabilistic risks to achieving our dual mandate.	92	9
201410	3386	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Financial excess is often built slowly, but, when bubbles pop or systemically important banks fail, it can be challenging, if not impossible, to achieve either maximum employment or price stability.	92	9
201410	3387	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	For this reason, risks to financial stability need to be part of our ongoing policy discussion.	92	9
201410	3388	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Importantly, though, financial stability is not the only source of longer-term probabilistic risks to our goals that we regularly discuss here and that influence our policy decisions.	92	9
201410	3389	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Other examples we’ve discussed in recent years include concerns about deflation, the zero lower bound, and the loss of anchored inflation expectations.	92	9
201410	3390	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Each of these, I think, is under the same general rubric of concerns about tail risks or, more generally, probabilistic risks to the outlook.	92	9
201410	3391	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Issues like these are already part of our ongoing discussions under the broader risk- management rubric.	92	9
201410	3392	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Therefore, it could be useful—and I’m picking up a theme that President Kocherlakota raised—to include some reference to risk management, broadly defined, in paragraph 5 of the consensus statement describing how we navigate tradeoffs between our goals.	92	9
201410	3393	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	This would echo the “balance of risks” reference at the end of paragraph 2, which I actually think is really well worded.	92	9
201410	3394	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Such an approach would be preferable to adding explicit reference only to financial stability in paragraph 5, for a couple of reasons.	92	9
201410	3395	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	One is, I do think that suddenly adding a clause about financial stability explicitly to paragraph 5 might be misinterpreted as a statement of a change in our conduct of our policy rather than a clarification of our existing strategy.	92	9
201410	3396	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Also, just as a matter of factual content, financial-stability concerns are a subset of many of these probabilistic risks that we do think about under risk management.	92	9
201410	3397	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The sentence in paragraph 2 really captures this right:  “The Committee’s policy decisions reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.”	92	9
201410	3398	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	That sentence nailed it, and I think finding a way, potentially, whether over the next few months or next year, of echoing those comments in paragraph 5 would be useful.	92	9
201410	3399	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, again, I agree with many people in the room that we don’t really know the answer to how we bring financial stability specifically into monetary policy decisionmaking.	92	9
201410	3400	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But it would be helpful to include some notion of risks to the outlook being an important part of our decisionmaking, because they are.	92	9
201410	3401	2014-10-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	92	9
201410	3402	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201410	3403	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	92	9
201410	3404	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	3405	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	What I’m hearing around the table is pretty much where I am:  The consensus statement we have is pretty good in the sense that it reflects the consensus that we could all subscribe to—the smallest tent we could come up with, as President Lacker said.	92	9
201410	3406	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m quite skeptical that we’re going to be able to improve on this to a sufficient degree to justify bringing this forward to the public.	92	9
201410	3407	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So my view would be that the subcommittee could spend its time on other things, and what I’m going to argue for is spending time working on developing a consensus forecast, because I think that would really be something that is achievable.	92	9
201410	3408	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Other central banks have done it.	92	9
201410	3409	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We could do it, too, and I believe it would also solve a lot of the issues with the SEP, frankly.	92	9
201410	3410	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Before I get into that, though, let me talk a little bit about the three questions.	92	9
201410	3411	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	On the symmetry of the inflation target, I think it’s actually a little trickier than what people have been laying out.	92	9
201410	3412	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re basically saying we agree on symmetry within small intervals of 2 percent.	92	9
201410	3413	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So between 1.99 and 2.01 percent, we’re completely symmetric, but I don’t think we’ve agreed that we’re completely symmetric in the case of 0 versus 4 or minus 2 versus 6.	92	9
201410	3414	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	What we really want to say to people very clearly—and maybe it doesn’t have to be in the consensus statement, but maybe it could be in the minutes—is that we don’t think 2 percent is a ceiling.	92	9
201410	3415	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We basically are targeting 2 percent and would expect to spend roughly half the time slightly above 2 percent and about half the time slightly below 2 percent, and that’s really what we’re for.	92	9
201410	3416	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But I don’t think symmetry is quite right, because I don’t feel symmetric as I get further and further away from 2 percent because it depends on the economic circumstances.	92	9
201410	3417	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	For instance, if you told me that I was at 1 percent inflation and real GDP was growing 8 percent, I wouldn’t be too worried about inflation being 1 percent.	92	9
201410	3418	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But if you told me that real GDP was growing 0 percent, then I’d be quite concerned about it.	92	9
201410	3419	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So I don’t think symmetry really holds up on examination.	92	9
201410	3420	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the balanced approach, I completely don’t believe we should try to do any further elaboration, and I think it really captures the fact that we pay attention to both of these things.	92	9
201410	3421	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t believe an equal-weights rule is a good one.	92	9
201410	3422	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	How much weight you put on the two objectives depends on how far you are away from the objectives.	92	9
201410	3423	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And it depends on the particular economic circumstances.	92	9
201410	3424	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In my own mind, how much weight I put on 1 percent inflation versus 2 depends on a whole bunch of other things that are going on in the economy that affect the economic outlook.	92	9
201410	3425	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So my weights really change over time dynamically.	92	9
201410	3426	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of financial stability, I’m not against trying to put financial stability more explicitly into the consensus statement, but I think it’s tricky.	92	9
201410	3427	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t see financial stability as a third objective of monetary policy, so I don’t like seeing monetary policy being set to achieve financial stability.	92	9
201410	3428	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess I see it a little differently.	92	9
201410	3429	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I see financial stability as a necessary condition to be able to achieve our dual-mandate goals over time.	92	9
201410	3430	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If you don’t have financial stability, then the transmission channels of monetary policy are impaired, which disrupts the effectiveness of monetary policy in achieving the Committee’s objectives.	92	9
201410	3431	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s different from saying we’re going to conduct monetary policy with a goal of generating the financial-stability outcomes we want.	92	9
201410	3432	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think monetary policy is a really blunt tool and not a very effective tool, quite frankly, in terms of responding to financial-stability concerns.	92	9
201410	3433	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The causality matters:  Is it monetary policy driving financial stability, or is financial stability something that’s taken into consideration in terms of how you conduct policy?	92	9
201410	3434	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Let me turn to the consensus forecast.	92	9
201410	3435	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We all recognize that the SEP and the dot plot aren’t so great.	92	9
201410	3436	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	They’re not so great because they don’t really represent very well where the mass of the Committee is, and they’re not very good, because there are all of these modal dots that people actually think represent some sort of uncertainty when, in fact, all they do is represent disagreement.	92	9
201410	3437	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think it would be far better for the Committee to have a consensus forecast.	92	9
201410	3438	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The question is, how do you get to that point?	92	9
201410	3439	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	As President Lockhart referenced—actually, I had a conversation with President Rosengren, and then President Rosengren had a conversation with President Lockhart.	92	9
201410	3440	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Let me tell you about the original conversation I had.	92	9
201410	3441	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I was talking to Ms Shafik, who’s a deputy governor of the Bank of England, and I asked her, “How does the Bank of England manage to come up with this Inflation Report, and why aren’t there dissents by Monetary Policy Committee members from the Inflation Report projection all of the time because, obviously, people probably won’t necessarily agree with that consensus view of things?”	92	9
201410	3442	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	She said exactly what President Lockhart said:  “Well, the reason why there haven’t been dissents”—in a decade, she said, and I don’t know if that’s correct or not, but that’s what she told me—“is that you’re not agreeing with the forecast.	92	9
201410	3443	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	You’re just agreeing that the forecast that’s in the Inflation Report represents the midpoint or the weight of where the committee is.”	92	9
201410	3444	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we crashed on the shoals of “Gee, do I agree with this forecast?	92	9
201410	3445	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Do I not agree with that forecast?”	92	9
201410	3446	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If we moved to this different formulation for the consensus forecast, it would actually be much more possible for the Committee to sign up for something like this.	92	9
201410	3447	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So this is what I’d like to have the subcommittee on communications work on, because if we were to move to a consensus forecast, that would really further the goals of the Committee substantially.	92	9
201410	3448	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s only so much time in the day.	92	9
201410	3449	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s only so much energy we all have.	92	9
201410	3450	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess I would prefer to put that energy into working on a consensus forecast and see if we can actually get to something.	92	9
201410	3451	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	One last point on the consensus forecast.	92	9
201410	3452	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Remember the other thing we got hung up on regarding the consensus forecast was the fact that we didn’t know how to specify the monetary policy assumption because we disagreed about how much asset purchases we’re going to do.	92	9
201410	3453	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, that probably is not an issue, at least in the near term.	92	9
201410	3454	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So maybe that obstacle we faced before is going to be less of an obstacle in the future, but I’ll let the subcommittee on communications work on that.	92	9
201410	3455	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Well, it’ll have a great effect on the public when we say, “Well, we’ve suspended the consensus forecast for a few months because we can’t agree on policy.”	92	9
201410	3456	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But, again, all you have to do is to agree that the Committee agrees that this is the midpoint of where the Committee is on the monetary policy assumption, so I still think it’s possible you can get there.	92	9
201410	3457	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Anyway, this would be worthwhile to pursue.	92	9
201410	3458	2014-10-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’d be curious about what other people around the table think.	92	9
201410	3459	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	92	9
201410	3460	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	3461	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I would join many others around the table in saying the consensus statement has provided real value.	92	9
201410	3462	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	It’s constitutional in nature, and so, to me, it’s natural that there would be differences that need to be papered over—I’m okay with that.	92	9
201410	3463	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I’ll also join the Hippocratic brigade of doing no harm.	92	9
201410	3464	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Turning to the three changes, I do see the 2 percent medium-term inflation objective as symmetrical, and I would view modest deviations from that objective symmetrically.	92	9
201410	3465	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I think the word “modest” is important here.	92	9
201410	3466	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I’m echoing what Vice Chairman Dudley said earlier, in a sense.	92	9
201410	3467	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I just don’t think we should be contemplating more than modest deviations.	92	9
201410	3468	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Once you get outside of that band, it’s not at all clear to me how to think about symmetry.	92	9
201410	3469	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I’d be prepared to say publicly that the objective is symmetrical.	92	9
201410	3470	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Indeed, the former Chairman did that, as Bob mentioned, at the April 2012 press conference.	92	9
201410	3471	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	He said that the medium-term objective, 2 percent, is “not a ceiling, it’s a symmetric objective.”	92	9
201410	3472	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	And I do think it could undermine the Committee’s credibility if the markets were to conclude that 2 percent is, in effect, a ceiling.	92	9
201410	3473	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	On the balanced approach, I like the existing formulation, and I take the statute to mean that the Committee sees the two sides of the dual mandate as of equal weight.	92	9
201410	3474	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	In fact, I don’t really see a plausible way to read the statute as suggesting different weights.	92	9
201410	3475	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	It’s an interesting thought to me that we can have models that, for example, might conclude that we should focus on one and ignore the other.	92	9
201410	3476	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I don’t know how that would work in connection with a statute that tells us to address the two of them.	92	9
201410	3477	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	It doesn’t say, “All of you make up your mind about which of these is more important than the other.”	92	9
201410	3478	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I’ll move on to financial stability.	92	9
201410	3479	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Like others, I would leave the language as is here.	92	9
201410	3480	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	There really isn’t a consensus about the role of financial stability in monetary policy decisionmaking or about the efficacy of regulation.	92	9
201410	3481	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	This sentence at the end of paragraph 2 really captures it very nicely, and I wouldn’t want to see any changes.	92	9
201410	3482	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	To wrap up, there seems to be pretty broad agreement around the table—not unanimous, but pretty broad agreement—to do basically nothing about the statement, and that will leave our subcommittee with, perhaps, some bandwidth, although there are some things to consider, clearly, in the wake of this.	92	9
201410	3483	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	My own view would be that I was very hopeful we were going to get there on the consensus forecast the last time we looked at it, and I was left with a feeling that it would have been really useful to get there.	92	9
201410	3484	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	I was disappointed that we didn’t and would love to take another shot at that.	92	9
201410	3485	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	In addition, there are clearly some things that could be improved with the SEP.	92	9
201410	3486	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	So I look forward to that work.	92	9
201410	3487	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	3488	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201410	3489	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	92	9
201410	3490	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you very much.	92	9
201410	3491	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I found this conversation very illuminating.	92	9
201410	3492	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I do also view this document as somewhat constitutional.	92	9
201410	3493	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	And, as somebody who was not involved in crafting it, it is very helpful to hear about the thinking that went into it on the part of the drafters.	92	9
201410	3494	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Let me focus a bit on the third question, because I do see the statement as a relatively clear and robust explanation of how the Committee views the two individual parts of the dual mandate and possible tradeoffs between them.	92	9
201410	3495	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	However, to my mind, it does not adequately address financial stability, which I consider to be an implicit third leg of our responsibilities in this area.	92	9
201410	3496	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I also would not want to see financial-stability risks called out as a pressing consideration in our current monetary policy deliberations, but it is important that our longer-run goals framework clearly acknowledges the reality that we do take into account, and should take into account, financial-stability risks in the formulation of monetary policy.	92	9
201410	3497	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I don’t think we can be too precise or prescriptive at this juncture.	92	9
201410	3498	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Neither the Committee’s practice nor the research is sufficiently settled to clearly state, for instance, the prioritization of macroprudential tools and monetary policy in combating financial-stability risks under different circumstances or to specify the circumstances under which we might be willing to tolerate some deviation from either leg of the dual mandate.	92	9
201410	3499	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	But I do think we want to acknowledge that the Federal Reserve’s mandate encompasses financial stability, and that it is central to our deliberations.	92	9
201410	3500	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	In my view, financial stability has been central to the Federal Reserve’s mission and mandate since its inception, although it has been, for the most part, implicit and not clearly called out in the statutory language until we saw the provisions on the Federal Reserve’s prudential responsibilities in Dodd-Frank.	92	9
201410	3501	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, if you think about the creation of the Federal Reserve and the major changes to it over its history, they’ve, in most cases, been in response to major events of financial instability.	92	9
201410	3502	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	It would also be a mistake to confine the use of monetary policy to being a last resort, for a variety of reasons.	92	9
201410	3503	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	First and most obvious is because there have been instances of extreme financial stress in which monetary policy has been the tool of first resort, and we should remember that.	92	9
201410	3504	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, we may need to rely more heavily on monetary policy relative to macroprudential tools, compared with some other central banks, for several reasons.	92	9
201410	3505	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	First of all, we operate in a highly fragmented regulatory environment and in a system in which the capital markets play a bigger role in the financial markets than they do in many other systems.	92	9
201410	3506	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	And, second, we have somewhat limited macroprudential tools relative to some other central banks.	92	9
201410	3507	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	We’re making huge strides in building structural resilience.	92	9
201410	3508	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	But I think we’re likely to find, as we continue on in this work, that we’re somewhat hampered in our macroprudential toolkit—possibly on constructing time-varying tools that address time-varying sectoral risks and, certainly, on tools that address the borrower side, such as loan-to-value ratios and debt-to-income ratios, which have been proven to be among the most powerful tools in combating the most damaging kinds of financial-stability risks.	92	9
201410	3509	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	If you think about what we are capable of commanding—in contrast, for instance, to the Bank of England—we have a much more fragmented regulatory structure, with a number of regulatory entities that don’t view their mandate as pertaining to financial stability.	92	9
201410	3510	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	They are instead focused, for instance, on investor protections or consumer protections.	92	9
201410	3511	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	And I’d say the FSOC is, so far, a highly imperfect answer to that problem.	92	9
201410	3512	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	In that context, monetary policy really is the only tool that works across the financial system to address periods of very rapid growth in private credit creation, and we may not want to take that off the table.	92	9
201410	3513	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, I think it’s absolutely right, as many here have stated, that we want to be very modest at this juncture in terms of what we could say about how we’re likely to address and view financial stability relative to the other two legs of the mandate.	92	9
201410	3514	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I don’t agree that it’s one risk in a list of risks.	92	9
201410	3515	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	It is a risk for which we have more primary responsibility, and one that is endogenous, to a larger degree, with respect to the tools we have at our disposal.	92	9
201410	3516	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	So, in that sense, I think we should call it out separately.	92	9
201410	3517	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	And I like the proposal that President Kocherlakota put on the table.	92	9
201410	3518	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	It does have an appropriate degree of modestness but also identifies this as an area in which we are going to intensify our work, which is, I believe, the case.	92	9
201410	3519	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	With regard to the other pieces, I don’t think I can really add to the remarks that have been put on the table.	92	9
201410	3520	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The statement, as drafted, is actually quite good—very carefully crafted language on both the balance and the issue of symmetry.	92	9
201410	3521	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I think it would be difficult for anyone who has observed the Committee’s actions over the past several years not to conclude that the Committee is prepared to act to counter inflation falling persistently below the 2 percent target.	92	9
201410	3522	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	With regard to the consensus forecast proposal, I wasn’t part of the earlier effort.	92	9
201410	3523	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I can see the virtues of having such a forecast.	92	9
201410	3524	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I believe that, in the case of the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee, that process is made considerably easier by the fact that they use market expectations of rates, which means that committee doesn’t actually have to agree on a monetary policy course in order to get to a consensus forecast.	92	9
201410	3525	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	That’s something you should take into account in deliberations over whether this is feasible for this Committee.	92	9
201410	3526	2014-10-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	3527	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201410	3528	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let me return to Governor Fischer for a few comments as well.	92	9
201410	3529	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	3530	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I’d like to say a few things about the discussion before you sum up, so I thank you for giving me the time.	92	9
201410	3531	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	There is widespread agreement on the view that the inflation target should be symmetric, leaving aside questions of what happens in extreme circumstances.	92	9
201410	3532	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Incidentally, it doesn’t say that the function is “symmetric and linear.”	92	9
201410	3533	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	It says “symmetric.”	92	9
201410	3534	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	So you can say that 0 inflation is as bad, not as 4 but as 10, if you want—or 20 or something like that.	92	9
201410	3535	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	You can have a function like that.	92	9
201410	3536	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Let me go to the symmetry.	92	9
201410	3537	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	It’s nice that Ben Bernanke made statements in press conferences.	92	9
201410	3538	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I didn’t know that, and I just read this report.	92	9
201410	3539	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I think a lot of people who didn’t follow the press conferences with the attention that maybe they should have don’t know that that’s what the view of this Committee is.	92	9
201410	3540	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Everybody agrees on symmetry in the sense that the 2 percent is not an upper limit.	92	9
201410	3541	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	So I don’t see why you don’t think we should try, without changing almost anything, to get the word “symmetric” into here.	92	9
201410	3542	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	It seems to me it’s a worthwhile statement.	92	9
201410	3543	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	On the balanced approach—Charlie, correct me if I’m wrong, but I think I wrote a paper trying to quantify the costs of inflation for the Carnegie-Rochester conference that you were organizing.	92	9
201410	3544	2014-10-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Yes.	92	9
201410	3545	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	It was about 1980.	92	9
201410	3546	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	You can try to estimate the costs of inflation, and you can try to estimate the costs of unemployment.	92	9
201410	3547	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	You can actually develop, if we really wanted to work at it, attempts to see what those costs are.	92	9
201410	3548	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	We’re not going to do it, probably, because it’s too much work.	92	9
201410	3549	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	But there has been a common index in wide use in the profession, which is the misery index that Art Okun introduced—the sum of the unemployment rate and the inflation rate.	92	9
201410	3550	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	That’s not bad.	92	9
201410	3551	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	That’s symmetric—not around zero, I guess.	92	9
201410	3552	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Well, it depends on whether it’s the absolute value of the index.	92	9
201410	3553	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	After listening to the discussion, I’m inclined to think we would spend so much time trying to figure out what we meant by the current balanced approach that I suspect it’s not worth working on a whole lot more, other than saying we take both of them into account.	92	9
201410	3554	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	But that’s my guess.	92	9
201410	3555	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	On financial stability, that’s a very tough one indeed.	92	9
201410	3556	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	The current constitutional document is based in the legal system, in laws relating to our mandate.	92	9
201410	3557	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think financial stability is equally based.	92	9
201410	3558	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	There’s a slight problem there.	92	9
201410	3559	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Nonetheless, I liked a lot of what I heard around the table.	92	9
201410	3560	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I think that the key issue here is not how the Fed deals with financial stability but how the FOMC deals with financial stability.	92	9
201410	3561	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	And that means we control the interest rate, and do we ever use the interest rate to deal with financial-stability issues?	92	9
201410	3562	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Now, President Evans used the Greenspan line:  “Well, if you were just going to use the interest rate when the situation becomes untenable, you’d have to do so much to raise the interest rate that you’d destroy the economy.”	92	9
201410	3563	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	That prejudged the answer.	92	9
201410	3564	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	We can’t do it.	92	9
201410	3565	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	We wait for the bubble to pop, and then we mop it up.	92	9
201410	3566	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	The issue is, do we take financial-stability considerations into account in our interest rate decisions?	92	9
201410	3567	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	We sometimes do, and then Lael pointed out that sometimes we do it right at the beginning and not right at the end.	92	9
201410	3568	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I think we ought to work a little bit more on that, but we cannot develop the statement that implies it’s on the same level as inflation and unemployment.	92	9
201410	3569	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	It’s got to be an instrument, an indicator, or something like that, but I would ask you to let me try to come up with something by December for you to look at.	92	9
201410	3570	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	On the consensus forecast, I can’t imagine myself agreeing to a consensus forecast that I think is off significantly.	92	9
201410	3571	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	When it comes to words, there are many different ways of describing a situation, and you’re occasionally willing to trade this word for that word.	92	9
201410	3572	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	But if we’re forecasting a growth rate of 3 percent and I think it should be 1 percent, I’d have a hard time saying, “Well, I’m joining the consensus.”	92	9
201410	3573	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Most central banks that I know use the staff forecast as their forecast.	92	9
201410	3574	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	They talk around that rather than around the committee forecast, and then the committee members are free to say whatever they want.	92	9
201410	3575	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Now, I’ve spoken to members of our staff.	92	9
201410	3576	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Their enthusiasm for this venture is limited.	92	9
201410	3577	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	92	9
201410	3578	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	So my guess is, we’re not going to get there.	92	9
201410	3579	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	But it’s, in fact, what we do today, and it’s, in fact, what underlies the SEP, because the staff gives us the forecast, and you all—at least, I—decide, which side do I want to be on for each variable?	92	9
201410	3580	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	And you go from there.	92	9
201410	3581	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	We’re, in fact, driving the Committee into commenting on the staff forecast.	92	9
201410	3582	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	That’s the outcome of the way the thing is done, and that’s a very useful way of doing it, because we do get people saying what they think.	92	9
201410	3583	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	A lot of things were said.	92	9
201410	3584	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I’m not sure we’re going to get to a consensus forecast—that is, the Committee’s consensus forecast.	92	9
201410	3585	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	But we can take a look at what others do and at least provide information on how many purport to have a committee forecast and how many purport to have a staff forecast.	92	9
201410	3586	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Dan raised a lot of issues, and his concern was that we don’t mean what we say on inflation.	92	9
201410	3587	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	But I don’t think we’d all be talking about 2 percent if we didn’t have 2 percent here.	92	9
201410	3588	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Without the 2 percent, you probably wouldn’t have a basis for complaining about the way we behave, because the complaint is, we’re diverging from what we say our goal is.	92	9
201410	3589	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	That’s a valid concern, which this statement allows us to say.	92	9
201410	3590	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	I also think it’s a very impressive document.	92	9
201410	3591	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	If it’s a constitutional document, then I think Jefferson is sitting with us, and we’re very lucky.	92	9
201410	3592	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	What would we be doing—amendments to the constitution?	92	9
201410	3593	2014-10-29	meeting	POWELL	A bill of rights.	92	9
201410	3594	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Yes, a bill of rights.	92	9
201410	3595	2014-10-29	meeting	TARULLO	Governor Fischer, I’m not quite seeing the parallel, but that’s okay.	92	9
201410	3596	2014-10-29	meeting		[Laughter]	92	9
201410	3597	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	In any case, my guess is that there will be very small changes, if any, but I think you could make a little progress on symmetry.	92	9
201410	3598	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	You could make a little progress on financial stability but you couldn’t make much because you don’t want to say very much.	92	9
201410	3599	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	My guess is that, on “balanced approach,” we could use some of the language, because you give a lot of alternatives for what “balanced approach” might mean.	92	9
201410	3600	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	So if I would make a recommendation, it is that there is enough to work on, but don’t expect to get too much that we can agree on by December.	92	9
201410	3601	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you for the discussion.	92	9
201410	3602	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201410	3603	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let me conclude briefly by thanking everybody for an interesting discussion.	92	9
201410	3604	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks to the subcommittee for your hard work in organizing this, and thanks to the staff for an excellent background paper.	92	9
201410	3605	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I’m not going to weigh in on all of the questions.	92	9
201410	3606	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I just want to say that I do think it’s helpful for us to exchange views periodically about the statement on our fundamental strategy and about the best way to communicate that strategy.	92	9
201410	3607	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Today’s discussion, for me, at least, clarified that, from the time when we adopted this statement to this day, we all have essentially seen the 2 percent as a symmetric objective, and nobody really had in mind that 2 percent was a ceiling.	92	9
201410	3608	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	We’ve had some debate about the usefulness of the consensus statement.	92	9
201410	3609	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	From my standpoint, I really think it’s been an important advance.	92	9
201410	3610	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Like President Kocherlakota and others of you, I consider it an indispensable tool.	92	9
201410	3611	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	In my own communications, it’s always at the center of the way I talk about monetary policy—our 2 percent objective, the fact that we place equal weight on both dual-mandate objectives, and “balanced approach.”	92	9
201410	3612	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	It was good for me to hear that most of you share this view.	92	9
201410	3613	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I guess I’ve served on this Committee longer than anyone else around the table, and I can still remember 1996, which is, I believe, when the first discussion occurred—although when I researched this topic, I found out that, in the Volcker years, there actually was a discussion about adopting a numerical inflation objective.	92	9
201410	3614	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	But we’ve been discussing this since 1996.	92	9
201410	3615	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	It’s taken well more than a decade to formulate a document that was capable of achieving broad support.	92	9
201410	3616	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	To my mind, it is constitutional, and its value derives very importantly from the fact that it does command an overwhelming degree of support in the Committee.	92	9
201410	3617	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I am all in with those who’ve cited the Hippocratic oath.	92	9
201410	3618	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	We should be very careful to do no harm.	92	9
201410	3619	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I would not want to see anything happen here that erodes the support that we have in this room for this statement.	92	9
201410	3620	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	But if your subcommittee can review this discussion and come up with some changes, whether it’s about “symmetric” or ways to characterize the role of financial stability in our decisionmaking, and if you think there are changes that could receive broad support in the Committee either in December or at a later time, I urge you to bring those back to us.	92	9
201410	3621	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	But I really think we have, to my mind, a very good statement, and I’ve heard a lot of positive things about it around the table.	92	9
201410	3622	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	There are other things to do.	92	9
201410	3623	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I heard, as I listened to your discussions, the potential to either look for revisions to the SEP or return to the idea of some form of a consensus forecast.	92	9
201410	3624	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	There was support for that.	92	9
201410	3625	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	And it would be helpful for us to have some Committee vehicle other than just the SEP to try to provide a more concrete discussion of what the Committee thinks about the outlook and the likely trajectory for future policy.	92	9
201410	3626	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	It would be helpful in achieving what I think many of you have said you want, which is forward guidance that is not calendar based and does evolve with the data but would be a Committee-wide statement.	92	9
201410	3627	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	I know this is challenging, but if the Committee, after reviewing what other central banks have done and our own past history with this, can find a way to make some progress, that would be very useful.	92	9
201410	3628	2014-10-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you very much, Madam Chair.	92	9
201410	3629	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	1	1
201410	3630	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Well, thank you very much.	1	1
201410	3631	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	We will next meet on December 16 and 17.	1	1
201410	3632	2014-10-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	1	1
