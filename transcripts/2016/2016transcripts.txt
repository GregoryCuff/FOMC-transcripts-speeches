201601	0	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Good afternoon, everyone.	50.0	65.0
201601	1	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I know that many of you have had to deal with pretty challenging travel conditions to get here, so I want to express my appreciation for your willingness to brave the snow and ice to participate in today’s meeting.	50.0	65.0
201601	2	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Before we get started, I want to discuss one housekeeping detail that pertains to dinner this evening.	50.0	65.0
201601	3	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Normally, we would have a dinner after the FOMC meeting.	50.0	65.0
201601	4	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And it’s not impossible for us to do it tonight: The Board staff is prepared to provide dinner.	50.0	65.0
201601	5	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	However, almost all of the people who live in town here face quite challenging conditions in terms of getting home.	50.0	65.0
201601	6	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	It is also forecast to rain this afternoon and maybe freeze over.	50.0	65.0
201601	7	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And so I am, frankly, concerned about people staying late and dealing with those conditions.	50.0	65.0
201601	8	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So would it be acceptable to people to make your own arrangements for dinner and cancel this evening?	50.0	65.0
201601	9	2016-01-27	meeting	PARTICIPANTS	Yes.	50.0	999.0
201601	10	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	50.0	65.0
201601	11	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	50.0	65.0
201601	12	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So we will consider dinner to be canceled.	50.0	65.0
201601	13	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Will there be a sufficient supply of doughnuts during the break?	50.0	102.0
201601	15	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, we gave you a good lunch.	50.0	65.0
201601	16	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	50.0	65.0
201601	17	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Tomorrow morning, tomorrow morning.	50.0	102.0
201601	18	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	You should have confidence and trust your colleagues to do the best they possibly can on that score.	50.0	65.0
201601	19	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	50.0	65.0
201601	20	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Importantly, I would like to welcome Neel Kashkari to his first FOMC meeting.	50.0	65.0
201601	21	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Neel became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis at the turn of this year.	50.0	65.0
201601	22	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari brings valuable government-sector experience, including service as senior advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury and assistant secretary of the Treasury during the global financial crisis.	50.0	65.0
201601	23	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, he has extensive experience in the private financial sector, and going back before that, he was employed as an aerospace engineer, contributing to what we affectionately call the “real side” of the economy.	50.0	65.0
201601	24	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So, Neel, we look forward to working with you.	50.0	65.0
201601	25	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And I would also like to welcome back onto the Committee Presidents Bullard, George, Mester, and Rosengren.	50.0	65.0
201601	26	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Now, as usual, this entire FOMC meeting will be considered a joint meeting with the Board of Governors.	50.0	65.0
201601	27	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So I need a motion to close the Board meeting.	50.0	65.0
201601	28	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	50.0	108.0
201601	29	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	50.0	65.0
201601	30	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	50.0	65.0
201601	31	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Now, let’s begin with the organizational portion of the meeting, and, following well-worn precedent, I will turn the floor over to Governor Fischer, who will handle the nominations and elections for the positions of Chair and Vice Chair of the Committee.	51.0	65.0
201601	32	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam—Chair.	51.0	108.0
201601	33	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’m not sure—[laughter].	51.0	108.0
201601	34	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, we’ll see.	51.0	65.0
201601	35	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	51.0	108.0
201601	36	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	“Madam” seems just fine.	51.0	65.0
201601	37	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, madam.	51.0	108.0
201601	38	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’ll be calling for two sets of nominations and votes, and the first is, I’d like to ask for a nomination for Committee Chair.	51.0	108.0
201601	39	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I will nominate Janet Yellen.	51.0	97.0

201601	41	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I second that nomination.	51.0	104.0
201601	42	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Any other nominations or discussion?	51.0	108.0
201601	43	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	[No response]	51.0	108.0
201601	44	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Without objection.	51.0	108.0
201601	45	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Now I’d like to ask for a nomination for the position of Committee Vice Chair.	51.0	108.0
201601	46	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I will nominate William C.	51.0	97.0
201601	47	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Dudley.	51.0	97.0
201601	48	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Is there a second?	51.0	108.0
201601	49	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I second that nomination, too.	51.0	104.0
201601	50	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Any other nominations or discussion?	51.0	108.0
201601	51	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	[No response]	51.0	108.0
201601	52	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Without objection.	51.0	108.0
201601	53	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, Governor Fischer.	51.0	65.0
201601	54	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Next, we’re going to turn to the election of staff officers.	51.0	65.0
201601	55	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Brian, can I ask you to read the list of nominated staff members?	51.0	65.0
201601	56	2016-01-27	meeting	MADIGAN	Certainly.	51.0	999.0

201601	58	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Do I have a motion to approve these nominations?	51.0	65.0
201601	59	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	51.0	108.0
201601	60	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	51.0	65.0
201601	61	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	51.0	65.0
201601	62	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And now we’re ready to move on to item 2.	51.0	65.0
201601	63	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We need to select a Federal Reserve Bank to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account, and the floor is open for nominations.	51.0	65.0
201601	64	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Did I see President Bullard?	51.0	65.0
201601	65	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Yes.	51.0	94.0
201601	66	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’ll nominate the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.	51.0	94.0
201601	67	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And are there further nominations or discussion?	51.0	65.0
201601	68	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	51.0	65.0
201601	69	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	51.0	65.0
201601	70	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	51.0	65.0
201601	71	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I need a motion to approve.	51.0	65.0
201601	72	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	51.0	108.0
201601	73	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	51.0	65.0
201601	74	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	51.0	65.0
201601	75	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Next we’re up to item 3, to select a manager and deputy manager of the System Open Market Account.	51.0	65.0
201601	76	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to ask Vice Chairman Dudley to make these nominations.	51.0	65.0
201601	77	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I’d like to nominate Simon Potter as Manager of the System Open Market Account and Lorie Logan as Deputy Manager of the System Open Market Account.	51.0	96.0
201601	78	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Do I have a motion?	51.0	65.0
201601	79	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	51.0	108.0
201601	80	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	51.0	65.0
201601	81	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	51.0	65.0
201601	82	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Now we’re going to move on to item 4, which concerns authorization for domestic open market operations and foreign currency operations, and I’d like to ask Simon to introduce this item.	64.0	65.0
201601	83	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I was having problems saying “Thank you, Madam Chair” at the start of this, which I’ve gotten through.	64.0	999.0
201601	84	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well done.	64.0	65.0
201601	85	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	As part of the annual review of the Committee’s authorization for domestic open market operations, and as discussed in the memo titled “Request for Votes on the Authorization for Desk Operations” that you received before the meeting, the Desk recommends approval, with one minor change to ensure consistency in the use of terms “repo” and “reverse repo” transactions.	64.0	999.0
201601	86	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	That would be on page 44 of the organizational document.	64.0	999.0
201601	87	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I’d also like to highlight another item for the Committee’s consideration.	64.0	999.0
201601	88	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	In January 2009, the Committee suspended the Guidelines for the Conduct of System Open Market Operations in Federal-Agency Issues in light of the Federal Reserve’s having begun a program of purchases of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities.	64.0	999.0
201601	89	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The SOMA contains a significant amount of agency debt and agency MBS, and it continues to conduct transactions in agency MBS as part of the reinvestment policy adopted by the Committee.	64.0	999.0
201601	90	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	That being the case, I recommend the continued suspension of these guidelines.	64.0	999.0
201601	91	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	No Committee vote is needed to continue the suspension.	64.0	999.0
201601	92	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Simon?	64.0	65.0
201601	93	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	64.0	65.0
201601	94	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Hearing none, we need a motion to approve the proposals.	64.0	65.0
201601	95	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	64.0	108.0
201601	96	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Second.	64.0	96.0
201601	97	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	64.0	65.0
201601	98	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	64.0	65.0
201601	99	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We’re now ready to move on to item 5, “Proposed Revisions to the Program for Security of FOMC Information.”	64.0	65.0
201601	100	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Excuse me.	64.0	999.0
201601	101	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Can we do the foreign authorization?	64.0	999.0
201601	102	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Oh, I’m sorry.	64.0	65.0
201601	103	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I apologize.	64.0	65.0
201601	104	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	We also recommend that the Committee approve the documents governing foreign transactions without amendment.	64.0	999.0
201601	105	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	As I mentioned at the December FOMC meeting, the staff is evaluating the current foreign exchange reserve management framework and working on modernizing the documents related to foreign operations.	64.0	999.0
201601	106	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I plan to defer recommending any changes to the documents governing foreign operations until these projects are complete.	64.0	999.0
201601	107	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Note that the approval of the “foreign” documents includes approval of the System’s warehousing agreement with the Treasury.	64.0	999.0
201601	108	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	As has been the case since February 5, 1997, the limit on warehousing is set at $5 billion.	64.0	999.0
201601	109	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	There are currently no outstanding balances.	64.0	999.0
201601	110	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Simon on the foreign currency matters?	64.0	65.0
201601	111	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Comments?	64.0	65.0
201601	112	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	64.0	65.0
201601	113	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Then we need a motion to approve that proposal.	64.0	65.0
201601	114	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	64.0	108.0
201601	115	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Second.	64.0	96.0
201601	116	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	64.0	65.0
201601	117	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	64.0	65.0
201601	118	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	64.0	65.0
201601	119	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Now, item 5—I’d like to turn to “Proposed Revisions to the Program for Security of FOMC Information.”	66.0	65.0
201601	120	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	The staff is proposing three sets of relatively minor changes to the program.	66.0	65.0
201601	121	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	The first is to clarify that all Federal Reserve persons—and that includes FOMC participants as well as staff members—must receive, review, and agree to abide by the program.	66.0	65.0
201601	122	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Second, there are some proposed changes to provide more flexibility in making FOMC information access decisions for persons at the Board.	66.0	65.0
201601	123	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And, third, there are some technical changes, such as making program language more consistent and correcting a typo.	66.0	65.0
201601	124	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	There is also a slightly more substantive change that I would like to propose, and I sent you a memo on this.	66.0	65.0
201601	125	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	As you know, our program for security of FOMC information has received some attention from the Congress and others as a consequence of the 2012 leak of FOMC information.	66.0	65.0
201601	126	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Protecting confidential FOMC information is clearly a matter of the utmost importance, and it’s appropriate that we continually review our program to ensure that our policies and practices remain strong and transparent.	66.0	65.0
201601	127	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	The proposed changes to section 7 of the program are intended to clarify our procedures in the event of a potential breach of confidential FOMC information.	66.0	65.0
201601	128	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	To date, our program has stated that, once notified of a potential breach, the Committee’s secretary and general counsel will perform a review of the incident and, in light of the review results, the general counsel will determine whether to request the Board’s inspector general to perform an investigation of the incident.	66.0	65.0
201601	129	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Now, during my tenure as Chair, all potential material breaches have been referred to the inspector general, with only minimal review by the secretary and general counsel.	66.0	65.0
201601	130	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I believe that that approach is fully consistent with the program, and the proposed revisions are meant to codify this practice.	66.0	65.0
201601	131	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, the revised language states that the secretary or the general counsel will make a referral to the inspector general, thereby vesting that responsibility in more than one person and reducing the possibility of any apparent conflict of interest in making a referral determination.	66.0	65.0
201601	132	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So I would like to propose those changes.	66.0	65.0
201601	133	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And, before we go to a vote, let me ask whether there are any comments or questions on that proposal or other changes to the organizational documents proposed by the staff.	66.0	65.0
201601	134	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	66.0	65.0
201601	135	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Madam Chair, I support what you’ve proposed here, but I noted in the strikeouts that the previous version, at some level, offered consultation with the president of the relevant Reserve Bank in the event of a breach.	66.0	103.0
201601	136	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	And if the breach emanated from a Reserve Bank, I just wondered, as a practical matter, even though you’re striking through that in favor of this stronger process, whether there would be such consultation.	66.0	103.0
201601	137	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think there could be such consultation.	66.0	65.0
201601	138	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I do think our default response should be that any material breach will be referred to the inspector general.	66.0	65.0
201601	139	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I agree.	66.0	103.0
201601	140	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	That should be the default.	66.0	65.0
201601	141	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	It shouldn’t be a specific judgment that we’re making once something has been determined to be material.	66.0	65.0
201601	142	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	It should be turned over to the IG.	66.0	65.0
201601	143	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	There could certainly continue to be consultation.	66.0	65.0
201601	144	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But I do think it’s important to make clear that our policy will be to turn any material matter over to the IG.	66.0	65.0
201601	145	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	And I support that.	66.0	103.0
201601	146	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I’m thinking, as a practical matter, with employment and code of conduct issues within the Banks, we would have some follow-up if it involves the staff in a Reserve Bank as well.	66.0	103.0
201601	147	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions or comments?	66.0	65.0
201601	148	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	66.0	65.0
201601	149	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	66.0	65.0
201601	150	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Then I guess we need just one motion to approve the organizational document.	66.0	65.0
201601	151	2016-01-27	meeting	MADIGAN	I would vote on this program explicitly.	66.0	999.0
201601	152	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	66.0	65.0
201601	153	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll vote explicitly on the changes to “The Program for Security of FOMC Information.”	66.0	65.0
201601	154	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Do I have a motion?	66.0	65.0
201601	155	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	66.0	108.0
201601	156	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	66.0	65.0
201601	157	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	66.0	65.0
201601	158	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Our next agenda item, is “Proposed Change to the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.”	92.0	65.0
201601	159	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Before I turn things over to Governor Fischer, I would like to extend my thanks to the subcommittee on communications and to the staff who have supported their work on this topic.	92.0	65.0
201601	160	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think they are proposing potential enhancements to what is a very important document of this Committee.	92.0	65.0
201601	161	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So let me turn things over to Governor Fischer to introduce this topic.	92.0	65.0
201601	162	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	108.0
201601	163	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	At the October 2014 FOMC meeting, we discussed the possibility of amending the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which is shortened to the “consensus statement,” in order to clarify that the Committee’s inflation objective is symmetric.	92.0	108.0
201601	164	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	At that time, there was widespread agreement that inflation moderately above the Committee’s 2 percent goal and inflation the same amount below that level were equally costly.	92.0	108.0
201601	165	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Although many participants thought that the symmetry of the objective was understood by the public, it nonetheless seemed useful to clarify that symmetry in the consensus statement.	92.0	108.0
201601	166	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	However, some members thought that making a change to the consensus statement at that time posed a risk that the change could be seen as signaling a change in the Committee’s views about the appropriate timing of liftoff.	92.0	108.0
201601	167	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	In order to avoid such confusion, the change was deferred until after liftoff.	92.0	108.0
201601	168	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	With liftoff now behind us, the Committee thought that this would be an appropriate time to make the modification.	92.0	108.0
201601	169	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	To do so, we have worked with all of you to develop specific language, which is shown in blue ink on page 4 of the handout, that has received broad support.	92.0	108.0
201601	170	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The modified wording makes clear that a sequence of one-sided misses of the 2 percent target in either direction would be undesirable.	92.0	108.0
201601	171	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Even if inflation was ultimately expected to return to target, persistent misses would represent a welfare loss and might cause inflation expectations to become unanchored over time.	92.0	108.0
201601	172	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Regarding the specific wording, we use the words “were running” in order to be clear that the deviations are ongoing.	92.0	108.0
201601	173	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	That is, they are not simply :bygones” but are expected to continue, at least for a time.	92.0	108.0
201601	174	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think this wording is appropriate because expected future deviations would be a greater concern if they followed a sequence of past deviations in the same direction, as the expected deviations would be more likely to have an effect on longer-term inflation expectations.	92.0	108.0
201601	175	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	That said, the word “concerned” was chosen because it provides flexibility regarding whether the Committee would take action in response to the deviations.	92.0	108.0
201601	176	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	It might do so, of course, but a policy response would not necessarily be called for.	92.0	108.0
201601	177	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	For example, if inflation was running above 2 percent but unemployment was above the level consistent with maximum employment, then the Committee might judge that no change in policy was appropriate.	92.0	108.0
201601	178	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Similarly, if inflation was running below 2 percent but the economy was strengthening and inflation was expected to return to 2 percent over the medium term, then the Committee also might see unchanged policy as appropriate.	92.0	108.0
201601	179	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	As we noted in the memo, we have also updated the reference to the SEP estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate.	92.0	108.0
201601	180	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	In doing so, we changed the reference from the central tendency to the median, a change consistent with the outcome of the Committee’s discussion last July.	92.0	108.0
201601	181	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	In view of the timing of the Chair’s monetary policy testimony, we plan to release the updated statement following our meeting tomorrow along with the usual postmeeting statement.	92.0	108.0
201601	182	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	A draft of the short cover note that would be used for that press release is on page 5 of 5 of the memo from the subcommittee to the FOMC.	92.0	108.0
201601	183	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	108.0
201601	184	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92.0	65.0
201601	185	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We now have an opportunity for comments on the consensus statement.	92.0	65.0
201601	186	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me start with President Williams.	92.0	65.0
201601	187	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	102.0
201601	188	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Governor Fischer has explained the process that we went through in the subcommittee on this as well as the reasons for the change, and I strongly support the change in the language.	92.0	102.0
201601	189	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I just want to add one particular comment that I think is relevant for thinking about what we are trying to accomplish here.	92.0	102.0
201601	190	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	This part of the consensus statement is really just about our longer-run inflation objective.	92.0	102.0
201601	191	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It doesn’t shed light on what the policy responses are to deviations from the objective, or to the shape of the objective beyond the fact that it is a symmetric objective.	92.0	102.0
201601	192	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think one of the great achievements of the consensus statement over the years is that it has provided the biggest umbrella we are able to provide with regard to what we agree on—the 2 percent objective, and the view that this is symmetric—and leaves off of the consensus statement the particulars of how one thinks about the appropriate policy response and other things that we may have different views on.	92.0	102.0
201601	193	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think the goal here, really, is just to cement in the public’s mind that the goal is 2 percent, that it is the midpoint of the target, and that it is symmetric around that.	92.0	102.0
201601	194	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the rest of the statement, which stays basically the same as before, describes our policy strategy on deviations from that objective and doesn’t indicate specifically what we do in those circumstances but lays out a general strategy.	92.0	102.0
201601	195	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, again, I strongly support the statement.	92.0	102.0
201601	196	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think it is something that will help clarify our thinking for those who may still think that our 2 percent objective is somehow a ceiling and not a point target.	92.0	102.0
201601	197	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	92.0	102.0
201601	198	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	92.0	65.0
201601	199	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	92.0	65.0
201601	200	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	999.0
201601	201	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The FOMC Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy was first introduced in January 2012.	92.0	999.0
201601	202	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	It serves to clarify the Committee’s decisionmaking framework, and I do view the statement as an important addition to our communications arsenal.	92.0	999.0
201601	203	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	It is known internally as the consensus statement.	92.0	999.0
201601	204	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	That is not a misnomer.	92.0	999.0
201601	205	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The statement has had very broad support among FOMC participants since its adoption.	92.0	999.0
201601	206	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Of course, it wasn’t by accident that that happened.	92.0	999.0
201601	207	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The previous communications subcommittee and its chair, Janet Yellen, worked diligently to devise language that would encompass the diversity of views among participants while at the same time articulate to the public the Committee’s approach to policymaking.	92.0	999.0
201601	208	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Due to the quasi-constitutional nature of the document and the fact that it has had very broad support, participants have generally agreed that the bar should be fairly high for making any changes.	92.0	999.0
201601	209	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	At the same time, the Committee has periodically considered amendments that could help clarify the document or make it a more effective communications device.	92.0	999.0
201601	210	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	And one of those changes, which is on the table today—the clarification that the Committee views a 2 percent inflation objective as symmetric—has received widespread support at previous meetings and, as Governor Fischer said, with the thought that the change would wait until after normalization had begun.	92.0	999.0
201601	211	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Consistent with those past discussions, I strongly support making the change now.	92.0	999.0
201601	212	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The change has been signaled with the minutes of earlier meetings.	92.0	999.0
201601	213	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	And, now that liftoff has occurred, it sounds like the right time to do it.	92.0	999.0
201601	214	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Moreover, January is the normal time for reaffirming the consensus statement.	92.0	999.0
201601	215	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	So I am not concerned that the change will be interpreted as a comment or signal about current monetary policy.	92.0	999.0
201601	216	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	And we can contain that interpretation by what we say about the change after it is released, explaining that the purpose is to clarify the framework in the interest of furthering transparency.	92.0	999.0
201601	217	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In terms of the specific language, I can tell you that the communications subcommittee and staff, under the able leadership of our chair, Stan Fischer, took a page out of the previous subcommittee’s book and strove to craft language that would represent the broad consensus.	92.0	999.0
201601	218	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	We did engage in deliberations and consultations, and we took the comments and suggestions of each FOMC participant very seriously.	92.0	999.0
201601	219	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Our deliberations suggest that the language now on the table is acceptable to almost all participants, and I want to acknowledge the willingness of many Committee members to compromise on their favorite phraseology in the spirit of reaching a workable consensus in the pursuit of our common goal of clarifying to the public this aspect of our policymaking framework.	92.0	999.0
201601	220	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	With regard to the specific wording, the broad intent is to clarify that the Committee views the 2 percent inflation objective as symmetric.	92.0	999.0
201601	221	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	As Governor Fischer said, the phrase “were running” captures the idea that the primary concern is with deviations from target that are expected to persist into the future.	92.0	999.0
201601	222	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	It allows for different preferred models of the inflation progress among participants.	92.0	999.0
201601	223	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Some might put more weight on current and past deviations from the target as informative about future inflation.	92.0	999.0
201601	224	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Others who view inflation expectations as a predominant factor when forecasting inflation might look at persistent deviations as a potential risk for unanchoring expectations.	92.0	999.0
201601	225	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	As was said earlier, the word “concerned” is consistent with the Committee’s past behavior.	92.0	999.0
201601	226	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Concern about persistent deviations doesn’t mean that they necessarily warrant Committee action.	92.0	999.0
201601	227	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	For example, I am concerned by the low level of inflation, but, on the basis of the outlook, I think a reasonable forecast is that inflation will return to target over the medium term, and I don’t believe additional policy accommodation is called for.	92.0	999.0
201601	228	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	A look at the minutes of the FOMC meetings in late 2006 and early 2007, when core inflation was above 2 percent, shows that the Committee was indeed concerned about elevated core inflation but held the funds rate target at 5¼ percent because it expected inflation to move lower over time.	92.0	999.0
201601	229	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The proposed wording clarifies the nature of the inflation target.	92.0	999.0
201601	230	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	How policymakers approach setting policy in order to promote achieving the symmetric inflation goal and our other dual-mandate goal of maximum employment is discussed later in the consensus statement.	92.0	999.0
201601	231	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I don’t feel that the proposed wording constrains or changes in any way the ability of the Committee to chart the appropriate course of policy in pursuit of our goals.	92.0	999.0
201601	232	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Again, we might all think of alternative wordings that we might individually prefer in one way or the other.	92.0	999.0
201601	233	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	But this statement is meant to be a consensus statement giving the Committee’s policymaking principles, and the specific wording proposed has been developed with that in mind.	92.0	999.0
201601	234	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In supporting this change, I feel comfortable that I can explain my own approach to monetary policymaking within the context of this statement.	92.0	999.0
201601	235	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I hope that others will approach it in this way, too, and I hope that they will support it as well.	92.0	999.0
201601	236	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you.	92.0	999.0
201601	237	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	92.0	65.0
201601	238	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	92.0	65.0
201601	239	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair, and let me briefly, offer the basis for my support for this change.	92.0	104.0
201601	240	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I support it for three reasons.	92.0	104.0
201601	241	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	First, the change is an important, even fundamental, one in the sense that it rises to the level of inclusion in the consensus statement.	92.0	104.0
201601	242	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The question of whether the 2 percent medium-term objective is a ceiling or a goal, with a symmetric loss function focused on it, is a critical one, particularly today—when inflation has undershot the target since the crisis, including almost every single month of my four years here at the Board.	92.0	104.0
201601	243	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Second, as the meeting that Governor Fischer referred to earlier showed, Committee participants have broadly agreed that the loss function is symmetric.	92.0	104.0
201601	244	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And, third, the proposed language, as Loretta indicated, has been the result of extensive consultation and now attracts the support of nearly all.	92.0	104.0
201601	245	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And for those reasons, I am happy to support the language.	92.0	104.0
201601	246	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	104.0
201601	247	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	92.0	65.0
201601	248	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	92.0	65.0
201601	249	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	97.0
201601	250	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	As some of you have probably noticed, I have abstained from voting on this statement since it was introduced in January 2012 in part, as I have stated for the record in each of the past four years, on the ground that it really didn’t communicate much that gave useful insight into how the FOMC would approach its policy decisions.	92.0	97.0
201601	251	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	In part, though, I abstained because certain expectations I had been given regarding language that would be included in the original statement were confounded at that time.	92.0	97.0
201601	252	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Experience over those four years hasn’t really changed my mind as to how useful the statement is in communicating how we go about making our policy decisions.	92.0	97.0
201601	253	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	As I anticipated at the time, in actual decisionmaking, everybody pretty much, I think, takes his or her own reading or interpretation of the statement.	92.0	97.0
201601	254	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	However, it is not a bad thing to have even a high-level expression of consensus as to the FOMC’s longer-range goals, and there does come a point when it is probably not too productive to continue to abstain.	92.0	97.0
201601	255	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	This seems to me such a point, particularly in light of the helpful changes that Chair Yellen, Governors Fischer and Powell, and Presidents Mester and Williams have worked out.	92.0	97.0
201601	256	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And although this change is not directed at the issue that was in play back in late 2011, I think it is noteworthy, in light of recent experience and current circumstances.	92.0	97.0
201601	257	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	So I will vote for the statement today.	92.0	97.0
201601	258	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I now want to add one thought, though.	92.0	97.0
201601	259	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	We don’t have a lot of expressions of agreement on the Committee.	92.0	97.0
201601	260	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	The statement expresses, albeit at a very high level, an agreement, despite some nontrivial differences that lie beneath it.	92.0	97.0
201601	261	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	President Williams, captured this well in his introductory remarks.	92.0	97.0
201601	262	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think it is institutionally important for us to project an ability to agree, even if only at a fairly high level, and that is why I abstained rather than dissented over each of the past several years.	92.0	97.0
201601	263	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And that is why I have gone out of my way in the past four years not to highlight publicly my points of difference with the statement.	92.0	97.0
201601	264	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I also appreciate the fact that so far as I am aware, none of you has tried to argue publicly that the statement compels or justifies a particular policy outcome.	92.0	97.0
201601	265	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	There is plenty of room to interpret the statement in a variety of ways, as we have de facto done in our policymaking.	92.0	97.0
201601	266	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I suspect many of you, like me, would be happier if it were drafted somewhat differently.	92.0	97.0
201601	267	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Indeed, I am not sure the language being added is exactly the way I would have phrased the point.	92.0	97.0
201601	268	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	The problem, of course, is that we would differ on what those differences should be.	92.0	97.0
201601	269	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think we should recognize the compromises that are inevitable, salute the work the subcommittee has done, endorse the statement, and then refrain from trying to highlight the differences rather than the admittedly high level of agreement.	92.0	97.0
201601	270	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	97.0
201601	271	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	92.0	65.0
201601	272	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	92.0	65.0
201601	273	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	94.0
201601	274	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’m opposed to this portion of the changes to the Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.	92.0	94.0
201601	275	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	My opposition centers on the extra sentence being added to the statement, which reads, “The Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below this objective.”	92.0	94.0
201601	276	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	In my view, this sentence is inappropriately backward looking.	92.0	94.0
201601	277	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	A basic tenet of modern inflation targeting is that it is the inflation forecast that is critically important, not recent misses of inflation from target that were caused by unpredictable shocks that hit the economy.	92.0	94.0
201601	278	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Because this is a statement of longer-run goals, this sentence should appropriately reflect this basic tenet of inflation targeting.	92.0	94.0
201601	279	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	A rewrite that would accomplish this would be simple:  “The Committee would be concerned if inflation were expected to run persistently above or below this objective.”	92.0	94.0
201601	280	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I communicated my concerns to the communications subcommittee, but I was unable to persuade the subcommittee to change the language.	92.0	94.0
201601	281	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Because I regard this as a matter of fundamental importance for this Committee, I’m dissenting on the adoption of this statement as written.	92.0	94.0
201601	282	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Part of my concern is that this statement of longer-run goals is quasi-constitutional in nature and that language introduced today will likely be very persistent into the future.	92.0	94.0
201601	283	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I therefore think that it is even more important to get this language correct than it is for other Committee statements.	92.0	94.0
201601	284	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I want to now point out three areas in which I see this new sentence as inconsistent with Committee statements and actual practice.	92.0	94.0
201601	285	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	One is in the staff’s characterizations of optimal monetary policy.	92.0	94.0
201601	286	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	A second is in the current Committee communication regarding the inflation outlook and future policy decisions.	92.0	94.0
201601	287	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	And the third is in past Committee behavior during an era in which inflation was persistently higher than desired.	92.0	94.0
201601	288	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Let me begin with the staff’s characterizations of optimal monetary policy.	92.0	94.0
201601	289	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	The current version of Tealbook B, page 8, provides the Committee with results of an optimal control exercise that projects inflation through 2021.	92.0	94.0
201601	290	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	The optimal control projections for inflation are below our 2 percent target until 2020; in addition, actual inflation has been below target for several years in the past.	92.0	94.0
201601	291	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Yet, at least under the assumptions behind the optimal control exercise, this is the very best policy that can be pursued by this Committee.	92.0	94.0
201601	292	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	If the Committee adopted this approach to policy, then it would not be particularly concerned that inflation had been below target in the past.	92.0	94.0
201601	293	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	That outcome would be chalked up to shocks that hit the economy in the past, and the Committee would take the effects of those shocks on board and map out a strategy to move inflation back to target over several years.	92.0	94.0
201601	294	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	To me, this type of optimal policy calculation lays out a dichotomy compared with the backward-looking sentence being proposed for the statement of longer-run goals.	92.0	94.0
201601	295	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Let me now turn to the current Committee communication.	92.0	94.0
201601	296	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee’s official statements on monetary policy in recent quarters have stressed the idea that the Committee needs to be reasonably confident that inflation will return to target over the forecast horizon.	92.0	94.0
201601	297	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is a forward-looking criterion that I think contrasts with the backward-looking sentence being proposed for the statement of longer-run goals.	92.0	94.0
201601	298	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Finally, let me turn to the past behavior of the Committee.	92.0	94.0
201601	299	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	During the period from 2003 to 2008, inflation routinely ran in excess of 2 percent.	92.0	94.0
201601	300	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Naturally, the Committee and the Chair at the time were constantly asked about this situation.	92.0	94.0
201601	301	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	My general characterization of the response is that the Committee stressed that the factors that were keeping inflation relatively high were likely temporary, and that, under the policy in place at the time, the Committee expected inflation to return to lower, more normal levels.	92.0	94.0
201601	302	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Again, this was a forward-looking argument.	92.0	94.0
201601	303	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	In the event, inflation did not continue to rise but instead moved lower, and an era of inflation misses on the high side ended.	92.0	94.0
201601	304	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	This historical experience suggests to me behavior of the Committee that would be difficult to reconcile with the new sentence being proposed for the statement of longer-run goals.	92.0	94.0
201601	305	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	In summary, putting the new sentence in the statement of longer-run goals this way will, in my opinion, put a burden on the Committee’s future communication as financial market participants seek to reconcile the new language with the reality that it must be the inflation forecast that really matters for the future direction of monetary policy.	92.0	94.0
201601	306	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Let me stress before concluding that I support the remainder of the statement as written.	92.0	94.0
201601	307	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	As many of you know, I worked closely with many of my colleagues on the Committee to help craft this statement during 2011 for adoption in January 2012.	92.0	94.0
201601	308	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	This established an official inflation target for the United States, a longtime goal of former Chairman Bernanke.	92.0	94.0
201601	309	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I still very much support that goal as well as the statement other than the new sentence.	92.0	94.0
201601	310	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	In particular, I support the addition of the word “symmetric,” because I have always felt that misses on either side of the inflation target are equally important.	92.0	94.0
201601	311	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	My qualms today are solely about preserving the forward-looking nature of inflation targeting in the United States.	92.0	94.0
201601	312	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	94.0
201601	313	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92.0	65.0
201601	314	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	92.0	65.0
201601	315	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	90.0
201601	316	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support the statement on longer-run goals and thank the subcommittee for providing language that clarifies that our inflation goal is symmetric.	92.0	90.0
201601	317	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’d like to believe that a symmetric goal was generally understood by the public, but there have been occasions when questions were raised about the Committee’s commitment to a symmetric goal, and this language removes any ambiguity.	92.0	90.0
201601	318	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Our original longer-run goals document was adopted in 2012.	92.0	90.0
201601	319	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	We have made only modest changes to that language, mostly of a clarifying nature.	92.0	90.0
201601	320	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think it would be useful next year, and subsequently every five years, to conduct a more comprehensive review of the longer- run goals.	92.0	90.0
201601	321	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	As President Mester discussed, the original document was a compromise to obtain agreement among participants on the Committee in 2012.	92.0	90.0
201601	322	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	We chose to focus on the PCE rather than the CPI measure of inflation; to express the goal in terms of total, not core, inflation; and to adopt a 2 percent inflation target.	92.0	90.0
201601	323	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Over the past five years, we have generally undershot our inflation target while being stuck at the lower bound.	92.0	90.0
201601	324	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	My view is that we should at least more fully consider the possibility that a 2 percent inflation target may unduly constrain monetary policy, especially in a world with low equilibrium real interest rates.	92.0	90.0
201601	325	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is clear to me that we have underestimated the cost of hitting, and the difficulties in leaving, the effective lower bound.	92.0	90.0
201601	326	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	We may very well not make any changes to what were in 2012 some difficult compromises, but I think a comprehensive review would be instructive even if we choose to make no substantive changes.	92.0	90.0
201601	327	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	90.0
201601	328	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92.0	65.0
201601	329	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	92.0	65.0
201601	330	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	91.0
201601	331	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I’d like to thank the communications subcommittee for their hard work in finding consensus.	92.0	91.0
201601	332	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	This is a welcome clarification of our price-stability objective.	92.0	91.0
201601	333	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Even though many of us have said in public that we view 2 percent as a symmetric target, I think adding the idea explicitly to the Committee’s formal statement of goals and strategy is an important communications tool to reinforce this concept with the public.	92.0	91.0
201601	334	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	The proposed language is succinct and clear in describing the sensible features of the symmetric objective.	92.0	91.0
201601	335	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I strongly support the proposed addition.	92.0	91.0
201601	336	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	91.0
201601	337	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92.0	65.0
201601	338	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	92.0	65.0
201601	339	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	81.0
201601	340	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I don’t see a pressing need to modify the consensus statement, but I don’t have strong objections to the changes being proposed.	92.0	81.0
201601	341	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I would reiterate a point I’ve made in the past, which is that to serve the purpose of the statement in anchoring expectations regarding the conduct of monetary policy, the statement should not be frequently amended.	92.0	81.0
201601	342	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It should be seen as a statement of timeless principles.	92.0	81.0
201601	343	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I think somebody used the word “constitutional.”	92.0	81.0
201601	344	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I think that’s right.	92.0	81.0
201601	345	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	In particular, we should avoid the appearance of opportunistic editing into driving policy expectations in one particular direction or another in the short run.	92.0	81.0
201601	346	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	My limited enthusiasm for this change stems in part from the extent to which this verges on appearing that way.	92.0	81.0
201601	347	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Another reason my enthusiasm is limited is that I don’t know of an economic model in which our implied objective function is symmetric, mathematically speaking, without taking a linear quadratic approximation, which essentially imposes symmetry, or without imposing symmetry a priori on a loss function that a policymaker is posited to have, as opposed to having the objective function derived from the utility function of the agency model.	92.0	81.0
201601	348	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Many of the reasons we view inflation above 2 percent as detrimental to the well-being of our country and our economy are distinct from the reasons we view inflation below 2 percent as detrimental to the economy, and there’s good reason to believe that inflation dynamics could be different above and below 2 percent.	92.0	81.0
201601	349	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	So I’m not a big fan of the notion that our objectives are, strictly speaking, symmetric.	92.0	81.0
201601	350	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I can live with the statement, however.	92.0	81.0
201601	351	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The sentence that’s inserted, by itself, doesn’t say our concerns are of equal magnitude on either side, and I prefer to think of the symmetry as a symmetry with respect to the sign of the concern on either side.	92.0	81.0
201601	352	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	But as I said, I have no objection to the changes being proposed.	92.0	81.0
201601	353	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92.0	65.0
201601	354	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	92.0	65.0
201601	355	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Chair Yellen.	92.0	110.0
201601	356	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m probably newer to this than just about anybody around the table, so I had a number of questions as we went through it.	92.0	110.0
201601	357	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I agree and support the language in the statement.	92.0	110.0
201601	358	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I do think it anchors expectations.	92.0	110.0
201601	359	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	For me, as someone maybe coming at this with fresh eyes, it does appear forward looking because the statement overall is forward looking.	92.0	110.0
201601	360	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I think the key word in the sentence that Jim was referring to is “concerned.”	92.0	110.0
201601	361	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It doesn’t mean we feel the need to act.	92.0	110.0
201601	362	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It means we’d be concerned.	92.0	110.0
201601	363	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And I’ll speak for myself—if inflation runs persistently below or above 2 percent, I am concerned, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t expect it to return to the 2 percent objective.	92.0	110.0
201601	364	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I think the statement adequately reflects my view.	92.0	110.0
201601	365	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	When I talked to Loretta about the timing of this, I had a question—maybe because I’m a little thinner-skinned as a new person here and sensitive to what’s going on out there in the world on inflation—about whether this will be misinterpreted and taken to mean something other than what we intend.	92.0	110.0
201601	366	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But I am convinced that this is simply clarifying and making more explicit what had been an implicit basic consensus around this table.	92.0	110.0
201601	367	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So I support this language.	92.0	110.0
201601	368	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	92.0	110.0
201601	369	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92.0	65.0
201601	370	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	92.0	65.0
201601	371	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	103.0
201601	372	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I, too, want to thank the subcommittee members and the staff for their work and for the inclusive manner in which they gathered input and considered various views.	92.0	103.0
201601	373	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I, too, think this document has served us well and, as President Lacker noted, changes to it require careful consideration.	92.0	103.0
201601	374	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I support the changes to this statement but would offer a brief observation about the proposed clarification.	92.0	103.0
201601	375	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	The choice of an inflation target represents our best judgment for fulfilling a congressional mandate to achieve price stability.	92.0	103.0
201601	376	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Such judgments necessitate not only a view on symmetry, but also on the magnitude of deviations.	92.0	103.0
201601	377	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	My own view is that small deviations from 2 percent may not warrant concern even if they are persistent.	92.0	103.0
201601	378	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	For example, it’s not clear to me that we should be terribly concerned if inflation were persistently 1.9 percent or 2.1 percent.	92.0	103.0
201601	379	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Such judgments, of course, must be made in the context of the economy’s performance and its outlook, as others have noted.	92.0	103.0
201601	380	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Deviations from 2 percent are less of a concern if inflation is expected to move toward 2 percent over time and inflation expectations remain well anchored.	92.0	103.0
201601	381	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Likewise, the cost of deviating from the 2 percent objective depends on what is happening with respect to employment and other economic conditions.	92.0	103.0
201601	382	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Inflation below 2 percent might be less of a concern than inflation above, for example, if unemployment is at or below the natural rate and the economy is growing at a sustainable pace.	92.0	103.0
201601	383	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	92.0	103.0
201601	384	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92.0	65.0
201601	385	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	92.0	65.0
201601	386	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	111.0
201601	387	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I support the changes to the statement, and I support the statement itself.	92.0	111.0
201601	388	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I have to say, though, that until I joined the Federal Reserve a few weeks ago, I always thought that 2 percent was a ceiling, not a target.	92.0	111.0
201601	389	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I heard what members said, but when I looked at the actions over the past few years, it appeared to me to be a ceiling.	92.0	111.0
201601	390	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I think that markets have short memories, maybe shorter memories than many people around this table, and I was guilty of that, too.	92.0	111.0
201601	391	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And so I support putting this in.	92.0	111.0
201601	392	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I think symmetry is sufficiently important to put in our constitutional document.	92.0	111.0
201601	393	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I would just encourage us all that we probably have to work even harder to communicate to markets why our actions are consistent with symmetry, especially in the near term, when we may well have to be raising rates when inflation may well be lower than target, and it is going to raise questions.	92.0	111.0
201601	394	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	92.0	111.0
201601	395	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Very good.	92.0	65.0
201601	396	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92.0	65.0
201601	397	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	92.0	65.0
201601	398	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	107.0
201601	399	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I also support the change in our statement on longer-run goals, and I thank the subcommittee for their work on this.	92.0	107.0
201601	400	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The modified language is very helpful—particularly at this time, when inflation expectations appear to be under some downward pressure—in clarifying that our inflation target is just that, not a ceiling but a target.	92.0	107.0
201601	401	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I also like the language underscoring that the Committee would be concerned about persistent one- sided misses.	92.0	107.0
201601	402	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	92.0	107.0
201601	403	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92.0	65.0
201601	404	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	92.0	65.0
201601	405	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	96.0
201601	406	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I support the revised statement.	92.0	96.0
201601	407	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The statement makes it clear that our loss function is symmetric with regard to the 2 percent goal, not necessarily in every particular case, but on an ex ante basis.	92.0	96.0
201601	408	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thus, 2 percent is not a ceiling, but a target.	92.0	96.0
201601	409	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, there is a more subtle question, that of how the statement will be read with respect to the so-called bygones issue.	92.0	96.0
201601	410	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Does “symmetric” mean we will want to make up for past shortfalls with offsetting or symmetric overruns?	92.0	96.0
201601	411	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think the statement speaks directly to that, and I don’t read the statement that way.	92.0	96.0
201601	412	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Symmetry to me is about the loss function, not a goal or a commitment to make up for past shortfalls.	92.0	96.0
201601	413	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	My own view is that we continue to run a bygones policy rather than a price-level targeting policy.	92.0	96.0
201601	414	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re not deliberately seeking to push inflation above 2 percent to offset for the years that we spent below 2 percent, but at the same time, we might have to run above 2 percent for a time if that’s what is required to push inflation expectations back up to our 2 percent objective.	92.0	96.0
201601	415	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And we would do that, of course, so we could better achieve our 2 percent objective over the longer run.	92.0	96.0
201601	416	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s that little subtlety that the statement doesn’t get at, and I think it’s just useful to restate this in terms of our still continuing to follow a bygones policy.	92.0	96.0
201601	417	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	92.0	65.0
201601	418	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me add my own support for the proposed changes to the statement.	92.0	65.0
201601	419	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I always viewed our inflation objective as symmetric and considered 2 percent to be our target and not a ceiling, and I think the new language makes this clear.	92.0	65.0
201601	420	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	As others have noted, it’s also consistent with previous communications and serves as a meaningful clarification of the FOMC’s views.	92.0	65.0
201601	421	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Now, I’d like to proceed, as we have in the past, to first take a straw poll of the views of the entire Committee so that the minutes can record the strength of support for the statement among all participants.	92.0	65.0
201601	422	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But we will also need a formal vote by the members of the Committee to adopt the statement.	92.0	65.0
201601	423	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So let me start with a straw poll, and I would ask any of the participants to raise your hand if you support the statement.	92.0	65.0
201601	424	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	92.0	65.0
201601	425	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Anyone opposed?	92.0	65.0
201601	426	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	92.0	65.0
201601	427	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92.0	65.0
201601	428	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	One opposed.	92.0	65.0
201601	429	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Now we’re going to take a formal vote of the members to adopt the statement.	92.0	65.0
201601	430	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So, members only, all in favor?	92.0	65.0
201601	431	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[Chorus of ayes]	92.0	65.0
201601	432	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And opposed?	92.0	65.0
201601	433	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[One aye]	92.0	65.0
201601	434	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92.0	65.0
201601	435	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	As Stan noted, we will release the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy tomorrow at the same time as our policy statement.	92.0	65.0
201601	436	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	This marks a departure from our typical practice of releasing the statement with the minutes.	92.0	65.0
201601	437	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	An advantage of our typical approach is that the minutes can provide important context and rationale for any changes and thereby reduce the possibility that the revisions will be misinterpreted by the public.	92.0	65.0
201601	438	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	This year, though, my monetary policy testimony before the Congress will occur earlier than normal and before the release of the minutes for this meeting.	92.0	65.0
201601	439	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Because the consensus statement appears in the Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, we need to accelerate its release.	92.0	65.0
201601	440	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But I do want to warn everyone that this timing will pose some communications challenges, particularly in light of the fact that we have the dissent that will be reported tomorrow.	92.0	65.0
201601	441	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Some of you may want to discuss the consensus statement in public, or you may be asked about it by members of the press.	92.0	65.0
201601	442	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So I just want to remind everybody that, as always, you are free to share your own views.	92.0	65.0
201601	443	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But let me emphasize that you should not characterize the views of other participants or the Committee as a whole as reflected in this meeting’s discussion or other confidential interactions, and that doing so would be a violation of our program for security of FOMC information and our policy on external communications.	92.0	65.0
201601	444	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And on this particular topic, I do think that staying in line with our policies may prove to be quite tricky, as discussing your view could very naturally lead to contrasting your view with the views of others.	92.0	65.0
201601	445	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So I mention this because I would like you to consider your communications on this topic very carefully.	92.0	65.0
201601	446	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	With that, let’s go on to our next item, item 7.	92.0	65.0
201601	447	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Madam Chair.	92.0	91.0
201601	448	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	92.0	65.0
201601	449	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I have a question.	92.0	91.0
201601	450	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	In listening to your commentary, that reminds me that normally, once the minutes are out, there’s a paragraph or more that describe Committee discussions.	92.0	91.0
201601	451	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, there will be.	92.0	65.0
201601	452	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Yes, that’s right, but part of the problem is, talking before the minutes come out means that you’re laying yourself bare.	92.0	91.0
201601	453	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Exactly.	92.0	65.0
201601	454	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	That’s right.	92.0	65.0
201601	455	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We will release this tomorrow.	92.0	65.0
201601	456	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard will have a sentence to explain his dissent.	92.0	65.0
201601	457	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	When the blackout period ends, everybody’s free to comment.	92.0	65.0
201601	458	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Especially with the dissent, many of you may be asked, “Well, what’s that about?	92.0	65.0
201601	459	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	What’s your view?” and so forth.	92.0	65.0
201601	460	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But the minutes won’t be out.	92.0	65.0
201601	461	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So it will be very natural, I think, to say things like, “Well, the Committee really thought X.	92.0	65.0
201601	462	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I agree with most people on the Committee.	92.0	65.0
201601	463	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We think this means blah, blah, blah.”	92.0	65.0
201601	464	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	So is it fair to say that after the minutes are out, it seems less likely that we’d be running afoul?	92.0	91.0
201601	465	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, I don’t think you’d be running afoul.	92.0	65.0
201601	466	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	You might say, “As the minutes explained, the Committee blah, blah, blah.”	92.0	65.0
201601	467	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And that’s fine.	92.0	65.0
201601	468	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	It’s in this period before the minutes come out that I think we’re at risk.	92.0	65.0
201601	469	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So I’m just highlighting that.	92.0	65.0
201601	470	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Good.	92.0	91.0
201601	471	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	92.0	91.0
201601	472	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	92.0	65.0
201601	473	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’ll ask a question that I’m sure is out of order, but I will ask anyhow, and I’ll direct this maybe to President Bullard and the group.	92.0	110.0
201601	474	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I take it that there’s been enough conversation back and forth by everyone else around the table indicating that we do mean this to be forward looking.	92.0	110.0
201601	475	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	That’s not enough to sway your thinking?	92.0	110.0
201601	476	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I normally wouldn’t ask, but I just want to ask because it strikes me that this coming out with a dissent is going to be very confusing to people.	92.0	110.0
201601	477	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I wouldn’t mind if we took a few extra minutes here, if you’re willing, to debate it or discuss it a little bit more.	92.0	110.0
201601	478	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It might be healthy—unless that’s going too far and it’s already been done.	92.0	110.0
201601	479	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I agree with you.	92.0	65.0
201601	480	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But we have had some conversations about this.	92.0	65.0
201601	481	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard?	92.0	65.0
201601	482	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think it’s done.	92.0	94.0
201601	483	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	You do?	92.0	110.0
201601	484	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Okay.	92.0	110.0
201601	485	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	You know, I do feel very strongly about this.	92.0	94.0
201601	486	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think it’s a constitutional document.	92.0	94.0
201601	487	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think we could have said that if inflation is expected to go back to target, the Committee would be comfortable.	92.0	94.0
201601	488	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I gave examples of when we’ve done that in the past.	92.0	94.0
201601	489	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I gave examples taken from our own communications.	92.0	94.0
201601	490	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So my concern is that what we’re doing is setting up, inside a constitutional document, a challenge for future communication because I think, for instance, our rhetoric about being comfortable that inflation is going to return to target is going to be at odds with what’s now in the longer-run statement, which says that we’re uncomfortable if inflation has been below target persistently for a while.	92.0	94.0
201601	491	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So I’m trying to highlight this.	92.0	94.0
201601	492	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think what will happen is that, as you all have done here at the meeting, you’ll talk a lot about how you’re interpreting the phrase as forward looking, which is the way I think it needs to be interpreted.	92.0	94.0
201601	493	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	92.0	65.0
201601	494	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’d just like to make two statements.	92.0	108.0
201601	495	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	One is that “were running” is not the same as “had run,” and if the statement had said we would be concerned if inflation “had run” below 2 percent, then we would clearly be backward looking.	92.0	108.0
201601	496	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We were trying to get in an element that said past, present, and future, and that was where “were running” came from.	92.0	108.0
201601	497	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And as others have emphasized, and as I said in my opening statement, the fact that we are concerned does not imply a particular course of action, and so I applaud President Kaplan’s initiative, and I would have been very happy if it had led to unanimity.	92.0	108.0
201601	498	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The second thing I’d like to say is that I’d like to thank the three other members of the communications subcommittee who spoke, in the order of John Williams, Loretta Mester, and Jay Powell.	92.0	108.0
201601	499	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	This was a fairly long and intensive process.	92.0	108.0
201601	500	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I was sustained throughout by the opening remark by one of the members of the subcommittee:  “You should know,” she said [laughter], “that there is a body buried under every word in this statement.”	92.0	108.0
201601	501	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And I can testify that there are about 13 more bodies buried under there now.	92.0	108.0
201601	502	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And, finally, I would like to thank the members of the Committee, including Jim Bullard, for the fact that the discussion on how to modify this statement was conducted in a thoroughly collegial way.	92.0	108.0
201601	503	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	108.0
201601	504	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	92.0	65.0
201601	505	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s then move along to our next item, item 7, which is “Financial Developments and Open Market Operations,” and I’d like to ask Simon to deliver the first part of the Desk briefing.	61.0	65.0
201601	506	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201601	507	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I will begin by discussing global financial market developments and then Lorie will review money markets and operational matters.	61.0	999.0
201601	508	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	As highlighted in the Desk’s post-liftoff briefings, global financial markets were little changed in the two weeks following the December FOMC meeting.	61.0	999.0
201601	509	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The calm in markets vanished at the turn of the year, and risk assets have had their worst January since 2009.	61.0	999.0
201601	510	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Market participants generally point to three somewhat related factors underpinning the selloff:  first, concerns over possible economic and financial instability in China; second, the continued declines in oil and other commodity prices; and, third, a change in the perception of support for risk assets from G-3 central banks.	61.0	999.0
201601	511	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The top-left panel of your first exhibit shows how significant the selloff in global risk assets has been.	61.0	999.0
201601	512	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The S&P 500 declined 7 percent, equity indexes in other countries fell as much as 18 percent, and high-yield corporate credit spreads in the United States widened 90 basis points to a new post-crisis high of 750 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201601	513	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	While the widening in credit spreads was sharpest for energy-sector firms, ex-energy spreads widened by 77 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201601	514	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Nellie will discuss the financial stability implications of the rise in spreads in her briefing.	61.0	999.0
201601	515	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The changes in asset prices and yields since the start of the year are remarkably similar to what followed the surprise renminbi devaluation in August of last year, as shown by the comparison of the two episodes in the top-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201601	516	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Market participants viewed unpredictable and inconsistent management of the Chinese currency as a key factor behind both episodes, which renewed questions about the severity of the economic growth slowdown in China and the ability of Chinese authorities to successfully address it.	61.0	999.0
201601	517	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	In both instances, the market-implied federal funds rate path shifted lower as global equity prices and emerging market asset prices declined.	61.0	999.0
201601	518	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Meanwhile, safe-haven currencies like the yen appreciated, and long-dated nominal Treasury yields declined, led by large declines in TIPS-implied breakeven rates.	61.0	999.0
201601	519	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-left panel, the on- and offshore renminbi have depreciated against the US dollar since the August 2015 devaluation.	61.0	999.0
201601	520	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The depreciation trajectory has been particularly volatile since the turn of the year, as Chinese officials appeared for a few days to have shifted their FX policy to target a trade-weighted renminbi basket as opposed to a dollar–renminbi exchange rate.	61.0	999.0
201601	521	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Both the surprise devaluation on August 11 and the erratic renminbi fixings at the start of 2016 have had the effect of depreciating the Chinese currency faster than some market participants had expected.	61.0	999.0
201601	522	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	That is increasing the demand to diversify from RMB-denominated assets into US dollar–linked assets and the urgency of paying down US dollar obligations.	61.0	999.0
201601	523	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Chinese authorities have reacted by increasing capital controls, severely limiting liquidity in the offshore RMB market and ramping up intervention to restore stability in the RMB–dollar exchange rate.	61.0	999.0
201601	524	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The volatility in the renminbi, the pace of depreciation since SDR inclusion was announced, and the recent spike in offshore interbank renminbi rates in Hong Kong have led many dealers to expect further depreciation to above 7 RMB per dollar this year.	61.0	999.0
201601	525	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	But perhaps more significantly, an increasing number of market participants are expecting a large, and potentially abrupt, depreciation in the RMB–dollar exchange rate in order to reset expectations and stem capital outflows.	61.0	999.0
201601	526	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Of course, Chinese authorities may want to avoid such an outcome and can instead attempt to push against depreciation expectations by intervening in foreign exchange markets and re-pegging to the US dollar.	61.0	999.0
201601	527	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-right panel, official December reserve data showed a record monthly decline of $108 billion, suggesting a historic pace of PBOC reserve sales to stem capital outflows and smooth the pace of currency depreciation.	61.0	999.0
201601	528	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Many speculate that reserve sales have accelerated so far in 2016 as the PBOC apparently re-pegged to the dollar in the past week or so.	61.0	999.0
201601	529	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Developments in China, along with the persistent declines in oil prices that I will discuss in a moment, have intensified concerns about financial fragilities across the globe.	61.0	999.0
201601	530	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Indeed, investors have begun to question the sustainability of two long- standing dollar pegs—the Hong Kong dollar and the Saudi riyal.	61.0	999.0
201601	531	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The top section of the bottom-left panel shows that the Hong Kong dollar depreciated significantly over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201601	532	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The bottom section of the panel shows an uptick in realized volatility in the Saudi riyal–US dollar exchange rate.	61.0	999.0
201601	533	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	While contacts believe the likelihood that the Saudi or Hong Kong pegs will be adjusted or abandoned is low because of large central bank dollar reserves, market speculation over this is a new development, and, if either materialized, it could generate additional market spillovers.	61.0	999.0
201601	534	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Concerns about the potential for a rapid deceleration in Chinese demand, which Steve will discuss further in his briefing, contributed to significant declines in the prices of oil and other commodities over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201601	535	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	However, the balance between demand and supply factors continues to be a debated issue, with oil market participants generally focusing on additional supply coming on line from Iran as the key driver over the period.	61.0	999.0
201601	536	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-right panel, the Bloomberg metals index has declined roughly 5 percent year-to-date, while the front-month Brent crude futures contract has declined about 15 percent to $30 per barrel; both measures fell below their crisis lows, the dashed lines.	61.0	999.0
201601	537	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The declines in commodity prices—in particular, in oil—had knock-on effects across markets.	61.0	999.0
201601	538	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Commodity-linked currencies depreciated considerably, as shown in the top-left panel of your next exhibit.	61.0	999.0
201601	539	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Their depreciation, along with the weakening renminbi, contributed to an appreciation of the trade-weighted dollar of nearly 2 percent since the start of the year, with many emerging market countries using FX intervention to smooth depreciation and maintain market functioning.	61.0	999.0
201601	540	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Meanwhile, global measures of inflation compensation, particularly in the euro area and United States, declined notably over the intermeeting period, as shown in the top-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201601	541	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The US five-year, five-year inflation swap rate—shown in light blue—is currently around 1.9 percent, while the euro-area inflation swap rate—the dark blue line—is at 1.6 percent, both only slightly above their 10-year lows.	61.0	999.0
201601	542	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The Board staff’s measure of five-year, five-year inflation compensation derived from TIPS fell below 1.5 percent over the period.	61.0	999.0
201601	543	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	A third factor underlying recent market turbulence, according to some market participants, is that the so-called G-3 central bank put, which, in their view, has provided support for global risk assets since the crisis, is now further out of the money.	61.0	999.0
201601	544	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	In addition to FOMC liftoff, these market participants point to the disappointment of the December ECB meeting and a belief that the BOJ might be at the feasible limit of monetary policy at the lower bound.	61.0	999.0
201601	545	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	However, market-implied policy rate paths in most of the developed world shifted lower over the period, shown in the middle-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201601	546	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Late in the period, communications by ECB President Draghi served to increase expectations of further accommodation coming from the ECB and produced a rally in global risk assets.	61.0	999.0
201601	547	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	With regard to near-term FOMC policy expectations, as shown in the middle-right panel, the implied probability of a 25-basis-point rate hike occurring by the March FOMC meeting has declined to roughly 1 in 4 from even odds at the beginning of the year.	61.0	999.0
201601	548	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	There is a very small probability placed on a January hike, and the market is pricing in only one increase to the target range over all of 2016, down from roughly two hikes at the start of the year.	61.0	999.0
201601	549	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Current market pricing of near-term policy is broadly consistent with the results of the Desk’s most recent surveys.	61.0	999.0
201601	550	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Nearly all survey respondents assign a near-zero probability to an increase in the target range occurring at this meeting, and the average perceived probability of a rate increase at the March meeting is around 30 percent.	61.0	999.0
201601	551	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	In our surveys, we redesigned questions related to the path of the federal funds rate with the goal of better understanding the differences across survey modal and mean paths and market pricing.	61.0	999.0
201601	552	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The bottom-left panel presents more detailed information on the average probability respondents attach to different outcomes for the direction and timing of the Committee’s next policy rate action, along with the implied expectations for the target rate at the end of 2016 conditional on these actions.	61.0	999.0
201601	553	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the leftmost column, respondents on average attach a 72 percent probability to the Committee’s next policy action this year being a rate increase, a 9 percent probability to the next action being a rate decrease, and a 19 percent probability to there being no change in the target range this year.	61.0	999.0
201601	554	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the rightmost column of the panel, conditional on the FOMC’s next policy action in 2016 being an increase in the policy rate at the January or March meeting, respondents’ average expectation for the target rate at year-end 2016 is 98 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201601	555	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Conditional on the next action being a rate hike in April or later, the expectation for the year-end 2016 target rate is a little lower, at 90 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201601	556	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Each of these outcomes is equivalent to approximately two further 25-basis-point rate hikes this year.	61.0	999.0
201601	557	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Taking into account the possibilities of the next move being a decrease in the policy rate or no change in 2016 produces an unconditional expectation for the year- end 2016 rate of 77 basis points—the first red dot in the bottom-right panel—only about 10 basis points above the market-implied rate.	61.0	999.0
201601	558	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Note that this unconditional expectation is constructed by assuming the effective lower bound is 13 basis points, which ignores the views of the roughly 25 percent of survey respondents who now believe the lower bound for the target federal funds rate is below 0 to 25 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201601	559	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	To measure policy rate expectations further out, we asked respondents to consider two conditioning events:  no return to the lower bound over the next three years versus a return to the lower bound sometime over the next three years.	61.0	999.0
201601	560	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	These conditioning events were then used to elicit probability distributions regarding federal funds rates at the end of 2017 and 2018.	61.0	999.0
201601	561	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Respondents across the surveys assigned an average probability of 30 percent to a return to the effective lower bound at some point during the next three years.	61.0	999.0
201601	562	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Conditional on not returning to the lower bound, the expected path was below the modal path in 2017 and 2018, suggesting that even in this scenario, market participants perceive downside risks to their modal federal funds rate forecasts.	61.0	999.0
201601	563	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Combining these conditional expectations with the means associated with the scenario of a return to the effective lower bound gives the unconditional means shown by the red diamonds for 2017 and 2018 in the bottom-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201601	564	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	It is striking how close these unconditional means are to the market-implied path and how far they are from the modal path.	61.0	999.0
201601	565	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	We also obtain economic forecasts and the probabilities of a US recession and global recession given by the dealers.	61.0	999.0
201601	566	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	These forecasts and probabilities are broadly similar to the Board staff forecast and do not appear to justify, in a standard Taylor rule–type approach, the large gap between the modal and mean expected rate paths.	61.0	999.0
201601	567	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Of course, a standard Taylor rule approach doesn’t capture some of the most salient features of the current global situation:  most advanced-economy central banks at or near the lower bound; the second-largest economy in the world going through a difficult economic transition while it haltingly tries to liberalize its financial markets; unprecedented falls in commodity prices; and, finally, a large increase in the value of the global reserve currency.	61.0	999.0
201601	568	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	An alternative explanation is that markets are pricing in outcomes that forecasters don’t expect; as you know, forecasters are notoriously bad at predicting recessions.	61.0	999.0
201601	569	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	In his briefing, Thomas will discuss the probability of a recession in the next six months implied by corporate credit markets using simple statistical models.	61.0	999.0
201601	570	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	We would be happy to take questions.	61.0	999.0
201601	571	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for Simon?	62.0	65.0
201601	572	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	May I ask a question, Madam Chair?	62.0	108.0
201601	573	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	62.0	65.0
201601	574	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	What do you expect us to do with these facts?	62.0	108.0
201601	575	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I view our job as trying to report on what’s happened in markets and the expectations that market participants have.	62.0	999.0
201601	576	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	One of the quandaries we had for some time was that there was quite a big difference between the market path and some of the expectations we were getting back from the people that we surveyed.	62.0	999.0
201601	577	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	So one of the things we did was, we tried to change our questions to give them events to think about.	62.0	999.0
201601	578	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	And that was to try to get at the notion we had had in our heads that some of the reasons that the market path looks different from the modal path or some of the other numbers we get back from them had something to do with the effective lower bound.	62.0	999.0
201601	579	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	And what we found by changing the questions is that it was much easier to reconcile the market pricing with the expectations regarding the federal funds rate path that market participants have, but it leaves a big gap to try to explain how their modal path and the economic forecast that they show could support those expectations regarding the federal funds rate.	62.0	999.0
201601	580	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	And, in my view, which I expressed, it’s something more to do with the rest of the world.	62.0	999.0
201601	581	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The other possibility is that markets have sensed a weakening that we can’t see in the data, and that’s in the financial market, and they’re basically giving a signal that US growth will be much weaker in the first half of the year.	62.0	999.0
201601	582	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	62.0	108.0
201601	583	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’ll stop there.	62.0	108.0
201601	584	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	You’re welcome to continue.	62.0	65.0
201601	585	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, yes.	62.0	108.0
201601	586	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think we all heard the earlier statement that more or less said that we’d better get on with the discussion.	62.0	108.0
201601	587	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I see.	62.0	65.0
201601	588	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So I’m doing this in that spirit.	62.0	108.0
201601	589	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201601	590	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We certainly have time for a little bit more conversation.	62.0	65.0
201601	591	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I did point out to people that we were starting late and so would need to be perhaps a little more concise than usual, but I did not mean to stifle discussion.	62.0	65.0
201601	592	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So, please, if you want to follow up, continue.	62.0	65.0
201601	593	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The concern I have is that as you draw them out, you’re guiding them.	62.0	108.0
201601	594	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I have a slightly uneasy feeling that we’re getting these torrents of information about what the market participants believe, and we’re not getting torrents about what the staff believes, although we have the very valuable Tealbooks to use.	62.0	108.0
201601	595	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And I don’t know whether it’s healthy that we concentrate our briefings on what the markets are telling us rather than what we believe economic forces are pushing us to.	62.0	108.0
201601	596	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	That’s not to ask you not to present this, but it’s to ask whether the deeper and deeper and the more complicated questionnaires you’re preparing are helping us do what we need to do in making our decisions.	62.0	108.0
201601	597	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Agreed.	62.0	999.0
201601	598	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	As you look at the data, this is just one point for you to look at, and you have a lot of other information you can bring to bear on your decisions.	62.0	999.0
201601	599	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The only thing I’d say is, the history of markets forecasting these turning points is a little bit better than forecasters just looking at the backward-looking data that they have.	62.0	999.0
201601	600	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Yes, well, you know, the famous Samuelson statement—but I was told by somebody in the Treasury that it’s not that the markets forecast 9 of the past 5 recessions, it’s that they forecast 20 of the past 8.	62.0	108.0
201601	601	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	That is probably about right, and the staff forecast has done 0 of the past 9.	62.0	999.0
201601	602	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	[Laughter]	62.0	999.0
201601	603	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	So you can make a choice.	62.0	999.0
201601	604	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	62.0	65.0
201601	605	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Maybe just to clarify in my own mind some of the information that is in this exhibit 2, bottom-right panel, could one of the things that has been going on—obviously, I know you said this in different ways—be that because, internationally, central banks are experimenting with negative rates, market participants are looking out there, and they are really thinking, “Oh, if something bad happened, the Committee here would go negative, and, therefore, we are going to lower the whole expected policy rate path.”	62.0	94.0
201601	606	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Is that what you are saying?	62.0	94.0
201601	607	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	No.	62.0	999.0
201601	608	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	If you take out the 12 responses that have negative rates or push them to 13 basis points, you get an increase of 3 basis points in the 2017 and 2018 dots.	62.0	999.0
201601	609	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	So that is not what I am saying.	62.0	999.0
201601	610	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The 30 percent probability of returning to the effective lower bound is not that different from the previous probability we had over two years.	62.0	999.0
201601	611	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	It is over three years.	62.0	999.0
201601	612	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The thing I am trying to emphasize is that even if we take the expected path, which doesn’t return to the lower bound, they still see downside risks relative to their modal forecast.	62.0	999.0
201601	613	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	And that’s hard to understand.	62.0	999.0
201601	614	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	It could be the neutral rate.	62.0	999.0
201601	615	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	It could be these global forces and a lot of other things that are driving it.	62.0	999.0
201601	616	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	But it’s data driven.	62.0	999.0
201601	617	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I was surprised to see how much of what was a big gap we could reconcile by changing the questions.	62.0	999.0
201601	618	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	And they didn’t get to see how their answers added up.	62.0	999.0
201601	619	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Yes, okay.	62.0	94.0
201601	620	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	62.0	65.0
201601	621	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	91.0
201601	622	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I admit I am still digesting the analysis you just gave us, but I do think it’s very useful to have you try to explain what the market pricing is telling us.	62.0	91.0
201601	623	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	For example, here is a different one.	62.0	91.0
201601	624	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	On exhibit 2, the top right, you display the five- year, five-year inflation swap rates and how they have taken another leg down.	62.0	91.0
201601	625	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	And I think you mentioned that the Board of Governors’ assessment of this is below 1½ percent.	62.0	91.0
201601	626	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	It is extremely low.	62.0	91.0
201601	627	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Now, we’ve talked about this in the past, and I have been troubled by the fact that we kind of dismissed these movements, especially when they are associated with another leg down in the price of oil:  Well, there is just a high correlation between oil going down and all the volatility, and so this is really something else about market functioning.	62.0	91.0
201601	628	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	But I don’t know what we know about that.	62.0	91.0
201601	629	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	That’s a story, but I wonder about it.	62.0	91.0
201601	630	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	And analysis like what you are talking about might shed light on whether markets actually believe that the FOMC is going to be unable to hit its 2 percent inflation objective in a world in which world demand is lower, oil supplies are higher, the price of energy is going down, prices of commodities are going down, and there is a lower equilibrium real interest rate.	62.0	91.0
201601	631	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I think it is extremely useful for your team to provide some commentary, at least, as to how market participants are thinking about that.	62.0	91.0
201601	632	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	And I tend to think that these legs down are somewhat meaningful.	62.0	91.0
201601	633	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	There’s definitely evidence that, when risk assets decline, the correlation that breakeven inflation has with oil goes up.	62.0	999.0
201601	634	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	And, remember, it is hard for us to explain why inflation from 2020 to 2024 should be related to the oil price today.	62.0	999.0
201601	635	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	We don’t have a good explanation for that.	62.0	999.0
201601	636	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	It is starting to feed on itself, though, because everyone has seen that.	62.0	999.0
201601	637	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	So the trades they are putting on are sort of based on that.	62.0	999.0
201601	638	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	And it is not just in the United States; you see it in Europe and other parts of the world.	62.0	999.0
201601	639	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	We were doing 30-minute correlations through the trade index, and you can see them really moving up across asset classes.	62.0	999.0
201601	640	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	We don’t have a good explanation for that, and it could be something to do with how these assets are traded in the short run.	62.0	999.0
201601	641	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	But if you look over a reasonable period of time, which is now six weeks, these are pretty large falls in risk assets as well as a large decline in the inflation compensation measures we have.	62.0	999.0
201601	642	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	And, historically, we have looked to measures like this, for example when we were simply looking at long-term Treasury rates quite a long time ago and saying, “They moved up, it must be inflationary pressures.”	62.0	91.0
201601	643	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	These are part of the toolbox that we keep pointing to, and dismissing the movements when they are inconvenient but then bringing them back later on when they are moving up.	62.0	91.0
201601	644	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I think we need a better handle on that.	62.0	91.0
201601	645	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	And I rely on your analysis to help us with that.	62.0	91.0
201601	646	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I appreciate that.	62.0	91.0
201601	647	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I think the Board staff has also done a lot of good work on it.	62.0	999.0
201601	648	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Yes.	62.0	91.0
201601	649	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	62.0	91.0
201601	650	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions?	62.0	65.0
201601	651	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62.0	65.0
201601	652	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201601	653	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think Lorie is going to continue now with the second part of the Desk briefing.	61.0	65.0
201601	654	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201601	655	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	I will begin with exhibit 3.	61.0	999.0
201601	656	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Following the Committee’s decision to increase the target for the federal funds rate, overnight rates moved smoothly into the new target range.	61.0	999.0
201601	657	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel, overnight secured and unsecured rates shifted up, and, with the exception of year-end, the effective federal funds rate printed between 35 and 38 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201601	658	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	The dispersion of rates and volume of trading in overnight markets were similar to those pre-liftoff, suggesting that market participants did not materially alter their behavior in response to the new level of rates.	61.0	999.0
201601	659	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-right panel, trading volumes in overnight markets were little changed following liftoff.	61.0	999.0
201601	660	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Further, as shown in your middle-left panel, the distribution of rates on federal funds transactions shifted higher, as illustrated by the movement from the dark blue to the light blue line.	61.0	999.0
201601	661	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Rates on triparty repo transactions, not shown, exhibited a similar shift though fell modestly lower within the target range than in the pre-liftoff period, in part reflecting the fact that the ON RRP rate increased by only 20 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201601	662	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Over year-end, the changes in money market rates were largely consistent with prior quarter-end dates, though the magnitude of the decline in the effective federal funds rate on the 31st was relatively large, printing below the target range at 20 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201601	663	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	As you can see in the red line of the middle-left panel, roughly 70 percent of lending in federal funds—nearly all of which was done by the FHLBs—took place below the ON RRP rate, despite nearly all FHLBs having access to the ON RRP.	61.0	999.0
201601	664	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	This lending was driven by two main factors:  first, a preference for a relatively early-in-the-day return of investments, which can be achieved in the federal funds market but not in triparty repo, through which our ON RRP operations are conducted; and, second, reduced demand by foreign banks on year-end.	61.0	999.0
201601	665	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	This lower demand leaves FHLBs with a smaller set of counterparties to lend to for early return of investments on period-end dates.	61.0	999.0
201601	666	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	We saw a comparable amount of trading activity below the ON RRP offering rate on some quarter-ends during the testing period.	61.0	999.0
201601	667	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	FHLBs appeared willing to lend at rates further below the ON RRP rate this year-end though, perhaps reflecting the movement away from the effective lower bound.	61.0	999.0
201601	668	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Overall, however, the year-end decline in the effective federal funds rate was transitory, and the level of the effective rate and the distribution of federal funds activity normalized quickly.	61.0	999.0
201601	669	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Of note, the volume-weighted median federal funds rate was 15 basis points on year-end, 5 basis points lower than the volume-weighted mean, as indicated by the arrows in the middle-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201601	670	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Although the volume- weighted mean and median are virtually the same on most days, a greater dispersion on period-ends between the level at which a majority of trading volume occurs and the other trades can cause the median to fall below the mean.	61.0	999.0
201601	671	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	This effect was apparent over the year-end and may have been amplified by movement away from the lower bound, suggesting that the effective rate may print further below the target range on future month- or quarter-ends once the calculation methodology is switched to the weighted median.	61.0	999.0
201601	672	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	As noted in the Desk’s January 6 public statement, the staff plans to change the underlying data source and the calculation method for the effective federal funds rate to the volume-weighted median and begin publishing the new Overnight Bank Funding Rate on March 2.	61.0	999.0
201601	673	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the bottom-left panel, term money market rates shifted upward in the run-up to the December FOMC meeting, roughly coincident with the increase in market-implied probabilities regarding liftoff depicted in the dashed line, and in a manner consistent with previous tightening episodes.	61.0	999.0
201601	674	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Of note, Treasury bill rates out to three months, shown in light blue, have largely traded below the ON RRP rate, reflecting strong demand for safe, liquid assets by a variety of investor types, most of whom do not have access to RRPs with the Federal Reserve.	61.0	999.0
201601	675	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	With regard to our operations, ON RRP take-up on the day after the December meeting was little changed from the previous day, and thereafter the levels of private market rates and calendar effects appeared to influence take-up in a similar fashion as before liftoff, as shown in the bottom-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201601	676	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Dynamics at the counterparty level were also largely consistent with the pre-liftoff experience, with no counterparty reaching the $30 billion individual cap.	61.0	999.0
201601	677	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	On the year-end date, ON RRP take-up rose to $475 billion, the highest level to date but generally in line with total RRP take-up on previous quarter-ends.	61.0	999.0
201601	678	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Take-up at the three year-end term RRP operations was minimal, as expected, as these were offered at no premium over ON RRPs and the $2 trillion aggregate cap assured participants that their year-end ON RRP bids would be fully allotted.	61.0	999.0
201601	679	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Federal Reserve RRPs with foreign official institutions, shown in the gray area of the same panel, also reached a record level.	61.0	999.0
201601	680	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	This was largely expected, being a reflection of year-end dynamics and the ongoing planned increases in foreign RP pool investments by one customer.	61.0	999.0
201601	681	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Of note, this large planned increase is nearly complete.	61.0	999.0
201601	682	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Looking forward, the Committee will need to decide when and under what conditions it will be appropriate to reduce the capacity in the ON RRP facility, which Gretchen will discuss in the next briefing.	61.0	999.0
201601	683	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel of your last exhibit, the Desk’s January policy surveys indicate that an aggregate cap is not expected to be reintroduced for another 11 months, with the median respondent expecting an initial reduction in the cap to a level of $500 billion.	61.0	999.0
201601	684	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-right panel, the median expectations regarding ON RRP usage on non-quarter-end days 6 months forward and 12 months forward, the light blue series, are $225 billion and $250 billion, respectively, down from previous surveys but higher than the current post-liftoff, ex-year-end average of $132 billion.	61.0	999.0
201601	685	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Several survey respondents noted expectations that money market fund reforms may exert further downward pressure on repo and bill rates, which could feed through to increased ON RRP usage.	61.0	999.0
201601	686	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	In sum, while our observations of the post-liftoff money market environment are limited, they provide us with some preliminary insights about the operating framework, summarized in the middle-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201601	687	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	The first dimension to assess is control:  Are we able to move the effective federal funds rate in the target range the Committee has set out?	61.0	999.0
201601	688	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	As noted in the assessment memo of post-liftoff interest rate control, although uncertainty remains, the staff assesses the framework to be working well in this regard.	61.0	999.0
201601	689	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown earlier in panels 13 and 16, the framework has been effective in establishing a floor on the effective federal funds rate and supported an appropriate upward move in other money market rates.	61.0	999.0
201601	690	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	It is hard to distinguish the relative weights between IOER and ON RRP in obtaining this control, but we have evidence of activity being driven by both tools.	61.0	999.0
201601	691	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	IOER clearly provides a substantial upward pull on rates, particularly in the federal funds and Eurodollar markets, while the ON RRP certainly plays an important role in supporting rates in the repo market and increases the competition banks face in their trading with nonbank counterparties.	61.0	999.0
201601	692	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	It is also hard to know how much of the ON RRP’s role in this enhanced competition to attribute to the high cap.	61.0	999.0
201601	693	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	One indication the high cap may be playing an important role is that unsecured rates appear to have settled about where they were before liftoff, even though one might have expected the widening in the IOER−ON RRP spread and the lower support from the ELB to result in a greater downward shift.	61.0	999.0
201601	694	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Anecdotally, some market participants have suggested that the increase in the cap over its pre-liftoff value bolstered confidence that there would be ample ON RRP headroom over the medium term, which increased their bargaining power.	61.0	999.0
201601	695	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	This argument seems reasonable, but we are uncertain about how high a cap is needed to provide this confidence.	61.0	999.0
201601	696	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Second, were we able to achieve this outcome without materially affecting the organization of financial markets?	61.0	999.0
201601	697	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	So far, despite the high cap, there has been little increase in ON RRP take-up, as noted on panel 18, either in aggregate or at the counterparty level, and little change in overall money market volumes.	61.0	999.0
201601	698	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	This suggests that we have succeeded, at least so far, in increasing interest rates without unintended effects on the structure of financial intermediation.	61.0	999.0
201601	699	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	In part, the success along this dimension can be attributed to our ability to raise interest rates across a range of money markets and, in particular, the absence of pronounced shifts in relative rates across money markets.	61.0	999.0
201601	700	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	In the absence of such shifts, investors have little incentive to make fundamental changes to their lending relationships.	61.0	999.0
201601	701	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Third, has liftoff had any unintended consequences to consider, particularly with regard to financial stability?	61.0	999.0
201601	702	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Although there is little to say on this at high frequency, it is perhaps notable that amid the recent market volatility and risk aversion, there has been no surge in ON RRP demand.	61.0	999.0
201601	703	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Looking ahead, market participants anticipate that the operating framework will continue to provide effective control, with nearly one-for-one pass-through of the next tightening into the effective federal funds rate.	61.0	999.0
201601	704	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	The Desk survey respondents expect that this control will be facilitated by ample ON RRP headroom and that ON RRP take-up might grow because of changes in the structure of money market rates and spreads prompted by bank and money fund regulatory developments.	61.0	999.0
201601	705	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Although it’s hard to be sure about the magnitude and timing of the effect of those regulatory developments on ON RRP demand, the tenor of those survey expectations also seems reasonable.	61.0	999.0
201601	706	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	With regard to other operational matters, market focus on the SOMA’s Treasury reinvestments has increased recently due to the large volume of Treasury maturities scheduled in 2016, as shown in the middle-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201601	707	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	These maturities will begin in the upcoming intermeeting period, with roughly $37 billion of expected reinvestments.	61.0	999.0
201601	708	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	In line with the current policy, the Desk plans to roll over these maturities proportionally across securities being auctioned on the basis of the Treasury’s announced offering amounts.	61.0	999.0
201601	709	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	The bottom-left panel shows the effect of these planned reinvestments on the evolution of the interest rate risk of the SOMA Treasury portfolio, as measured in 10-year equivalent terms, a unit that captures both the par dollar amount and duration of securities holdings.	61.0	999.0
201601	710	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Since the FOMC ceased new purchases of securities, the par size of the Treasury securities portfolio has remained steady at roughly $2.5 trillion.	61.0	999.0
201601	711	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Ten-year equivalents, however, have declined as securities in the portfolio moved closer to maturity and their duration decreased.	61.0	999.0
201601	712	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	For the period ahead, staff projections, shown in the light blue portion, suggest the decline in 10-year equivalents will continue as the portfolio ages further, although the decline is projected to slow should reinvestment of these large Treasury maturities proceed.	61.0	999.0
201601	713	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Finally, in the memo on small-value tests for operational readiness circulated to the Committee, we provided advance notice of all small-value exercises that the Desk currently plans to conduct in 2016.	61.0	999.0
201601	714	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	This was intended to provide a consolidated set of information and reduce the number of memos circulated each meeting.	61.0	999.0
201601	715	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	From now on, we will provide updates on the results of any small-value exercises from the previous period and inform you of the upcoming exercises.	61.0	999.0
201601	716	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Our plans for the next intermeeting period, summarized in the final panel, include small-value tests for Treasury outright purchases, euro repos, and dollar liquidity swaps.	61.0	999.0
201601	717	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Additionally, the Federal Reserve announced plans last year to conduct quarterly TDF tests to maintain operational readiness.	61.0	999.0
201601	718	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	The staff recommends conducting a test operation for one week each quarter over the remainder of 2016—the next one is scheduled for February—with the parameters for each operation mirroring those for the December operation.	61.0	999.0
201601	719	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you, and I’d be happy to take any questions.	61.0	999.0
201601	720	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	62.0	65.0
201601	721	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I have a question, Lorie, on slide 19.	62.0	96.0
201601	722	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	You focused on the average, but there’s a lot of dispersion in both of those charts, in terms of both timing and level.	62.0	96.0
201601	723	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Is that a problem?	62.0	96.0
201601	724	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Are people sort of clamoring for more guidance on when we are going to reduce the cap or what the level will be?	62.0	96.0
201601	725	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Or is that something that is not a market focus at all?	62.0	96.0
201601	726	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The reason why I am raising this, obviously, is that this is relevant to the discussion that we are going to have in a few minutes.	62.0	96.0
201601	727	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	In most of the discussions we had this round, it wasn’t a topic that came up because they were much more focused on the volatility that we are seeing in financial markets, and they assumed that there was some time for this decision to be made.	62.0	999.0
201601	728	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	So we asked a lot about their framework and how things were trading in money markets.	62.0	999.0
201601	729	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	But this wasn’t at the top of their minds.	62.0	999.0
201601	730	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So they’re not expecting anything from us.	62.0	96.0
201601	731	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	You can see there are some market participants who expect the timing to be soon, but I don’t think it was a big focus.	62.0	999.0
201601	732	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	The write-ups and commentary that were circulated certainly mentioned it as a possibility of being discussed with the minutes this round.	62.0	999.0
201601	733	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	But, again, there were a lot of other issues in financial markets that dominated the discussion.	62.0	999.0
201601	734	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Okay.	62.0	96.0
201601	735	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	62.0	96.0
201601	736	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions for Lorie?	62.0	65.0
201601	737	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62.0	65.0
201601	738	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	61.0	65.0
201601	739	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, Gretchen Weinbach is going to provide us some comments to guide our discussion of the cap and the timing concerning it.	61.0	65.0
201601	740	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201601	741	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	I will be referring to the exhibits titled “Reducing Aggregate Capacity of the ON RRP Facility” as I highlight key themes in the recent staff memo on this topic.	61.0	999.0
201601	742	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	As Simon and Lorie noted, the implementation of December’s increase in the target range for the federal funds rate went smoothly.	61.0	999.0
201601	743	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	In view of the Committee’s stated expectation that it will be appropriate to reduce the facility’s capacity “fairly soon” after the start of policy firming, you may want to consider when and how to reintroduce an aggregate cap on the facility.	61.0	999.0
201601	744	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	As noted in the first exhibit, our experience with policy implementation to date, both before and after liftoff, leaves us with two key takeaways that are relevant for calibrating the capacity of the ON RRP facility.	61.0	999.0
201601	745	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	First, market confidence that the facility will have sufficient headroom over time seems to be important for interest rate control.	61.0	999.0
201601	746	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	But there is little direct evidence we can bring to bear on the issue of exactly how large ON RRP headroom needs to be to support interest rate control in the future.	61.0	999.0
201601	747	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Having very elevated capacity of almost $2 trillion at liftoff may have contributed to the success of the initial policy firming by producing high confidence among market participants in the availability of the facility or by signaling that the Federal Reserve would do what it takes to control interest rates.	61.0	999.0
201601	748	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	In the period ahead, the amount of sufficient headroom will likely be lower than that afforded by the current capacity setting, but it could also be higher than the amount—roughly $150 billion—that prevailed, on average, during the testing phase of ON RRP operations prior to liftoff.	61.0	999.0
201601	749	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	The second key takeaway is that demand for ON RRPs with the Federal Reserve could increase significantly over time.	61.0	999.0
201601	750	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Factors that might contribute to increased demand include changes in financial regulations for money funds and banks as well as a rise in the general level of US interest rates, including the ON RRP offering rate, compared with those on some money market instruments or other assets.	61.0	999.0
201601	751	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Taken together, these factors suggest that there is meaningful uncertainty about the future demand for RRPs with the Federal Reserve and thus the usage of the ON RRP facility.	61.0	999.0
201601	752	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	As summarized in exhibit 2, the memo offered three illustrative options for reducing the aggregate capacity of the ON RRP facility, keeping in mind the possibility that demand for RRPs with the Federal Reserve could grow over time.	61.0	999.0
201601	753	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	It also discussed the high-level policy tradeoffs inherent in choosing among the options.	61.0	999.0
201601	754	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	You could initially set a high cap, as in option 1, perhaps in the range of $800 billion or $1 trillion; a high cap would make it very unlikely that the cap would need to be increased over time.	61.0	999.0
201601	755	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	You might prefer this option if you see substantial headroom as being important for rate control but are less concerned about surge risk and the Fed’s potential footprint in financial markets in the near term.	61.0	999.0
201601	756	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Even if you were quite concerned about surge risk and footprint issues over time, you might see setting an initial cap of $800 billion or even $1 trillion as a prudent first step in a process of reducing the cap over time.	61.0	999.0
201601	757	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Alternatively, you might prefer to initially set a lower cap, as in the two other options, because you judge that the level of headroom sufficient for supporting interest rate control is unlikely to be more than several hundred billion dollars and because you want to mitigate surge risk in the near term.	61.0	999.0
201601	758	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	If you also judge that it would be important to accommodate trend growth in demand for ON RRPs in order to maintain sufficient, but nonetheless limited, headroom, you might choose, as in option 2, to announce that you will increase the cap over time as necessary to maintain interest rate control.	61.0	999.0
201601	759	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Or, as in option 3, you might instead prefer to set a hard cap and make it clear that it will not be increased over time.	61.0	999.0
201601	760	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	This approach might be preferred if you wished to limit the extent to which a very large ON RRP facility might alter the behavior of money funds and other institutional investors.	61.0	999.0
201601	761	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Of course, there are some caveats to these broad assessments that we noted in the memo.	61.0	999.0
201601	762	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	As noted at the top of exhibit 3, a related issue is the timing of a reduction in capacity—that is, what constitutes “fairly soon”?	61.0	999.0
201601	763	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	If you judge rate control to be sufficient and likely to be sustained with lower capacity in the ON RRP facility, you might choose to reduce capacity as early as the March meeting.	61.0	999.0
201601	764	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Doing so might reduce your concerns about exposure to some risks, including possible surges in take-up, and perhaps also footprint-related issues regarding the Federal Reserve’s potential influence in financial markets.	61.0	999.0
201601	765	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Or you might want to wait longer, perhaps because you want to gain more experience with policy normalization or prefer to wait until some upcoming calendar events—such as March quarter-end and the April tax season—have passed.	61.0	999.0
201601	766	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	As noted in the middle panel, how to handle calendar effects on the demand for RRPs in the period ahead, such as at March quarter-end, is a somewhat separate issue.	61.0	999.0
201601	767	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	We expect these effects will continue for some time and recommend that the Committee continue to provide sufficient RRPs at quarter-ends to alleviate the associated pressures in money markets.	61.0	999.0
201601	768	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Under any of the three capacity options just discussed, calendar effects could be accommodated.	61.0	999.0
201601	769	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	The bottom panel lists some considerations regarding your near-term communications about RRPs.	61.0	999.0
201601	770	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	First, the minutes to this meeting will note that the topic of reducing the capacity of the ON RRP facility was discussed, which could help lay the groundwork for your future decision.	61.0	999.0
201601	771	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	In addition, if you are inclined to accommodate quarter-end pressures by ensuring sufficient RRP capacity, the minutes could also convey that intention.	61.0	999.0
201601	772	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	The decision about how to manage RRP capacity around March quarter-end can be deferred until the March FOMC meeting, as it will depend in part on the nature of the cap on ON RRPs in place at that time.	61.0	999.0
201601	773	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Lastly, we note that the drafts of the domestic policy directive for January that are shown in Tealbook B eliminate the reference to term RRPs because the testing resolution cited in the December directive has expired; it provided authority for term RRPs at quarter-ends only in 2015.	61.0	999.0
201601	774	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	If the Committee decides to offer term RRPs in March, the directive could be changed in March to indicate that.	61.0	999.0
201601	775	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	The final page in your exhibits lists the questions for discussion that were included in the cover note to the staff memo.	61.0	999.0
201601	776	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Thank you, we’d be happy to take your questions.	61.0	999.0
201601	777	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201601	778	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Gretchen?	62.0	65.0
201601	779	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	62.0	65.0
201601	780	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	97.0
201601	781	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Actually, I have several questions, and maybe I’ll start with the ones that are more specific.	62.0	97.0
201601	782	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Is my understanding correct, Gretchen, that the way we have been doing term RRPs, at least in the testing phase, would be completely consistent with the SEC’s rules for liquidity for government-only money market funds?	62.0	97.0
201601	783	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	The reason I ask that is, obviously, to the degree that we’re worried about surge or business model effects, if the term RRP actually is perfectly consistent with the external constraints that the money market funds would face, then our choosing to use term RRP really wouldn’t make that much of a difference in inhibiting any of those effects.	62.0	97.0
201601	784	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	That’s right.	62.0	999.0
201601	785	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	You have been using term RRP at quarter-ends, and that doesn’t come with those concerns.	62.0	999.0
201601	786	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Was your point that settlement is two plus zero?	62.0	999.0
201601	787	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Yes.	62.0	97.0
201601	788	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Okay.	62.0	999.0
201601	789	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	As far as I know, you’re right.	62.0	999.0
201601	790	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	But it’s a quantity operation rather than a fixed-rate one.	62.0	999.0
201601	791	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Right.	62.0	97.0
201601	792	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	So suppose we run the operation at 9:30 in the morning, and there’s an event the night before.	62.0	999.0
201601	793	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The surge would come in, and the rate would change at that point because it’s a maximum bid rate, so that’s the maximum you can bid.	62.0	999.0
201601	794	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	So for people who really wanted the money, what you’d see is very low rates being put in.	62.0	999.0
201601	795	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I see.	62.0	97.0
201601	796	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	So it might have some efficacy as an antisurge mechanism.	62.0	97.0
201601	797	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	So far it hasn’t been intended to do that, right?	62.0	999.0
201601	798	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Well, when we first offered it, we had it at 10 basis points, so we were getting more demand.	62.0	999.0
201601	799	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The way it would do it is, if there was a surge, it’s got a price mechanism, which is natural.	62.0	999.0
201601	800	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Hitting the cap in the overnight RRP is a different type of event because we’re not expecting that to be hit.	62.0	999.0
201601	801	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	So it has a different type of signal when you hit the cap in the overnight RRP.	62.0	999.0
201601	802	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Then we just say, “Here’s $X billion.	62.0	999.0
201601	803	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	You can take as much as you like, and we’re going to allocate this by just going through the bids, awarding the price that clears.”	62.0	999.0
201601	804	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	That’s helpful.	62.0	97.0
201601	805	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	My second question is—and you may not have the answer to this at your fingertips, but—do we know where nongovernment money market fund holdings are concentrated right now?	62.0	97.0
201601	806	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	That is, in which countries, banks, other areas?	62.0	97.0
201601	807	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Because it’s not a trivial consideration in thinking about how concerned we should be over the next couple of quarters.	62.0	97.0
201601	808	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Right.	62.0	999.0
201601	809	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	I don’t have a great breakdown of that, but I think a lot of the holders tend to be hedge funds.	62.0	999.0
201601	810	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	In the FR 2420, we can see that there are some very large French banks who are funding through the Eurodollar market.	62.0	999.0
201601	811	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Most of it looks like what’s called “luxury funding,” so it’s the arbitrage-type funding.	62.0	999.0
201601	812	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Japanese banks definitely have some other types of issues.	62.0	999.0
201601	813	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Then it’s Australian, Canadian, Norwegian—I don’t think they’re going to be greatly affected by this because they’re just arbing through into the interest on excess reserves.	62.0	999.0
201601	814	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Okay, that’s helpful.	62.0	97.0
201601	815	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	My last questions are about one of the factors that Gretchen noted in the reasons why demand may increase over time, which is regulation.	62.0	97.0
201601	816	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	My first question is on the reference in the memo to some regulations affecting foreign agencies and branches being “in train.”	62.0	97.0
201601	817	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	If I understand correctly the kind of regulations you were talking about, I wouldn’t have characterized them as “in train” so much as “under discussion.”	62.0	97.0
201601	818	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Yes.	62.0	999.0
201601	819	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	We subsequently questioned that wording, so I agree with your characterization.	62.0	999.0
201601	820	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Okay.	62.0	97.0
201601	821	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	The example there gave the nature of the kind of thing we had in mind.	62.0	999.0
201601	822	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	There had been conversations of possible things.	62.0	999.0
201601	823	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Okay.	62.0	97.0
201601	824	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And then, am I correct in drawing a distinction between the SEC regulations as they affect the decisions of money market funds, on the one hand, and the possibility, which I think is unlikely to be realized in the short term, of Europe changing its rules on how leverage ratios have to be reported, on the other hand?	62.0	97.0
201601	825	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	But let’s stipulate, for a second, that that change might take place, thereby affecting how the branches of foreign banks think about the ON RRP.	62.0	97.0
201601	826	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Tell me if I’m missing something here, but it seems to me that those are somewhat different considerations because for the money market funds, their decision is being made with reference, among other things, to what they think we’re going to do.	62.0	97.0
201601	827	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	That is, whether to shift from being a prime fund to a government-only fund may be dependent, in no small part, on whether they think there’s going to be another half a trillion or trillion dollars available for them to invest.	62.0	97.0
201601	828	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Whereas, if you are a bank and you’re just facing capital constraints, you’re going to have to adjust from where you are now as opposed to make a decision to start in some new line of business.	62.0	97.0
201601	829	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Is that a fair way of looking at it?	62.0	97.0
201601	830	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	I think so.	62.0	999.0
201601	831	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	That’s right, that there would be some element of choice in the money fund conversion to appeal to investors, but taking into account, in some sense, the prevalence of the availability of the overnight RRP as an investment, whereas the other one is an unconditional change.	62.0	999.0
201601	832	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I think for the money funds, they also don’t know what the institutional investors are going to do.	62.0	999.0
201601	833	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Suppose prime funds start posting much higher rates.	62.0	999.0
201601	834	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Will that attract some of that institutional money back in that’s scared about the regulatory changes?	62.0	999.0
201601	835	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	We don’t know that.	62.0	999.0
201601	836	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	That’s probably one of the biggest uncertainties in the money fund complex right now.	62.0	999.0
201601	837	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Yes.	62.0	97.0
201601	838	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	That I get.	62.0	97.0
201601	839	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Okay.	62.0	97.0
201601	840	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	62.0	97.0
201601	841	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201601	842	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions for Gretchen?	62.0	65.0
201601	843	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62.0	65.0
201601	844	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201601	845	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, why don’t we begin our go-round.	62.0	65.0
201601	846	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Oh, sorry.	62.0	65.0
201601	847	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	62.0	65.0
201601	848	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Could I ask Simon and Lorie—you have this hint on page 2 of your very clear paper, which I’ll read to you, and perhaps you can explain it:  “The very elevated setting of the cap may have also conveyed the sense that the Committee is willing to do what it takes to control interest rates”—this in a context in which you’re explaining the importance of the cap.	62.0	108.0
201601	849	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And then it continues:  “Arguably, this effect could be achieved through other means.”	62.0	108.0
201601	850	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	What are the other means?	62.0	108.0
201601	851	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Different people may have had different means in mind.	62.0	999.0
201601	852	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	One example could be, as in option 2, communicating timely adjustments to the cap to ensure it’s not binding over some medium-run horizon.	62.0	999.0
201601	853	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	I think if there was full certainty that the cap was going to be adjusted such that it wouldn’t bind, that would give market participants a similar type of certainty as the high cap might be demonstrating.	62.0	999.0
201601	854	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	There might be other options that people have in mind, but that’s the way I would have interpreted it.	62.0	999.0
201601	855	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	If the only thing that interested you was control of the federal funds rate, there were very many ways we could’ve done that.	62.0	999.0
201601	856	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	We could’ve drained $2.4 trillion of reserves out of the system—it would’ve been quite painful, but we could’ve done it.	62.0	999.0
201601	857	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	But our viewpoint was, there were a lot of other thoughts going into this, and Gretchen tried to go through some of those issues.	62.0	999.0
201601	858	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	There’s a big issue of some of the trading in these markets.	62.0	999.0
201601	859	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	There’s probably some bargaining surplus for people to agree about.	62.0	999.0
201601	860	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	And by showing a determination to get the rate firmly in the range, we probably helped the people who are investing cash at that point rather than the people who wanted to get cash in and would much rather pay less.	62.0	999.0
201601	861	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	It’s mainly a general thought meant to capture the fact that there are other ways—including, as Lori said, “words,” or as Simon said, “tool adjustments”—that could be used to convey that the Federal Reserve is on the job and that there’s not only one way to do that.	62.0	999.0
201601	862	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	But some of that is in option 2, isn’t it?	62.0	108.0
201601	863	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Yes.	62.0	999.0
201601	864	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Your communications about each of these options is an important feature in making these tradeoffs.	62.0	999.0
201601	865	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	You can communicate about each one in pretty different ways, and that might alter the way you make those assessments.	62.0	999.0
201601	866	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Simon, just one last question.	62.0	108.0
201601	867	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I was thinking that I might be told, “Well, we could go out and do open market operations from the portfolio.”	62.0	108.0
201601	868	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Is that what you’re saying?	62.0	108.0
201601	869	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62.0	999.0
201601	870	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	We could’ve built up a book of term TDF, term RRP, in a really classic way.	62.0	999.0
201601	871	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	We’d just multiply the numbers we used to do by about a hundred or a thousand, and then we’d be there.	62.0	999.0
201601	872	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	It just might be disruptive in the market for us to come in for $300 billion or $400 billion a day, something like that, and setting term rates.	62.0	999.0
201601	873	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	One of the advantages of using the overnight RRP in this particular case—there are other issues with it—is that it zeroes in to support interest on excess reserves and doesn’t have us breaking a sweat each day to do that.	62.0	999.0
201601	874	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	62.0	108.0
201601	875	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks.	62.0	108.0
201601	876	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions?	62.0	65.0
201601	877	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62.0	65.0
201601	878	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201601	879	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	If not, let’s begin the go-round.	62.0	65.0
201601	880	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	62.0	65.0
201601	881	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	90.0
201601	882	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Liftoff occurred more smoothly than I anticipated.	62.0	90.0
201601	883	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	With the exception of the end of the year, the utilization of the facility has been rather limited.	62.0	90.0
201601	884	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	With the federal funds rate and the Eurodollar rate trading well above 25 basis points on most days, it is not surprising that prime money market funds are not making extensive use of the facility on most days.	62.0	90.0
201601	885	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Other short-term instruments of high quality are paying rates higher than the RRP rate.	62.0	90.0
201601	886	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It might be useful in future presentations to distinguish between prime and government-only funds, just to highlight that.	62.0	90.0
201601	887	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	For the government-only funds, with more limited alternatives, the RRP facility is more frequently attractive, in part because short-term Treasury rates have been below the RRP rate, as was shown in Lorie’s chart 17.	62.0	90.0
201601	888	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	For many of the days since liftoff, the one- and three-month Treasury bills have traded below the RRP rate.	62.0	90.0
201601	889	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, this has been a period complicated by liftoff, the end of the year, and significant financial turbulence.	62.0	90.0
201601	890	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If the one- and three-month Treasury bill rates start to trade consistently above the RRP rate, there should be much less incentive for government-only funds to make use of the facility.	62.0	90.0
201601	891	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think it would be useful to observe how the use of the facility changes as these complicating factors diminish.	62.0	90.0
201601	892	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	As a result, I’d prefer to not alter the capacity of the facility at this time and wait to make a decision on the capacity of the RRP facility until we have somewhat more experience with the facility under more normal circumstances.	62.0	90.0
201601	893	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The primary use of the facility is likely to occur at quarter- and year-ends.	62.0	90.0
201601	894	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This is a manifestation of poorly designed European bank regulations that incent bank window-dressing.	62.0	90.0
201601	895	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The Basel III leverage ratio framework, as Governor Tarullo was referencing, requires a minimum capital calculation at quarter-end.	62.0	90.0
201601	896	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The United States requires averages of daily values throughout quarter for the variables that enter into the calculation of capital ratios used to meet capital requirements, whereas most E.U. nations use quarter-end values.	62.0	90.0
201601	897	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The United Kingdom has recently changed regulations to require the use of averages of daily, on-balance-sheet assets, but UK banks don’t need to comply until December 2017.	62.0	90.0
201601	898	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Not surprisingly, in the presence of these incentives, the main culprit in window-dressing is the behavior of foreign branches and agencies.	62.0	90.0
201601	899	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If one looks at H. weekly data, US bank assets do not decline significantly at quarter-end, unlike foreign branches and agencies that show distinct decreases at quarter-end.	62.0	90.0
201601	900	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If one examines money market fund data, roughly 30 percent of prime money market assets are liabilities of European banks.	62.0	90.0
201601	901	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, at the end of a quarter, there’s a discernible decline in money market fund exposures to European banks but not a discernible drop to exposure to non-European banks.	62.0	90.0
201601	902	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This implies two possible responses to get at the root cause of seasonality.	62.0	90.0
201601	903	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	First, encourage European colleagues to change reporting requirements.	62.0	90.0
201601	904	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Not only does window-dressing misrepresent the true position of banks to investors and regulators, but it is generating problems discernible in the United States.	62.0	90.0
201601	905	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Second, we should consider ways in which we in the United States can strongly discourage branches and agencies of European banks from dramatically downsizing at quarter-ends.	62.0	90.0
201601	906	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If European regulators want to perpetuate the misrepresentation of their banks’ balance sheets and capital cushions, let them do it in Europe, rather than in the branches and agencies they have located in the United States.	62.0	90.0
201601	907	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	An alternative strategy to reduce the dependence on an RRP facility would be to allow the RRP rate to move up more slowly than the IOER rate.	62.0	90.0
201601	908	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	So far, the IOER appears to be the main mechanism for keeping the federal funds rate at roughly a 15 basis point discount.	62.0	90.0
201601	909	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Should that be maintained as we raise rates, more slowly raising the RRP rate will discourage the use of the RRP facility as short-term Treasury yields are more likely to be above the RRP rate.	62.0	90.0
201601	910	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	When we decide to make changes to the RRP facility, I would suggest that we start with option 1 and then potentially move to option 2.	62.0	90.0
201601	911	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Whether money market funds use overnight RRP or term RRP would seem to have little implication for the size of the Fed’s footprint, as Governor Tarullo was mentioning.	62.0	90.0
201601	912	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The most efficient way to discourage use of the RRP would be to get at the root cause of window-dressing and to make take-up of the RRP facility less attractive in relation to short-term Treasury rates.	62.0	90.0
201601	913	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	90.0
201601	914	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201601	915	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	62.0	65.0
201601	916	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	97.0
201601	917	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Let me begin by, again, commending Simon, Lorie, and their colleagues at the Desk for their expert preparation for, and precise execution of, the December rate rise, which has relieved us of a bunch of headaches we otherwise might have had following Christmas and even at this meeting.	62.0	97.0
201601	918	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I’m glad we’re talking about the imposition of a limit on the ON RRP so quickly after liftoff.	62.0	97.0
201601	919	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Having said that, I want to say that I share some of President Rosengren’s sense that it would be good to get a better idea of how things may normalize over the course of the next few months.	62.0	97.0
201601	920	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	My only qualification to what President Rosengren said is that I would worry if, as my question to Gretchen earlier suggested, we saw in the process a migration of prime funds to be government-only money market funds potentially premised on an expectation of the availability of a very large cap, which would facilitate such a move.	62.0	97.0
201601	921	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	That really is the dilemma that I see.	62.0	97.0
201601	922	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I would like to accommodate possible increases in demand associated with what the memo described as zero-lower-bound effects, but not to accommodate possible increases in demand that are associated with money market funds deciding that this is a good business model for them to move into, as opposed to simply reacting, at the end of quarters when FBOs are not doing as much activity as they normally do.	62.0	97.0
201601	923	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I would actually not be averse to waiting a little longer on the basis of the best understanding we have that, as of now, there doesn’t seem to be much of a migration.	62.0	97.0
201601	924	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	But I have to confess, I worry that when it starts, it could start pretty quickly, and some of that $700 billion in remaining assets referenced in the staff memo could move pretty quickly.	62.0	97.0
201601	925	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	When we do move, like President Rosengren, I’m inclined toward option 1, but I would say option 1 with an explicit suggestion that further periodic reductions in the cap will be forthcoming, because if we don’t have that, we might be sending the signal that it’s going to be a trillion indefinitely, at which point we might be providing incentives, rather than disincentives, for some of the things that I’ve been concerned with.	62.0	97.0
201601	926	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	What I most want to avoid is for us to impose a cap and then raise or remove it later.	62.0	97.0
201601	927	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	It seems to me that would risk a little bit of a negative for FOMC credibility in managing interest rate increases, but it may also communicate to money managers that we will adjust the ON RRP to accommodate whatever demand does develop.	62.0	97.0
201601	928	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, again, that wouldn’t be the signal that I would want to send.	62.0	97.0
201601	929	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Imposing a cap, with an expectation of lower caps to come, would signal a tapering of the program that should at least limit that incentive.	62.0	97.0
201601	930	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Now, obviously, a lower initial cap would send a stronger signal, but were the possibility described in the staff memo of the increase in demand associated with the ELB effects to materialize, I suspect a majority, if not everyone, on this Committee would want the ability to set a hard floor for the federal funds rate by using more ON RRP.	62.0	97.0
201601	931	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	That’s why, as I said, I would prefer to be a little bit more conservative in setting the cap in order to avoid the need to reverse later.	62.0	97.0
201601	932	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Let’s see.	62.0	97.0
201601	933	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Eric made a number of these other points, so I won’t repeat them.	62.0	97.0
201601	934	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think I’ll end there, Madam Chair.	62.0	97.0
201601	935	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201601	936	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	62.0	65.0
201601	937	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	999.0
201601	938	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I, too, want to thank the staff for the helpful memo.	62.0	999.0
201601	939	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Because we’ve said publicly that the aggregate capacity on the ON RRP facility would be temporarily elevated at liftoff and that we expected to reduce the capacity fairly soon after the first increase in the funds rate, I don’t think it’s too soon to consider how we want to approach this reduction in capacity.	62.0	999.0
201601	940	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I view the main reason for the ON RRP facility is to give us better control of the interest rate.	62.0	999.0
201601	941	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	By all accounts, operationally, liftoff was a success.	62.0	999.0
201601	942	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I agree with my colleagues.	62.0	999.0
201601	943	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The combination of our tools proved up to the task, and I thank the Desk and the Board staff that made that happen.	62.0	999.0
201601	944	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	But as the staff memo assessing our control of interest rates says, it’s difficult to know the relative effects that the IOER, ON RRP, large aggregate cap on the ON RRP facility, and moving away from the lower bound had in bringing short-term interest rates up to the target.	62.0	999.0
201601	945	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Thus, how high a cap is needed to ensure interest rate control is not known with certainty at this point.	62.0	999.0
201601	946	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	But we also have to consider some of the potential costs associated with the facility, especially if the cap on aggregate capacity remains large.	62.0	999.0
201601	947	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	As others have said, there’s a possibility during times of financial market stress that firms will turn to the facility instead of their private-sector counterparts and subtract liquidity from the market, thereby exacerbating stress on the markets.	62.0	999.0
201601	948	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Also, a large facility may lead, over time, to operational and structural changes in private-sector money markets.	62.0	999.0
201601	949	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	That may affect the viability of the funds rate market over time or other parts of the private-sector funding market.	62.0	999.0
201601	950	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I think, because the Committee is currently studying what its longer-run operating framework should be, we wouldn’t want a decision we make today or pretty soon to, in effect, take an option off the table for our operating framework.	62.0	999.0
201601	951	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Some of these cost-benefit considerations led the Committee to decide, as indicated in the normalization principles, that it would use the ON RRP facility only to the extent necessary to help control the funds rate, and that it would phase it out when the facility is no longer needed.	62.0	999.0
201601	952	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Those principles helped guide my thinking on the questions posed in the staff memo.	62.0	999.0
201601	953	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Regarding an approach to scaling back the size of the facility, in general, I don’t think we should be moving the maximum size of the facility up or down at high frequency.	62.0	999.0
201601	954	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Admittedly, there are still some questions about what size of the facility is needed for interest rate control and what the demand on the ON RRPs will be, and the memo discusses, in a pretty in-depth way, some reasons to think that demand will be rising over time.	62.0	999.0
201601	955	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In addition, we’ve had only one rate increase, and we’ve experienced only one quarter-end since liftoff.	62.0	999.0
201601	956	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I think we should avoid being overly confident in our ability to raise short-term interest rates.	62.0	999.0
201601	957	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Given these considerations, I think we should come to some determination of the appropriate size, conditional on our current estimates and expectations, and then use term RRPs to offset changes in demand that will result from calendar effects, like quarter-ends.	62.0	999.0
201601	958	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	At some point, consistent with the normalization principles, we’ll determine that the facility is no longer needed, and we’ll have a plan for phasing out the facility, perhaps by reducing its size.	62.0	999.0
201601	959	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I think this puts me closest to the memo’s option 3, but I’m perhaps less dogmatic about never being willing to raise the cap, in view of some of the uncertainties about demand.	62.0	999.0
201601	960	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	If it turns out that we’ve set the cap too low for adequate control of interest rates, we may indeed have to revisit the size, but I don’t think that should be our default intention.	62.0	999.0
201601	961	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I think we can use language similar to what’s in our normalization principles—indicate our plan, but also say that we would be prepared to make some adjustments, if necessary, in the interest of interest rate control.	62.0	999.0
201601	962	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Given the take-up to date, the $400 billion to $600 billion aggregate cap in option 3 seems reasonable to me.	62.0	999.0
201601	963	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	But because we’re very early in the normalization process, and our estimates of trend demand are not certain, I’m not fully confident in that size and would like to see more analysis supporting that.	62.0	999.0
201601	964	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I see some merit in waiting until after the March quarter-end to initiate a reduction in the cap to gain more experience during a period of potentially elevated demand.	62.0	999.0
201601	965	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	If the staff indicated that implementing another funds rate increase would be a very valuable experience in determining the appropriate size of the facility, then I wouldn’t necessarily be averse to that, but I think the communications reconciling this with our previous indication that we would reduce the size fairly soon after liftoff would have to be carefully done.	62.0	999.0
201601	966	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The minutes of this meeting will reveal that we’ve had this discussion, and, as the staff memo suggests, it could be used to indicate the Committee’s intentions with respect to the cap.	62.0	999.0
201601	967	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	999.0
201601	968	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	62.0	65.0
201601	969	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	62.0	65.0
201601	970	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	81.0
201601	971	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	A couple of comments before answering the questions.	62.0	81.0
201601	972	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The gist is willingness to begin with the end in mind, the ultimate objective for the ON RRP facility.	62.0	81.0
201601	973	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We actually decided on our objective in September 2014 when we announced that the Committee will phase it out when it is no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate.	62.0	81.0
201601	974	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	So how will we know when the facility is no longer needed to control the federal funds rate?	62.0	81.0
201601	975	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The staff memo focuses heavily on the short-run tactical question of what to do next with the overall cap, and they didn’t provide an analysis of this question of how to know when the facility is no longer needed to control the federal funds rate.	62.0	81.0
201601	976	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	In fact, they haven’t proposed how we’re going to find out, either.	62.0	81.0
201601	977	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We spent a lot of time discussing whether the overnight RRP facility was necessary to control the funds rate before liftoff, but at that time the one consideration that seemed to trump all others was the desire to avoid the embarrassment of raising the target range for the federal funds rate and interest rate on excess reserves and not having money market rates follow right along.	62.0	81.0
201601	978	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We used to refer to this as the “egg on the face” risk.	62.0	81.0
201601	979	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	So we did it.	62.0	81.0
201601	980	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We raised our administrative rates, and market rates came right along as we predicted and hoped, and we didn’t get egg on our face.	62.0	81.0
201601	981	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	So I think that we can think about the role of the overnight RRP facility without that dreadful fear trumping everything else and indicating, well, we have to have this program.	62.0	81.0
201601	982	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Now, the question is, to what extent is the funds rate being held up by the interest rate on excess reserves as opposed to the overnight RRP rate?	62.0	81.0
201601	983	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The staff doesn’t know.	62.0	81.0
201601	984	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	They were agnostic, or maybe they just couldn’t agree on it—they didn’t say one way or another.	62.0	81.0
201601	985	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The natural way to answer this question, it seems to me, is to do some tests.	62.0	81.0
201601	986	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We did some testing before in 2014 by varying the interest rate we paid on the overnight RRP facility.	62.0	81.0
201601	987	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I think we should do some tests again.	62.0	81.0
201601	988	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The memos don’t make any mention of changing the RP facility rate, and I find that surprising.	62.0	81.0
201601	989	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	There is a lot of discussions of demand and how demand might rise over time.	62.0	81.0
201601	990	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Obviously, demand depends on the price, though, and surely it would vary.	62.0	81.0
201601	991	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It seems plausible to me, looking at what’s happened since liftoff, that the funds rate doesn’t depend much on the RP facility rate.	62.0	81.0
201601	992	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	That seem really plausible to me.	62.0	81.0
201601	993	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The fact that the funds rate fell below the RP facility rate at the end of the year suggests, as the staff indicated, that overnight RRPs at our facility are not a very good substitute for funds rate transactions due to the time of day the funds get returned.	62.0	81.0
201601	994	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It strikes me that we could learn more by moving the rate.	62.0	81.0
201601	995	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Now, President Rosengren suggested moving the facility rate less than we raised IOER when we raise interest rates.	62.0	81.0
201601	996	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I’m not sure we have to wait for a rate increase to do that.	62.0	81.0
201601	997	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I think we could undertake an experiment like that later this year.	62.0	81.0
201601	998	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We’re talking about the funds rate, and our objective is to control the funds rate and keep the funds rate within the target.	62.0	81.0
201601	999	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The question is, could lowering the rate on the overnight RRP facility result in a decline in market RP rates?	62.0	81.0
201601	1000	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	That’s not obvious, because the market RP rates are above our facility rate now.	62.0	81.0
201601	1001	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It could be that that spread is determined by the market, and that spread will remain constant, and the RP market rates will fall if we reduce the facility rate.	62.0	81.0
201601	1002	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	That could be.	62.0	81.0
201601	1003	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	But if that does happen, it’s not clear it should bother us, because our announced goal is to control the federal funds rate, and we used to not care about the RP rate.	62.0	81.0
201601	1004	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We used to let the spread be determined by market, and the market set the spread at various rates at various times.	62.0	81.0
201601	1005	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It was never a concern for the Committee.	62.0	81.0
201601	1006	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	So I think there’s an open question, and it would be useful to get the staff working on it.	62.0	81.0
201601	1007	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I understand that the long-term framework project is going to be examining these and other questions presumably, but for us I think it’s important to remember that our objective is to phase out this facility if it’s no longer needed to keep the funds rate within the target, and I think we need to find out whether it’s needed or not and reduce the facility appropriately as we learn.	62.0	81.0
201601	1008	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	For the questions, I would prefer option 3—a low hard cap—because I think it would more rapidly ramp down market expectations about the ongoing scale of the program in the future.	62.0	81.0
201601	1009	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Quarter-end fluctuations have been a feature of money markets since—I want to say the beginning of time, but let’s say before the crisis.	62.0	81.0
201601	1010	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	And, again, they never really bothered the Committee because it never really made a difference for monetary conditions.	62.0	81.0
201601	1011	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I don’t think we should change the parameters for quarter-end.	62.0	81.0
201601	1012	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	For communications, I’d suggest that we say that we believe that the interest rate on excess reserves is able to carry most of the weight in controlling the funds rate, and that we’ll do some experimenting as we go forward to confirm this, and we expect to phase out the ON RRP program gradually as evidence accumulates that IOER is sufficient.	62.0	81.0
201601	1013	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	As for timing of putting a cap on it, March isn’t too soon for me, but I’ve heard other views around the table, so we’ll have to discuss that in the future.	62.0	81.0
201601	1014	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	81.0
201601	1015	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	62.0	65.0
201601	1016	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	62.0	65.0
201601	1017	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	999.0
201601	1018	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	I’m in favor of being forward looking, but even then it seems a bit early to me to be making a decision on this matter.	62.0	999.0
201601	1019	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	For me, the overriding concern right now is maintaining control of the federal funds rate.	62.0	999.0
201601	1020	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	I believe it’s important that we maintain maximum flexibility until we’re well on our way toward policy normalization.	62.0	999.0
201601	1021	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Given the uncertainties about how demand for overnight RRP will develop and how gradually we will be normalizing policy, it seems to me that now is not the time to signal to markets that we will be reducing aggregate capacity for this facility.	62.0	999.0
201601	1022	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	So I prefer an approach that would have us implement a flexible cap once the fund rate target hits a certain level—say, for the sake of argument, 1 percent—rather than adhering to a date-dependent schedule.	62.0	999.0
201601	1023	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	At that time we should have a much clearer picture about the normal take-up of the facility, and we could be more confident about how gradually capacity can be reduced without unnecessarily imposing worries about headroom on participants.	62.0	999.0
201601	1024	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Now, if there is a strong view about setting an aggregate cap now, I prefer we set it at a very high level that would reassure markets about our continued willingness to support demand for overnight RRP in the early stages of policy normalization.	62.0	999.0
201601	1025	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	As for calendar-based pressures, I’d prefer that we use term RRPs to meet that demand.	62.0	999.0
201601	1026	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	If we proceed at this gradual pace and markets are settled in the use of the overnight facility, I believe our communication about reducing the capacity of the facility will just simply be that much easier.	62.0	999.0
201601	1027	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	999.0
201601	1028	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	62.0	65.0
201601	1029	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	62.0	65.0
201601	1030	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	91.0
201601	1031	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I’d also like to commend the Board staff and New York for such excellent materials on the design and the implementation that prepared us for the programs that were put in place so that things would run so smoothly.	62.0	91.0
201601	1032	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	It’s really been a big help.	62.0	91.0
201601	1033	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	The Committee has previously agreed that the ON RRP facility will be temporary.	62.0	91.0
201601	1034	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I continue to support this approach, and this bears repeating in our announcements.	62.0	91.0
201601	1035	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I’m inclined to favor option 1.	62.0	91.0
201601	1036	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I think that reducing the cap from its current $2 trillion level down to the $1 trillion cap envisioned in option 1 would help remind the markets that our eventual goal for this temporary facility is to wind down the program.	62.0	91.0
201601	1037	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	At this point, like, I think, Governor Tarullo, I could support periodic reductions in the overnight RRP capacity from time to time.	62.0	91.0
201601	1038	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I’m not a big fan of option 2, with the flexible adjustments.	62.0	91.0
201601	1039	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I think we could move to the $1 trillion cap fairly quickly, within a few meetings, but there’s no need to rush toward a lower hard cap, as in option 3, until we’ve had experience with multiple rate hikes and have more information on the real size and effect of this market.	62.0	91.0
201601	1040	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Regarding end-of-quarter pressures, frankly, it’s not clear to me how important this issue really is.	62.0	91.0
201601	1041	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	During my time in the System, the federal funds rate has often traded away from target for a short period around quarter-end, sometimes spectacularly.	62.0	91.0
201601	1042	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	These short-term seasonal variations have not had any significant effect on achieving our policy goals, as near as I can tell, or the ultimate reliability of the monetary policy transmission mechanism itself.	62.0	91.0
201601	1043	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I’m not saying there wasn’t pain for various financial participants, but quarter-end federal funds rate spikes did not leave an imprint on macrodata, as near as I can tell.	62.0	91.0
201601	1044	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Knowledgeable market observers know that these seasonal effects exist, and they adjust their interpretations of rate movements accordingly.	62.0	91.0
201601	1045	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Finally, regarding communications, for now I think that we should reiterate that the facility is temporary, but that the timing and size of future reductions in the cap will depend on how the normalization process is proceeding.	62.0	91.0
201601	1046	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	91.0
201601	1047	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	62.0	65.0
201601	1048	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	97.0
201601	1049	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Something that Presidents Lacker and Evans have now both said makes me want to ask the two of them a question.	62.0	97.0
201601	1050	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Is one or both of you saying that you would be willing to accept some softness in the federal funds rate around the end of quarters, and that’s what you mean by not worrying too much about the window-dressing effects?	62.0	97.0
201601	1051	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Absolutely.	62.0	91.0
201601	1052	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	62.0	81.0
201601	1053	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Okay.	62.0	97.0
201601	1054	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It always happened, yes.	62.0	81.0
201601	1055	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It always used to happen, and it was inconsequential.	62.0	81.0
201601	1056	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	What matters is longer-run rates, and they’re going to average through the quarter-end.	62.0	81.0
201601	1057	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Well, it would matter if it makes it into the two-year rate or the three- month rate or things like that, lending rates.	62.0	91.0
201601	1058	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	That also gets back to the issue of reporting requirements that President Rosengren raised that I should have but didn’t comment on.	62.0	97.0
201601	1059	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	There is a very important difference from before the crisis.	62.0	999.0
201601	1060	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Our balance sheet on the liabilities side was currency plus a little bit of reserves.	62.0	999.0
201601	1061	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Now, it’s currency plus about $3 trillion of other liabilities which the system has to deal with.	62.0	999.0
201601	1062	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	But we’re talking about what rates do.	62.0	81.0
201601	1063	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It’s a question of whether you mind rates going 5 basis points, 10 basis points lower.	62.0	81.0
201601	1064	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It’s the same question whether we have a giant balance sheet or a little one.	62.0	81.0
201601	1065	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I don’t get it.	62.0	81.0
201601	1066	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I don’t think it’s quite the same because of how many liabilities there are in the system.	62.0	999.0
201601	1067	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Are you talking about just the frictional cost of moving all that money around?	62.0	96.0
201601	1068	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62.0	999.0
201601	1069	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	It’s a different situation when you see the contraction.	62.0	999.0
201601	1070	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	It’s a much larger contraction that you see in the volumes in the money markets.	62.0	999.0
201601	1071	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The people who are getting hurt by that are the people who are trying to invest.	62.0	999.0
201601	1072	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	It’s not the dealers, which used to be the other ones who were doing the window-dressing, or the large European banks.	62.0	999.0
201601	1073	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	You’re talking about the dollar volume of people who are affected by a lower rate on quarter-end.	62.0	81.0
201601	1074	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	That’s one version of it.	62.0	999.0
201601	1075	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	And it might be different for a different sort of scale as people invest a different amount.	62.0	81.0
201601	1076	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	So it’s the maturity of their borrowing that we’re talking about?	62.0	91.0
201601	1077	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	A couple of days, or are they going to lock in a one-year rate because they show up on the wrong date right before the end of the quarter?	62.0	91.0
201601	1078	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	There’s about $700 billion to $800 billion, which is overnight, plus some other terms.	62.0	999.0
201601	1079	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	So it’s quite a lot of that.	62.0	999.0
201601	1080	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Some of that has just been produced by the size of our balance sheet.	62.0	999.0
201601	1081	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	So if they’re going to get a bad trade near the end of the quarter and they understand that this is the environment they face, then they’re going to start moving their money around earlier.	62.0	91.0
201601	1082	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I’m not explaining myself.	62.0	999.0
201601	1083	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The money has to end up with the Federal Reserve somehow, and there are easier ways for it to end up.	62.0	999.0
201601	1084	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The overnight RRP or term RRPs are ways for it to directly go there rather than go through some complicated structure in the financial system.	62.0	999.0
201601	1085	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	So it’s more of a plumbing issue with that much money moving around.	62.0	999.0
201601	1086	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I scribbled down some notes as I was listening to President Lacker.	62.0	91.0
201601	1087	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I was sympathetic to what he was saying.	62.0	91.0
201601	1088	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	For the longest time, the FOMC and the conduct of monetary policy has been about the funds rate.	62.0	91.0
201601	1089	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	And the New York Desk does a great job of telling us about how hard it is to implement that when the funds rate trades soft over a long period of time, how other market rates are affected.	62.0	91.0
201601	1090	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	But at the end of the day, it’s really the funds rate.	62.0	91.0
201601	1091	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	As we move closer to an environment in which we’re away from the effective lower bound, I think that’s going to be the most important thing.	62.0	91.0
201601	1092	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	We’ve ended up, because of the lower bound and all of our programs, having to discuss things at this meeting that normally took place at the 9:20 calls and things like that.	62.0	91.0
201601	1093	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	If they’re really as important for the transmission mechanism as maybe Simon is suggesting, I guess we need more information, because I don’t see it that way.	62.0	91.0
201601	1094	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Sorry.	62.0	999.0
201601	1095	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	There’s a market-functioning issue and a rate issue, I think.	62.0	999.0
201601	1096	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Lorie.	62.0	65.0
201601	1097	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	I just wanted to mention that, in the old framework, we did take actions to try to alleviate the quarter-end effects.	62.0	999.0
201601	1098	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	We just couldn’t do it because we were on the maintenance period.	62.0	999.0
201601	1099	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	I wanted to make it clear that, in the old framework, we were making a lot of decisions to try to adjust the level of reserves to smooth through the quarter-end.	62.0	999.0
201601	1100	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Right.	62.0	81.0
201601	1101	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	You did, but you often didn’t completely offset it.	62.0	81.0
201601	1102	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	We weren’t able to.	62.0	999.0
201601	1103	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	But it was always a goal of the implementation path to try to offset those effects.	62.0	999.0
201601	1104	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Sure.	62.0	91.0
201601	1105	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	But Jim Hamilton had a paper in the Journal of Political Economy many years ago about the spectacular, spectacular spikes in the funds rate that occurred, and I don’t know of any evidence that those spikes made their way into macrodata or things like that.	62.0	91.0
201601	1106	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	That’s correct.	62.0	999.0
201601	1107	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	They certainly didn’t and might not now, but there  the size of our balance sheet has a market-functioning aspect that could affect quarter-end trend behavior.	62.0	999.0
201601	1108	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Could I ask another question of Simon?	62.0	90.0
201601	1109	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	No one really knew what the end-of-the-year rate was going to be going in.	62.0	90.0
201601	1110	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	So many things were new this time.	62.0	90.0
201601	1111	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	But if we systematically saw the rates drop to, say, zero if we did nothing, it would start leeching into those other rates, predictably at the end of every quarter and every year.	62.0	90.0
201601	1112	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	So we’d start trading soft instead of trading in the middle; presumably the arbitrage would get us to start being much closer to the floor before the end of the quarter and end of the year.	62.0	90.0
201601	1113	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	That’s possible.	62.0	999.0
201601	1114	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I think the issue for many people is:   They have a lot of cash to invest, and they have a relationship that is not as robust on the quarter-end.	62.0	999.0
201601	1115	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Where are they going to put that cash?	62.0	999.0
201601	1116	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	They want to invest on the quarter-end.	62.0	999.0
201601	1117	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	They will take action to make sure they can invest on the quarter-end if they think there’s less of the Federal Reserve balance sheet available, and that would lead to softness in rates.	62.0	999.0
201601	1118	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	It also leads to inefficient behavior because a lot of the cash they have to invest is coming from the size of our balance sheet.	62.0	999.0
201601	1119	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	To go back to your question, Governor Tarullo, this isn’t about market functioning, it’s a distributional issue—it’s who pays for the privilege of investing cash at quarter-end.	62.0	81.0
201601	1120	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	You’ve got a lot of cash around.	62.0	81.0
201601	1121	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	You can make a lot every other day of the quarter, but at quarter-end, you don’t have relationships.	62.0	81.0
201601	1122	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	You’ve set up relationships with foreign banks that are doing the arbitrage to IOER.	62.0	81.0
201601	1123	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Part of what you pay for doing that is that on quarter-end, you don’t have relationships elsewhere to invest the cash.	62.0	81.0
201601	1124	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	To some extent, for us to defray that cost, for us to reduce the cost of having nowhere to invest your cash on quarter-end, we’re just making it easier for the foreign banks to do this arbitrage.	62.0	81.0
201601	1125	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We’re just shifting costs around these players.	62.0	81.0
201601	1126	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It’s less market functioning than just a distributional question.	62.0	81.0
201601	1127	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	One last note is, what we’re seeing in unsecured markets is that it’s a day at month-end and quarter-end.	62.0	999.0
201601	1128	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	But for repo markets, if you look at the data, it takes multiple days for the balance sheets of some of those dealers to come down and then multiple days to build back up.	62.0	999.0
201601	1129	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	What we saw in September when we did the test in which we put the cap in and didn’t have the term is that the softness was not just on one day, it was several days in advance.	62.0	999.0
201601	1130	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	I suspect that if we didn’t provide it, we’d be talking about more than one day per month—we’d be talking about a couple of days, both before and after.	62.0	999.0
201601	1131	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	But you would distribute the softness over time, so the financial system would find a way of dealing with all of those reserves.	62.0	999.0
201601	1132	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	If they thought that it was going to be harder to invest on the quarter-end using the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in a direct way, they would find a way to distribute that over the quarter .	62.0	999.0
201601	1133	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	62.0	65.0
201601	1134	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Can you tell us, what is the cost to the Federal Reserve of supplying the Federal Reserve paper that they want?	62.0	108.0
201601	1135	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The overnight RRP offer rate right now is 25 basis points below the interest rate on excess reserves.	62.0	999.0
201601	1136	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	When we issue term, it’s probably going to be 3 basis points above.	62.0	999.0
201601	1137	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	If you look at it the other way, if you want to save a little bit of money at quarter-end, which I don’t think is of interest here, using the overnight RRP is a little bit cheaper because you don’t get it as a reserve balance as it finds its way back into the banking system to be a reserve balance.	62.0	999.0
201601	1138	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Sorry, who’s “you”?	62.0	108.0
201601	1139	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Who saves the money?	62.0	108.0
201601	1140	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We do.	62.0	65.0
201601	1141	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The US taxpayer would, because we’d remit more to the Treasury.	62.0	999.0
201601	1142	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	But were you asking about the operational costs, like how many people they have doing it?	62.0	81.0
201601	1143	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	No, not at all.	62.0	108.0
201601	1144	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I was asking about the interest costs.	62.0	108.0
201601	1145	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It saves us money, because it saves reserves—IOER.	62.0	81.0
201601	1146	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Because what will happen is, if we don’t offer another type of liability to the financial system, that money has to get back to our balance sheet, and it will find a way of getting there.	62.0	999.0
201601	1147	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	At that point, it receives interest on excess reserves.	62.0	999.0
201601	1148	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201601	1149	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	62.0	65.0
201601	1150	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	94.0
201601	1151	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I support option 1, which is the high-cap option, but I want to align myself with comments by President Harker and President Evans, who have similar themes.	62.0	94.0
201601	1152	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	My preference is actually to have no cap at this point and to watch and wait during the next six months or so.	62.0	94.0
201601	1153	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’d consider what President Harker suggested, that you should have some idea about where the funds rate is before you start putting a cap on this facility.	62.0	94.0
201601	1154	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think we want maximum emphasis on rate control during this phase that we’re in right now.	62.0	94.0
201601	1155	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’m also encouraged that actual take-up seems to be quite low at this time, and so for this reason I don’t think we really need a cap right now.	62.0	94.0
201601	1156	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think it’s a little premature to put that on.	62.0	94.0
201601	1157	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Now, I agree, if the program grows to a substantially larger size, the Committee could at that point review the reasons for the expansion of the program.	62.0	94.0
201601	1158	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	One way we could proceed—this is just something to consider here—is to simply agree to a size of the program that would trigger further review, and possibly you could announce to the public that the Committee would review it at some point if the program got larger, but that wouldn’t be an official cap.	62.0	94.0
201601	1159	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	You’d just say that the Committee is going to look at this again if this thing starts to grow, because one thing that seems like it might happen in the future is that you’d remain with relatively small take-up, and you wouldn’t need a cap, and you wouldn’t get much growth in the program.	62.0	94.0
201601	1160	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Now, I understand it may not go that way, but then we’d have a way to review that possibility.	62.0	94.0
201601	1161	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So I’d actually be willing to go with the possibility of no cap indefinitely, depending on how the demand develops as we go forward.	62.0	94.0
201601	1162	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	94.0
201601	1163	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201601	1164	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	62.0	65.0
201601	1165	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	104.0
201601	1166	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Let me say, I think it’s great to have this discussion now when there’s no near-term problem to solve and no really urgent need to act.	62.0	104.0
201601	1167	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Broadly speaking, the RRP is doing its job well with IOER.	62.0	104.0
201601	1168	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I would say that it’s clear that reserves are going to remain superabundant for a number of years now, and that’s probably going to mean that we’re going to need the RRP, and we’ll be facing these issues for a number of years.	62.0	104.0
201601	1169	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The place to which I would like to see this go in the medium term, two to three years, is more at the level of option 2, which is $300 million to $500 million.	62.0	104.0
201601	1170	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I would be comfortable—	62.0	104.0
201601	1171	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Billion.	62.0	97.0
201601	1172	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Billion—thank you.	62.0	104.0
201601	1173	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I would be comfortable starting with option 1 and saying explicitly that we expect to reduce this over time, as appropriate.	62.0	104.0
201601	1174	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The problem with option 1, just putting the number out there and not saying that you expect to reduce it over time, is that you send a signal that you welcome, and perhaps even encourage, more funds.	62.0	104.0
201601	1175	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	But that would be perfectly acceptable in my view.	62.0	104.0
201601	1176	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	In terms of when to start, I think it is tied up with the path of policy.	62.0	104.0
201601	1177	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	If the Committee is going to be in tightening mode as the year goes on, then it seems to me it would be useful to have one or two more rate increases in place to see how the federal funds rate behaves in space as it moves away from the lower bound.	62.0	104.0
201601	1178	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	If that’s not going to be the case, then it might well be appropriate and a useful signal to send as soon as the March meeting that you’re reducing the cap from $2 billion–plus to effectively $1 billion.	62.0	104.0
201601	1179	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	That might be a useful place to go.	62.0	104.0
201601	1180	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Trillion.	62.0	65.0
201601	1181	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	You’ve got to get your orders of magnitude right.	62.0	97.0
201601	1182	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	62.0	97.0
201601	1183	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Sorry.	62.0	104.0
201601	1184	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Missed some zeros.	62.0	104.0
201601	1185	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The memo asks about quarter-ends.	62.0	104.0
201601	1186	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	As far as quarter-ends go, I like using term RRP at quarter-ends.	62.0	104.0
201601	1187	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	It seems to work.	62.0	104.0
201601	1188	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I’d say, keep doing what works.	62.0	104.0
201601	1189	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Those are my comments.	62.0	104.0
201601	1190	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	104.0
201601	1191	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201601	1192	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	62.0	65.0
201601	1193	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	110.0
201601	1194	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I also would wait.	62.0	110.0
201601	1195	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Just in view of the tone of the memo and the presentation, the New York staff don’t appear to have conviction yet on judgments about these market effects.	62.0	110.0
201601	1196	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So my advice to them would be, do what you need to do to get conviction on these judgments, and that implies that it would be helpful if we had one or two more tightenings.	62.0	110.0
201601	1197	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We’ll see when and how that happens.	62.0	110.0
201601	1198	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But on the idea of doing experiments and other activities so that you can have more conviction about how much headroom you might need, it’s clear to me that, in terms of priorities, maintaining confidence that we can control the rate is paramount.	62.0	110.0
201601	1199	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I do think we need to make clear that we’re not going to accommodate all private-sector choices.	62.0	110.0
201601	1200	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We’re not here to do that.	62.0	110.0
201601	1201	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We’re here to control the rate, and accommodating all private-sector choices is not why we’re doing this.	62.0	110.0
201601	1202	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	If I had to pick a choice to gravitate to, it would probably be the high end of the staff’s low flexible cap—in the middle, $500 billion or more.	62.0	110.0
201601	1203	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But I don’t think I know enough to know, and it sounds like the staff don’t yet know quite enough to know.	62.0	110.0
201601	1204	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But as soon as you do have more conviction and at the point we make this decision, I’ll be asking the staff for their recommendation on all these questions, and I probably won’t give a judgment until I get their recommendation.	62.0	110.0
201601	1205	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	That will probably be the approach I’ll take.	62.0	110.0
201601	1206	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	62.0	110.0
201601	1207	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201601	1208	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	62.0	65.0
201601	1209	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	103.0
201601	1210	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I, too, appreciate the staff’s work to characterize the challenging and important tradeoffs we face with the ON RRP facility in the future.	62.0	103.0
201601	1211	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Having viewed this facility as essential to controllability of interest rates, especially at liftoff, my preference among the options discussed at this point would be to reduce the capacity of the facility as described in option 2, the low flexible cap, and I would lean toward the higher end of that range.	62.0	103.0
201601	1212	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	This option would maintain adequate headroom for markets to have confidence about the availability of the facility while credibly communicating our original intention that the capacity be elevated only temporarily at liftoff to support policy implementation, and that it would be appropriate to reduce the capacity fairly soon after liftoff.	62.0	103.0
201601	1213	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Regarding quarter-end pressures, it is not clear to me that we should react with this facility.	62.0	103.0
201601	1214	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Missing our target funds rate on one or two days because of these pressures would not seem to have material policy implications, notwithstanding the counsel that Simon provided during our previous discussion.	62.0	103.0
201601	1215	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	But to the degree that such pressures proved persistent, I would not object to a temporary increase in the cap as proposed under the low flexible cap option or offering term RRPs.	62.0	103.0
201601	1216	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	For communication, I would explain the change in the capacity of the facility as the result of a successful liftoff of the target funds rate from its effective lower bound.	62.0	103.0
201601	1217	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	And in the future, the capacity should be no greater than what is required to achieve an effective floor under money market rates.	62.0	103.0
201601	1218	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I see such an approach as consistent with our stated intention of, in the longer run, holding no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.	62.0	103.0
201601	1219	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Given our experience with successful liftoff, I believe it would be appropriate to reduce the capacity of the facility as early as our March meeting.	62.0	103.0
201601	1220	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I would signal that intention in the minutes of this meeting.	62.0	103.0
201601	1221	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	62.0	103.0
201601	1222	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201601	1223	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	62.0	65.0
201601	1224	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	88.0
201601	1225	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In answer to the question of how to approach reducing aggregate capacity of the overnight reverse repo facility, I prefer to think a little beyond a single choice from the menu proposed.	62.0	88.0
201601	1226	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I have the working assumption that the goal is to largely phase out the facility over time, in keeping with our 2014 statement on normalization principles and plans.	62.0	88.0
201601	1227	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	At liftoff, I was in favor of prioritizing monetary control and fully supported the lifting of the cap.	62.0	88.0
201601	1228	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	However, I do have some concern that a decision to continue running a very large facility for a prolonged period entails nontrivial financial stability risk.	62.0	88.0
201601	1229	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In addition, such a policy might incent or enable changes in money markets that might make it much more difficult to reduce or phase out the facility in the future.	62.0	88.0
201601	1230	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	With these thoughts in mind, I favor thinking in terms of a sequence of steps or a strategy, if you will, for gradually reducing the footprint of the facility in a manner that places strong emphasis on monetary control.	62.0	88.0
201601	1231	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	As an illustration and illustration only, I envision a process that could go something like this.	62.0	88.0
201601	1232	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Begin by implementing a high cap accompanied by communications to establish the expectation of a ratcheting down to an ultimate phaseout.	62.0	88.0
201601	1233	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I think it would make sense to maintain that cap through at least the next rate increase as a conservative approach to managing monetary control risk.	62.0	88.0
201601	1234	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Assuming things go well and the funds rate trades in the desired range, at the subsequent meeting we can move to a lower flexible cap.	62.0	88.0
201601	1235	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	It makes some sense to me to test the headroom effects following a meeting that does not involve the confounding effects of a rate increase.	62.0	88.0
201601	1236	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	If monetary control seems well established with a lower flexible cap, I see making a subsequent further step that’s not offered as an option in the memo—specifically, at the next rate increase, I’d prefer to leave the overnight reverse repo rate unchanged, thereby widening the spread between the IOER and reverse repo rates.	62.0	88.0
201601	1237	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I think this step will be necessary to truly test how necessary the overnight reverse repo facility is to maintaining control over the funds rate.	62.0	88.0
201601	1238	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Once we’ve tested the waters with a wider spread, we can evaluate next steps in terms of fixing the cap or implementing further increases in the spread and whether to phase out the program entirely or retain some residual facility.	62.0	88.0
201601	1239	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The latter—some small but continuing overnight reverse repo operations—might be desirable as we work through the long-run framework questions and consider some of the regulatory and market changes noted in the staff memo.	62.0	88.0
201601	1240	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I offer these specifics as an example of what a longer-view strategy might look like.	62.0	88.0
201601	1241	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I would certainly be open to other paths and options.	62.0	88.0
201601	1242	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The important point is that we not think of the next move with the facility as a one-off decision.	62.0	88.0
201601	1243	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We should have in mind what we intend to do over several steps down the road and communicate our plans to the market.	62.0	88.0
201601	1244	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	88.0
201601	1245	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201601	1246	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	62.0	65.0
201601	1247	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	102.0
201601	1248	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The normalization strategy and principles that we laid out some time ago have worked according to plan, and I don’t see any signs in recent market behavior that would suggest any change in our approach.	62.0	102.0
201601	1249	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I emphasize here that by “approach,”	62.0	102.0
201601	1250	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m referring to both our September 2014 and our March 2015 communications that the ON RRP facility will be temporarily elevated at liftoff, but that the capacity will be reduced fairly soon after policy firming and that it’s a temporary program.	62.0	102.0
201601	1251	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The success in maintaining monetary control is a testament to the thorough testing of our normalization tools—a good example of practice makes perfect.	62.0	102.0
201601	1252	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In light of this success, I would continue along the path we’ve laid out.	62.0	102.0
201601	1253	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Our next step should be to start lowering the cap on the ON RRP facility to reduce financial stability risks associated with possible surges in demand.	62.0	102.0
201601	1254	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think option 1 provides for a prudent reduction that still should provide ample headroom to maintain monetary control.	62.0	102.0
201601	1255	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	When the appropriate time comes, I would be comfortable with reducing the cap to $800 billion or $1 trillion.	62.0	102.0
201601	1256	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think we can take this step fairly soon—in the language of our earlier communications, in the next few meetings.	62.0	102.0
201601	1257	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Obviously, waiting until March quarter-end might be useful.	62.0	102.0
201601	1258	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t think we should necessarily wait until the next rate increase.	62.0	102.0
201601	1259	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree completely with Governors Tarullo and Powell that in making that step, we want to communicate that this is only a first step and not the end of a process, and that further decreases in the cap will be forthcoming.	62.0	102.0
201601	1260	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that’s an important part of the communication regarding option 1.	62.0	102.0
201601	1261	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Over time, we can lower the cap for the ON RRP facility further.	62.0	102.0
201601	1262	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, there’s no rush to take that step.	62.0	102.0
201601	1263	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We should collect more information along the way to make sure that we’re on the right track.	62.0	102.0
201601	1264	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Assuming all goes well, additional reductions would be warranted after we’ve observed market behavior following further rate hikes.	62.0	102.0
201601	1265	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In addition, as we lower the cap further, term RRPs could or should provide a good supplementary tool to deal with quarter-end spikes in demand, if needed.	62.0	102.0
201601	1266	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In this regard, we’ve had a good discussion about whether that’s necessary or really important.	62.0	102.0
201601	1267	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do think that the term RRP tool has shown to be a pretty elegant solution to this issue.	62.0	102.0
201601	1268	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Once we get to the point at which the cap is much smaller, using the term RRP seems to be a useful way to deal with quarter-end issues and spikes in demand.	62.0	102.0
201601	1269	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	When we decide to make these adjustments, communicating clearly with the public that these are natural steps in the normalization strategy that we’ve already explained is going to be very important.	62.0	102.0
201601	1270	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We want to convey that our approach has been successful, and that’s why we’re continuing to follow that in a well-designed strategy.	62.0	102.0
201601	1271	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Importantly, communication we give following these changes should, as always, stress their technical nature and emphasize that monetary policy is focused on the setting of the federal funds rate and that all of these other things that are happening in the background are being done in support of monetary control and our other objectives.	62.0	102.0
201601	1272	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	62.0	102.0
201601	1273	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	62.0	65.0
201601	1274	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	62.0	65.0
201601	1275	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	111.0
201601	1276	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I think the memos and the staff briefing on this discussion show that we have a lot more to learn about this program, and so I’m in the camp of many of you that there’s no rush.	62.0	111.0
201601	1277	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Let’s learn more.	62.0	111.0
201601	1278	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Let’s get more experience before we make any changes.	62.0	111.0
201601	1279	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	To me, it’s fundamental that we have a better view of the long-run operating framework.	62.0	111.0
201601	1280	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	That’s a pretty fundamental decision for the Committee.	62.0	111.0
201601	1281	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And, for me, having more information about how this tool works and having a better view of the long-run operating framework will be important in informing the ultimate judgment of what this tool looks like.	62.0	111.0
201601	1282	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	If pushed today, I’d say I’m in favor of option 1 or option 2.	62.0	111.0
201601	1283	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	But waiting is probably my stronger preference.	62.0	111.0
201601	1284	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	62.0	111.0
201601	1285	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201601	1286	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	62.0	65.0
201601	1287	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	107.0
201601	1288	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Again, I want to extend my compliments to the staff on their execution of liftoff, which was really outstanding.	62.0	107.0
201601	1289	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The control over rates has been as strong as any of us could have wished.	62.0	107.0
201601	1290	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The strength of the monetary control so far can be ascribed in no small part to the floor that’s been provided by the ample capacity of the ON RRP.	62.0	107.0
201601	1291	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And for this reason, I think it’s still premature to implement changes to the cap.	62.0	107.0
201601	1292	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Although the activity of the ON RRP has been quite close to pre-liftoff norms so far, it’s only six weeks since liftoff, and there’s still substantial uncertainty about how our rate control might evolve as normalization proceeds.	62.0	107.0
201601	1293	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I’m particularly attentive to how both the activity of the ON RRP and the support for the funds rate provided by the ON RRP facility change as we move farther away from the effective lower bound.	62.0	107.0
201601	1294	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	For that reason, I prefer deferring changes to the ON RRP cap until normalization is well under way.	62.0	107.0
201601	1295	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Indeed, this would seem to be pretty consonant with market expectations.	62.0	107.0
201601	1296	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Of the three options presented in the staff memo, I prefer setting a high cap as a first step, as outlined in option 1.	62.0	107.0
201601	1297	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	At the stage of normalization at which we find ourselves, as you can probably infer, my highest priority remains monetary control.	62.0	107.0
201601	1298	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	For that reason, I think option 1 has the best monetary control properties—certainly better than option 3, which would sacrifice control for a smaller footprint.	62.0	107.0
201601	1299	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Compared with option 2, option 1 is both easier to explain and easier to implement, which I view as strong virtues in policymaking.	62.0	107.0
201601	1300	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s not obvious that the cap in option 2 could be adjusted in as timely and accurate a manner as would be necessary to maintain the level of monetary control that I think is important.	62.0	107.0
201601	1301	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, I do think it’s helpful to remind market participants that the heightened capacity of the ON RRP is temporary in order to guard against a permanent change in the structure of money markets, which I would view as very undesirable.	62.0	107.0
201601	1302	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	A reflection of this discussion in the minutes should accomplish this goal.	62.0	107.0
201601	1303	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	107.0
201601	1304	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201601	1305	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	62.0	65.0
201601	1306	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	108.0
201601	1307	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Like everyone else, I’d like to congratulate the staff, both the New York Federal Reserve staff and the Board staff, on the work done and the quality of the paper we received, which is both thorough and interesting.	62.0	108.0
201601	1308	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And, of course, I’d also like to congratulate them on the success of the operation of our new method of monetary control, which was faced with a pretty strong stress test in the first six weeks of its operation—at least the past three weeks of its operation—as the market seemed to be less than stable, and it didn’t seem to spread over to the use of the RRP facility.	62.0	108.0
201601	1309	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	One of the benefits of going very near the end is that everything that should be said has been said.	62.0	108.0
201601	1310	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Not everyone has said it.	62.0	97.0
201601	1311	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	62.0	97.0
201601	1312	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	It just remains to decide which of the excellent interventions to reference, and I reference President Evans’s approach, which is similar to what a lot of other people suggested.	62.0	108.0
201601	1313	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think, as many have said, that after six weeks, it’s a good time to start changing things.	62.0	108.0
201601	1314	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	A lot can happen, and we want to make sure that this facility and the way we’re operating it is really capable of doing what it’s done so far, and it’s only further experience that will be able to tell us that.	62.0	108.0
201601	1315	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I also have some sympathy for the view that it could be useful to retain a small facility at the end, but that’s an issue that we can discuss nearer the time.	62.0	108.0
201601	1316	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	What I’d like to see is what I think President Evans said, which is a move—most people say in the second quarter, I think it could be the end of the second quarter, possibly the third quarter—to option 1.	62.0	108.0
201601	1317	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Then, as time goes by, and as we get more and more confident in our use of it, begin reducing the cap in a fairly steady way over the course of time and then phase it out, with the question of whether there should be some capacity left to carry out these operations.	62.0	108.0
201601	1318	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	As we move to the hard cap, I do think that we’ll have to either accept the use of term RRP or allow ourselves not to hit the target federal funds rate on a couple of days in each quarter and possibly more at the end of the year.	62.0	108.0
201601	1319	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	But this is clearly something that’s working, and it seems to me there’s probably an interesting question as to what comes next, adjusting the RRP or stopping repurchases of maturing assets in the portfolio.	62.0	108.0
201601	1320	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We haven’t talked about those two things together, and each of them could be regarded as capable of creating some noise in the system that we ought to find a way of coordinating.	62.0	108.0
201601	1321	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	108.0
201601	1322	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	62.0	65.0
201601	1323	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And, finally, Vice Chairman.	62.0	65.0
201601	1324	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	96.0
201601	1325	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, I think the consensus around the table is that the overnight reverse repo facility is working well, and that we’re pleased by how solid the flow has been, even as the take-up has been quite modest.	62.0	96.0
201601	1326	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	To me, that seems like the best of both worlds.	62.0	96.0
201601	1327	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We have monetary policy control, and we have a modest footprint.	62.0	96.0
201601	1328	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That suggests to me that there’s little urgency to make changes at this time.	62.0	96.0
201601	1329	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Why not learn more and proceed relatively slowly?	62.0	96.0
201601	1330	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It doesn’t seem like there’s any rush in terms of market expectations, either.	62.0	96.0
201601	1331	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We saw in the survey results that there’s a wide range of expectations among market participants, and I deliberately asked Lorie a question about whether they were waiting with a lot of interest to see how we were going to answer this question, and the answer seems to be, “Not really.”	62.0	96.0
201601	1332	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	This is not something that we need to resolve quickly because there’s a big question in the marketplace.	62.0	96.0
201601	1333	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, I think there’s some uncertainty about how the facility usage is going to evolve over time, and I’m sympathetic with the staff memo that suggests that, most likely, it’s going to rise rather than fall, everything else being equal, with money market fund reform and possible future regulatory changes the major factors.	62.0	96.0
201601	1334	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	For that reason, because we don’t know really how high demand is going to get over time, I favor option 1, a relatively high cap.	62.0	96.0
201601	1335	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think a high cap has tremendous benefits, and this goes back to something that Governor Brainard said.	62.0	96.0
201601	1336	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s much less drama, and there are fewer communications problems, if you have a high cap.	62.0	96.0
201601	1337	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	You don’t need to have term RRP at the end of quarter-ends to accommodate temporary surges in demand at quarter-end.	62.0	96.0
201601	1338	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	You don’t have to explain why you’re paying higher interest rates on term RRP, rather than using the lower rates that are on the overnight RRP.	62.0	96.0
201601	1339	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	You don’t have to adjust the cap up and down as demand fluctuates.	62.0	96.0
201601	1340	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me that having a high cap, at least for a while, seems like a very simple and straightforward way to proceed.	62.0	96.0
201601	1341	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, I do recognize that having a relatively high cap could lead to issues in terms of footprint and financial stability, and so the question is, how big are those risks?	62.0	96.0
201601	1342	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	On the footprint issue, I think we’ve already had some success in addressing this.	62.0	96.0
201601	1343	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	As long as we make it clear in the minutes that this is not a facility that’s going to be around indefinitely, that can continue to damp expectations about the ability to develop your business plans to adjust to the idea of an overnight RRP facility being around for some time.	62.0	96.0
201601	1344	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	At the current time, I don’t think the footprint issue is really very significant.	62.0	96.0
201601	1345	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That could, obviously, change.	62.0	96.0
201601	1346	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If it were to change in the future, then I think we would have to think more seriously about doing something in terms of the cap or in terms of changing the spread between the overnight RRP rate and the IOER rate in the future, but there’s no need to address this right now.	62.0	96.0
201601	1347	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the financial stability risk, as I understand the concern, it’s that if we had a high-capacity overnight RRP facility, there could be a big flight out of short-term private debt instruments, and that could put upward pressure on the interest rates for those instruments.	62.0	96.0
201601	1348	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I personally don’t see this as a huge risk.	62.0	96.0
201601	1349	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	While we could see some upward pressure on other money market rates, this should be at least partly offset by the fact that if there is an overnight RRP facility that has lots of headroom, you also have a place to flee to.	62.0	96.0
201601	1350	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The fact that there is a place to flee to means that you don’t have as much incentive to run at the first sign of trouble, because it’s known that there’s a place to go in the future should things get worse.	62.0	96.0
201601	1351	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, I think that if there was a rise in private-sector short-term rates, and if it was significant and had sufficient persistence to cause us to be worried about the implications for the economic outlook, there are other things we can do about it.	62.0	96.0
201601	1352	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We could adjust monetary policy.	62.0	96.0
201601	1353	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I suspect that in a circumstance in which there really was a large amount of funds flooding into the overnight RRP, the rise in usage of the overnight RRP would not be the first concern that we would have.	62.0	96.0
201601	1354	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	There would be something else going on that we would be really focusing our attention on.	62.0	96.0
201601	1355	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of communication, I think we should continue to emphasize that we want the facility to have sufficient headroom so that the cap won’t bind, because monetary policy control is our primary focus here.	62.0	96.0
201601	1356	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If participants in the market understand that the cap is not likely to bind, that improves their bargaining power with banks.	62.0	96.0
201601	1357	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That makes banks more aggressive in bidding for funds, and that actually makes the IOER more effective in pulling up short-term rates.	62.0	96.0
201601	1358	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So there’s a real benefit of having cap capacity in the overnight RRP, even if the overnight RRP facility isn’t used that much.	62.0	96.0
201601	1359	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In addition, assuring people that there’s going to be room in the overnight RRP facility underscores our commitment to monetary policy control, and I think that’s really important, as many people have said today.	62.0	96.0
201601	1360	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to timing, I don’t see any reason to rush.	62.0	96.0
201601	1361	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not sure it should be the second quarter or the third quarter.	62.0	96.0
201601	1362	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it certainly shouldn’t be March.	62.0	96.0
201601	1363	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Let’s get more experience with the facility, and then we can figure out how to proceed.	62.0	96.0
201601	1364	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I want to talk a little bit about what President Lacker brought up, because I thought he raised an interesting set of issues.	62.0	96.0
201601	1365	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And that is, we still don’t know the answer to the question, what’s doing most of the work in pulling up short-term interest rates?	62.0	96.0
201601	1366	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Is it the IOER, or is it the overnight RRP facility?	62.0	96.0
201601	1367	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that’s an interesting issue, and so there are a couple of questions here I guess I would pose.	62.0	96.0
201601	1368	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	One question is, do we need to find out the answer to that question?	62.0	96.0
201601	1369	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, if we’re really comfortable with the overnight RRP facility, then presumably we don’t really need to try to run experiments to answer the question about whether the overnight RRP facility is doing most of the lifting, or the IOER is doing most of the lifting.	62.0	96.0
201601	1370	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, if we’re uncomfortable with the notion that we really need the overnight RRP facility to raise short-term rates, then it makes more sense to run the experiments, because I think there’s a cost to running the experiments.	62.0	96.0
201601	1371	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think the experiments are free.	62.0	96.0
201601	1372	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The point I’m trying to make here is that if the outcome of the experiments is not going to change your choices in terms of how you set the facilities, then it probably doesn’t make sense to run the experiments.	62.0	96.0
201601	1373	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But if you think the answer to the experiments could change how you use the facilities, then it probably makes sense to run the experiments.	62.0	96.0
201601	1374	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	What I’d like to do is see the staff come up with a proposal on how important it is to find out.	62.0	96.0
201601	1375	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	What are the pros and cons of running the experiments?	62.0	96.0
201601	1376	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	What are the costs of running the experiments?	62.0	96.0
201601	1377	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And if one were going to run the experiments, what’s the best experiment one could run at the lowest cost?	62.0	96.0
201601	1378	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Then we could actually have a full discussion on this topic, because I think it’s a very relevant issue.	62.0	96.0
201601	1379	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	96.0
201601	1380	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	62.0	65.0
201601	1381	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	62.0	81.0
201601	1382	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you for responding, Vice Chairman Dudley.	62.0	81.0
201601	1383	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I think we decided that we would phase it out if it’s no longer needed.	62.0	81.0
201601	1384	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It strikes me as inconsistent with the spirit of that decision to not take any steps to find out if it’s needed.	62.0	81.0
201601	1385	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	And it strikes me that it wouldn’t be that hard to do.	62.0	81.0
201601	1386	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	If we raised rates, if we raised the IOER rate a quarter point, like Eric said, raised the ON RRP rate 20 basis points, a 5 basis point increase in the spread, and the RRP rates stayed where they are in relation to IOER, we’d be able to say, “Look, we’re done,” and volume went down—that could easily happen.	62.0	81.0
201601	1387	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not arguing against running the experiment.	62.0	96.0
201601	1388	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I misunderstood you.	62.0	81.0
201601	1389	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But we first have to answer the question, what is the experiment generating in terms of information?	62.0	96.0
201601	1390	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And will that information change your behavior in terms of how you use it?	62.0	96.0
201601	1391	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If you decide that the cost of the experiment is high and it’s unlikely to change how you run the facilities, then it’s probably not worth running the experiment.	62.0	96.0
201601	1392	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It might be if you decide that the cost to run the experiment is pretty low—in other words, that the staff can come up with a way of doing the experiment that’s not really hard to communicate to markets, and we don’t confuse people about what our intentions are or about how we’re ranking monetary control versus footprint versus financial stability.	62.0	96.0
201601	1393	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s all I’m saying.	62.0	96.0
201601	1394	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not arguing against running the experiment.	62.0	96.0
201601	1395	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we also need to think about the question, what are you going to gain from running the experiment, and how is it going to affect your behavior?	62.0	96.0
201601	1396	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair, those are perfectly sensible principles.	62.0	81.0
201601	1397	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I totally agree.	62.0	81.0
201601	1398	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	What’s at stake here is whether we have a facility or not.	62.0	81.0
201601	1399	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	What’s at stake here is a couple hundred billion dollars of money market fund allocations and where they go—whether they go to us or somewhere else.	62.0	81.0
201601	1400	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I think that suggests that the stakes are quite enough to motivate some experiments.	62.0	81.0
201601	1401	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I join you in urging the staff to bring us some plans for experimentation.	62.0	81.0
201601	1402	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201601	1403	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’ve had a very good round of comment and discussion.	62.0	65.0
201601	1404	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me join others in thanking the staff, first, for flawless execution of liftoff and, second, for an excellent memo.	62.0	65.0
201601	1405	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’ve had a rich discussion.	62.0	65.0
201601	1406	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	As usual, we’ll go off and contemplate what the appropriate next steps or options might be.	62.0	65.0
201601	1407	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think there is some degree of agreement—obviously not complete—but, as in the past, my guess is, we’ll go back and try to narrow options and respond to what we’ve heard and try to work our way forward to a decision about how to proceed.	62.0	65.0
201601	1408	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest we take a break.	62.0	65.0
201601	1409	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Do we need to ratify the open market operations?	63.0	108.0
201601	1410	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Oh, I’m sorry.	63.0	65.0
201601	1411	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We do.	63.0	65.0
201601	1412	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	63.0	65.0
201601	1413	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I appreciate that.	63.0	65.0
201601	1414	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Before we break, we need to ratify open market operations.	63.0	65.0
201601	1415	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Can I have a motion?	63.0	65.0
201601	1416	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	63.0	108.0
201601	1417	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	63.0	65.0
201601	1418	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	63.0	65.0
201601	1419	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	52.0	65.0
201601	1420	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s take a 20-minute break.	52.0	65.0
201601	1422	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s resume.	52.0	65.0
201601	1423	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Brian has something for you.	51.0	65.0
201601	1424	2016-01-27	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	51.0	999.0
201601	1425	2016-01-27	meeting	MADIGAN	I apologize, but I misstated the name of the person proposed as associate economist by Vice Chairman Dudley.	51.0	999.0
201601	1426	2016-01-27	meeting	MADIGAN	The individual that Vice Chairman Dudley proposes is Jonathan McCarthy rather than James McAndrews.	51.0	999.0
201601	1427	2016-01-27	meeting	MADIGAN	Again, I apologize for this error.	51.0	999.0
201601	1428	2016-01-27	meeting	MADIGAN	I think the Chair would like to call for a vote on this nomination.	51.0	999.0
201601	1429	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	51.0	65.0
201601	1430	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Do I have a motion?	51.0	65.0
201601	1431	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	51.0	108.0
201601	1432	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	51.0	65.0
201601	1433	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And I assume without objection.	51.0	65.0
201601	1434	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	51.0	65.0
201601	1435	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Now let’s move on to our briefings on the “Economic and Financial Situation,” and today we’re going to start with Steve Kamin.	11.0	65.0
201601	1436	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Thank you, Chair Yellen.	11.0	999.0
201601	1437	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	I will be referring to the materials titled “Material for the International Outlook.”	11.0	999.0
201601	1438	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	As Simon has discussed, this is the second time in six months that concerns about a steep devaluation of the Chinese renminbi and related fears of a hard landing in China have roiled international markets.	11.0	999.0
201601	1439	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Admittedly, finding anything comforting to say about the world economy right now is as challenging as finding a carton of milk or loaf of bread in a local grocery store.	11.0	999.0
201601	1440	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	But nevertheless, as in September, our sense is that, in an environment of fragile global economic growth and pronounced anxieties about deflationary pressures, investors are being driven more by heightened concerns about downside risks than by tangible evidence of a sharp deterioration in the baseline outlook.	11.0	999.0
201601	1441	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	To begin with, incoming data since your previous meeting do not suggest any steep falloff in Chinese output.	11.0	999.0
201601	1442	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	As indicated by the solid red line in panel 1, GDP growth stayed strong at 7 percent in the fourth quarter, higher than our December projection.	11.0	999.0
201601	1443	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	The announced figure was very much in line with our nowcasting model, the blue line, which predicts Chinese GDP using data on contemporaneous industrial production, retail sales, and imports.	11.0	999.0
201601	1444	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	All told, we see no evidence that Chinese GDP is slowing more precipitously than official figures would suggest, and our baseline forecast remains one of only gradually slowing growth—in line with slowing potential output—in the years to come.	11.0	999.0
201601	1445	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Later in my remarks, I will return to the question of downside risks to this reasonably benign outlook.	11.0	999.0
201601	1446	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	The future path of the renminbi is, frankly, a more difficult issue.	11.0	999.0
201601	1447	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	The authorities are struggling to achieve multiple objectives:  (1) containing appreciation of the trade- weighted renminbi that would accompany a further rise in the dollar; (2) preventing a large, disorderly depreciation of the currency; (3) maintaining reserves amid strengthening capital outflows; and (4) giving market forces a greater role in the foreign exchange market.	11.0	999.0
201601	1448	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	The mutual inconsistency of some of these goals, plus the failure of the Chinese authorities to articulate clearly their strategy and objectives, has confused markets.	11.0	999.0
201601	1449	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, when the PBOC allowed the currency to depreciate at a faster pace at the start of the year, investors took this as a sign that a much larger depreciation might be in the offing.	11.0	999.0
201601	1450	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	We believe that the current level of the renminbi is not fundamentally overvalued, but that downward pressures on the currency will continue as long as investors worry that the economy is falling into recession and that the authorities will allow—or even welcome—substantial further depreciation.	11.0	999.0
201601	1451	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, as indicated in panel 2, we are assuming that the renminbi will depreciate a little further—both against the dollar and the authorities’ own announced basket of currencies, the multilateral index shown in red—through the middle of the year.	11.0	999.0
201601	1452	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	By that time, assuming that our forecast materializes that there will be still- solid Chinese growth , capital outflows should settle down and the currency stabilize.	11.0	999.0
201601	1453	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	However, more bumps on this road are likely, and again, as I will discuss momentarily, more extreme outcomes are certainly possible.	11.0	999.0
201601	1454	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Besides concerns about China, the further steep plunge in oil prices shown in panel 3 has also roiled global financial markets.	11.0	999.0
201601	1455	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Part of that plunge was itself a reaction to the concerns about global demand triggered by the events in China, but we believe supply factors accounted for the lion’s share of the decline.	11.0	999.0
201601	1456	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Estimates of US crude oil production came in stronger than expected, inventories continued to build, and sanctions against Iran that had restrained its oil exports were finally removed.	11.0	999.0
201601	1457	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, we do not see the most recent plunge in oil prices as reflecting a sharp downgrade in global prospects.	11.0	999.0
201601	1458	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Even so, the decline in oil prices does affect the outlook.	11.0	999.0
201601	1459	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Ultimately, that decline should be a slight positive for the global economy, as income is transferred from oil-producing to oil-consuming countries that traditionally have a higher propensity to spend out of income.	11.0	999.0
201601	1460	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	But it appears to take considerable time for lower energy prices to boost consumption, whereas the hit to investment in the energy sector materializes more quickly.	11.0	999.0
201601	1461	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, over the next few quarters, the drag arising from falling oil prices on net oil exporters—the bottom set of bars in panel 4—should exceed the boost to net oil importers.	11.0	999.0
201601	1462	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	This should lower aggregate foreign growth, as some of the oil exporters, such as Canada and Mexico, have much higher trade weights in our foreign GDP aggregate than the oil importers.	11.0	999.0
201601	1463	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Moreover, even net oil importers may experience some drag if, like the United States, they have oil sectors of their own.	11.0	999.0
201601	1464	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	One question we have grappled with recently is whether the current low level of oil prices alters their economic effects.	11.0	999.0
201601	1465	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	In regard to the magnitude of the effect of falling oil prices on the energy sector, we remain uncertain.	11.0	999.0
201601	1466	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	On the one hand, if oil prices are reaching thresholds at which production and investment are unprofitable, this could cause disproportionately large declines in energy investment.	11.0	999.0
201601	1467	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	On the other hand, these thresholds are very uncertain and oil prices may already have fallen through them.	11.0	999.0
201601	1468	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	It is worth noting that in the United States, drilling and mining have already fallen by half, so the scope for further declines is limited, no matter how low oil prices go.	11.0	999.0
201601	1469	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	In other respects, however, it seems likely that as oil prices hit very low levels, the effects of their decline will prove more injurious.	11.0	999.0
201601	1470	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	For countries that are especially reliant on oil revenues, such as Russia and Saudi Arabia, budgets are becoming so stretched that sharp cutbacks in consumption seem unavoidable.	11.0	999.0
201601	1471	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Very low oil prices may also damage the balance sheets of oil-producing companies and oil-reliant governments and thus make bankruptcies and defaults more likely.	11.0	999.0
201601	1472	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Panel 5 shows our projection for foreign economic growth, taking developments in China, oil prices, and global financial markets into account.	11.0	999.0
201601	1473	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Growth in the fourth quarter fell a bit below our December Tealbook estimate, largely because Canadian growth stalled in the face of drag due to prior declines in oil prices.	11.0	999.0
201601	1474	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	For this quarter and next, we revised down the pace of expansion in Canada and other commodity producers in light of the further fall in commodity prices this year; Mexican economic growth promises to be a little softer as well, reflecting the weaker path for US manufacturing.	11.0	999.0
201601	1475	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Even so, we see foreign activity accelerating from here on out, reaching its trend pace of near 3 percent—the same as we wrote down in December— by the second half of the year.	11.0	999.0
201601	1476	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Canadian growth recovers from its oil-induced slump; lackluster growth in the euro-area firms, supported by low energy costs; and Brazil’s economy finally bottoms out.	11.0	999.0
201601	1477	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Our relatively limited markdown of the foreign outlook for the next couple of quarters might seem inconsistent with the further easing of monetary policy expected in Canada, the euro area, and Japan, as described by Simon, along with a likely postponement of liftoff in the United Kingdom.	11.0	999.0
201601	1478	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	However, with the exception of Canada, those easings appear to be motivated less by a weakening of their economies and more by further declines in inflation and inflation expectations, in part triggered by the recent plunge in oil prices, as well as by concerns about downside risks to the global outlook.	11.0	999.0
201601	1479	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, assuming foreign growth does return to trend as expected, we believe it likely that the broad real dollar—the solid black line in panel 6—will stabilize as well.	11.0	999.0
201601	1480	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	That said, our forecast path for the dollar now averages almost 3½ percent above its level in the December Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201601	1481	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Most of that revision reflects the rise in the dollar over the intermeeting period, but some additional appreciation of the dollar against the renminbi and other Asian currencies that we are now assuming also boosts the dollar’s path.	11.0	999.0
201601	1482	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Incorporating our revisions to the dollar and the outlook for foreign GDP growth since the December Tealbook, we now project a slightly greater drag arising from net exports on US GDP over most of the forecast period and a slightly greater drag of core import prices on US inflation.	11.0	999.0
201601	1483	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	But as I noted earlier, the fluctuations in global financial markets this year likely reflected concerns about extreme downside risks.	11.0	999.0
201601	1484	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	One prominent such risk, drawn from the January Tealbook and summarized in the top panel of your next exhibit, is that China’s economy experiences a hard landing that spills over to other EMEs and causes sharp disruptions in global markets.	11.0	999.0
201601	1485	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Considering China’s substantial economic and financial imbalances, as well as its increasing weight in the global economy, this scenario is hardly far-fetched.	11.0	999.0
201601	1486	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	But even so, we have calibrated the shock to be very severe:  GDP in China and other EMEs falls 7 percent below baseline—similar to during the Asia crisis; the dollar rises 15 percent, more than it did during the Asian crisis; and US corporate credit spreads, which in the 1980s and 1990s generally had been relatively impervious to EME crises, widen by 100 basis points.	11.0	999.0
201601	1487	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, we view this scenario as a tail risk rather than a likely alternative to our baseline outlook.	11.0	999.0
201601	1488	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	In the event, as evidenced by the red lines in the panels below, US GDP growth falls below 1 percent, core inflation falls to ¼ percent, and the federal funds rate moves back toward zero.	11.0	999.0
201601	1489	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	In the January Tealbook, we featured a second external downside risk to the US economy that we would regard as having a greater probability of coming to pass than a hard landing in China.	11.0	999.0
201601	1490	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	As shown in the top panel, foreign real GDP growth comes in just ½ percentage point below expectations—hardly a crisis, but enough to unnerve investors further, pushing the dollar up another 10 percent and oil prices down a further $7 per barrel.	11.0	999.0
201601	1491	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	As indicated by the blue lines below, the rise in the dollar pushes US real GDP growth down ½ percentage point while both the movements in the dollar and oil prices further delay the return of inflation toward target.	11.0	999.0
201601	1492	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	The federal funds rate still rises, but at a slower pace.	11.0	999.0
201601	1493	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	David will now continue our presentation.	11.0	999.0
201601	1494	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	I will be referring to the packet titled “The US Outlook.”	11.0	999.0
201601	1495	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Despite the recent turmoil in financial markets and some increase in the turmoil in my own stomach, our baseline outlook for real activity is only a little weaker than it was in December.	11.0	999.0
201601	1496	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	I will spend the bulk of my remarks laying out the reasons behind this outcome.	11.0	999.0
201601	1497	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Along the way, I will also note that we continue to assess the risks to our outlook for real activity as weighted to the downside, and a little more so now than six weeks ago.	11.0	999.0
201601	1498	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Starting with some of the bad news, the recent indicators of spending and production have mostly been disappointing.	11.0	999.0
201601	1499	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Panel 1 at the top of your first exhibit shows the evolution of several forecasts of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year.	11.0	999.0
201601	1500	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	The horizontal axis shows the date when a forecast was generated.	11.0	999.0
201601	1501	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	The forecasts shown here include the Board staff’s judgmental forecast as of each Tealbook closing date, as well as various model-based nowcasts generated at the Board and elsewhere in the System.	11.0	999.0
201601	1502	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from the black line, over the past few months the Board staff has successively lowered our estimate of fourth-quarter growth to the point at which it now stands at just ½ percent.	11.0	999.0
201601	1503	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Nowcasts from our dynamic factor model—the red line—have also drifted lower on net.	11.0	999.0
201601	1504	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	That said, uncertainty about what happened last quarter is still substantial as portrayed both by the dispersion in views across models maintained by staff around the Reserve Banks—which are portrayed by the blue dashed lines—as well as by the shaded region, which gives a 70 percent confidence interval around the estimate in the Board staff’s factor model.	11.0	999.0
201601	1505	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	For us on the judgmental staff at the Board, the negative surprise since the time of your December meeting has been about equally split between inventory investment and final sales.	11.0	999.0
201601	1506	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	At this point, hard evidence about first-quarter real GDP growth is sparse but, as you can see from the black line in panel 2, we do not think that last quarter’s pronounced weakness will persist, partly because non-energy inventories look to be in reasonable alignment with sales, and so inventory investment is not likely to continue declining rapidly.	11.0	999.0
201601	1507	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	That said, the various nowcasting models can support a wide range of views about what might be going on in the first quarter.	11.0	999.0
201601	1508	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Our judgment about the current state of the economy was heavily influenced by the strength of the December jobs report.	11.0	999.0
201601	1509	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	As I have mentioned before, we have been working on an ambitious program to develop a comprehensive method for combining the signal from spending, production, and labor market indicators to infer a summary measure of the economy’s cyclical position.	11.0	999.0
201601	1510	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	In panel 3, I show the cyclical indicator—essentially, an estimate of the output gap—that emerges from one model- based version of this idea.	11.0	999.0
201601	1511	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	The solid black line gives the estimated cyclical indicator, taking as given what we now know about such variables as the unemployment rate and payroll employment in the fourth quarter, along with our latest estimate of GDP growth in that quarter.	11.0	999.0
201601	1512	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	The red dashed line was constructed on the basis only of data through the third quarter and is meant to approximate what we would have estimated on the basis of the official quarterly data that were available to us at the time of your December meeting.	11.0	999.0
201601	1513	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see, the estimated cyclical position of the economy in the fourth quarter in this version of the model is completely unaffected by the addition of the fourth-quarter values.	11.0	999.0
201601	1514	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	One interpretation of what is going on is that the model is writing off much of the weak GDP information as statistical noise and instead is putting substantial weight on the strong recent labor market data, leaving the estimated cyclical indicator unrevised.	11.0	999.0
201601	1515	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	We did the same thing in the judgmental forecast albeit to a lesser degree:  Of the total signal for the output gap that we might have taken from the weak trajectory of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter, we took on board half and absorbed the other half by marking down once again our estimate of potential GDP growth in 2015—in effect, using potential GDP as a temporary parking lot for observation error until we can get a more fully articulated accounting system in place.	11.0	999.0
201601	1516	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Beyond the near term, our outlook for real output growth—shown in panel 4— and the unemployment rate—panel 5—is very little changed from our previous forecast.	11.0	999.0
201601	1517	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Current and expected financial conditions—particularly the stronger path of the dollar and lower level of equity prices over the projection period—are now less supportive of growth than they were in the December Tealbook, but the effects of these weaker financial assumptions are partly offset by the net impetus from lower oil prices.	11.0	999.0
201601	1518	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	In addition, legislation regarding some federal tax policies that the Congress passed last month implies a stance of federal fiscal policy that is slightly more expansionary than what we had penciled in at the time of our December forecast.	11.0	999.0
201601	1519	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Naturally, views will differ about whether our assessment of the underlying state of the economy is correct, and having been raised at a dinner table at which a lawyer’s adversarial mindset was the norm, I thought I would take a crack at sketching the case I would assemble if I were, alternatively, more pessimistically minded or more optimistic than in the baseline.	11.0	999.0
201601	1520	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	A more downbeat assessment of the outlook for real activity could start with the observation that December’s retail sales report was quite weak, following a stronger- than-expected reading in November.	11.0	999.0
201601	1521	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	In the baseline, we took the view that this monthly pattern may reflect a shift toward an earlier holiday shopping season, but it could instead reflect a more fundamental weakening late last year in households’ inclination to spend.	11.0	999.0
201601	1522	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Perhaps bolstering that view, while motor vehicle sales were still at a high level in December, they were not as high as we had expected, and a skeptic might be especially attentive to durable goods spending as a relatively sensitive harbinger of cyclical weakening.	11.0	999.0
201601	1523	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Moreover, indicators of activity in the industrial sector—including the various regional surveys—have continued to be downbeat.	11.0	999.0
201601	1524	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Although the industrial sector seems to have been particularly hard-hit by the stronger dollar and the reduction in oil drilling activity, industrial activity has been sluggish, even leaving those factors aside.	11.0	999.0
201601	1525	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	In the labor market, while initial claims remain low by historical standards, they have drifted up some since late last year.	11.0	999.0
201601	1526	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Finally, we could be underestimating the adverse implications of the recent tightening in financial conditions.	11.0	999.0
201601	1527	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Our baseline incorporates all of the conventional channels—for example, the effect of lower equity wealth on household spending and the effect of a stronger dollar on net exports.	11.0	999.0
201601	1528	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	But we have not allowed for any additional contribution operating through household or business confidence or disruptions of financial intermediation, nor have we assumed that financial market conditions will worsen materially, nor did we take the recent adverse financial news as an indication that market participants know something we do not know about economic prospects.	11.0	999.0
201601	1529	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Thomas will report on some models that key off of financial variables and point to an elevated risk of recession in coming quarters.	11.0	999.0
201601	1530	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	On the other hand, one could also find reasons to be more optimistic than our baseline.	11.0	999.0
201601	1531	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Most notably—as I mentioned earlier—the December labor market report was quite good:  Job gains over the fourth quarter are now estimated to have averaged 285,000 per month, and the employment-to-population ratio ticked up last month as the participation rate edged higher.	11.0	999.0
201601	1532	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	In the past several years, this has been a consistent pattern:  Labor market improvements have chugged along at a steady pace, and disappointing news about GDP growth has been an indication that we needed to downgrade further our assessment of aggregate supply conditions.	11.0	999.0
201601	1533	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	That is not great news for the living standards of future generations, but thus far it has not meant that cyclical weakness was just around the corner.	11.0	999.0
201601	1534	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	In addition, the news coming from the household sector has not been all bleak:  The Michigan measure of consumer sentiment remained at a pretty high level in early January, and the slow-but-steady recovery in housing construction still seems to be in place.	11.0	999.0
201601	1535	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	As a partial counterpoint to the estimates of an elevated risk of recession six months hence, I would point to other models suggesting that the probability that the economy was in recession last month was much lower than normal.	11.0	999.0
201601	1536	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Moreover, if I were prosecuting the optimistic case, I would note that we still do not really know what went on during the fourth quarter of last year with regard to GDP:  Even after the BEA publishes its first estimate of growth in the fourth quarter—which we will all take, in our weaker moments, as an announcement of the true outcome—the 70 percent confidence interval around that estimate will be wider than 3 percentage points.	11.0	999.0
201601	1537	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	In other words, even if the BEA validates our current guess that real GDP inched up only ½ percent at an annual rate last quarter, there would be a 15 percent chance that the actual growth rate last quarter was around 2 percent or better.	11.0	999.0
201601	1538	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Of course, the pessimist could reply that the uncertainty is two-sided, and that a decline of 1 percent or more is just as good a guess, but in light of the recent track record of the GDP data, I think the optimist would have the better side of this particular point.	11.0	999.0
201601	1539	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	The middle course that we have taken in the baseline tries to strike a balance between these two views, and I am mildly encouraged that our state-space model would have had us go even a little further in discounting the weak GDP data.	11.0	999.0
201601	1540	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Downside risks are certainly very much in vogue these days.	11.0	999.0
201601	1541	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Although picking a favorite downside risk would feel a little like having to name which is my favorite child and acknowledging the salience of the risks Steve has discussed, I would also put in a word for the scenario titled “Financial Turbulence” in the “Risks and Uncertainty” section of the Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201601	1542	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	In that scenario, we used a model developed by colleagues at FRB New York to wrestle with the potential economic implications of a significant further deterioration in financial conditions.	11.0	999.0
201601	1543	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	The beauty of the New York model is that it represents one of the few serious attempts to build in a richer interaction between the financial sector and real activity.	11.0	999.0
201601	1544	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	If we assume a substantial and sustained additional widening in credit risk spreads compared with the baseline, then this model does predict a mild recession during the first half of this year.	11.0	999.0
201601	1545	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Panels 6 and 7 summarize the inflation outlook.	11.0	999.0
201601	1546	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	I do not have much to report here, mostly because not enough time has passed yet since the December meeting to prove us very wrong.	11.0	999.0
201601	1547	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from panel 6, we have lowered our near-term projection for headline PCE inflation, largely because of the lower path of crude oil prices now anticipated by futures markets and by us.	11.0	999.0
201601	1548	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	And panel 7 shows that our near-term forecast of core PCE inflation is a little lower than in the December Tealbook, mainly because the projected path for core import prices has been revised down.	11.0	999.0
201601	1549	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Beyond the near term, though, our inflation projection is about unchanged from our previous forecast.	11.0	999.0
201601	1550	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	In the statement that you released at the conclusion of your December meeting, you cited reasonable confidence that inflation would move up to your 2 percent objective as one of the rationales for raising the funds rate by a notch.	11.0	999.0
201601	1551	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	To aid in the task of monitoring progress toward that objective, we intend to introduce in the March Tealbook a set of inflation-focused exhibits similar to the ones we used following your September 2012 meeting to track whether the substantial further improvement in labor market conditions was being achieved.	11.0	999.0
201601	1552	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Panels 8 and 9 preview two of the exhibits that we intend to use.	11.0	999.0
201601	1553	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	These two panels will decompose the cumulative revisions that we make to our inflation projection from our forecast in the December 2015 Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201601	1554	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from panel 8, we have revised down our forecast regarding top-line PCE inflation this year by nearly ½ percentage point thus far, mostly because of the further downward move in energy prices.	11.0	999.0
201601	1555	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	And as shown in panel 9, the cumulative revisions to our forecast of core PCE inflation are, not surprisingly, very small thus far and almost entirely attributable to readily identifiable factors—namely, the level of resource utilization and the pass-through of energy and import prices into core inflation.	11.0	999.0
201601	1556	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Finally, the next page updates the “Lockhart dashboard,” which summarizes the timeline of when some key indicators will become available to you at the next few FOMC meetings.	11.0	999.0
201601	1557	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	The data that will first be available at the March meeting are in the gold-shaded region, the additional observations that will become available in time for the April meeting are shaded in red, and data that will be available at the June meeting lie yet further to the right.	11.0	999.0
201601	1558	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	We expect that headline inflation will continue to run at a low level through the first part of this year—with some further negative readings on a three-month change basis—as low oil prices depress consumer energy prices, and on our reckoning, core inflation will remain below 1½ percent.	11.0	999.0
201601	1559	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	As for real activity, we expect that the labor market will keep generating solid job gains and an unemployment rate moving just below 5 percent despite the sluggish pace of GDP growth.	11.0	999.0
201601	1560	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Nellie will continue.	11.0	999.0
201601	1561	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Thank you, David.	11.0	999.0
201601	1562	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	I will be referring to the materials called “Financial Stability Developments.”	11.0	999.0
201601	1563	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Since the last financial stability briefing in October, the US financial system continued to be buffeted by some large shocks, mainly related to lower oil prices and developments in China.	11.0	999.0
201601	1564	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Risk premiums for many US assets have widened, but the domestic financial system appears not to have amplified them with forced asset sales or stresses at large financial firms.	11.0	999.0
201601	1565	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	The system’s resiliency likely reflects limited exposures and high capital in the banking system, and a gradual modest decline in leverage and less stable funding more broadly in recent quarters.	11.0	999.0
201601	1566	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	However, bigger shocks, such as a sharper slowing of global growth mentioned by Steve and David, would increase the risk of larger amplification effects.	11.0	999.0
201601	1567	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	On the first exhibit:  As Simon noted in his briefing, spreads on speculative-grade corporate bonds have risen sharply for many sectors, not just for oil firms.	11.0	999.0
201601	1568	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Moreover, spreads have risen by more than required to compensate for higher expected defaults, suggesting risk premiums also have risen significantly.	11.0	999.0
201601	1569	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	One illustration of the rise in risk premiums is the increase in far-forward spreads of about 150 basis points since mid-2014, when oil prices started to fall.	11.0	999.0
201601	1570	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	We interpret these changes to reflect changes in risk sentiment as investors likely are not revising their outlook for defaults at that horizon.	11.0	999.0
201601	1571	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	The larger increase in near-term spreads of closer to 300 basis points is more plausibly driven by both higher expected defaults and higher risk premiums.	11.0	999.0
201601	1572	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	This rise in expected defaults stems partly from the increased leverage of speculative-grade corporations.	11.0	999.0
201601	1573	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Debt has been growing rapidly for the lower-rated segment of the corporate sector, and as shown by the blue line in the top right, the debt-to-asset ratio for speculative-grade non-oil corporations has increased to a near multidecade high and has jumped recently at oil firms, the red line, as they wrote down the value of their oil reserves.	11.0	999.0
201601	1574	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	While many of these firms that issued debt in recent years have locked in lower interest rates and extended maturities, we expect some firms will be stressed as firm values fall amid the reversal in risk sentiment, making it more expensive to maintain or get new financing.	11.0	999.0
201601	1575	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Falling prices for speculative-grade bonds have been accompanied by sizable outflows at mutual funds in recent months (shown in the middle-left chart).	11.0	999.0
201601	1576	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Large redemptions for more than a year at a small high-yield mutual fund led that fund to suspend redemptions in December, an action that surprised investors.	11.0	999.0
201601	1577	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	This event highlights the tension between the offer of daily redemptions to investors and the growth of funds concentrated in less liquid assets.	11.0	999.0
201601	1578	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	We have not seen evidence of disproportionate outflows at other bond funds as a result.	11.0	999.0
201601	1579	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	We also did not see evidence of strains in market functioning at the time in the speculative-grade corporate bond market (shown to the right).	11.0	999.0
201601	1580	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	As shown in that panel, bid-ask spreads (the blue line) and average trading volumes (the black line) stayed in their normal ranges.	11.0	999.0
201601	1581	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Nonetheless, it seems quite possible that the surprise closure raised the risk of preemptive outflows in the future and forced asset sales.	11.0	999.0
201601	1582	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	The SEC proposed rules last September to improve liquidity risk management and investor disclosures at these mutual funds, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council is assessing whether potential systemic risks arising from liquidity mismatch are being addressed.	11.0	999.0
201601	1583	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	An adverse dynamic of wider risk premiums that could have broader consequences should be limited by the modest exposures and strong capital positions of banking firms.	11.0	999.0
201601	1584	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Although LISCC firms naturally have significant exposures to the corporate sector, as noted in the bottom-left panel, exposures to oil firms are not large.	11.0	999.0
201601	1585	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	The more significant concerns arising from lower oil prices would be for community banks or some regional banks in some areas of the country.	11.0	999.0
201601	1586	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	In addition, LISCC bank exposures to China, Hong Kong, and other EMEs are limited, although indirect exposures through other global banking firms could be a concern if EME troubles intensify.	11.0	999.0
201601	1587	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	These potential risks are not a complete surprise:  Last year’s stress-test scenarios featured wider corporate spreads and weak foreign growth, and they will remain features of this year’s scenarios, which will be released later this week.	11.0	999.0
201601	1588	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Leverage in other parts of the financial system is more difficult to assess, but it does not appear unusually high and may be falling modestly.	11.0	999.0
201601	1589	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Leverage at hedge funds measured based on margin credit may have turned down after the sharp jump in stock price volatility in August and the related margin calls, and more dealers reported in SCOOS in December that they had tightened somewhat the terms for securities financing and derivatives for their hedge fund clients.	11.0	999.0
201601	1590	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	In terms of oil positions, and as shown in the bottom right, the CME started to raise margins for oil futures last fall and have maintained margins at a relatively high level as price volatility has stayed high.	11.0	999.0
201601	1591	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	The staff views current margins to be conservative, on the basis of an estimated probability being low that a futures price change would exceed current margin levels.	11.0	999.0
201601	1592	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Conservative margins reduce the prospect of a near-term increase that could trigger further price declines.	11.0	999.0
201601	1593	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Exhibit 2 summarizes a broader view of financial vulnerabilities.	11.0	999.0
201601	1594	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	The table focuses on four categories of financial vulnerabilities, listed in the first column.	11.0	999.0
201601	1595	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	The current assessments for the categories, shown in the last column, are mostly “yellow,” which means we view vulnerabilities to shocks from any sources to be in the moderate range.	11.0	999.0
201601	1596	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	The staff judgments regarding the categories and overall are based on both a cyclical assessment of indicators as assessed against metrics of roughly the past 30 years as well as structural problems not captured well by time-series data.	11.0	999.0
201601	1597	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	I do not plan to talk through each line of the table but will highlight a few points.	11.0	999.0
201601	1598	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	For asset valuation pressures, we currently view them to be moderate, a step-down from the notable level in recent assessments.	11.0	999.0
201601	1599	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	As mentioned, risk spreads for corporate bonds widened materially and are now well above average, and low-rated, low-quality issuance has been abating.	11.0	999.0
201601	1600	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	In addition, the decline in stock prices has brought forward price-to-earnings ratios down, but they are above their median level of recent decades.	11.0	999.0
201601	1601	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	However, cap rates for commercial real estate through December indicate required returns continued to move down and are very close to or near levels near their previous boom in 2007.	11.0	999.0
201601	1602	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Although cap rates may be supported by low interest rates and lending terms and standards recently appear to be tightening, the continued rapid rise in prices suggests this sector warrants continued attention.	11.0	999.0
201601	1603	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	In the next category, private nonfinancial sector leverage, an increase to record- high debt ratios in the business sector led us to raise the assessment early last year from green to yellow.	11.0	999.0
201601	1604	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Although the business sector on its own might warrant a higher level, household borrowing has been very subdued, and the total private nonfinancial credit-to-GDP ratio in relation to its long-run trend is at a very low level.	11.0	999.0
201601	1605	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	In the financial sector, vulnerabilities arising from leverage are viewed to be low (shown by green), though a notch higher than the blue subdued level that would be suggested by the time-series data.	11.0	999.0
201601	1606	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Bank capital ratios are at their highest in decades, but ratios have been rising as capital has turned out to have been inadequate many times for the risks of the financial system.	11.0	999.0
201601	1607	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	In maturity and liquidity transformation, vulnerabilities also are viewed as moderate, reflecting the fact that while cyclical vulnerabilities are low, structural reforms are still incomplete.	11.0	999.0
201601	1608	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Short-term nondeposit liabilities have declined sharply in recent years and are low, especially adjusted for an upward trend.	11.0	999.0
201601	1609	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	On the structural side, the money fund reforms to address run risk are still to be implemented, as discussed earlier, and some parts of the repo and sec lending markets are very opaque.	11.0	999.0
201601	1610	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Liquidity transformation has increased, and, as noted earlier, there is work supporting reforms for mutual funds.	11.0	999.0
201601	1611	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Finally, I would note that this assessment that financial vulnerabilities overall are moderate was an input into the Board’s decision in December to affirm the level of the countercyclical capital buffer at zero.	11.0	999.0
201601	1612	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	The Board at the same time issued a proposal for comments on the framework for determining the level of the countercyclical capital buffer.	11.0	999.0
201601	1613	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	That concludes our remarks, and we would be happy to answer your questions.	11.0	999.0
201601	1614	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	12.0	65.0
201601	1615	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Two quick questions.	12.0	111.0
201601	1616	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	David, on your inflation revisions, forgive me, what’s the takeaway from panel 9?	12.0	111.0
201601	1617	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	How do we look at this, and how do we use it?	12.0	111.0
201601	1618	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	8 and 9 are components of an inflation monitor that we intend to introduce in the March Tealbook.	12.0	999.0
201601	1619	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	The first page of those exhibits is just going to show the evolution of our inflation forecasts from one Tealbook to the next and will overlay each successive forecast on top, so that if our forecast begins to drift away from what we had envisioned at the time of the December 2015 Tealbook, that will be completely evident.	12.0	999.0
201601	1620	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	And 8 and 9 will look at the cumulative revision in the inflation forecast, putting a stake in the ground at the December 2015 Tealbook.	12.0	999.0
201601	1621	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	What they’ll do is decompose in the left-hand panel the projection for top-line PCE inflation and in the right-hand panel the projection for core PCE inflation.	12.0	999.0
201601	1622	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	The decomposition in the left-hand panel is just arithmetic.	12.0	999.0
201601	1623	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	All it does is take the top-line PCE price index and decompose our forecast error into the main categories that are listed there:  food, energy, and core.	12.0	999.0
201601	1624	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	In some sense, there’s no analytical content there.	12.0	999.0
201601	1625	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	It’s just relative importance weights and an arithmetic exercise of how much each component departed from our forecast.	12.0	999.0
201601	1626	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	There is some economic content in the panel on the right-hand side because that’s based on rules of thumb that our sector analysts use, which in turn themselves are informed by model- based estimates.	12.0	999.0
201601	1627	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	What we’re trying to do is trace through the importance of changes in each of these factors for the projected behavior of core inflation.	12.0	999.0
201601	1628	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	The idea there in the right-hand panel is that what we’ll do is attempt to trace back revisions in our core PCE inflation forecast to one- level-more fundamental sources.	12.0	999.0
201601	1629	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	I’m sure that interpretations around the table will differ, probably in 19 different ways at least.	12.0	999.0
201601	1630	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	That will double-count—	12.0	999.0
201601	1631	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	But there are only 17 of us.	12.0	97.0
201601	1632	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	—two of you.	12.0	999.0
201601	1633	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	I was onto that.	12.0	999.0
201601	1634	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	At least two of you will have different views.	12.0	999.0
201601	1635	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	[Laughter]	12.0	999.0
201601	1636	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	One possible interpretation of this decomposition might be that if we’re able to trace the cumulative revision in our inflation forecast back to easily identifiable, earlier sources, like energy prices, the dollar feeding through import prices, or the pressure on economic activity— that is, the Phillips curve at work—that might not reveal any extent to which we’ve lost our handle on how the inflation mechanism is working, because those would be identifiable factors that we would understand the economic mechanism that’s at work.	12.0	999.0
201601	1637	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Now, there’s an “other” category, because it’s not going to work out in so tidy a manner.	12.0	999.0
201601	1638	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	At the moment, this “other” category is barely discernible, as we’ve only had one reading on the PCE monthly price index and one reading on the CPI since last time, but over time the “other” category will emerge, either to the upside or the downside.	12.0	999.0
201601	1639	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	My hope is that it will provide an interesting vehicle for discussion and analysis as to what’s going on, what the underlying story might be.	12.0	999.0
201601	1640	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	That’s the goal of this.	12.0	999.0
201601	1641	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	The last piece of this inflation monitor will just be a panel—currently page 27 in your data sheets—that provides a roundup of a whole bunch of different measures of longer-term inflation expectations, which play a pretty key role in our inflation analysis.	12.0	999.0
201601	1642	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	If those begin to drift one direction or the other, that’s something that would capture our attention.	12.0	999.0
201601	1643	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The second quick question I had—maybe for David or Nellie, I’m not sure—is that in the risk scenarios I found it hard to reconcile that the China hard-landing scenario did not yield a recession, but the financial market turbulence did yield a recession.	12.0	111.0
201601	1644	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	It struck me that a China hard landing would trigger financial market instability, and if that’s really what’s going to trigger a recession, China could well be it.	12.0	111.0
201601	1645	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I’m just curious if I’m off in how I’m thinking about it, or if the staff would think differently.	12.0	111.0
201601	1646	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Let me start, because the international side was responsible for that part of the scenarios.	12.0	999.0
201601	1647	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	If you look at exhibit 2 of your international outlook materials, the red line in panel 5, which is US GDP, falls on a four-quarter change basis to ½ percent.	12.0	999.0
201601	1648	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	I don’t have the actual quarterly numbers on me, but I’m pretty darn sure that that means a quarter or two of negative changes in real GDP.	12.0	999.0
201601	1649	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	In that sense, it probably is associated with at least a mild recession.	12.0	999.0
201601	1650	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Just to compare that scenario with the financial turbulence scenario, in the China hard-landing scenario, the negative effects on the US economy come mainly through trade channels—the rise in the dollar and the decline in foreign GDP.	12.0	999.0
201601	1651	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Those have a very important and material effect on the US economy, but all that being said, because the US economy is not as open to international trade as other economies, the effect is not so great.	12.0	999.0
201601	1652	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	The China hard- landing scenario does also incorporate the disruptions to US markets that do depress GDP, but obviously not as much as the financial turbulence scenario.	12.0	999.0
201601	1653	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	I’ll now pass the baton to my colleagues here.	12.0	999.0
201601	1654	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	I would only add, I think we could probably easily, in some sense, concatenate the two scenarios and get something that’s more severe to the downside from the combination of both of the factors.	12.0	999.0
201601	1655	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	And I think it’s realistic to envision that the kind of financial turbulence that we have in that scenario would result from the China scenario.	12.0	999.0
201601	1656	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	And that’s a pretty common type of additional exercise that you do with these, right, when you’re looking for an extra kick from spillovers.	12.0	91.0
201601	1657	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	I’ll add one more point.	12.0	999.0
201601	1658	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	When we were looking at the financial linkages between the United States and China, and the EMEs, most of the linkages are economic—trade and the dollar—so that’s where the biggest linkages in the scenario are, as you would expect.	12.0	999.0
201601	1659	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	The linkages between the financial institutions in the United States and China and the EMEs are pretty limited.	12.0	999.0
201601	1660	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Your first scenario would not entail a lot of distress in the US financial markets from this, but, clearly, that could be added.	12.0	999.0
201601	1661	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker, did you have a two-hander?	12.0	65.0
201601	1662	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Yes, it was a two-hander.	12.0	81.0
201601	1663	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Because it appears as if charts like number 9 might make more visits to the Committee, I wanted to follow up on President Kashkari’s question and ask something that I’ve wanted to ask you for a while.	12.0	81.0
201601	1664	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	You have apportioned this: resource utilization, energy prices, and import prices.	12.0	81.0
201601	1665	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	In our standard models, we often think of monetary policy as related to inflation.	12.0	81.0
201601	1666	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	In fact, in the standard textbook models, an impulse from monetary policy affects both prices and, to the extent that there are monetary nonneutralities or something that gives rise to the Phillips curve, simultaneously real activity and real resource utilization.	12.0	81.0
201601	1667	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I’m wondering how you want us to think about attributing inflation to resource utilization, when in the standard models it’s just a correlate of inflation.	12.0	81.0
201601	1668	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We usually think about it in terms of monetary impulses affecting both—sometimes not real things, sometimes real things.	12.0	81.0
201601	1669	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Is that clear?	12.0	81.0
201601	1670	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Do you understand the question?	12.0	81.0
201601	1671	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It’s a puzzle, more or less.	12.0	81.0
201601	1672	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Well, this is quite a standard New Keynesian Phillips curve kind of framework.	12.0	999.0
201601	1673	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Monetary policy is relevant because it influences the thrust of aggregate demand, and that influences, in turn, the level of resource utilization.	12.0	999.0
201601	1674	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	As well, monetary policy operates very importantly on inflation through the exchange rate and setting the terms of trade.	12.0	999.0
201601	1675	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	So monetary policy is very much present here through two different channels:  One is the thrust of economic activity, and the other is the import price channel.	12.0	999.0
201601	1676	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Now, I don’t know what else I can say.	12.0	999.0
201601	1677	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	I’m looking back to Dave Reifschneider.	12.0	999.0
201601	1678	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	What would you add to that?	12.0	999.0
201601	1679	2016-01-27	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	I’d add two things.	12.0	999.0
201601	1680	2016-01-27	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	One, there’s a third channel—expectations.	12.0	999.0
201601	1681	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201601	1682	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Right.	12.0	999.0
201601	1683	2016-01-27	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	I would say your point is correct, in that some of the explanatory variables for inflation—say, resource utilization or marginal costs or something like that—are determined by monetary policy, but they’re determined by many other things as well.	12.0	999.0
201601	1684	2016-01-27	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	And the accounting exercise that David was talking about isn’t trying to take everything back to every single ultimate cause, which would include what’s up with Chinese economic growth, what the European Central Bank’s monetary policy is, and yada, yada, yada.	12.0	999.0
201601	1685	2016-01-27	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	It’s stopping at an earlier point than that.	12.0	999.0
201601	1686	2016-01-27	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	Yes, it’s stopping at an earlier point, and it’s using some things that are clearly endogenous, like slack.	12.0	999.0
201601	1687	2016-01-27	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	But in the accounting mechanisms, in the New Keynesian Phillips curve, they are direct drivers of inflation.	12.0	999.0
201601	1688	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	So the puzzle is that this makes it seem as if it’s the case that if monetary policy did not affect real activity, it wouldn’t affect inflation, whereas in our models, that’s a case in which it does affect inflation.	12.0	81.0
201601	1689	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	That’s the puzzle for me.	12.0	81.0
201601	1690	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s still the inflation expectations channel, right?	12.0	96.0
201601	1691	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Forget expectations.	12.0	81.0
201601	1692	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	In the standard model, if the Phillips curve is vertical, it affects inflation, even though it doesn’t affect real activity.	12.0	81.0
201601	1693	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	There’s an aggregate supply relationship in there, which is this Phillips curve mechanism between the level of utilization and inflation.	12.0	65.0
201601	1694	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And according to their estimates, that relationship, at least at the moment, is, and has been, quite flat.	12.0	65.0
201601	1695	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But in the world you’re talking about, the relationship could be quite steep.	12.0	65.0
201601	1696	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	The influence of utilization on inflation could be, in some world, very large, in which case monetary policy, when you incorporate that into a model, would mainly raise inflation and have very little effect on utilization.	12.0	65.0
201601	1697	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	That would be a vertical Phillips curve.	12.0	65.0
201601	1698	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	That’s not in any way the estimates that you are basing this on, but it could be, so I don’t think there’s any conceptual puzzle here.	12.0	65.0
201601	1699	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t think so.	12.0	999.0
201601	1700	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	12.0	65.0
201601	1701	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I think it’s a two-hander, because at least it’s on the same dashboard topic.	12.0	91.0
201601	1702	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	But another factor that could show up here—you mentioned the inflation expectations table, but, presumably, one thing that’s underlying this is, you’ve got your price-inflation Phillips curve with the additional transitory variables that show up here and other things.	12.0	91.0
201601	1703	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	But you’ve also got the inflation attractor, if I understand that right.	12.0	91.0
201601	1704	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	So part of the forecast, the last time I remember looking at it, was, you’ve got that at something like 1.8 percent, and it’s expected to go up at some point, possibly within the forecast horizon.	12.0	91.0
201601	1705	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Beginning of 2018.	12.0	999.0
201601	1706	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	So if that doesn’t happen, that would show up as one of these yellow factors?	12.0	91.0
201601	1707	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	That’s right.	12.0	999.0
201601	1708	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	12.0	91.0
201601	1709	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	So to the extent that the yellow all of a sudden gets big, it is like other things are at work, and we might be behind.	12.0	91.0
201601	1710	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Right.	12.0	999.0
201601	1711	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	So if the yellow region begins to emerge, what we would do at that point is caucus among ourselves—	12.0	999.0
201601	1712	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Break out the yellow region.	12.0	96.0
201601	1713	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	—engage in some analysis of the yellow region and see whether we had some readily attributable underlying factors there, or come back to the Committee and say, “Gee, we don’t know.	12.0	999.0
201601	1714	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	There is something at work in the inflation mechanism that we can’t square with our analytical framework.”	12.0	999.0
201601	1715	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Now, there will be a lot of different analytical frameworks brought to the table.	12.0	999.0
201601	1716	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	And so what might be of concern in our framework might be understandable in others, but the goal here is to try to provide one metric where, applying our pretty mechanical rules of thumb, you’ll be able to keep score at home and see whether things are drifting away from the narrative that we had in place as of the time of the December 2015 projection.	12.0	999.0
201601	1717	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	12.0	91.0
201601	1718	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions?	12.0	65.0
201601	1719	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	12.0	65.0
201601	1720	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	94.0
201601	1721	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I just had a question about the jobs numbers on the Key Economic Indicators exhibit.	12.0	94.0
201601	1722	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I guess you penciled in 238,000 for the three months in the first quarter of 2016 for nonfarm payrolls, and I notice the Tealbook had the year averaging more than 200,000.	12.0	94.0
201601	1723	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I just wonder if I could get you to talk a little bit about where the risks on that part of the forecast are.	12.0	94.0
201601	1724	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	It seems high to me, but I’m willing to listen to explanations.	12.0	94.0
201601	1725	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think we’ve been telling a story that we expect job growth to slow down, but this really sounds like it’s still going to be a banner year in 2016.	12.0	94.0
201601	1726	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I guess that’s my general feeling.	12.0	94.0
201601	1727	2016-01-27	meeting	WASCHER	We’re basically taking some signal from 2015.	12.0	999.0
201601	1728	2016-01-27	meeting	WASCHER	The strong job growth and the modest pace of GDP growth has been a feature of the economy for a while, and we have those trends extending into 2016, particularly in the first half of the year.	12.0	999.0
201601	1729	2016-01-27	meeting	WASCHER	And then over the second half, we have monthly employment increases slowing down to about 160,000 or so.	12.0	999.0
201601	1730	2016-01-27	meeting	WASCHER	So, yes, it’s still good job growth with moderate GDP growth.	12.0	999.0
201601	1731	2016-01-27	meeting	WASCHER	Again, that’s what we’ve been seeing.	12.0	999.0
201601	1732	2016-01-27	meeting	WASCHER	Now, I suppose I can see risks on both sides.	12.0	999.0
201601	1733	2016-01-27	meeting	WASCHER	We’ve underpredicted job growth in the past, and so that might argue for a higher number, not a slowdown.	12.0	999.0
201601	1734	2016-01-27	meeting	WASCHER	On the other hand, with the modest pace of GDP growth, and if you felt productivity was going to pick up toward a faster trend, you might expect a sharper slowing in job growth.	12.0	999.0
201601	1735	2016-01-27	meeting	WASCHER	So I guess we view this as relatively balanced, a view reflected in our forecast of GDP growth.	12.0	999.0
201601	1736	2016-01-27	meeting	WASCHER	The other risk I would note is that we see the balance of risks for real activity as weighted to the downside, and that might argue for thinking about the risk to employment growth as weighted to the downside.	12.0	999.0
201601	1737	2016-01-27	meeting	WASCHER	But in view of our path for GDP growth, I think the risks of our employment forecasts seem reasonably balanced to me.	12.0	999.0
201601	1738	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	12.0	65.0
201601	1739	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	88.0
201601	1740	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	This is a financial stability question for Nellie.	12.0	88.0
201601	1741	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	One thing that has gotten my attention recently are media reports and commentary linking global equity market declines to the selling activity of sovereign wealth funds, particularly the sovereign wealth funds of oil- and gas-producing countries.	12.0	88.0
201601	1742	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	After looking into the issue, there seems to be some evidence for a reduction in holdings in foreign assets, but it seems much more difficult to determine if these reductions could be directly contributing to the declines in equity markets or indirectly influencing a risk-off environment by large investors more broadly.	12.0	88.0
201601	1743	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	So my question is, has the staff done any work on, or given any thought to, the potential role of sovereign wealth funds in the recent equity market declines and, maybe more broadly, the increasing correlation of oil and risk-asset markets—which seems to be a new development?	12.0	88.0
201601	1744	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Let me just say a couple things about sovereign wealth funds.	12.0	999.0
201601	1745	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	It is something we’re currently learning more about.	12.0	999.0
201601	1746	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	I would say that, six months ago, we thought of sovereign wealth funds like endowments:  They are private pools of capital.	12.0	999.0
201601	1747	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	They make investment decisions.	12.0	999.0
201601	1748	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	They might be big, and so they might affect asset prices, but they’re private pools of capital, generally not viewed as leveraged.	12.0	999.0
201601	1749	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Market regulators would not be concerned about sovereign wealth funds.	12.0	999.0
201601	1750	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	It’s not pooled investment funds or investment for others.	12.0	999.0
201601	1751	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	I think what we’re seeing over the past six months to a year is that they aren’t really endowments, to the extent that they are parts of oil-producing countries, and the countries are using them to finance their deficits.	12.0	999.0
201601	1752	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	So, in some sense, they’re just a leveraged fund for a country, and to that extent they are of more interest.	12.0	999.0
201601	1753	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Could make a comment?	12.0	88.0
201601	1754	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201601	1755	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	One commentator, I thought, had a very interesting analysis.	12.0	88.0
201601	1756	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	He said that we’re experiencing an enormous margin call.	12.0	88.0
201601	1757	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201601	1758	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	That is the exact sentiment I was trying to express.	12.0	999.0
201601	1759	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	I think the main questions for financial stability are:  What kind of liabilities do they have?	12.0	999.0
201601	1760	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	How short are they?	12.0	999.0
201601	1761	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	How quickly do they need to meet these obligations?	12.0	999.0
201601	1762	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	And then the other piece would be, who are the other investors?	12.0	999.0
201601	1763	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Are their sales offset by purchases by other investors?	12.0	999.0
201601	1764	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	So I’m giving you a sense of how we’re thinking about it.	12.0	999.0
201601	1765	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	We don’t have any answers to these questions.	12.0	999.0
201601	1766	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	The international community is very interested in learning more about sovereign wealth funds, but they are a very different kind of “private” financial institution, so the kind of proposals for regulations would be very different.	12.0	999.0
201601	1767	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	This would be a country.	12.0	999.0
201601	1768	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Globally, they’re about $7 trillion.	12.0	999.0
201601	1769	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	And just to put that into context, US mutual funds have about $15 trillion.	12.0	999.0
201601	1770	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	And I think separately managed accounts—which is the way we’ve been thinking about them, like pension funds or insurers or endowments—are probably $9 trillion.	12.0	999.0
201601	1771	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	So they’re a big piece, but they’re not the whole piece.	12.0	999.0
201601	1772	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	We’ll probably be giving them a little bit more thought.	12.0	999.0
201601	1773	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	But that’s the state of play right now.	12.0	999.0
201601	1774	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	They mainly hold US assets.	12.0	999.0
201601	1775	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Yes, they like US assets.	12.0	999.0
201601	1776	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	If I could just add a couple of points.	12.0	999.0
201601	1777	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	As Nellie said, it is almost certainly the case that a lot of sovereign wealth funds are very intimately connected with their governments.	12.0	999.0
201601	1778	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	And so it’s quite plausible that over the past year or so, you’ve seen sales of sovereign wealth funds both to help finance governments that had been reliant on oil revenues and now need more cash and, secondly, perhaps even to basically finance reserve intervention.	12.0	999.0
201601	1779	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	A lot of times, the line between foreign exchange holdings and sovereign holdings is not very clear cut.	12.0	999.0
201601	1780	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	So probably both of those factors are at play, although to what extent is a little bit murky.	12.0	999.0
201601	1781	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	But I would view those as important background factors.	12.0	999.0
201601	1782	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	And then if you think about what’s happened with the plunge in equity prices more recently in the last couple of weeks, that seems to be triggered more by high-profile macroeconomic elements, such as in China.	12.0	999.0
201601	1783	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	You probably wouldn’t want to attribute that to any particular sea change in the portfolio behavior of the sovereign wealth funds themselves.	12.0	999.0
201601	1784	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Any further questions?	12.0	65.0
201601	1785	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	12.0	65.0
201601	1786	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12.0	65.0
201601	1787	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Then we have an opportunity for comments on financial stability, and let me start with Governor Fischer.	94.0	65.0
201601	1788	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	108.0
201601	1789	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	First, I want to commend the staff that produced both of these reports, “QS Assessment of Financial Stability” and “Financial Stability Implications of ‘Low-for-Long’ Interest Rates in AFEs.”	94.0	108.0
201601	1790	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The QS assessment is summarized in the table on exhibit 2, which shows a slight improvement in the overall level of vulnerability due to a decline in valuation pressures in corporate debt markets and equity markets.	94.0	108.0
201601	1791	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think in both those cases, the decline in valuation pressures is a result of external events happening, and I’m not sure that’s all good news about what’s happened to prices there.	94.0	108.0
201601	1792	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	What I found remarkable about these two reports is how much you read about the rest of the world.	94.0	108.0
201601	1793	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And this is not the first time the United States banking system has been severely exposed to foreign countries, the debt crisis of the 1980s being an obvious example in which the exposure was very large.	94.0	108.0
201601	1794	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	It may be the first time that the United States financial system seems to be exposed to other countries.	94.0	108.0
201601	1795	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Starting in the morning, you get the Japanese affecting us not that much, then the Chinese in a big way, and then it moves on to Europe affecting us to a greater extent than I recall at earlier stages.	94.0	108.0
201601	1796	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And it’s very interesting, because it isn’t all happening through the banking systems, which it used to.	94.0	108.0
201601	1797	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	It’s happening, to a considerable extent, through equity markets and debt markets.	94.0	108.0
201601	1798	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And I find that very interesting.	94.0	108.0
201601	1799	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I was just thinking, as I was writing this, that it was only about nine months ago that we first decided we could refer to China being a factor in our thinking about what we ought to do.	94.0	108.0
201601	1800	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And now it’s coming in massively, and it’s a good thing that we’re following what’s going on there.	94.0	108.0
201601	1801	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The QS report ends with something that I think is very important and that we need to remember as we move ahead.	94.0	108.0
201601	1802	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think the last paragraph says that “because Treasury yields are closely related to discount rates used to value many assets and securities, sudden future increases in longer-term Treasury yields, especially if not related to faster-than-anticipated economic growth, could prompt sharp declines in the prices of many assets that appear fairly valued primarily because of the low term premiums.”	94.0	108.0
201601	1803	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And I think that’s part of what’s happening in the US equity markets as well.	94.0	108.0
201601	1804	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We cut the interest rate in order to get asset values up, and we were successful—very successful.	94.0	108.0
201601	1805	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Equity markets came through the crisis beautifully.	94.0	108.0
201601	1806	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, if that all worked, then when we undo the cuts in interest rates, unless the economy has grown a lot since then, and profits are much higher, and firms are much more prosperous, and so on—which hasn’t happened—equity prices are going to go down.	94.0	108.0
201601	1807	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And in any case, the partial effect of a rise in short-term interest rates, which also affects longer-term rates, is to reduce equity prices and other asset prices.	94.0	108.0
201601	1808	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And we’ll have to keep thinking about those facts.	94.0	108.0
201601	1809	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The paper asking about what the longer-term effects are, if any, of low-for-long interest rates in the advanced foreign economies doesn’t find much to worry about, or at least to comment on, except for German insurers who have given long-term guarantees of real rates that are no longer available.	94.0	108.0
201601	1810	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think there are some American insurance companies in the same position as well, but you didn’t find very much more.	94.0	108.0
201601	1811	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’m kind of reflecting on the fact that we—and when I say “we,”	94.0	108.0
201601	1812	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I mean “I”—have said in many a speech, “Well, we gave them a long time to prepare.	94.0	108.0
201601	1813	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We kept warning them.”	94.0	108.0
201601	1814	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And then you sort of say, “Well, what did you—or what did we, or what did I—expect them to do after we’d told them that we were going to raise the rates and they could be facing capital outflows?”	94.0	108.0
201601	1815	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, did we want them to raise rates to keep the money there?	94.0	108.0
201601	1816	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’m not sure what we wanted them to do.	94.0	108.0
201601	1817	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Some of them have gone on to use capital controls, which, if we’re interested in financial stability, we’d better not rule out if we want financial markets to not be a source of problems for us.	94.0	108.0
201601	1818	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And then there are a few—Mexico is an example of one that has simply built a very robust financial system and has been, so far, able to withstand a very large devaluation in part because of its oil dependence, which is not that high.	94.0	108.0
201601	1819	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So what are the lessons?	94.0	108.0
201601	1820	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think that we’re in a period in which we’re undergoing a shift of regime in the global economy in which we’re heading back to the 1970s and 1980s.	94.0	108.0
201601	1821	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think we’re going to be less connected.	94.0	108.0
201601	1822	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think there’s going to be less foreign lending.	94.0	108.0
201601	1823	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’re doing that with the anti–money laundering.	94.0	108.0
201601	1824	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’re creating problems at the level of the individual.	94.0	108.0
201601	1825	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	They may be justified problems, but we’re doing it.	94.0	108.0
201601	1826	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And the big difference that China made when it was growing fast, at least in terms of the way I thought of this, is we thought for 40 years or so that the terms of trade would be turning against raw material producers, natural resource producers, forever.	94.0	108.0
201601	1827	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Australia was quite used to that assumption.	94.0	108.0
201601	1828	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Then all of a sudden China came along and started buying iron, copper, everything, and all of the prices of commodities started rising.	94.0	108.0
201601	1829	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And then everybody thought, happy days are here again, and there were massive investments taking place.	94.0	108.0
201601	1830	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And now, unless I’m mistaken, unless India, which is less globally integrated than China decided to become, replaces it—which is possible, but I don’t think will happen—we’re going to have to get used to a different behavior of that fundamental relationship—namely, the terms of trade between the industrialized world and the developing world.	94.0	108.0
201601	1831	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And that will have some implications for financial relationships and may have some implications for financial stability.	94.0	108.0
201601	1832	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So what do we have to do?	94.0	108.0
201601	1833	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I think, two things.	94.0	108.0
201601	1834	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We have to remember that we don’t have a lot of financial stability tools, and that we’ve got to do this primarily, as Dan keeps emphasizing, I think, through strengthening the structure of our financial system more than through the use of macroprudential tools, which other countries may have more of.	94.0	108.0
201601	1835	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And the other thing that I think we have to remember, having watched what has happened in the short period since concerns about China started increasing, is the Warren Buffett warning, “Only when the tide goes out do you discover who is swimming naked.”	94.0	108.0
201601	1836	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	You don’t see it until the crisis actually comes.	94.0	108.0
201601	1837	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	You think about it and you worry about it, but you don’t actually know when it’s going to come.	94.0	108.0
201601	1838	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And then, bang, it shows up.	94.0	108.0
201601	1839	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So I like both of these papers, and I think they’re very useful warnings to us, particularly the second one.	94.0	108.0
201601	1840	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you very much, Madam Chair.	94.0	108.0
201601	1841	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	94.0	65.0
201601	1842	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	94.0	65.0
201601	1843	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	90.0
201601	1844	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I will be brief, in view of the number of topics we are discussing at this meeting.	94.0	90.0
201601	1845	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The QS report notes that commercial real estate prices continued to rise through Q3, as shown in chart 1-10.	94.0	90.0
201601	1846	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This continued upward trend in commercial real estate prices, driven by low interest rates and declining vacancy rates, is a scenario we ran in the tabletop exercise.	94.0	90.0
201601	1847	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If this trend continues through year-end, rather than simply being a tabletop scenario, we will be looking at a possible commercial real estate bubble in real time.	94.0	90.0
201601	1848	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This would seem to be the appropriate time to signal even more forcefully our concerns, through guidance, stress tests, and speeches, that supervisory tools are not sufficient.	94.0	90.0
201601	1849	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I may be inclined to use monetary policy tools, perhaps raising the funds rate more rapidly than otherwise would be the case, even though I view that as a second-best solution.	94.0	90.0
201601	1850	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	90.0
201601	1851	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201601	1852	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	94.0	65.0
201601	1853	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	110.0
201601	1854	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I just have two comments, briefly.	94.0	110.0
201601	1855	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	First of all, I just want to emphasize—and we’ve been talking about this—that the composition of the S&P 500 is today very different than that of the underlying US economy.	94.0	110.0
201601	1856	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Approximately 50 percent–plus of the S&P 500 are goods-producing companies, in terms of their profitability, and 40 percent–plus of S&P 500 earnings originate outside the United States.	94.0	110.0
201601	1857	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This goods- producing exposure explains why the oil decline last year was enough to cause a decline in S&P earnings last year.	94.0	110.0
201601	1858	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And S&P earnings this year, despite this oil wane, are expected to be $115 to $120.	94.0	110.0
201601	1859	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	If you take a 16-times multiple of that, you would get to $1,840 to $1,920 on the S&P.	94.0	110.0
201601	1860	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And 16, in my career, and if you go through history, is a relatively full multiple.	94.0	110.0
201601	1861	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It’s sort of in the range.	94.0	110.0
201601	1862	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And so, right now, we are at 1,870, which is right in the middle of 1,840 to 1,920.	94.0	110.0
201601	1863	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I think one of the parts of normalization is that the market is likely to find reasons to get to a more normal level of P/E.	94.0	110.0
201601	1864	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I don’t think that is a bad thing, and I think that is part of this process.	94.0	110.0
201601	1865	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It does not necessarily mean that the underlying US economy is slowing.	94.0	110.0
201601	1866	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It may turn out to mean that, but it says a lot more about the non–US economy than it does about the US economy, as the composition of the S&P is so dramatically different.	94.0	110.0
201601	1867	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	That has been increasing during our lifetimes, and people are used to thinking about it in the old way.	94.0	110.0
201601	1868	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The only other comment I’d make, and I have talked to Nellie about this, is on this issue of high-yield ownership in mutual fund form.	94.0	110.0
201601	1869	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I know Nellie is working on this.	94.0	110.0
201601	1870	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I think there is a natural mismatch between high-yield bonds, which by their nature trade these days very infrequently but are held in mutual fund form at a size that offer daily redemptions.	94.0	110.0
201601	1871	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Third Avenue was indicative of it.	94.0	110.0
201601	1872	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	My fear would be, and we will talk about this later, that if oil did get down to $15 per barrel—which I think is not unreasonable—and high-yield spreads widen more, some of these reforms, such as swing pricing, may not really be sufficient to deal with the run that could occur.	94.0	110.0
201601	1873	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I know this would require a change in law, but I hope we keep talking about the idea.	94.0	110.0
201601	1874	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	If mutual funds are going to hold, in size, relatively illiquid assets—that is, if these assetscannot trade in size—I would love to see us revisit whether they should go to quarterly liquidity or longer or have the ability to gate put into their provisions.	94.0	110.0
201601	1875	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And I do believe someday we’re going to make these changes.	94.0	110.0
201601	1876	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I would prefer that a blowup did not cause us to make these reforms.	94.0	110.0
201601	1877	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I know we have limited, not complete power in this, but I would hope we keep raising it.	94.0	110.0
201601	1878	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	94.0	65.0
201601	1879	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	103.0
201601	1880	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I just wanted to make a brief comment about the low-for-long paper, which I found helpful.	94.0	103.0
201601	1881	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I take the conclusions that there are no immediate or near-term problems regarding financial stability as some comfort.	94.0	103.0
201601	1882	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	But also, in connection with President Rosengren’s point:  When I look at things like CRE, I think that we’ll have to continue to watch the implications of our policy for various asset classes for fiscal policy effects and other macroeconomic effects over the long term to see how those are being affected.	94.0	103.0
201601	1883	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I wanted to make one specific point, as it relates to the effect of low rates on bank net interest margins.	94.0	103.0
201601	1884	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I would add to that that the flattening of the yield curve—which has come from our policies, in conjunction with forward guidance that kept expectations of policy rates low— has played a role in compressing those margins for banks.	94.0	103.0
201601	1885	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	And I would point to some research by my staff that suggests that the flatter yield curve is actually more consequential than the level of short-term rates in affecting, particularly, community banks, and that, as we begin to normalize short-term rates, unless the yield curve moves, that could actually worsen their net interest margin position.	94.0	103.0
201601	1886	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	94.0	65.0
201601	1887	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard, did you want to comment?	94.0	65.0
201601	1888	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No comment indicated]	94.0	65.0
201601	1889	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	94.0	65.0
201601	1890	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	If there are no further comments on financial stability, I think we’re ready to begin our economic go-round.	13.0	65.0
201601	1891	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I hope we will be able to finish this before we break for the day, but we’ll see.	13.0	65.0
201601	1892	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13.0	65.0
201601	1893	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	102.0
201601	1894	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In San Francisco, we are preparing to host the Super Bowl—“SB50,” as all the posters say.	13.0	102.0
201601	1895	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The actual game is 45 miles away, in Santa Clara, but the big pregame party is all set for next week in the city itself.	13.0	102.0
201601	1896	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	President Williams?	13.0	94.0
201601	1897	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes.	13.0	102.0
201601	1898	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Are your guys in that Super Bowl?	13.0	94.0
201601	1899	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	[Laughter]	13.0	94.0
201601	1900	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We are hosting the Super Bowl.	13.0	102.0
201601	1901	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Revenge is a dish best served cold, President Bullard.	13.0	102.0
201601	1902	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’ve got to read my jokes.	13.0	102.0
201601	1903	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13.0	102.0
201601	1904	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	President Bullard, do you have a team in your District?	13.0	97.0
201601	1905	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	13.0	97.0
201601	1906	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	In the future, we won’t be in any bets with San Francisco.	13.0	94.0
201601	1907	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Well, the typical comment is that he does have a team so it’s very apropos.	13.0	91.0
201601	1908	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The fenced-in party zone starts literally at the front door of the San Francisco Fed.	13.0	102.0
201601	1909	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And with all the congestion and crowds, the Bank and other local employers will likely scale back to only essential operations.	13.0	102.0
201601	1910	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I expect a surge in spending from football fans in our District next week but also a drop in hours worked.	13.0	102.0
201601	1911	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, the national economy is the opposite pattern:  strong employment but weak spending.	13.0	102.0
201601	1912	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I don’t think this disconnect is all that troubling.	13.0	102.0
201601	1913	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We have seen it before.	13.0	102.0
201601	1914	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, this will be the eighth time over the past five years that we will have gotten negative labor productivity growth in a quarter.	13.0	102.0
201601	1915	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In all but one of the earlier cases, productivity fell because output growth turned out to be temporarily weak.	13.0	102.0
201601	1916	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	What we have seen is that relatively stronger employment data turned out to give the more accurate signal on underlying fundamentals.	13.0	102.0
201601	1917	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The strong job gains but weak GDP growth in the fourth quarter reflect a fundamentally healthy domestic economy, but it is being buffeted by developments abroad.	13.0	102.0
201601	1918	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Sectors with direct exposure to the dollar, weak foreign demand, and falling energy and commodity prices have underperformed.	13.0	102.0
201601	1919	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But the sectors hardest hit, such as manufacturing, drilling and mining, and agriculture, account for less employment than they do output.	13.0	102.0
201601	1920	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In contrast, the large domestic services sector of the economy, including restaurants, health care, and professional and business services, is doing quite well.	13.0	102.0
201601	1921	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Notably, of the 2.6 million jobs added last year, 94 percent were in services.	13.0	102.0
201601	1922	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Strong domestic services demand provides a fire break or a flood bank—we need both in California—against shocks from abroad.	13.0	102.0
201601	1923	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Therefore, I continue to expect above-trend growth this year and balanced risks.	13.0	102.0
201601	1924	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Reports from my directors and other contacts confirm the view that the new hiring and low gas prices should provide ample resources to support more consumer spending.	13.0	102.0
201601	1925	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	As enumerated in the Tealbook, a broad range of labor market indicators have improved significantly over the past year and are nearly unanimous in signaling that the labor market is very close to our maximum employment goal.	13.0	102.0
201601	1926	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even labor force participation is very near its estimated trend.	13.0	102.0
201601	1927	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The one exception to the good news on labor utilization is the still-elevated level of involuntary part-time employment.	13.0	102.0
201601	1928	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, my staff recently reaffirmed their earlier work that shows that the degree of additional slack implied by elevated involuntary part-time work is likely to be quite small.	13.0	102.0
201601	1929	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Another indicator of labor market slack is wage growth.	13.0	102.0
201601	1930	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And over the past eight years, wage behavior has been, at times, puzzling.	13.0	102.0
201601	1931	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	During the recession, aggregate wage growth didn’t fall as much as we might have expected, and then later, during the recovery, despite the considerable improvement in the labor market, wage growth has remained stubbornly low.	13.0	102.0
201601	1932	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Some recent research by my staff argues that these two puzzling episodes of contradictory wage growth in part reflect changes in the composition of the labor force that are associated with movements into and out of full-time employment.	13.0	102.0
201601	1933	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Specifically, during the Great Recession and early in the recovery, aggregate wage measures were propped up because it was predominantly low-wage workers who were let go.	13.0	102.0
201601	1934	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The employees still on the payroll generally had higher-than-average skills and wages.	13.0	102.0
201601	1935	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The shift in the mix of workers—the so-called upscaling of the labor force—boosted the average aggregate wage and had the effect of moderating the cyclical decline in nominal wage growth.	13.0	102.0
201601	1936	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	More recently, as the labor market has strengthened, this pattern has reversed.	13.0	102.0
201601	1937	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Many workers on the sidelines of the labor force who were holding part-time positions have been moving into full-time employment.	13.0	102.0
201601	1938	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The vast majority of these new workers earn less than the typical full-time employee, so their entry—or the downscaling of the labor force, if you will— pushes down the average wage.	13.0	102.0
201601	1939	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, superimposed on these cyclical dynamics is the “silver tsunami”—that is, the retirement of the baby-boom generation.	13.0	102.0
201601	1940	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the exits from full-time employment of older, higher-paid retirees have put downward pressure on wage growth.	13.0	102.0
201601	1941	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Further, with so many still to retire, this more secular downscaling is a headwind to higher wage growth.	13.0	102.0
201601	1942	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It is likely to continue for some time.	13.0	102.0
201601	1943	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	All in all, my staff estimates that the changes in the composition of the labor force are pushing down the rate of growth of median weekly earnings by more than 1 percentage point.	13.0	102.0
201601	1944	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Other measures of nominal wage growth are also being held down by such compositional changes in the workforce.	13.0	102.0
201601	1945	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, in fact, even the ECI, which holds the composition of occupations constant, is susceptible to the same problem, because the composition of workers in these very broad job categories can shift.	13.0	102.0
201601	1946	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So what’s the implication of this research?	13.0	102.0
201601	1947	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The main result is that the sluggish wage growth may be a poor indicator of labor market slack if you don’t control for the compositional effects that I just outlined.	13.0	102.0
201601	1948	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, correcting for worker composition, wages are consistent with a stronger labor market that is drawing lower-wage workers into full-time employment.	13.0	102.0
201601	1949	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And some support for this view can also be seen in the productivity data.	13.0	102.0
201601	1950	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The same compositional flows affecting wage growth also clarify why productivity growth was very strong during the recession and early recovery and why it has been so weak recently.	13.0	102.0
201601	1951	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	My staff estimates that, from 2007 to 2010, the shift from low- to higher-skilled workers almost added 1 full percentage point per year to labor productivity growth.	13.0	102.0
201601	1952	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And these are very big effects when you think about the cyclical movements.	13.0	102.0
201601	1953	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Since then, with downscaling pressures, the overall pace of shifting from low- to high-skilled workers has declined, and this contribution has been cut to only about ¼ percentage point per year.	13.0	102.0
201601	1954	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	This productivity effect leaves the effect of the shift in labor composition on price inflation unclear.	13.0	102.0
201601	1955	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	To the extent that firms keep their wage bills low by hiring lower-wage workers, labor cost pressures will provide less impetus for higher price inflation.	13.0	102.0
201601	1956	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, if these lower-wage workers are less productive, then continued increases in unit labor costs may be hiding behind the lower readings that we are seeing in nominal wage growth.	13.0	102.0
201601	1957	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I think this is just something that we have to be aware of when watching the wage data over this year.	13.0	102.0
201601	1958	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you very much.	13.0	102.0
201601	1959	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201601	1960	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	President Williams, is all of that research you talked about on your website?	13.0	97.0
201601	1961	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Not yet.	13.0	102.0
201601	1962	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is a preview.	13.0	102.0
201601	1963	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Okay.	13.0	97.0
201601	1964	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But we’re happy to share it.	13.0	102.0
201601	1965	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think the work on productivity, though, is previous work.	13.0	102.0
201601	1966	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201601	1967	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	13.0	65.0
201601	1968	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201601	1969	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Since the December FOMC meeting, incoming data have significantly reduced our estimate of Q4 real GDP.	13.0	90.0
201601	1970	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Sizable declines in stock and commodity prices have also raised the possibility of slower global growth.	13.0	90.0
201601	1971	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Yet in light of these data, we saw surprising strength in payroll employment in December.	13.0	90.0
201601	1972	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Which of these data portend the true underlying strength or weakness of the economy?	13.0	90.0
201601	1973	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Although incoming real data have been, on balance, weaker than expected, they are not of a magnitude that one would normally expect to cause such significant asset price movements, and much of the real data reflect what are likely to be temporary phenomena:  mild weather effects on service spending and a two-quarter inventory adjustment.	13.0	90.0
201601	1974	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	While official data reports from China may overstate actual economic activity, other independent evidence indicates limited direct trade effects, which are hard to reconcile with the observed large declines in stock indexes around the globe.	13.0	90.0
201601	1975	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Similarly, the positive correlation between oil prices and stock indexes in countries that are large importers of oil and thus should benefit from lower oil prices is somewhat puzzling.	13.0	90.0
201601	1976	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Furthermore, while there have been some reductions in estimates of foreign growth by many forecasters, they are relatively modest compared with asset price movements.	13.0	90.0
201601	1977	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	With little fundamental economic data to explain such large asset price movements, a reasonable interpretation is to view asset price movements as a temporary exogenous net worth shock that is unlikely to have much of a permanent effect on the economy.	13.0	90.0
201601	1978	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	As a result, other than weaker near-term forecasts of data that reflect wealth effects, the Boston staff forecast has not changed materially.	13.0	90.0
201601	1979	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	As I do not have a good explanation for recent asset price movements, I must admit to some unease about my forecast, and, like the Tealbook, I view the downside risks to my forecast as being elevated relative to December.	13.0	90.0
201601	1980	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	One source of my anxiety is whether the consumption-led economic growth over the next year will be as strong as forecast in the Tealbook or in my own forecast.	13.0	90.0
201601	1981	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Current estimates regarding consumption in the fourth quarter were weaker than many earlier forecasts.	13.0	90.0
201601	1982	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	And over most of the recovery to date, actual consumption has tended to come in lower than expected, particularly when considering the gains that have been experienced in both disposable income and household net worth.	13.0	90.0
201601	1983	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	One possible explanation for this lower-than-expected growth in consumption is that consumers are not consuming as much of the disposable income freed up by recent declines in oil prices.	13.0	90.0
201601	1984	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, work done by the Boston staff that utilizes account-level transaction data that include every transaction from checking accounts, savings accounts, and linked credit cards for more than a half-million accounts finds that the marginal propensity to consume from the newly available real income that is generated by a gas price decline is 80 percent.	13.0	90.0
201601	1985	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Similar results were found in a recent JPMorgan Chase Institute study based on data on Chase customer debit and credit cards.	13.0	90.0
201601	1986	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because the Boston model expects individuals to spend roughly 80 percent of savings from lower gas prices, this does not seem to account for the lower consumption.	13.0	90.0
201601	1987	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	An alternative explanation for the consumption shortfall is that the income gains in this recovery have disproportionately accrued to high-income individuals with a lower marginal propensity to consume.	13.0	90.0
201601	1988	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Work by the Boston Federal Reserve staff has found that a large fraction of households in middle- to lower-income deciles have current resources below recession levels, and that much of the income and wealth gains that we see in aggregate data have accrued to affluent households who tend to have a lower marginal propensity to consume.	13.0	90.0
201601	1989	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This would imply less pent-up demand for consumption and may suggest that misses in consumption forecasts reflect compositional shifts in income and wealth that may be more persistent.	13.0	90.0
201601	1990	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, saving may remain high relative to aggregate disposable income and wealth.	13.0	90.0
201601	1991	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	A third explanation is that consumers are still scarred by the experience of the Great Recession and thus will maintain higher precautionary savings.	13.0	90.0
201601	1992	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This scarring may be exacerbated by recent, highly publicized declines in US and global stock prices.	13.0	90.0
201601	1993	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Anecdotally, I must say that the number of people commenting on their 401(k) plans, from the Federal Reserve lunchroom to audiences at my speeches around New England, has certainly gone up.	13.0	90.0
201601	1994	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This scarring might indicate a greater reluctance to spend than is reflected in my current consumption forecast.	13.0	90.0
201601	1995	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	One piece of evidence that runs contrary to this, however, is that the most recent responses to the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers suggest little, if any, response to recent financial market developments.	13.0	90.0
201601	1996	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In summary, the downside risks to the economic outlook in my view are higher than in December.	13.0	90.0
201601	1997	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I will be highly attentive to evidence that consumption growth may be slower than forecast.	13.0	90.0
201601	1998	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In some sense, the canary in the consumer coal mine may be whether large purchases, such as car purchases, are postponed because of the recent financial turbulence.	13.0	90.0
201601	1999	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Were the economy not to grow at potential, this would have implications for my desired path of interest rates, which I will discuss tomorrow.	13.0	90.0
201601	2000	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	13.0	90.0
201601	2001	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201601	2002	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13.0	65.0
201601	2003	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201601	2004	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The tone of conversations in recent weeks with directors and contacts in my District was subdued compared with the previous FOMC cycle.	13.0	88.0
201601	2005	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We detected a downshift in confidence.	13.0	88.0
201601	2006	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	With only a few exceptions, business activity in the fourth quarter and the first weeks of January was characterized as disappointing.	13.0	88.0
201601	2007	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Retail contacts reported mixed sales over the holiday season, with many brick-and-mortar retailers reporting deep discounting, especially in apparel.	13.0	88.0
201601	2008	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Notwithstanding strong sales numbers, we heard a similar report from our large auto retailer director.	13.0	88.0
201601	2009	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	This is a national-scope company.	13.0	88.0
201601	2010	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Sales slowed somewhat over the fourth quarter despite being supported by heavy discounts and incentives.	13.0	88.0
201601	2011	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Our director indicated that retail auto inventories are high, and he expects auto production to scale back in 2016.	13.0	88.0
201601	2012	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	He does not anticipate a significant overall drop-off in auto sales.	13.0	88.0
201601	2013	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The exception is the luxury car segment, which he claimed is directly tied to equity market performance.	13.0	88.0
201601	2014	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Despite continuing strong sales, he offered the opinion that the domestic auto market is not likely to be a factor pushing consumer activity growth, as it has been in recent years.	13.0	88.0
201601	2015	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard more upbeat reports from residential real estate contacts.	13.0	88.0
201601	2016	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	They reported increased sales and construction activity, at least compared with year-ago levels.	13.0	88.0
201601	2017	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The Friday existing home sales print exceeded our expectations and raised our tracking estimate for the fourth quarter by 0.2 percent, to 0.9 percent.	13.0	88.0
201601	2018	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	After a first few days of January characterized as “dead,” banker contacts noted that mortgage applications have picked up in recent days.	13.0	88.0
201601	2019	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Our commercial real estate contacts depicted the construction pipeline as steady.	13.0	88.0
201601	2020	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	A few contacts noted a slowdown in multifamily development and some weakness in retail, but overall, we heard little concern about a change in momentum in commercial real estate.	13.0	88.0
201601	2021	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	From our energy-sector contacts, mostly in Louisiana, we heard concerns that firms in this sector are still adjusting to lower oil prices and expect further cuts in investment and employment.	13.0	88.0
201601	2022	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Although localized, we heard reports that the direct economic effects of oil prices are spawning more indirect effects.	13.0	88.0
201601	2023	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Spillover is accelerating.	13.0	88.0
201601	2024	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Likewise, we heard pessimistic sentiment about the outlook for manufacturing.	13.0	88.0
201601	2025	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Sluggish growth abroad and an appreciating dollar continue to weigh on companies with a significant export component of sales.	13.0	88.0
201601	2026	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In this round of director summaries, we picked up strong opinions that, on the basis of their experience in the fourth quarter and January to date, firms are beginning to temper their 2016 economic growth expectations.	13.0	88.0
201601	2027	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard reports of heightened caution as regards capital expenditure plans for expansion.	13.0	88.0
201601	2028	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Projects are being shelved or their timelines extended.	13.0	88.0
201601	2029	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Anecdotal feedback on labor market conditions portrayed a reasonably strong situation somewhat at odds with signals on economic activity.	13.0	88.0
201601	2030	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Business contacts continue to experience areas of labor market tightness, and tightness is spreading.	13.0	88.0
201601	2031	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Firms reported increased wage pressures in an effort to attract or keep workers.	13.0	88.0
201601	2032	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I consider it noteworthy that the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker shows the growth rate of low-skill wages to have caught up with middle- and high-skill wage growth after having lagged for most of the recovery.	13.0	88.0
201601	2033	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	With regard to the national economy, at this point, I’m pretty certain the GDP growth number for the fourth quarter of 2015 will show a meaningful slowdown.	13.0	88.0
201601	2034	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	As mentioned, the Atlanta Fed’s GDP tracker for Q4 is just under 1 percent.	13.0	88.0
201601	2035	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Like our business contacts, I’m unsure whether the fourth quarter will turn out to be just a temporary dip or the onset of a more persistent period of weakness.	13.0	88.0
201601	2036	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I have not adjusted my 2016 outlook from what I submitted in December.	13.0	88.0
201601	2037	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	My full-year 2016 forecast regarding economic growth is just a little higher than what’s in this meeting’s Tealbook, but at this juncture, I find it hard to reconcile broad-based indications of slowing activity with the continuing strength in jobs growth, and I have to question whether the divergent signals on growth momentum and the labor market can persist.	13.0	88.0
201601	2038	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	As regards the inflation outlook, we will likely see a short period of firming as last year’s drop in energy prices roll out of the 12-month numbers.	13.0	88.0
201601	2039	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	But due to the recent drop in energy and earlier declines in commodity prices, I anticipate a 12-month headline inflation trend near zero by midyear, and I would not be surprised if core measures also reflect some of this softness.	13.0	88.0
201601	2040	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	So I’m expecting inflation readings in the near term to be pretty messy—a technical term.	13.0	88.0
201601	2041	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding inflation expectations, I’m sticking with the view that longer-term expectations remain well anchored.	13.0	88.0
201601	2042	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m influenced in this view by my Bank’s business inflation survey and my staff’s work that argues that inflation compensation can be explained by market adjustments of risk and liquidity premiums.	13.0	88.0
201601	2043	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	If the first quarter produces a bounceback from the fourth and moderate economic growth continues through the year, which is my forecast, I expect to see a firming of the underlying inflation trend later in the year.	13.0	88.0
201601	2044	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	But clarity could be elusive well into the year, and policy calls in March, April, and June may have to rely on forecast assumptions as opposed to outlook-confirming evidence.	13.0	88.0
201601	2045	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	All things considered, my read on the balance of risks has moved a little to the downside.	13.0	88.0
201601	2046	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Were it not for the solid labor market reports, I would have shifted my balance of risks for economic growth lower.	13.0	88.0
201601	2047	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	A lot of negative factors are ganging up on my risk assessment at the moment.	13.0	88.0
201601	2048	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	On my list are fourth-quarter economic growth estimates, global financial market volatility, and the effects of falling oil prices.	13.0	88.0
201601	2049	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We will take up the matter of how to deal with all this in our statement in tomorrow’s policy round.	13.0	88.0
201601	2050	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201601	2051	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201601	2052	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	13.0	65.0
201601	2053	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201601	2054	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Economic activity in the Third District has continued to improve since December, but growth may have slowed a bit.	13.0	999.0
201601	2055	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Manufacturing activity worsened slightly, while nonmanufacturing firms continued to see modest sales growth.	13.0	999.0
201601	2056	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Bank lending continues to improve, with loan growth exceeding 10 percent, according to some of our contacts.	13.0	999.0
201601	2057	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	And commercial building has continued at a relatively high level of activity.	13.0	999.0
201601	2058	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	The January Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey responses were generally weak and remained well below trend.	13.0	999.0
201601	2059	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	The general activity diffusion index for January came in at minus 3.5, but this was an improvement from minus 10.2 in December.	13.0	999.0
201601	2060	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	The indexes for new orders and unfilled orders were also negative in January, but, again, improved compared with December.	13.0	999.0
201601	2061	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Shipments for January rebounded into positive territory, and inventories were being drawn down more rapidly than in December.	13.0	999.0
201601	2062	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Taken together, these data suggest that manufacturing output is declining slightly in the region and at a less rapid pace than in December.	13.0	999.0
201601	2063	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Weakness is not uniform, however.	13.0	999.0
201601	2064	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Some manufacturers are doing quite well.	13.0	999.0
201601	2065	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Driven by strength in aerospace, one metal stress-testing firm has seen sales rise by 20 percent, and area manufacturers remain upbeat.	13.0	999.0
201601	2066	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	The diffusion index for future general activity remains comfortably in positive territory.	13.0	999.0
201601	2067	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	However, it has been trending down since last summer.	13.0	999.0
201601	2068	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	The survey’s labor market indicators suggest slightly weaker employment in January, and most firms reported no change in product prices in January.	13.0	999.0
201601	2069	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	In special questions regarding the effect of lower energy prices, over half of the firms reported this is a positive for their business, while 30 percent reported it as a negative.	13.0	999.0
201601	2070	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Firms mentioned lower costs of production as the main reason for a positive effect, while firms reporting a negative effect tied it to a decline in demand from energy production–related customers.	13.0	999.0
201601	2071	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Regarding the effect of lower energy prices on future demand, firms are evenly divided, with roughly one-third being unaffected, one-third experiencing a negative effect, and the remaining one-third being affected positively.	13.0	999.0
201601	2072	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Though the index remained positive, nonmanufacturing activity in the District appears to have slowed.	13.0	999.0
201601	2073	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Our Nonmanufacturing Business Outlook Survey headline activity index fell from 26.7 in December to 2.9 in January.	13.0	999.0
201601	2074	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	The index of expected future activity weakened, as firms saw both their prospects and the prospects for the region as worsening over the next six months.	13.0	999.0
201601	2075	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	At the same time, though, the nonmanufacturing respondents saw only a modest change in the general business activity at their own firms over the last month.	13.0	999.0
201601	2076	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	So there is a bit divergence between what firms are seeing in their own business activity and what they perceive is happening around them.	13.0	999.0
201601	2077	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	The survey suggests that firms are more uncertain, obviously, about the economy.	13.0	999.0
201601	2078	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Employment in the region continues to improve, on balance, but the growth was mixed.	13.0	999.0
201601	2079	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	New Jersey and Delaware saw employment growth in November at a much faster pace than the nation as a whole.	13.0	999.0
201601	2080	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	But employment growth in Pennsylvania was flat and has been weak for the last three months.	13.0	999.0
201601	2081	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	The three-state unemployment rate edged down to 5.1 percent in November from 5.2 percent in October, and so remained in line with the nation.	13.0	999.0
201601	2082	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	We are continuing to hear reports, as others are, of the difficulty of hiring skilled labor.	13.0	999.0
201601	2083	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Skilled engineers are in short supply, and one light truck service station reported having difficulty in finding skilled technicians despite offering very high yearly salaries.	13.0	999.0
201601	2084	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Keeping with Madam Chair’s request for brevity, I will skip the normal Beige Book report for the Third District and turn to my views on the national economy.	13.0	999.0
201601	2085	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	The economy appears to have less momentum entering 2016 than I thought in December.	13.0	999.0
201601	2086	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Nevertheless, my near-term forecast continues to be that of economic activity rebounding to a pace above 2 percent this quarter and then growing at near trend in 2016.	13.0	999.0
201601	2087	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	The continued fall in oil prices and appreciating dollar will lead to further downward pressure on headline and core inflation, but survey measures of inflation expectations have remained fairly well anchored.	13.0	999.0
201601	2088	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	As oil prices and the dollar stabilize, I remain optimistic that inflation will rebound toward our 2 percent target over the medium term.	13.0	999.0
201601	2089	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	The recent downturn in worldwide equity prices obviously is a cause for concern, but I find it difficult to extract much signal about the domestic economy from these movements, especially in light of the ongoing strength in the labor market and the generally high levels of consumer confidence.	13.0	999.0
201601	2090	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Rather than sharply deteriorating fundamentals, stock prices may be reacting to domestic, political, geopolitical, and policy uncertainty.	13.0	999.0
201601	2091	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	I do see somewhat higher downside risk to my forecast, especially if asset prices continue to fall or remain depressed for a long period.	13.0	999.0
201601	2092	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	For now, though, I see these developments as likely to be transitory and the economy as strong enough to absorb them without a worrisome adverse effect.	13.0	999.0
201601	2093	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201601	2094	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201601	2095	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	13.0	65.0
201601	2096	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201601	2097	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	As we know, since the December FOMC meeting most of the news about energy has been negative.	13.0	110.0
201601	2098	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Let me just go through the data that we accumulate at the Dallas Federal Reserve and what we hear from our contacts.	13.0	110.0
201601	2099	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We now believe the excess of supply over demand today is approximately 1.5 million barrels a day.	13.0	110.0
201601	2100	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This is higher than we had estimated in December.	13.0	110.0
201601	2101	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Why did this happen?	13.0	110.0
201601	2102	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It turns out that the DEA and other sources probably overestimated the amount of US production cuts.	13.0	110.0
201601	2103	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And it has turned out that US production declines have been stubborn.	13.0	110.0
201601	2104	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	There is also clearly a time lag between cap-ex cuts and actual production declines.	13.0	110.0
201601	2105	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In addition, there have actually been production increases in places like the Gulf of Mexico and where there are long-lived projects.	13.0	110.0
201601	2106	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In addition, the shale industry is much more productive than it was a few years ago.	13.0	110.0
201601	2107	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This is creating a greater supply–demand imbalance.	13.0	110.0
201601	2108	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Also, we now believe that by the end of 2016, we will still have an oversupply of approximately 300,000 barrels per day.	13.0	110.0
201601	2109	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The average oversupply per day during 2016 we now believe will be approximately 750,000 barrels a day.	13.0	110.0
201601	2110	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This won’t be linear.	13.0	110.0
201601	2111	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We continue to expect that by 2017, supply and demand will get into daily balance, but you still will have the excess inventory to work off.	13.0	110.0
201601	2112	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We have now revised upward our excess inventory estimate, and we now believe that global excess inventory is approximately 400 million barrels.	13.0	110.0
201601	2113	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We talked previously about the prospect of Iran coming online.	13.0	110.0
201601	2114	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	That production is now factored now into these numbers because it appears that, by February, Iran’s production will in fact get into the market.	13.0	110.0
201601	2115	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Some of that, as I mentioned last time, already has.	13.0	110.0
201601	2116	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We believe their daily production is somewhere between 2.8 and 3.3 million barrels.	13.0	110.0
201601	2117	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Plus they have, in our view, 30 to 40 million barrels of inventory.	13.0	110.0
201601	2118	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	One of the new issues that has now gotten into the thinking of this industry and people who trade oil is whether some lack of capacity will constrain the ability to store the commodity.	13.0	110.0
201601	2119	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	People still believe we will have enough storage capacity, but they’re starting to be concerned about it.	13.0	110.0
201601	2120	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And this is particularly the case, in view of the behavior of the forward curve.	13.0	110.0
201601	2121	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	If the forward curve is not more upwardly sloping, there’s not much incentive for people to store oil.	13.0	110.0
201601	2122	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The prospect of production not going into storage, but going into the market, is further, in our view, depressing prices.	13.0	110.0
201601	2123	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We still believe that, in 2016, daily demand will increase by, on average, 1.4 million barrels a day.	13.0	110.0
201601	2124	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In addition, when we talk about Saudi Arabia, our contacts have said to us, “Saudi Arabia wanted lower prices.	13.0	110.0
201601	2125	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	They wanted to hurt the shale industry in the United States.	13.0	110.0
201601	2126	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	They wanted to hurt Russia.	13.0	110.0
201601	2127	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	They wanted to be maybe a thorn in the side of Iran.	13.0	110.0
201601	2128	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	They did not, though, want this level of prices or this level of instability.”	13.0	110.0
201601	2129	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We were talking about the sovereign wealth funds earlier.	13.0	110.0
201601	2130	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	There is increasing fear in Saudi Arabia, we are hearing from our contacts, about the domestic unrest that could come from this situation.	13.0	110.0
201601	2131	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	At the Dallas Fed, we’ve talked about three basic potential scenarios for this year.	13.0	110.0
201601	2132	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	One, we could plod along, plus or minus $30 per barrel.	13.0	110.0
201601	2133	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Another scenario, which we think is distinctly possible, is, we will get down to $15.	13.0	110.0
201601	2134	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This will happen if storage becomes an issue, if the forward curve stays flat.	13.0	110.0
201601	2135	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But I think people in the industry who have the ability to do so are preparing themselves for the possibility that it could get down to $15.	13.0	110.0
201601	2136	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Keep in mind that we think incremental cash costs in this industry are probably somewhere between $25 and $30 per barrel in the Permian.	13.0	110.0
201601	2137	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And in some other places like the Bakkan and Eagle Ford, cash costs, we believe, are in fact higher.	13.0	110.0
201601	2138	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So we’ve gone from worrying about capital structure in this industry to now worrying about the ability of these companies just simply to generate cash flow and viability.	13.0	110.0
201601	2139	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The other potential development—it would not surprise us, although you can’t predict this—is that we will wake up one day and see that Saudi Arabia has made an agreement with other OPEC countries to modestly cut their supply and do it proportionately.	13.0	110.0
201601	2140	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In our view, that alone could actually kick up oil prices to between $40 and $60 a barrel.	13.0	110.0
201601	2141	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It could make a dramatic difference.	13.0	110.0
201601	2142	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We would not rule that possibility out at this point, in view of the potential instability that Saudi Arabia may be fearing.	13.0	110.0
201601	2143	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So that is oil.	13.0	110.0
201601	2144	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Obviously, none of this is having a very positive effect on the 11th District.	13.0	110.0
201601	2145	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Manufacturing is shrinking.	13.0	110.0
201601	2146	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The service sector has been growing, but at slower rates.	13.0	110.0
201601	2147	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We now expect job growth in Texas to be approximately 1.1 percent in 2016, assuming $30 per barrel oil.	13.0	110.0
201601	2148	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This is versus 3.6 percent job growth in 2014.	13.0	110.0
201601	2149	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The unemployment rate in the state is now 4.7 percent.	13.0	110.0
201601	2150	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We think risks are that unemployment rate will increase from here.	13.0	110.0
201601	2151	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And, interestingly, Austin and Dallas seem to be particularly resilient in this period.	13.0	110.0
201601	2152	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Houston is suffering the brunt of this weakness, as well as along the border, because of the strength of the dollar.	13.0	110.0
201601	2153	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I have one last comment on the national economy.	13.0	110.0
201601	2154	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Understanding, as everyone else here does, that we have much weaker data for the fourth quarter, we are basically taking for the moment a wait-and-see attitude about our GDP forecast.	13.0	110.0
201601	2155	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We still believe, for now, that it could be 2 to 2½ percent.	13.0	110.0
201601	2156	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	You could still have sufficient job growth to drive down the rate of unemployment.	13.0	110.0
201601	2157	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And in terms of inflation, we will be very interested in watching the trimmed mean data, which continues to run between 1.6 and 1.7 percent.	13.0	110.0
201601	2158	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But, in particular, we will be watching the effect of China’s devaluation; the stronger dollar; and tighter economic conditions, both in terms of the wealth effects and tighter financial conditions.	13.0	110.0
201601	2159	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And I would have to say that our forecasts for the national economy are such that the risks are to the downside.	13.0	110.0
201601	2160	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But I think the main thing we have been talking about in Dallas is that only time will tell, and we’re just going to have to wait and see.	13.0	110.0
201601	2161	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It’s too soon to judge.	13.0	110.0
201601	2162	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It’s too soon to revise our forecasts.	13.0	110.0
201601	2163	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We may change our mind here in the next four to eight weeks.	13.0	110.0
201601	2164	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	13.0	110.0
201601	2165	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201601	2166	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13.0	65.0
201601	2167	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201601	2168	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Since our decision to begin normalizing interest rates in December, the news from the labor and output markets has continued to arrive in a familiar pattern:  a very strong labor market with disappointing real spending.	13.0	108.0
201601	2169	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	That pattern, which remains difficult to explain, has been complicated by the volatility in financial markets and by the continuing decline in the price of oil.	13.0	108.0
201601	2170	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thus, I am somewhat more uncertain about the trajectory of real economic activity and the inflation rate than I would be if all of the data were aligned.	13.0	108.0
201601	2171	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	This meeting is a time for watchful waiting to see how the uncertainties of the current situation resolve themselves over the coming months.	13.0	108.0
201601	2172	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Although we should recognize that they may neither resolve themselves nor resolve themselves in a manner that reduces uncertainty about future inflation and growth.	13.0	108.0
201601	2173	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The news from the financial markets, both domestic and international, has been unsettling.	13.0	108.0
201601	2174	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	My sense is that this bout of volatility will subside as the volatility in August did and allow us to proceed more or less—probably a bit less—on the path I had predicted when filling in the December SEP, which was three increases in the federal funds rate in 2016.	13.0	108.0
201601	2175	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	However, there is more uncertainty and downside risk associated with that prediction than there was only six weeks ago.	13.0	108.0
201601	2176	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	That uncertainty arises from the possibility that the current asset market instability presages deeper weakness to come.	13.0	108.0
201601	2177	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The inability so far of the Chinese authorities to clarify and communicate their exchange rate policies is one source of uncertainty—uncertainty that, in the case of China, is strengthened by concerns that economic growth may slow more sharply than the anticipated gradual decline from the vicinity of 7 percent to a somewhat lower rate over the next five years or so.	13.0	108.0
201601	2178	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And there are some foreign economies whose growth performance has been better than expected.	13.0	108.0
201601	2179	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	That includes India and, to a lesser extent, some countries in the euro zone.	13.0	108.0
201601	2180	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	There is another factor that has begun to receive attention, and we started talking about it in connection with the work on financial stability an hour or so ago:  the expected effect on asset prices of the beginning of the unwinding of the extremely accommodative monetary policies that central banks have put in place during the last seven to eight years.	13.0	108.0
201601	2181	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Those policies were put in place in the expectation that doing so would lower interest rates and increase asset values, Tobin’s q in particular.	13.0	108.0
201601	2182	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The lower interest rates and the increase in wealth would increase both investment and consumption through intertemporal substitution and wealth effects, and thereby increase aggregate demand.	13.0	108.0
201601	2183	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, the effect of the low interest rates on asset prices, especially equity prices, happened, but there was less effect on investment, in part because the housing market did not recover as rapidly as expected.	13.0	108.0
201601	2184	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Markets have reason to believe that the period of extraordinary accommodation is now beginning to end, even though we have indicated that we will raise rates at a pace that is likely to be gradual.	13.0	108.0
201601	2185	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The beginning of the slow process of normalization has increased the probability that equity prices, too, will begin to normalize, which means that the very high q will likely decline.	13.0	108.0
201601	2186	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	That is a reasonable expectation, especially because the economy has not grown as fast as markets must have expected when the Great Recession began.	13.0	108.0
201601	2187	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The outlook for inflation remains a concern.	13.0	108.0
201601	2188	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I retain my belief that the basic logic of the Phillips curve will, in the medium term, assert itself.	13.0	108.0
201601	2189	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And, indeed, the rate of compensation increase has moved up somewhat.	13.0	108.0
201601	2190	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	But we have continued to see further decreases in inflation, resulting from the continuing fall in oil prices and the ongoing effects of the appreciation of the dollar.	13.0	108.0
201601	2191	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I continue to believe that the ongoing declines in oil prices and in the appreciation of the dollar are temporary, and that when they stop, we will, after a while, see actual inflation rising to our target rate of 2 percent.	13.0	108.0
201601	2192	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	But the recent behavior of the price of oil and the weaknesses in many foreign economies have further delayed the beginnings of that return.	13.0	108.0
201601	2193	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	This further delay in the increase in inflation, in conjunction with the increase in downside risks to both output and inflation, have increased my uncertainty about the outlook and led me to the view that the trajectory of rate increases may be flatter than I had expected in December.	13.0	108.0
201601	2194	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	But there appear to be elements of herd behavior in the financial markets.	13.0	108.0
201601	2195	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Steve Kamin referred to that in his presentation.	13.0	108.0
201601	2196	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And we could see a stabilization or change in direction of those markets before the March meeting.	13.0	108.0
201601	2197	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Of course, our views will also be informed by the rate at which employment increases.	13.0	108.0
201601	2198	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thus, the signal we will send by and following our decision tomorrow will be extremely important.	13.0	108.0
201601	2199	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201601	2200	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201601	2201	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13.0	65.0
201601	2202	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201601	2203	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	My only two points on the economy are, I think, in agreement with what many of you have already said.	13.0	97.0
201601	2204	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	First, I agree that the baseline economic outlook hasn’t really changed much since December, though I was and remain somewhat less optimistic than the median participant on GDP growth and the degree to which inflation will turn toward the 2 percent target.	13.0	97.0
201601	2205	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Second—and here I thought I was not going to be as much in agreement, but I think the first half-dozen of you roughly agree with what I am about to say—I think that the risks are now weighted to the downside, as compared with December.	13.0	97.0
201601	2206	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	At that time, I thought they were only modestly so, but I find them now decidedly weighted to the downside.	13.0	97.0
201601	2207	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	David, Dennis, Eric, Stan, and probably a few others of you have already mentioned some of them, so I won’t rehearse them in turn.	13.0	97.0
201601	2208	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I did, though, want to emphasize one in particular.	13.0	97.0
201601	2209	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think the upside risks for the dollar and the associated downside risks facing the economy are rather greater than the Tealbook suggested and than I have heard to this point.	13.0	97.0
201601	2210	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Some of that is because of my view on developments in China, and some of it is because of where I think the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank may go and the Bank of England may not go over the course of the next several meetings.	13.0	97.0
201601	2211	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	On China, I think anybody who thinks they know what is going on there is fooling themselves right now.	13.0	97.0
201601	2212	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I was struck, when Governor Fischer and I were in Basel two weeks ago, by the divergence between those who are mostly talking to the professionals and those who would actually talk to senior political leadership, obviously not in Basel but elsewhere.	13.0	97.0
201601	2213	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	There was a pretty big divergence in the perceptions that those two groups had, which suggested that there is still an effort within China to figure out where they want to go, and that there are political impetuses or constraints overlaid on the judgments that the professionals in the People’s Bank are making on a regular basis.	13.0	97.0
201601	2214	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I want to turn away from the economy as such for a second, to talk a bit about the monitoring mechanism for the components of inflation that David Wilcox introduced.	13.0	97.0
201601	2215	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I first want to thank the staff for taking the time and effort to try to develop such a mechanism.	13.0	97.0
201601	2216	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	In December, when the Committee concluded that it had reasonable confidence that inflation would return to the 2 percent target, the SEP medians for both core and headline inflation for 2016 were 1.6 percent.	13.0	97.0
201601	2217	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Behind those projections was a narrative—to some degree explicit, to some degree implicit—about how those outcomes would be realized, such as through fading effects from energy prices, increasing effects from further reductions in the output gap, and—for some, perhaps—other factors such as the reemergence of significant increases in health-care costs.	13.0	97.0
201601	2218	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Some of us who have rather more hope than confidence that this is the path inflation will follow were particularly focused on the inclusion of language in the December statement indicating that “in light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.”	13.0	97.0
201601	2219	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I think that this is obviously what the staff is trying to help us do.	13.0	97.0
201601	2220	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I would welcome efforts by Reserve Bank staff or others to create complementary mechanisms that will, in effect, impose some discipline on the statement of reasonable confidence that was made in December—reasonable confidence, with a trajectory and a narrative behind it.	13.0	97.0
201601	2221	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I think it’s important that we be testing that in real time, not necessarily because actual inflation may go up during that period.	13.0	97.0
201601	2222	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think there is every reason to believe that with the change in energy prices, even since December, that won’t happen.	13.0	97.0
201601	2223	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	But as the decomposition of the core inflation rate in David’s exhibit 9 shows, there is a way in which we can question ourselves on an ongoing basis as to whether what was expected to happen is in fact in the process of happening, or whether it isn’t happening, or something else has intervened in the interim.	13.0	97.0
201601	2224	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I think by doing that, some, like me, who were a little bit less than reasonably confident, might be made more so.	13.0	97.0
201601	2225	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Or, contrariwise, those who were reasonably confident might have some grounds for questioning those assumptions.	13.0	97.0
201601	2226	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think it is important to have this discipline.	13.0	97.0
201601	2227	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, actually, Jim, it’s one of the reasons why I do think it’s important to look at the actual inflation numbers as well as expectations.	13.0	97.0
201601	2228	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	It’s in order to discipline the expectations, because the actuals help us test the basis on which prior expectations were formed to see if those have to be modified in the future.	13.0	97.0
201601	2229	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	The staff, too, I think, can help us isolate what’s going on underneath, particularly, the core numbers, and if not provide definitive answers, at least provoke a discussion among us that will enhance that self-discipline as we try to see whether the expected path of inflation will in fact track, fall short of, or even exceed what we put forth in the December SEP.	13.0	97.0
201601	2230	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201601	2231	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201601	2232	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13.0	65.0
201601	2233	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201601	2234	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Since the December meeting, incoming spending and production data have been weaker than expected.	13.0	104.0
201601	2235	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The weakness was partly due to lower consumption of energy services thanks to unusually warm weather late in the year and to a negative surprise in inventory investment, both of which should prove to be transitory factors.	13.0	104.0
201601	2236	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Labor market data, on the other hand, were strong right through December, with monthly increases in payroll jobs averaging 284,000 for the fourth quarter and 220,000 for all of 2015.	13.0	104.0
201601	2237	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Wages seem to be on a path of moderate increases, with signs of gradual acceleration.	13.0	104.0
201601	2238	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	In addition, the Michigan survey shows ongoing strength in consumer confidence, as do the latest Conference Board and Bloomberg surveys, suggesting that, for now, consumers view the world as more like that indicated by the labor data.	13.0	104.0
201601	2239	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Putting all of that together, the nonfinancial data suggest that one might reasonably expect the economy to continue to expand at a moderate rate, although probably lower than what was expected in December.	13.0	104.0
201601	2240	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The financial markets appear to be expressing a different view.	13.0	104.0
201601	2241	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	With the big selloff in risky assets since the December meeting, the S&P 500 is down 7 percent.	13.0	104.0
201601	2242	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Credit spreads have increased further, especially for lower-quality issuers.	13.0	104.0
201601	2243	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Volatility has spiked, and oil prices are down another 20 percent.	13.0	104.0
201601	2244	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The broad trade-weighted dollar is up 2½ percent.	13.0	104.0
201601	2245	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Overall, there has been a significant tightening in financial conditions estimated by credible external economists as the equivalent of three or four tightenings.	13.0	104.0
201601	2246	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	On the basis of my reading of the vast flow of commentary out there, it seems that macroeconomists generally take only modest signal from the financial market selloff so far and see increased but still relatively low chances of a significant reduction in economic growth or a recession.	13.0	104.0
201601	2247	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The Tealbook view—and I think the Tealbook does a great job, by the way, of assessing the downside risks to the modal view—is essentially also in that vein.	13.0	104.0
201601	2248	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	It is also my view, although I hold it with fingers crossed for hope.	13.0	104.0
201601	2249	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Nonetheless, the financial markets are signaling elevated risk, and some financial economists point, in particular, to the big increases in credit spreads as a sign of trouble.	13.0	104.0
201601	2250	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And I understand that Thomas is going to be discussing some of that work in his presentation, I take it, tomorrow morning.	13.0	104.0
201601	2251	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The intense risk focus is clearly evident in conversations with investors and in the rash of pieces by Wall Street economists asking whether a recession is coming.	13.0	104.0
201601	2252	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	That fear may or may not be justified.	13.0	104.0
201601	2253	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And even if it is not justified, the deterioration in financial conditions may itself contaminate real activity by holding back household consumption or business hiring and investment.	13.0	104.0
201601	2254	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And as I’m sure many have around the table, I’ve been trying to unpack what is really driving the financial market, because it’s not the real data.	13.0	104.0
201601	2255	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And I can come up quickly with four related stories, probably all four of which are playing some kind of a role.	13.0	104.0
201601	2256	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And all of them strike me as having some basis, but, frankly, as either overdone or premature.	13.0	104.0
201601	2257	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Of course, there’s no way to know.	13.0	104.0
201601	2258	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	We’re not good at predicting these downturns, and we’ll have to simply wait and see.	13.0	104.0
201601	2259	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The first narrative, though, is really grounded in US cyclical considerations.	13.0	104.0
201601	2260	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And I think that this is the one probably gets less play than China and oil and the fourth one I’ll talk about.	13.0	104.0
201601	2261	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And it goes along the following lines.	13.0	104.0
201601	2262	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	It’s pretty downbeat.	13.0	104.0
201601	2263	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I don’t vouch for all of this, I’m just reporting it.	13.0	104.0
201601	2264	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The manufacturing sector is barely growing, thanks to the strong dollar and lower oil prices.	13.0	104.0
201601	2265	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The service sector is growing but has to carry an awful lot of weight with little help.	13.0	104.0
201601	2266	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The corporate profits cycle has turned, and they have begun to decline from their peak.	13.0	104.0
201601	2267	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	After years of cost-cutting and meager investment, US businesses have squeezed their income statements to the limit, and to continue to drive earnings, they will have to start doing more with their balance sheets.	13.0	104.0
201601	2268	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The credit cycle has also turned, for now.	13.0	104.0
201601	2269	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Spreads have blown out, and banks are tightening credit standards for C&I and CRE loans.	13.0	104.0
201601	2270	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The flow of newly issued leverage loans has dried up.	13.0	104.0
201601	2271	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And against that background, asset prices have had support from years of accommodative monetary policy and have been ripe for a correction.	13.0	104.0
201601	2272	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Meanwhile, global economic growth is even weaker than our own, which will hurt us through our stronger dollar.	13.0	104.0
201601	2273	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I said it was downbeat—very downbeat.	13.0	104.0
201601	2274	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And if you take all of that together, that does amount to a credible set of factors that could weigh on economic growth through credit availability, wealth reduction, and a stronger dollar, not to mention general risk aversion.	13.0	104.0
201601	2275	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	It’s a plausible, if premature, story for a weakening economy.	13.0	104.0
201601	2276	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	We don’t yet see it in the labor market data or the real data.	13.0	104.0
201601	2277	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And I also know that if you look at the factor models or the leading indicator models, they don’t actually prove this up.	13.0	104.0
201601	2278	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	But the persistence of these factors means that, over time, they could well prove it up.	13.0	104.0
201601	2279	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	We’ve talked about the second and third narratives, China and oil, a lot already.	13.0	104.0
201601	2280	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The China story concerns the risk of a hard landing, a substantial devaluation of the renminbi, or both.	13.0	104.0
201601	2281	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Markets are also unnerved by the apparent clumsiness since last summer on the part of typically sure-handed Chinese economic officials.	13.0	104.0
201601	2282	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And overall leverage in the Chinese economy increased very rapidly after the crisis to quite high levels, which is a story that doesn’t tend to end well.	13.0	104.0
201601	2283	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Yet, as Steve pointed out, incoming economic data from China show no sign of unexpected weakness.	13.0	104.0
201601	2284	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	There is no doubt that China faces a difficult transition, but it may be that China can manage through this.	13.0	104.0
201601	2285	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The oil story is that low oil prices, driven by weak demand and a supply glut, will undermine US activity either through financial contagion or by reducing activity in the oil patch.	13.0	104.0
201601	2286	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The domestic financial contagion story is real, but I am not sure how substantial it is.	13.0	104.0
201601	2287	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The debt issued by energy firms is not now held principally by large, systemically important financial institutions, but rather by mutual funds and other asset managers.	13.0	104.0
201601	2288	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And we haven’t seen difficulties there.	13.0	104.0
201601	2289	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I do take President Kaplan’s point that we haven’t run the test with $15 oil.	13.0	104.0
201601	2290	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And it may be that credit spreads on high-yield bonds for oil and $15 per barrel oil could produce run characteristics and damage the economy.	13.0	104.0
201601	2291	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	We haven’t seen that yet.	13.0	104.0
201601	2292	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	There’s also the possibility, as outlined in the “China-Driven Crisis in the Emerging Market Economies” alternative scenario, that lower oil prices could really put commodity- exporting emerging market countries in serious trouble.	13.0	104.0
201601	2293	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And we would certainly feel that kind of a crisis.	13.0	104.0
201601	2294	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	But without such an event, it’s worth remembering, I think, that low oil prices should be a net benefit for our economy.	13.0	104.0
201601	2295	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	We are a very large oil importer.	13.0	104.0
201601	2296	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The pain may be front-end- loaded through declining drilling investment and weaker oil patch employment, but the overall proposition that oil prices benefit the US economy still seems to be right to me.	13.0	104.0
201601	2297	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	A fourth and final factor may also be playing a role, and that is that—someone referred to it over here earlier—central banks have changed their posture and may no longer be standing in such a supportive way, relative to asset markets.	13.0	104.0
201601	2298	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	So there’s a reasonable possibility that all of these bad narratives may linger in the financial markets and weigh on economic activity.	13.0	104.0
201601	2299	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	We’ll just have to wait and see.	13.0	104.0
201601	2300	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Two final comments, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201601	2301	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	First, on inflation, the stronger dollar and lower oil prices will mean that these negative effects will linger even longer, which will allow further patience on the Committee’s part.	13.0	104.0
201601	2302	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The underlying story of inflation returning to 2 percent in the medium term is still credible to me, assuming that economic growth continues above trend and the labor market continues to tighten.	13.0	104.0
201601	2303	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Second, and finally, it does seem to me that the balance of risks has probably shifted to the downside; at the same time, it also seems to me premature to embrace that conclusion fully in our statement.	13.0	104.0
201601	2304	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	More on that tomorrow.	13.0	104.0
201601	2305	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201601	2306	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201601	2307	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13.0	65.0
201601	2308	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	107.0
201601	2309	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The intermeeting period has seen an intensification of global crosscurrents, with volatility spilling over into our financial markets.	13.0	107.0
201601	2310	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The associated financial tightening poses downside risks to domestic activity, which so far has remained resilient, and to inflation, which was already soft and coming in persistently under target.	13.0	107.0
201601	2311	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I believe the underlying drivers of these crosscurrents are likely to be with us for some time.	13.0	107.0
201601	2312	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The recent data on our labor market and aggregate spending have been mixed, with the employment data suggesting a pickup in momentum, while the spending data point to a softening.	13.0	107.0
201601	2313	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The underlying trajectory of activity likely lies somewhere between these two signals.	13.0	107.0
201601	2314	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	However, looking beyond the near term, the global environment is likely to continue weighing on activity and inflation and presents an important downside risk.	13.0	107.0
201601	2315	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Global growth remains subdued, with many advanced economies facing strong disinflationary forces, and many emerging economies suffering from the combined effects of the drop in commodity prices together with weaker demand from China.	13.0	107.0
201601	2316	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	This implies downward pressure on US inflation throughout the year, threatening progress on our inflation target.	13.0	107.0
201601	2317	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Let me take each facet in turn.	13.0	107.0
201601	2318	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The December labor market report showed strong job gains at the end of last year and a continued take-up in labor market slack.	13.0	107.0
201601	2319	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Although the unemployment rate was flat, labor force participation moved up.	13.0	107.0
201601	2320	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, despite changing little in December, average hourly earnings rose 2½ percent over the year, somewhat faster than the average pace thus far over the recovery.	13.0	107.0
201601	2321	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	While fourth-quarter job growth seems somewhat outsized when judged against the underlying trend, the opposite could be said of aggregate spending, with indicators currently suggesting a fourth-quarter annualized increase in GDP of only ½ percentage point.	13.0	107.0
201601	2322	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Some of this weakness, such as further moderation in the pace of inventory accumulation, seems unlikely to persist.	13.0	107.0
201601	2323	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, the recent weakening in some of the indicators of consumer spending, such as retail sales, seem out of sync with the support to consumer spending from job gains, real income growth, and elevated sentiment, although this might be slightly damped by the nearly 10 percent fall in equity prices since our last meeting.	13.0	107.0
201601	2324	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Overall, I wouldn’t expect spending growth to rebound to more than a moderate pace.	13.0	107.0
201601	2325	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	While the housing sector looks likely to continue its gradual recovery and government purchases will offer a small additional boost, the global environment continues to weigh on aggregate activity.	13.0	107.0
201601	2326	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	From the summer of 2014 to December, the real dollar increased 17 percent, and nominal changes in the dollar since then suggest another 3 percent real appreciation on top of that.	13.0	107.0
201601	2327	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, net exports likely subtracted a little over ½ percentage point from GDP growth last year, and econometric models, such as the one used by the staff, suggest net exports will subtract a further 1 percentage point this year.	13.0	107.0
201601	2328	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	A higher dollar, along with lower energy prices, have also restrained manufacturing output, which looks to be close to flat in the fourth quarter, and business investment, for which indicators suggest only tepid gains heading into this year.	13.0	107.0
201601	2329	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It has been assumed that falling oil prices would contribute on net to aggregate demand, offsetting the drag arising from the behavior of the dollar.	13.0	107.0
201601	2330	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	But thus far, the offsetting contribution is hard to discern.	13.0	107.0
201601	2331	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Declines in drilling and mining investment have been sizable, while the consumption response, as others have noted, has been somewhat smaller than it has historically been.	13.0	107.0
201601	2332	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Indeed, although real income looks to have increased nearly 4 percent last year, the gain in consumption appears to have been considerably smaller and the saving rate appears to have increased by close to 1 percentage point.	13.0	107.0
201601	2333	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Also notable has been the accompanying tightening in financial conditions.	13.0	107.0
201601	2334	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The size of the decline in oil prices, together with the large footprint of the domestic oil industry since the shale oil boom, may be leading to greater strains in corporate bond markets than historical data would have suggested.	13.0	107.0
201601	2335	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Many energy companies have experienced significant financial distress, and the associated pullback from risk appears to be spilling over more broadly.	13.0	107.0
201601	2336	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It is also noteworthy that the recent oil price decline has negatively affected important commodity-producing countries, including our two largest trading partners, Canada and Mexico, who account for nearly 40 percent of our exports.	13.0	107.0
201601	2337	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Anemic foreign demand is an important underlying driver of both the succession of downward movements in oil prices and upward movements in the exchange rate.	13.0	107.0
201601	2338	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	This weakness has been widespread, affecting important advanced foreign economies and emerging economies.	13.0	107.0
201601	2339	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In assessing the risks associated with this weakness, it’s important to note that the weakening in foreign growth, the decline in commodity prices, and the strengthening of the dollar have been considerably greater and more persistent than most observers expected.	13.0	107.0
201601	2340	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	While there is good reason to look through truly transitory moves in oil prices and the dollar, the exchange rate in fact has strengthened in each of the six quarters since mid-2014, for a cumulative increase of nearly 20 percent in real effective terms.	13.0	107.0
201601	2341	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And oil prices have dropped in five of those six quarters for a greater cumulative decline.	13.0	107.0
201601	2342	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Just as the futures price of crude oil two to three years out has been subject to persistent, repeated markdowns over the past year and a half, so too the projected peak in the dollar has been repeatedly marked up.	13.0	107.0
201601	2343	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The IMF’s most recent downgrade of the outlook for global growth is only the latest in a string of downgrades going back to early 2014.	13.0	107.0
201601	2344	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, the global adjustment to the economic transition in China is likely to be with us for some time.	13.0	107.0
201601	2345	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I think many people are struggling with how it is possible for China to both be hitting its domestic growth and employment targets and still see such large negative spillovers into the rest of the world economy.	13.0	107.0
201601	2346	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Structural transformation indeed appears to be under way in China, with indicators suggesting that consumption and services are indeed accounting for increasing shares of economic growth.	13.0	107.0
201601	2347	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	But even if China successfully rebalances, without a sharp slowing in its domestic employment and growth, the implications of this transition away from trade- and investment-intensive activities could be quite sobering for many of its trade partners.	13.0	107.0
201601	2348	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	China’s massive investment has accounted for nearly one-third of global investment over the past three years, which in turn has absorbed about one-half of global consumption in metals, from iron ore to aluminum to copper to nickel.	13.0	107.0
201601	2349	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Even with its recent slowing, China still accounts for nearly 40 percent of global growth.	13.0	107.0
201601	2350	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	With imports down 14 percent last year and investment needing to contract significantly further as a share of GDP, the change in the pattern of China’s growth is being painfully felt in countries from Australia to Brazil.	13.0	107.0
201601	2351	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, the accumulated financial-sector imbalances pose downside risks, as we have seen with the sharp movements in China’s equity markets.	13.0	107.0
201601	2352	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Little clarity remains about China’s intentions with regard to its exchange rate mechanism.	13.0	107.0
201601	2353	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	If anything, recent policy moves have added to confusion and volatility.	13.0	107.0
201601	2354	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Since China’s senior leadership affirmed their commitment to the basic stability of the RMB in the fall, the currency has depreciated materially further both against the dollar and against their preferred basket.	13.0	107.0
201601	2355	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	China’s exchange rate regime shift is a marked contrast to China’s strategy in previous episodes of financial crisis in which China strengthened its commitment to a peg in order to foster stability.	13.0	107.0
201601	2356	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	So it should be no surprise that market participants are on high alert.	13.0	107.0
201601	2357	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	While there are good reasons to expect China’s policymakers have the will and the capacity to avoid adverse tail scenarios to their domestic activity, nonetheless, the complexity of the challenges they face, together with their relative inexperience in managing financial market volatility that has global repercussions, should lead us to put some weight on recurring bouts of volatility rather than viewing the two episodes we have seen as one-offs.	13.0	107.0
201601	2358	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	More broadly, I think it is appropriate to recognize global challenges as a prominent downside risk to both our inflation and employment goals.	13.0	107.0
201601	2359	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	At the current juncture, the threat to our inflation goal seems particularly prominent, as the most recent data suggest inflation will continue to be well short of our 2 percent target through the near term; that we have continually revised down our projections for core inflation; and that, although the staff and Committee members continue to have inflation eventually moving back to 2 percent, the timing regarding when we get there keeps being delayed.	13.0	107.0
201601	2360	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Persistently low inflation, of course, is a concern not only here but also in many other advanced economies.	13.0	107.0
201601	2361	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, market-based measures of inflation expectations, both here and abroad, have slipped further, recently touching historic lows.	13.0	107.0
201601	2362	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The persistence and global nature of the forces holding down inflation have important implications for the risks surrounding our inflation forecasts and for monetary policy, a subject to which we turn tomorrow.	13.0	107.0
201601	2363	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	13.0	107.0
201601	2364	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201601	2365	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13.0	65.0
201601	2366	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201601	2367	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I think I’m number 10, and I’m beginning to feel the pain that some of the Governors have talked about before, listening to so many people.	13.0	91.0
201601	2368	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	13.0	91.0
201601	2369	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Much has been said already, but still, I’ll try to spice it up and be nimble.	13.0	91.0
201601	2370	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	In spite of the strong labor market data that we received, I continued to hear mostly downbeat assessments from my business contacts.	13.0	91.0
201601	2371	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Also, the incoming data on spending have been disappointing.	13.0	91.0
201601	2372	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	My view is that GDP growth for the fourth quarter will come in close to the Tealbook’s meager projection of ½ percent, and financial market developments will add some further restraint to the economy.	13.0	91.0
201601	2373	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	These crosscurrents increase uncertainty over the outlooks for economic growth and inflation, and they make me nervous.	13.0	91.0
201601	2374	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Nevertheless, I think it would be a mistake to overreact today to the softer spending data and financial volatility.	13.0	91.0
201601	2375	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	After all, last August and September, we found ourselves facing volatile financial markets and a disappointing slowing in job growth.	13.0	91.0
201601	2376	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	We responded with a well-timed pause in our policy plans and monitored how the uncertainty would play out.	13.0	91.0
201601	2377	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Financial markets soon settled down, and the labor market improved markedly, giving the Committee the confidence necessary to take our first move toward normalization.	13.0	91.0
201601	2378	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I see us in a similar situation today.	13.0	91.0
201601	2379	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	While uncertainty and the downside risks have risen in recent weeks, in my opinion, there’s not enough evidence yet to adjust the basic contours of the outlook, although I admit that December’s forecast does now seem a bit optimistic in light of intermeeting developments.	13.0	91.0
201601	2380	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	With this as background, it’s not surprising that I heard a mixture of views from my business contacts and directors.	13.0	91.0
201601	2381	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Along the same lines as President Lockhart’s comments, manufacturers with significant international exposures continue to face a very tough business environment.	13.0	91.0
201601	2382	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Some are talking about a recession in manufacturing, notably those in steel and heavy machinery, and they see little relief in sight.	13.0	91.0
201601	2383	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	In contrast, the attendees at our December 30 manufacturing roundtable were somewhat more optimistic.	13.0	91.0
201601	2384	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	While they acknowledged that late 2015 was dismal, most were hopeful and expecting growth to pick up over the next 6 to 12 months.	13.0	91.0
201601	2385	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	They and other contacts pointed to domestic strength in autos, aerospace, consumer- facing product markets, and labor markets in general.	13.0	91.0
201601	2386	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	In light of these mixed views, I think we will just have to wait and see how it all plays out.	13.0	91.0
201601	2387	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	But the international headwinds are strong.	13.0	91.0
201601	2388	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Even if the dollar stabilizes, as Governor Brainard was touching on, the trade-weighted dollar has risen 25 percent since the summer of 2014, and that’s a heavy lift for tradable goods sectors.	13.0	91.0
201601	2389	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	One thing that seems clear is that financial conditions have tightened.	13.0	91.0
201601	2390	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Both Discover Financial and Ford said it has become more difficult to sell asset-backed securities.	13.0	91.0
201601	2391	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Financing is still available, but spreads are higher and market volatility makes the timing of deals problematic.	13.0	91.0
201601	2392	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Other contacts noted that new issuance of high-yield debt has essentially shut down.	13.0	91.0
201601	2393	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	They report a similar contraction in the supply of leveraged loans.	13.0	91.0
201601	2394	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Our contact at PayNet, a small business credit bureau, also noted that there was an abrupt pullback in small business lending in October and November.	13.0	91.0
201601	2395	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	He attributed this mostly to increased caution on the part of borrowers as opposed to supply-side developments.	13.0	91.0
201601	2396	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	The bottom line is that the credit environment has tightened by more than simply our 25 basis point move.	13.0	91.0
201601	2397	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	It is unclear how these conditions will weigh on cap-ex and other spending, but it seems difficult to imagine that business confidence has been unaffected.	13.0	91.0
201601	2398	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	These developments bear watching, but if the essential intent of our renormalization is to tighten financial conditions, then I think we’re ahead of schedule—and Governor Powell’s comments regarding federal funds equivalent increases seem relevant on this point.	13.0	91.0
201601	2399	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	The news on inflation also suggests caution.	13.0	91.0
201601	2400	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Our December statement indicated confidence that inflation would rise to target over the medium term.	13.0	91.0
201601	2401	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Our communications have also pointed to developments that we are looking for to support that confidence, and I think the staff’s inflation dashboard ought to help us get at assessing those developments, too.	13.0	91.0
201601	2402	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	And I agree with Governor Tarullo’s comments there.	13.0	91.0
201601	2403	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Stabilization in energy and import prices are prominent on the list, but both oil prices and the dollar have again moved in the wrong direction.	13.0	91.0
201601	2404	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	We’ve also cited anchored expectations as a key inflation support.	13.0	91.0
201601	2405	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I’ve been uncomfortable for a while with the continued low levels of inflation breakevens, and their recent further deterioration has only made matters worse.	13.0	91.0
201601	2406	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	The most benign interpretation is that these unusually low readings can be ignored as statistical noise or market anomalies.	13.0	91.0
201601	2407	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Maybe this is right, but other measures, such as the Michigan survey’s longer-term inflation expectations, also are near 25-year lows.	13.0	91.0
201601	2408	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	To remain confident about inflation pressures being right around the corner, the Committee will have to continue to look through a lot of uncomfortable data developments.	13.0	91.0
201601	2409	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	To sum up, my baseline forecast has not changed much since December, but the recent news beyond labor markets has been a sharp reminder that there continue to be large downside risks.	13.0	91.0
201601	2410	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201601	2411	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201601	2412	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13.0	65.0
201601	2413	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201601	2414	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I have been surprised during the intermeeting period by the relative weakness in US economic data other than those for labor markets, the selloff in global equity markets, and renewed declines in crude oil prices.	13.0	94.0
201601	2415	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I took some comfort that the staff forecast has not been changed substantially in response to these developments, at least as measured by Q1 real GDP growth.	13.0	94.0
201601	2416	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I thought that the staff’s explanations and expectations were reasonable, at least at this juncture.	13.0	94.0
201601	2417	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Nevertheless, I think it’s appropriate to watch and wait at this time to see if the seeming weakness in economic growth in the second half of 2015 persists into the first half of 2016.	13.0	94.0
201601	2418	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’m also mindful of a topic that we’ve not mentioned today:  Q1 residual seasonality, which has plagued us in the last couple of years.	13.0	94.0
201601	2419	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	It’s possible you get another weaker-looking quarter now on that basis.	13.0	94.0
201601	2420	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Although the Eighth District continues to grow at a moderate pace, I’ve been concerned during the intermeeting period with anecdotes from District contacts.	13.0	94.0
201601	2421	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Some companies reported substantial drop-offs in activity in December and into January.	13.0	94.0
201601	2422	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I will be very interested to see whether the activity levels for these firms recover in the weeks ahead.	13.0	94.0
201601	2423	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’ve heard a lot about the state of US agriculture since the first of the year.	13.0	94.0
201601	2424	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	The US agricultural sector is large.	13.0	94.0
201601	2425	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	It has been doing relatively well since the recession ended, a relative strong point in the economy, but many components of this sector were weaker in 2015 because of declines in many key commodity prices since the summer of 2014.	13.0	94.0
201601	2426	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	In the Eighth District, the outlook for the ag sector was considered weak during the October–November 2015 timeframe.	13.0	94.0
201601	2427	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Since then, crude oil prices have renewed their decline, and many other commodity prices fell in sympathy.	13.0	94.0
201601	2428	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Since the first of the year, many Eighth District farmers and bankers are looking at the likely 2016 prices with considerable trepidation.	13.0	94.0
201601	2429	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	On the basis of the discussions I have had, I expect a particularly weak year for agribusiness income.	13.0	94.0
201601	2430	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I take this as an example of the effects of commodity price declines, which could be substantial beyond those coming directly from the renewed fall in crude oil prices.	13.0	94.0
201601	2431	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	The renewed decline in crude oil prices since early November has also caused me to revisit my ideas about the state of US medium- and longer-term inflation expectations.	13.0	94.0
201601	2432	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	As has been discussed here extensively, TIPS-based measures of inflation expectations over the medium term have fallen around 75 basis points since the summer of 2014, when crude oil began its recent fall.	13.0	94.0
201601	2433	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I have argued that TIPS-based measures of inflation expectations are useful indicators of the state of markets on this dimension.	13.0	94.0
201601	2434	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	However, the high correlation between crude oil prices and market-based inflation expectations has been a puzzle.	13.0	94.0
201601	2435	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	As President Evans was just referring to, I have argued for a wait-and-see policy on this aspect of monetary policy over the past 18 months.	13.0	94.0
201601	2436	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I thought that crude oil prices would likely stabilize and that, post- stabilization, market-based inflation expectations would return to more normal levels.	13.0	94.0
201601	2437	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	But the renewed decline in crude oil prices since November 2015, which again has pulled down inflation expectations, has led me to review this assumption.	13.0	94.0
201601	2438	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I am now concerned that inflation expectations may be falling in the United States regardless of crude oil price developments, and that the Committee may have to place more emphasis on this factor than we have in the past 18 months.	13.0	94.0
201601	2439	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201601	2440	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201601	2441	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13.0	65.0
201601	2442	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	81.0
201601	2443	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I’ll abbreviate, in the interest of time, my regional comments.	13.0	81.0
201601	2444	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Conditions improved in the Fifth District.	13.0	81.0
201601	2445	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I didn’t pick up the broad, downbeat tone, but I think it’s fair to say that reports were mixed in manufacturing.	13.0	81.0
201601	2446	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Our composite manufacturing index that came out this morning was marginally positive.	13.0	81.0
201601	2447	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Service- sector revenue rose to plus 10, and contacts in retail and nonretail were very positive.	13.0	81.0
201601	2448	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Labor markets are strong outside West Virginia, where things are pretty weak.	13.0	81.0
201601	2449	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The employment indexes in all of our surveys were solidly positive.	13.0	81.0
201601	2450	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	In housing markets, the anecdotal comments were universally positive.	13.0	81.0
201601	2451	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Commercial real estate reports were upbeat, notably in DC, which has been a quite soft market for years.	13.0	81.0
201601	2452	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The belief is that the new federal appropriations are going to add to demand for office space.	13.0	81.0
201601	2453	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	And in some areas, availability of skilled and unskilled construction workers is limiting construction activity.	13.0	81.0
201601	2454	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	On the national economy, I agree with the Tealbook’s assessment that the outlook hasn’t changed much since our previous meeting.	13.0	81.0
201601	2455	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	In fact, the labor market, if anything, looks better than we thought.	13.0	81.0
201601	2456	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We’ve now reached a point at which the unemployment rate is just one-tenth above the median of SEP estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate, just three- tenths above the lower bound of the range of those projections, and, of course, one-tenth below the natural rate estimated by the staff.	13.0	81.0
201601	2457	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	For me, this suggests that the extent of any underutilization of labor resources is likely to be quite limited now, and, to me, that suggests that there’s less scope for further declines in the unemployment rate from here.	13.0	81.0
201601	2458	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	In addition, the labor force participation rate is now, someone remarked, within confidence bands of any plausible estimate of trend.	13.0	81.0
201601	2459	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Tealbook has it as just ¼ percentage point below trend.	13.0	81.0
201601	2460	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	As demographics are going to be driving labor force participation down over time, I think we should expect little, if any, further boost to employment growth from gains to participation.	13.0	81.0
201601	2461	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	As a result, I expect monthly payroll employment growth to decline over the next couple of years toward its longer-run trend rate of less than 100,000 per month.	13.0	81.0
201601	2462	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Growth in labor productivity has been relatively low for the past several years on average.	13.0	81.0
201601	2463	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	If it was to rise, as the Tealbook forecasts, it could offset the decline in employment growth and allow real GDP to continue to grow at about its current pace.	13.0	81.0
201601	2464	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	This certainly could happen.	13.0	81.0
201601	2465	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Productivity growth is notoriously hard to forecast, but I don’t see any compelling reason why that’s more likely than a continuation of current trends.	13.0	81.0
201601	2466	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	So, on the basis of all we know, I think a more reasonable expectation is that labor productivity over the medium term will grow at about the same low rate it has grown over the last few years.	13.0	81.0
201601	2467	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	A continuation of low productivity growth, together with low employment growth, implies that real GDP growth will moderate over time from its recent average of around 2¼ percent to, perhaps, around 1¾ percent.	13.0	81.0
201601	2468	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	In the context of slowing GDP growth, one would expect a moderation of consumption growth relative to the high rates we’ve seen over the past two years.	13.0	81.0
201601	2469	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	On the near term, I agree with the Tealbook that we should expect a rebound from the disappointing retail sales numbers in the late fourth quarter.	13.0	81.0
201601	2470	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Beyond the near term, I wouldn’t be surprised to see consumption growth moderate somewhat.	13.0	81.0
201601	2471	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Growth in business fixed investment was slower last year, and that seems attributable in part to the effects of lower oil prices.	13.0	81.0
201601	2472	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The boom in shale oil extraction spawned by oil prices above $100 a barrel returned oil production to 1980s levels.	13.0	81.0
201601	2473	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The decline in oil prices to nearly $30 a barrel over the past year and a half has resulted in a corresponding investment bust, of course.	13.0	81.0
201601	2474	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	One should pay attention whenever spending in a significant sector declines so dramatically, but the secondary effects of this bust seem likely to remain limited because oil and gas extraction is a relatively small portion of the economy.	13.0	81.0
201601	2475	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I would note that it is far smaller than residential construction:  The peak shares of employment and investment connected to oil extraction were significantly smaller than the shares associated with residential construction at the peak of the housing boom.	13.0	81.0
201601	2476	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Moreover, significant adjustment in oil-sector employment and investment apparently has already taken place.	13.0	81.0
201601	2477	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Over the longer run, I expect that the beneficial effects of lower oil prices due to reduced costs to energy users is going to outweigh the adverse effects of reduced employment and investment spending in the energy sector.	13.0	81.0
201601	2478	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The unexpected decline in oil prices and further dollar appreciation since the previous meeting have also affected the near-term outlook for inflation.	13.0	81.0
201601	2479	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I interpret this the way we’ve interpreted previous oil and dollar impulses; namely, as another transitory shock to headline and core inflation.	13.0	81.0
201601	2480	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It will delay somewhat our return to 2 percent inflation.	13.0	81.0
201601	2481	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Having said that, I have to admit, I’m a bit apprehensive about the five-year, five-year-forward TIPS compensation falling below 1.5 percent.	13.0	81.0
201601	2482	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I think it’s reassuring that estimates of expected inflation extracted from TIPS compensation did not seem to have fallen, but our ability to disentangle expectations from risk premiums is imperfect.	13.0	81.0
201601	2483	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Finally, it’s hard to talk about the economic situation without commenting on the recent unpleasantness in equity markets.	13.0	81.0
201601	2484	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	At a broad level, the sudden decline in equity prices seems way out of proportion with any tangible change in the outlook for economic fundamentals.	13.0	81.0
201601	2485	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I agree with others who have made that point.	13.0	81.0
201601	2486	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The equity risk premium appears to have risen, as have measures of expected volatility, suggesting that investors, as Nellie said, are placing greater weight on some adverse outcomes, either domestically or abroad.	13.0	81.0
201601	2487	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	But these measures haven’t moved outside the range of values we’ve seen over the past several years.	13.0	81.0
201601	2488	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	So at this point, my modal economic projection is unchanged, although I think it’s reasonable to put slightly more probability on downside scenarios.	13.0	81.0
201601	2489	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	And while I’ll be watching equity market developments with great interest in the weeks ahead, I remain mindful of the risk of overreacting to financial market moves that aren’t demonstrably connected with weakening economic fundamentals.	13.0	81.0
201601	2490	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	81.0
201601	2491	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201601	2492	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, we’ll turn to President Mester.	13.0	65.0
201601	2493	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And then, I think, although there are a couple of speakers left, I propose we adjourn until tomorrow.	13.0	65.0
201601	2494	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Some of our staff are going to have a tough time getting home—and maybe not only staff.	13.0	65.0
201601	2495	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	13.0	65.0
201601	2496	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So let’s do what we can so that people can get on the road.	13.0	65.0
201601	2497	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Loretta, though, please.	13.0	65.0
201601	2498	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201601	2499	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Over the intermeeting period, sentiment among business contacts in the Fourth District turned down and indicators of activity in the energy-related and manufacturing sectors weakened further.	13.0	999.0
201601	2500	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	On the positive side, the retail and construction sectors showed improvement, and labor market indicators remained strong.	13.0	999.0
201601	2501	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Our diffusion index of business contacts reporting better versus worse conditions fell 18 points, from plus 2 in December to minus 16 in January, indicating some softening of business conditions.	13.0	999.0
201601	2502	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	This decline was driven mainly by reports from contacts in the energy, manufacturing, and freight sectors, which have been under pressure for some time and which are expected to face continued challenges in light of continued declines in oil prices and the rising dollar.	13.0	999.0
201601	2503	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Within manufacturing, the auto sector remains a bright spot.	13.0	999.0
201601	2504	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In contrast to President Lockhart’s report, the auto producers we spoke with remain optimistic despite weaker sales in December.	13.0	999.0
201601	2505	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Our retailers are also optimistic.	13.0	999.0
201601	2506	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Their sales toward the end of the year held up well, even as national retail sales were below market expectations.	13.0	999.0
201601	2507	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	These reports, coupled with the strong labor market, suggest that outside energy and manufacturing, the District economy is likely to continue expanding modestly.	13.0	999.0
201601	2508	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Indeed, the weaker sentiment among business contacts over the intermeeting period is somewhat at odds with these signs from the labor market, which show that firms are continuing to expand hiring at a good pace.	13.0	999.0
201601	2509	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	District labor market conditions appear to be at levels consistent with full employment.	13.0	999.0
201601	2510	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland Federal Reserve staff’s estimate of year-over-year growth in District payroll employment was 1.4 percent in November, little changed from October but up from a softer reading in September.	13.0	999.0
201601	2511	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Employment gains in 2015 were sufficient to push the District unemployment rate down below the national average to 4.7 percent in November, which is well below the minimum of 5.2 percent reached during the last expansion.	13.0	999.0
201601	2512	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Reports of tightening labor markets have spread beyond construction and skilled trades.	13.0	999.0
201601	2513	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Firms have reported they’re having difficulty filling positions in unskilled occupations, and there are rising wage pressures for entry-level employees in retail.	13.0	999.0
201601	2514	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Auto dealers noted troubles hiring qualified sales personnel as well as skilled auto technicians.	13.0	999.0
201601	2515	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Bankers reported having trouble filling not only midlevel positions, but also entry-level jobs, such as tellers and phone bank associates.	13.0	999.0
201601	2516	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	With regard to the national economy:  Economic growth stalled in the fourth quarter, pulled down by net exports and a slowdown in inventory investment.	13.0	999.0
201601	2517	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	National retail sales in December were also a bit disappointing.	13.0	999.0
201601	2518	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The question is whether this softness will last.	13.0	999.0
201601	2519	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	We also had to evaluate what the recent market volatility might imply about medium-run growth.	13.0	999.0
201601	2520	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	So I’m not sure what’s more disheartening—listening to the financial news stations during episodes of market turbulence, to the local news stations when a blizzard is coming, or to an excerpt of Rhapsody in Blue for three hours as you try to rebook a flight during said blizzard.	13.0	999.0
201601	2521	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	[Laughter]	13.0	999.0
201601	2522	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In any case, declines in global equity markets since the beginning of the year partly reflect market participants’ reassessment of the outlook for economic growth in China and their views on how effective actions undertaken by Chinese policymakers will be in fostering growth there.	13.0	999.0
201601	2523	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	As it relates to US growth, the direct trade ties between the US economy and China are low.	13.0	999.0
201601	2524	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	But because many emerging economies are considerably more dependent on trade with China, the implications of developments there for the global economy need to be considered.	13.0	999.0
201601	2525	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In addition to the decline in stock prices, we’ve seen another sharp decline in oil prices.	13.0	999.0
201601	2526	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In part, this reflects the same reassessment of global economic growth prospects affecting the stock market, but supply-side factors are perhaps more important.	13.0	999.0
201601	2527	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Worldwide oil inventories remain high, and oil production has not been as responsive as one might have thought, in view of the price declines seen over the past 18 months.	13.0	999.0
201601	2528	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	This means that oil prices are likely to remain lower for longer than previously anticipated, as it’s taken longer for supply to rebalance with demand.	13.0	999.0
201601	2529	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	So I ask myself, how should a data-dependent policymaker incorporate the recent developments in the medium-run outlook?	13.0	999.0
201601	2530	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Has there been an accumulation of enough evidence to actually materially change the medium-run outlook?	13.0	999.0
201601	2531	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	And my answer is “no.”	13.0	999.0
201601	2532	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The drop in oil prices means that the US energy sector and manufacturing sectors will continue to be under pressure.	13.0	999.0
201601	2533	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	However, lower energy prices will provide an offsetting benefit for the US consumer and those in other oil-importing countries.	13.0	999.0
201601	2534	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Although there’s always a possibility that a steeper, more persistent drop in equity markets could lead to a broader and persistent pullback in risk- taking, so far we’ve not seen this.	13.0	999.0
201601	2535	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Indeed, even during some of the recent market volatility, some of my directors reported seeing an increase in risk-taking, driven by low interest rates, rather than a pullback.	13.0	999.0
201601	2536	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	At this point, solid labor market indicators, including strong payroll growth, suggest to me that underlying fundamentals remain sound.	13.0	999.0
201601	2537	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	While I continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the outlook and risks to the outlook, at this point, I anticipate the US economy will likely work through the latest episode of market turbulence and the patch of weaker data and will regain its footing for moderate growth, even as the energy and manufacturing sectors remain challenged.	13.0	999.0
201601	2538	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I continue to expect that economic growth this year will be sufficient to generate some further improvement in labor markets.	13.0	999.0
201601	2539	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I see the risks associated with my forecasts regarding economic growth and labor markets as remaining roughly balanced.	13.0	999.0
201601	2540	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The latest round of oil price declines means headline inflation will remain lower for longer than I previously thought, but I still think a reasonable forecast is that inflation will gradually return to 2 percent over the medium run.	13.0	999.0
201601	2541	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Oil prices cannot continue to decline indefinitely, nor can the dollar continue to appreciate forever.	13.0	999.0
201601	2542	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	At some point, both will regain some stability, and the effects of previous changes on inflation will dissipate.	13.0	999.0
201601	2543	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	As that happens, with inflation expectations remaining stable—that’s my read of them—and economic growth continuing, I remain reasonably confident inflation will gradually move back to 2 percent.	13.0	999.0
201601	2544	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	It just may take a bit longer now, in light of the most recent decline in oil prices.	13.0	999.0
201601	2545	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	This has got me thinking about our characterization of the inflation outlook.	13.0	999.0
201601	2546	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	We’ve been saying the effects of the decline in energy prices are transitory, because when energy prices stabilize, the pass-through of past declines in the headline inflation dissipate.	13.0	999.0
201601	2547	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	However, we’ve now experienced a series of energy price declines, and although each decline has a transitory effect on headline inflation, the effect of the series of declines is longer lasting.	13.0	999.0
201601	2548	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	If energy prices continue to fall, we’ll need to strike the word “transitory” and make other adjustments to the characterization of our inflation outlook.	13.0	999.0
201601	2549	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Lower energy prices are a downside risk to inflation in the near term but pose an upside risk in the medium run because they may spur stronger-than-expected consumer and business spending in an environment of significantly accommodative monetary policy.	13.0	999.0
201601	2550	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	My reasonable confidence that inflation will gradually return to our objective over time recognizes there is and has always been large uncertainty regarding inflation forecasts.	13.0	999.0
201601	2551	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In many different models, 2 percent is within the 70 percent confidence interval of the inflation forecast for 2017.	13.0	999.0
201601	2552	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	These models include the Cleveland Federal Reserve staff’s baseline and steady-state Bayesian VAR models, the Tealbook, and several others that have been shown in the literature to perform well, including those of Stock and Watson and Faust and Wright.	13.0	999.0
201601	2553	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Of course, the 70 percent confidence interval also includes many lower levels of inflation as well.	13.0	999.0
201601	2554	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I wish we were able to forecast inflation with more precision, but, unfortunately, the state of the science—or, perhaps I should say, the state of the art—isn’t there yet.	13.0	999.0
201601	2555	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Central bank and academic economists are working hard to improve our forecasting models.	13.0	999.0
201601	2556	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In the meantime, policymakers will have to fight against any nihilistic tendencies—here I’m really speaking about myself—and deal with the uncertainty as best we can.	13.0	999.0
201601	2557	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201601	2558	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201601	2559	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest we quit now to let people get on the road to go home.	52.0	65.0
201601	2560	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll resume at 9 am  We’ll try to be expeditious tomorrow, and we should have time to conclude our work.	52.0	65.0
201601	2561	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Safe travels, everybody.	52.0	65.0
201601	2563	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	January 27 Session .	52.0	65.0
201601	2564	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, folks, let’s get started.	52.0	65.0
201601	2565	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think you all have in front of you a handout called “Revised Draft Press Release regarding Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.”	92.0	65.0
201601	2566	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I wanted to spend a moment discussing that.	92.0	65.0
201601	2567	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	In light of the fact that President Bullard has dissented, we thought it advisable to rewrite the press release that will accompany the statement and will reflect his reasons for dissenting.	92.0	65.0
201601	2568	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So to provide some necessary context, we also made some changes from the short paragraph that was distributed to you with the memo, and I wanted to give you the opportunity to see this before it’s released later today.	92.0	65.0
201601	2569	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	If you have any concerns, I would like to know about them.	92.0	65.0
201601	2570	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Maybe you can just spend a second looking this over.	92.0	65.0
201601	2571	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	It’s intended to provide a bit of context on what the Committee was doing in revising the statement.	92.0	65.0
201601	2572	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	92.0	65.0
201601	2573	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I have one.	92.0	104.0
201601	2574	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Do you want to wait a second to give people a chance to read it, or shall I launch in?	92.0	104.0
201601	2575	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Go ahead.	92.0	65.0
201601	2576	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Focusing on the last sentence, I, too, believe that “the Committee’s concern should be focused primarily on expected future deviations of inflation from the goal.”	92.0	104.0
201601	2577	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	So to say that that’s a basis for dissent is to say that that’s not what we believe this statement says.	92.0	104.0
201601	2578	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I think what President Bullard is really saying is that the statement doesn’t sufficiently point in that direction.	92.0	104.0
201601	2579	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The Committee does not have a different concern than the one that’s expressed here.	92.0	104.0
201601	2580	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Do you see my point?	92.0	104.0
201601	2581	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I do see your point.	92.0	65.0
201601	2582	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	The problem is that the minutes will come out and will reflect the discussion we had on that, and I think they will indicate that the view of most of the Committee is not inconsistent with President Bullard’s view.	92.0	65.0
201601	2583	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	However these are not the minutes.	92.0	65.0
201601	2584	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	This is just a cover sheet for releasing this statement.	92.0	65.0
201601	2585	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think our view—maybe Governor Fischer, President Mester, or others want to speak about this—was that almost everything that’s in here was essentially in the previous minutes, and we vote on the minutes.	92.0	65.0
201601	2586	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We didn’t want to get involved in writing a statement that would require a lot of editing and a vote.	92.0	65.0
201601	2587	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So we’ve just included some background but are not trying to offer a full discussion, which will later appear in the minutes.	92.0	65.0
201601	2588	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	92.0	65.0
201601	2589	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I share Governor Powell’s concern, and, as you say, there would be a three-week period in which members of the public might have a misimpression of what the other 16 members of the FOMC—at least the other 9 members plus the other participants—thought they were voting for.	92.0	97.0
201601	2590	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I wonder whether President Bullard might be amenable—it should be his language because it’s his statement—to a change in the formulation, which would at least allow people to infer that this is a difference of gradation rather than a binary issue.	92.0	97.0
201601	2591	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I’m just suggesting this language, and, obviously, again, it’s President Bullard’s.	92.0	97.0
201601	2592	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	But if that last clause read “but believed the Committee’s language is not adequately focused on expected future deviations of inflation from the goal” or something like that, it might allow him to take his principal position while not leaving people with a false impression of where most of the rest of us are.	92.0	97.0
201601	2593	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Another possibility along those lines, if President Bullard is amenable, would be “but believed that the statement should more clearly express that it is primarily focused.”	92.0	65.0
201601	2594	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Yes, I’d be open to either Governor Tarullo’s language or the language that you just gave.	92.0	94.0
201601	2595	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think insufficient focus is my main concern, and I wanted to force that point.	92.0	94.0
201601	2596	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I like the Chair’s language of “express” because, when you characterized your view, it was really about what that sentence said in terms of “were running” versus “expected.”	92.0	96.0
201601	2597	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think “express” focuses on how it’s more of a language issue than something more.	92.0	96.0
201601	2598	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Would that language, then, be acceptable to you, President Bullard?	92.0	65.0
201601	2599	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	It sounded acceptable.	92.0	94.0
201601	2600	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	It is acceptable?	92.0	65.0
201601	2601	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Yes.	92.0	94.0
201601	2602	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’m not sure exactly what it is, but it sounded good.	92.0	94.0
201601	2603	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	[Laughter]	92.0	94.0
201601	2604	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me read that language to you:  “Voting against was James Bullard, who agreed the Committee’s inflation goal is symmetric, but believed that the statement should more clearly express that it is primarily focused on expected future deviations of inflation from the goal.”	92.0	65.0
201601	2605	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	That’s perfectly acceptable to me.	92.0	94.0
201601	2606	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	92.0	65.0
201601	2607	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s fine.	92.0	102.0
201601	2608	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Loretta, are you okay with that?	92.0	65.0
201601	2609	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Yes.	92.0	999.0
201601	2610	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Is everybody okay with that?	92.0	65.0
201601	2611	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	92.0	108.0
201601	2612	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair.	92.0	81.0
201601	2613	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	92.0	65.0
201601	2614	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Did it say “should more clearly express that it is”?	92.0	81.0
201601	2615	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Is that what you said?	92.0	81.0
201601	2616	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	92.0	65.0
201601	2617	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Should it be “the Committee”?	92.0	81.0
201601	2618	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	No, it’s the statement.	92.0	102.0
201601	2619	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The statement.	92.0	107.0
201601	2620	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	It’s about the consensus statement.	92.0	108.0
201601	2621	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	About the statement of the Committee.	92.0	102.0
201601	2622	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	“The statement is primarily focused”—	92.0	65.0
201601	2623	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	You mean the statement?	92.0	81.0
201601	2624	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	You could say “but believed that the statement should more clearly express.”	92.0	999.0
201601	2625	2016-01-27	meeting	PARTICIPANTS	Yes.	92.0	999.0
201601	2626	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	That “it is,” or “the Committee is”?	92.0	65.0
201601	2627	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	That “it is primarily focused”?	92.0	65.0
201601	2628	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	That “the Committee is primarily focused.”	92.0	999.0
201601	2629	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So maybe it should be “the Committee.”	92.0	65.0
201601	2630	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Right.	92.0	999.0
201601	2631	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s try that again:  “the Committee’s inflation goal is symmetric, but believed that the statement should more clearly express that the Committee is primarily”—	92.0	65.0
201601	2632	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Right.	92.0	81.0
201601	2633	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Right.	92.0	999.0
201601	2634	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	No.	92.0	102.0
201601	2635	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	You’re starting to talk about Committee actions at that point.	92.0	91.0
201601	2636	2016-01-27	meeting	PARTICIPANTS	It’s the statement.	92.0	999.0
201601	2637	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	“But believed that the statement should more clearly express that”— what?—“the Committee is primarily focused” or—	92.0	65.0
201601	2638	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	“That the Committee’s primary focus be on expected future deviations.”	92.0	88.0
201601	2639	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	No.	92.0	102.0
201601	2640	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair, could we try the passive voice, because it avoids that.	92.0	81.0
201601	2641	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	“It should more clearly express a focus on” or “a primary focus on.”	92.0	81.0
201601	2642	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Dan’s language avoided this whole mess.	92.0	104.0
201601	2643	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes.	92.0	102.0
201601	2644	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We were good before.	92.0	102.0
201601	2645	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	“But believed the Committee’s language is not adequately,” or maybe “the statement language is not adequately focused on expected future deviations.”	92.0	104.0
201601	2646	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	How about “sufficiently” rather than “adequately”?	92.0	96.0
201601	2647	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	“That the statement language is not”—	92.0	65.0
201601	2648	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	—“sufficiently” or “adequately focused on expected”—et cetera.	92.0	104.0
201601	2649	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s his view, so Jim?	92.0	102.0
201601	2650	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Yes, it’s Jim’s, in the end.	92.0	97.0
201601	2651	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Well, he’s characterizing the difference between how he sees it and the Committee’s so he’s in effect also characterizing the Committee’s view by saying it this way.	92.0	91.0
201601	2652	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92.0	65.0
201601	2653	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s try this, and this obviously requires President Bullard’s consent:  “Voting against was James Bullard, who agreed the Committee’s inflation goal is symmetric, but believed the statement language is not sufficiently focused on expected future deviations of inflation from the goal.”	92.0	65.0
201601	2654	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Yes, I agree with that.	92.0	94.0
201601	2655	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	92.0	65.0
201601	2656	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Can I offer one thought?	92.0	999.0
201601	2657	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Could you say “the amended language,” because you’re not wanting to reopen the whole statement?	92.0	999.0
201601	2658	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes.	92.0	102.0
201601	2659	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	That’s a good addition.	92.0	94.0
201601	2660	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Yes, “the amended language.”	92.0	108.0
201601	2661	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	“But believed the amended language is not sufficiently focused.”	92.0	65.0
201601	2662	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Right.	92.0	94.0
201601	2663	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Is everybody content?	92.0	65.0
201601	2664	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Yes.	92.0	107.0
201601	2665	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Yes, thank you.	92.0	108.0
201601	2666	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Good.	92.0	96.0
201601	2667	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	92.0	96.0
201601	2668	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92.0	65.0
201601	2669	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much, and thank you, President Bullard, for working with us on this.	92.0	65.0
201601	2670	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll now return to the economic go-round with a few speakers left, and we’re going to start with President George.	13.0	65.0
201601	2671	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	103.0
201601	2672	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	The 10th District economy continues to grow at a modest pace, with weakness in commodity prices and a stronger dollar weighing on sectors like agriculture, energy, and manufacturing.	13.0	103.0
201601	2673	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	District manufacturing activity has now contracted in 9 out of the past 10 months, and prices of all major crops grown in the District are at or very near their 12-month lows and considerably below prices three years ago.	13.0	103.0
201601	2674	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Concerns at District energy companies also have risen, as oil prices fell further below breakeven levels, hedges continued to roll off, and financing to the sector tightened.	13.0	103.0
201601	2675	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	In our fourth-quarter energy survey, more than 80 percent of respondents now expect a large increase in defaults and bankruptcies this year for those oil and gas companies with exceptionally high debt levels.	13.0	103.0
201601	2676	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Other than those in these sectors, District contacts remain relatively upbeat about the outlook for 2016, primarily in construction and retail, travel, and leisure.	13.0	103.0
201601	2677	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	One District contact in the nonprofit sector noted for the first time that charitable giving is up and the demand for food and shelter services has declined.	13.0	103.0
201601	2678	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	My outlook for the national economy is little changed since our December meeting.	13.0	103.0
201601	2679	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I expect moderate economic growth this year as temporary weakness from the fourth quarter of last year dissipates.	13.0	103.0
201601	2680	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Consumption and labor market gains continue to be the primary sources of strength in my forecast.	13.0	103.0
201601	2681	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Fundamentals remain supportive for consumption.	13.0	103.0
201601	2682	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Debt service ratios remain low, household wealth remains at high levels, saving rates are higher, gasoline prices are low, house prices are rising, and the labor market continues to improve.	13.0	103.0
201601	2683	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	However, if households pull back amid the current market volatility and other uncertainties, as highlighted yesterday in terms of downside risks, then this year would likely see only modest economic growth.	13.0	103.0
201601	2684	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I note that confidence among the top third of income earners from the University of Michigan survey has been slipping for several months and is now about equal to the rising confidence of middle-income households, a somewhat unusual occurrence that likely reflects the volatility in financial markets.	13.0	103.0
201601	2685	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Still, the empirical evidence suggests to me that households make only modest adjustments to their spending in response to higher uncertainty, and that these kinds of developments don’t necessarily translate into weaker consumption growth.	13.0	103.0
201601	2686	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of the labor market, continued improvements seem likely to support economic growth.	13.0	103.0
201601	2687	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	In December, the level of activity component of my staff’s labor market index went above its long-run average for the first time since the crisis.	13.0	103.0
201601	2688	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	While my forecast of the unemployment rate depends on continued improvement in the labor market, I expect some lower job growth numbers in the next few months, in light of how strong we assessed the release in December to be.	13.0	103.0
201601	2689	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	A number of sectors saw December job gains at or near the tops of the ranges seen over the previous 12 months, so I won’t be surprised to see payroll growth below what we’ve seen over the past few months.	13.0	103.0
201601	2690	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, I expect that the decline in oil prices and dollar effects will continue to be a headwind for inflation, a headwind that has proven to be more persistent than fleeting and appears to be affecting five-year, five-year-ahead breakevens.	13.0	103.0
201601	2691	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	While the stability of survey- based longer-term inflation expectations is reassuring, longer-term inflation expectations bear watching.	13.0	103.0
201601	2692	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	13.0	103.0
201601	2693	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201601	2694	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	13.0	65.0
201601	2695	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Good morning.	13.0	111.0
201601	2696	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	111.0
201601	2697	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The Ninth District economy is growing moderately but unevenly, and employment is strong in the District overall.	13.0	111.0
201601	2698	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	In the Twin Cities, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in November was 3.2 percent— pretty strong.	13.0	111.0
201601	2699	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Our business contacts continue to report difficulty finding skilled and specialized workers.	13.0	111.0
201601	2700	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	However, the strong dollar is weighing on exports of manufacturers and farmers, and low commodity prices are reducing incomes and activity in the oil, mining, and ag sectors.	13.0	111.0
201601	2701	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Let me offer two anecdotes from the region that I think the Committee may find interesting.	13.0	111.0
201601	2702	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	First of all, we have the Bakken oil field, and some of our contacts there expressed a great deal of optimism that prices are going to rebound quickly.	13.0	111.0
201601	2703	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	When pushed, there wasn’t a lot of analysis underlying that optimism.	13.0	111.0
201601	2704	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I would call it more of a hope.	13.0	111.0
201601	2705	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	But it’s a good reminder that not all market participants adjust immediately when prices move in a painful direction for them.	13.0	111.0
201601	2706	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The adjustment can take time before they fully embrace it.	13.0	111.0
201601	2707	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The second anecdote I’ll offer is that I’m pleased to report that I was able to get a mortgage.	13.0	111.0
201601	2708	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	[Laughter]	13.0	111.0
201601	2709	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I went through the whole process, from soup to nuts.	13.0	111.0
201601	2710	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I was concerned when Chairman Bernanke famously was turned down for a refinance, so I thought, what hope did I have?	13.0	111.0
201601	2711	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	But I’ve got to tell you something:  It is a painful process.	13.0	111.0
201601	2712	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I went through it like anybody else.	13.0	111.0
201601	2713	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The amount of documentation that I had to provide was shocking to me.	13.0	111.0
201601	2714	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So the good news is, the mortgage market is open.	13.0	111.0
201601	2715	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The good news also is, the banks are taking the new regulatory environment very seriously, but it’s not for the faint of heart.	13.0	111.0
201601	2716	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The national economic picture is similarly mixed.	13.0	111.0
201601	2717	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Concerns about China’s economic growth outlook and policy decisions and about other global risks, as we’ve noted, have destabilized financial markets.	13.0	111.0
201601	2718	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	As of last night, the S&P is down, I think, 7 percent since the start of the year.	13.0	111.0
201601	2719	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Volatility has risen, credit spreads have widened considerably, and longer-run market-based measures of inflation expectations have fallen to new lows.	13.0	111.0
201601	2720	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	As we discussed yesterday, financial markets can be leading indicators.	13.0	111.0
201601	2721	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We have to consider the possibility that these developments are signaling higher odds of an economic downturn, especially one that’s accompanied by low inflation.	13.0	111.0
201601	2722	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The US economy does show substantial underlying strength, especially in the labor market, so it’s far from certain that the international volatility we see is going to directly affect us.	13.0	111.0
201601	2723	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	In summary, I share the Tealbook’s baseline outlook for gradual improvement in the economy, but uncertainty has risen.	13.0	111.0
201601	2724	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We don’t know how hard a landing China will have, we don’t know how effectively China’s policymakers will deal with that landing, and we don’t know how events in China will spill over to the United States.	13.0	111.0
201601	2725	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So I feel that we must be prepared to respond to a wide range of potential outcomes, including those downside scenarios.	13.0	111.0
201601	2726	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	13.0	111.0
201601	2727	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201601	2728	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13.0	65.0
201601	2729	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201601	2730	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	My views have changed somewhat since the December FOMC meeting.	13.0	96.0
201601	2731	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	While I still think the economy will grow at a slightly above-trend pace in 2016, the recent foreign and financial market developments do make me more concerned that economic growth could disappoint.	13.0	96.0
201601	2732	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, inflation seems likely to stay lower for longer, due to lower energy prices, a stronger dollar, and inflation expectations that seem less well anchored than earlier.	13.0	96.0
201601	2733	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Starting with the economic growth side of the ledger, I think we’ve had a bit more negative news than positive news since the December meeting.	13.0	96.0
201601	2734	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	On the positive side, payroll gains have been strong, and household real income remains on a sturdy trajectory.	13.0	96.0
201601	2735	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Moreover, fiscal policy is likely to provide support to the economy in 2016.	13.0	96.0
201601	2736	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But this has to be set against the softness in real GDP growth, the weakness of the factory sector, soft foreign activity, and significantly tighter financial conditions.	13.0	96.0
201601	2737	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	While my baseline view is that consumer spending will strengthen and real GDP growth will rebound this quarter as the drag due to the behavior of inventories lessens, if this doesn’t fully materialize, then I’d be concerned that we might see a significant slowing in payroll employment growth and, with it, a weakening in what’s been a very favorable trend for household real income.	13.0	96.0
201601	2738	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	On the inflation side, the outlook has also deteriorated, in that the transitory effects of lower energy prices and non-energy imports look likely to prove more persistent.	13.0	96.0
201601	2739	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	As many people have noted, inflation expectations obtained using survey data remain weak, and the five- by-five inflation compensation obtained from the spread between nominal Treasury yields and TIPS yields continues to decline.	13.0	96.0
201601	2740	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, that said, if the rebound in economic growth does materialize, then I think inflation will gradually move up as labor market utilization continues to tighten.	13.0	96.0
201601	2741	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The fact that the core inflation measures have been pretty stable, despite the sharp deflationary impulses we’ve seen, supports that conclusion.	13.0	96.0
201601	2742	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But it is very important that above- trend economic growth does, in fact, materialize.	13.0	96.0
201601	2743	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Although the sharp and abrupt tightening we’ve seen in financial market conditions is difficult to reconcile with what still seems to be a relatively good US economic outlook, we do have to recognize that there are underlying causes—the slowdown in China, the collapse in energy prices, and the pressure on many EME economies.	13.0	96.0
201601	2744	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s not just animal spirits, so I wouldn’t completely dismiss it.	13.0	96.0
201601	2745	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The fact is that the strains we’re seeing have intensified since August.	13.0	96.0
201601	2746	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, the shift in our monetary policy regime may also play a role.	13.0	96.0
201601	2747	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s a lot more uncertainty now about the path of short-term interest rates, for example.	13.0	96.0
201601	2748	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Now that we’ve lifted off, I would expect financial asset prices to be more volatile.	13.0	96.0
201601	2749	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So liftoff probably has played a role, even though some of the other factors I’ve cited seem more important to me.	13.0	96.0
201601	2750	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The key issue for me is, will the tightening in financial market conditions prove persistent, or will it intensify further?	13.0	96.0
201601	2751	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t know the answer to that.	13.0	96.0
201601	2752	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So let me review the major financial market components and what my current thoughts are on that.	13.0	96.0
201601	2753	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The equity market has been very volatile and down more than 10 percent from its peak and about 7 percent since year-end.	13.0	96.0
201601	2754	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I view the main cause here as the lack of earnings growth due to a stronger dollar and negative foreign earnings translation effects, poor productivity growth, and a tightening labor market.	13.0	96.0
201601	2755	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The problem, to me, is not that equities are overvalued relative to bonds.	13.0	96.0
201601	2756	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Equity risk premiums are not unusually narrow.	13.0	96.0
201601	2757	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But, instead, the problem is the lack of visibility in terms of future earnings growth.	13.0	96.0
201601	2758	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Credit spreads have widened considerably.	13.0	96.0
201601	2759	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	What’s happening in the energy sector is pretty straightforward.	13.0	96.0
201601	2760	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The key issue is what to make of the widening elsewhere.	13.0	96.0
201601	2761	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	To me, the key question is, how much of this widening just represents spillover from the energy sectors and outflows from bond mutual fund bleeding to selling pressure versus a regime shift in which the price of leverage has gone up?	13.0	96.0
201601	2762	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Leverage in the corporate sector increased in recent years as companies actively sought to lever up to boost their returns on equity and their stock prices.	13.0	96.0
201601	2763	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Companies were responding to an environment of record-low interest rates and narrow credit spreads, but now the situation may be reversing.	13.0	96.0
201601	2764	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The price of leverage may be going up, so, as a consequence, this widening in credit spreads could turn out to be persistent.	13.0	96.0
201601	2765	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the dollar, the outlook in the United States continues to be better than elsewhere.	13.0	96.0
201601	2766	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Chinese officials have made it clear the RMB is no longer pegged to the dollar, and I imagine that, if the RMB is allowed to weaken, this is likely to lead to currency weakness elsewhere.	13.0	96.0
201601	2767	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	President Evans and I were having a conversation at breakfast today, and I think he made a really interesting point.	13.0	96.0
201601	2768	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If things evolve in line with the Tealbook forecast—an interest rate path that’s above the market consensus—one consequence of that would probably be a dollar that’s also firmer than expected.	13.0	96.0
201601	2769	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So we need to understand that, if the interest rate path materializes as we envision it, dollar strength is probably going to continue, especially in light of the fact that Japan and Europe are continuing to add to quantitative easing rather than pulling back from that.	13.0	96.0
201601	2770	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The key issue, to me, is whether this is a temporary squall that will soon reverse or something that will prove more persistent.	13.0	96.0
201601	2771	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If the tightening in financial conditions reverses, as it did last fall, then it probably doesn’t have implications for what we’re going to do or not do at the March meeting.	13.0	96.0
201601	2772	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But if it does prove persistent or intensifies further, then the case for tightening would be a lot less compelling because the tighter financial conditions would, over time, imply slower growth and lower inflation, all else being equal.	13.0	96.0
201601	2773	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201601	2774	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	My thanks to everyone for a thoughtful round of comments on the incoming data, the outlook, and the associated risks.	13.0	65.0
201601	2775	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	If I might, I’d like to wrap up with a few comments of my own, including some observations on the policy implications of the outlook and the uncertainties we face, anticipating our next round of discussion.	13.0	65.0
201601	2776	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Starting with the data we’ve received on spending, production, and the labor market, as many around the table commented, incoming readings on real activity have been quite mixed and almost seem to tell a tale of two economies.	13.0	65.0
201601	2777	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thus far, the labor market has been doing very well, although the move up we’ve seen in UI claims may conceivably be a harbinger of a weaker job market ahead.	13.0	65.0
201601	2778	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	The unemployment rate has changed little in recent months but is at a level only a little higher than my estimate of its longer-run level.	13.0	65.0
201601	2779	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And the recent stability reflects a welcome combination of solid gains in household employment and a pickup in labor force participation.	13.0	65.0
201601	2780	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	As a result, the employment-to-population ratio rose over the fall, even as its underlying trend continued to drift down.	13.0	65.0
201601	2781	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, average hourly earnings in December were up 2½ percent on a 12-month change basis, which is a considerable improvement from a year ago, even if the pace remains subdued.	13.0	65.0
201601	2782	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Now, because of the noisiness of compensation indicators, I don’t want to read too much into this pickup, but perhaps it hints that diminished labor market slack may be finally showing through to wages.	13.0	65.0
201601	2783	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	On the other hand, incoming data on overall real activity have been disappointing, to say the very least.	13.0	65.0
201601	2784	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Manufacturing output barely increased last quarter, and recent readings from business surveys are weak.	13.0	65.0
201601	2785	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Retail sales declined in December and were up only modestly, on net, over the fall.	13.0	65.0
201601	2786	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	As for overall activity, whereas I had anticipated that real GDP would expand more or less in line with potential output in the fourth quarter, the staff now estimates that it rose at an annual rate of less than ½ percent.	13.0	65.0
201601	2787	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	For me, a particularly worrisome aspect of this near stall is the contribution of consumption, which had been one of the few sources of strength in this economy.	13.0	65.0
201601	2788	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But consumer spending now appears to have risen at an annual rate of only 1½ percent last quarter, down from a 3 percent rate in the third quarter, despite strong real income gains from rising employment and falling energy prices.	13.0	65.0
201601	2789	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	In trying to make sense of some of these mixed signals, I take some comfort that transitory factors explain some of the weak GDP growth.	13.0	65.0
201601	2790	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	As David noted yesterday, part of the slowdown in consumer spending was a result of unusually warm weather that held down outlays on energy services, and the likely snapback in the level of that spending component this quarter should boost overall GDP growth.	13.0	65.0
201601	2791	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, changes in mortgage reporting rules appear to have caused a temporary blip down in home sales and thus sales commissions last quarter.	13.0	65.0
201601	2792	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Consistent with this assessment, existing home sales rebounded strongly in December.	13.0	65.0
201601	2793	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, the estimated sharp slowdown in inventory investment last quarter probably is a one-time adjustment of stocks, with no lasting implications for overall GDP growth, although, in this case, one cannot dismiss the possibility that it could signal a more persistent scaling back of firms’ production plans.	13.0	65.0
201601	2794	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	For these reasons, I’m inclined to discount the recent spending and production data in judging where the economy is probably headed in the near term and rely more on the labor market indicators themselves.	13.0	65.0
201601	2795	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	De-emphasizing the GDP data also makes sense, as they’re noisy indicators, prone to substantial revisions, and, as David noted, simply just not that informative in predicting near-term labor market developments.	13.0	65.0
201601	2796	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	For example, econometric analysis reveals that, in forecasting the current-quarter change in the unemployment rate, one can completely ignore lagged GDP growth and simply rely on last quarter’s change in the unemployment rate.	13.0	65.0
201601	2797	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	That said, I did hear comments around the table indicating that a number of you noted that your business contacts saw a slowing in economic activity toward the end of the year, and that obviously bears watching.	13.0	65.0
201601	2798	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Even if we significantly discount the relevance of the slowdown in fourth-quarter GDP to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market, we should not dismiss the implications of recent developments in financial markets and the global economy.	13.0	65.0
201601	2799	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Since our December meeting, as many of you noted, the stock market is down about 7 percent.	13.0	65.0
201601	2800	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Risk premiums on corporate bonds have increased notably, banks reported tightening terms and standards on C&I and CRE lending in the most recent SLOOS, and the dollar has appreciated an additional 2½ percent.	13.0	65.0
201601	2801	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	According to FRB/US, the net GDP effects of the rise in the dollar, the fall in stock prices, and the movements in longer-term interest rates are roughly equivalent to an increase in the federal funds rate of at least 50 basis points, assuming that the changes in asset prices persist.	13.0	65.0
201601	2802	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Now, of course, they may not, and the imprint of lower stock market wealth on the Tealbook projection is less than it might be, because the staff projects some of the recent decline to be reversed over time.	13.0	65.0
201601	2803	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, lower oil prices and the resulting boost to real income and consumer spending provide a partial offset, although the net boost to GDP will likely be tempered by a further reduction in domestic drilling activity and slower economic growth in Canada and Mexico, two of our biggest trading partners.	13.0	65.0
201601	2804	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Beyond these conventional effects of changes in financial conditions, I also worry that a more unusual dynamic may now be at work, especially as recent market developments seem disproportionate in light of the staff’s quite small downward revision to foreign economic growth.	13.0	65.0
201601	2805	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Perhaps this pronounced jitteriness partly reflects fears that some countries and firms are near a tipping point, past which further declines in commodity prices could lead to a highly nonlinear deterioration in conditions, with quite adverse effects for the global economy.	13.0	65.0
201601	2806	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, markets seem concerned that central banks may be reaching their limits in terms of the support they can provide to the economy.	13.0	65.0
201601	2807	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Whatever the underlying reason, we need to be careful that our own communications do not make the situation worse.	13.0	65.0
201601	2808	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Currently, many financial market participants appear concerned that we will respond too inertially to the evolving downside risks.	13.0	65.0
201601	2809	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	In view of the fact that we raised rates in December, they may fear we’ll be insufficiently responsive to these intensifying risks and particularly resist a policy reversal, even if the incoming data are quite weak.	13.0	65.0
201601	2810	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Given our consensus on the importance of being data dependent, I don’t believe that we would actually make such mistakes.	13.0	65.0
201601	2811	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But if we aren’t careful in our public statements, we could strengthen the market’s fears on this score.	13.0	65.0
201601	2812	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think we need to be particularly careful that we do not inadvertently leave the impression that we’re being overly dismissive of adverse global developments.	13.0	65.0
201601	2813	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Such a misperception could result in further dollar appreciation, increases in risk premiums, and declines in oil and other commodity prices.	13.0	65.0
201601	2814	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But, at the same time, we don’t want to make the opposite mistake of overreacting, thereby making matters worse, by conveying panic or an unduly pessimistic shift in our outlook.	13.0	65.0
201601	2815	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Achieving this balance is clearly our task today, and that is the objective of the revised version of alternative B.	13.0	65.0
201601	2816	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Obviously, the recent appreciation of the dollar and decline in oil prices also have implications for inflation.	13.0	65.0
201601	2817	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Once again, we will have to wait longer for the transitory influences of these factors to fade.	13.0	65.0
201601	2818	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	According to the current Tealbook, core inflation is now projected to remain near 1¼ percent on a 12-month change basis through the end of this year, while headline inflation is expected to remain below 1 percent.	13.0	65.0
201601	2819	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think that, in continuing to predict an eventual pickup in inflation, we risk sounding like Wonderland’s White Queen:  “The rule is, jam tomorrow and jam yesterday—but never jam today.”	13.0	65.0
201601	2820	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	There are good reasons for monetary policy to look through the transitory inflation effects of price shocks, and that approach served us well from 2004 through 2008, when, year after year, unexpected increases in oil prices caused headline inflation to be persistently elevated.	13.0	65.0
201601	2821	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But there are at least two caveats.	13.0	65.0
201601	2822	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	First, shocks of this sort can have persistent contractionary effects on real activity, to which monetary policy should respond.	13.0	65.0
201601	2823	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And this is clear in the case of dollar appreciation, fueled by flight-to-safety concerns.	13.0	65.0
201601	2824	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	The shock not only puts downward pressure on inflation but also restricts economic growth by reducing net exports.	13.0	65.0
201601	2825	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	While oil price declines are normally viewed as a plus for US real activity, there is a risk that the tipping point effects I mentioned earlier may have reversed the sign in present circumstances.	13.0	65.0
201601	2826	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	The second caveat is that one better be sure that the transitory influences aren’t starting to have persistent effects on inflation expectations.	13.0	65.0
201601	2827	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	In this regard, it does worry me that longer-run inflation expectations in the Michigan survey are now at the bottom end of their historical range, and that inflation compensation has now declined to a historically low level, well below our 2 percent objective.	13.0	65.0
201601	2828	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Developments in this area need to be closely monitored and considered, as we emphasized in our December statement.	13.0	65.0
201601	2829	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there and turn over the floor to Thomas for his policy briefing.	21.0	65.0
201601	2830	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201601	2831	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21.0	999.0
201601	2832	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Your policy decisions today center on whether economic and financial developments over the intermeeting period warrant modifying the Committee’s assessment of the medium-term economic outlook, the risks to that outlook, or both.	21.0	999.0
201601	2833	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternatives A, B, and C present essentially the same modal outlook for economic activity and the labor market but different assessments of the outlook for inflation and of the risks attending the economic outlook, along with corresponding policy choices—specifically, whether to increase the target range for the federal funds rate and whether to indicate any change in the likely future path of the policy rate.	21.0	999.0
201601	2834	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Developments over the intermeeting period apparently led market participants to see a greater likelihood that the real economy and inflation will evolve in ways that will warrant even more gradual policy normalization than investors had anticipated earlier.	21.0	999.0
201601	2835	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The federal funds rate path implied by futures shifted down noticeably, as shown in the upper-left panel.	21.0	999.0
201601	2836	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	And even though the median dealer’s modal path for the funds rate did not change materially, dealers now see a higher probability of a lower target range for the federal funds rate at the end of this year, suggesting that they see greater downside risks to the economy than in December.	21.0	999.0
201601	2837	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	For example, as shown in the upper-right panel, since December, a number of dealers have raised the odds they assign to the US economy being in recession in six months.	21.0	999.0
201601	2838	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	In dealers’ written responses, financial market developments and risks to economic growth abroad, particularly in China, were the most frequently cited reasons for respondents having raised their probabilities of recession.	21.0	999.0
201601	2839	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	One key issue confronting you is whether to continue to describe the risks associated with the outlook for real activity and the labor market as balanced, as in alternative C, or whether to withhold judgment for the time being—as in the revised version of alternative B that was distributed on Monday, and that is shown in your handout—or to describe those risks as tilted somewhat to the downside, as in alternative A.	21.0	999.0
201601	2840	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The middle two panels examine the downside risks to real activity from a number of perspectives.	21.0	999.0
201601	2841	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The panel on the left shows estimates of the probability that real GDP will decline this quarter and next; these results, which are also reported on page 77 of Tealbook A, are derived from several staff models and are independent of the staff baseline forecast.	21.0	999.0
201601	2842	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The first three estimates continue to show very low probabilities and are little changed since the December Tealbook.	21.0	999.0
201601	2843	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	However, these particular estimates do not take into account the recent turbulence in global financial markets, because the models either condition on financial data only through the fourth quarter or largely exclude such information altogether.	21.0	999.0
201601	2844	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	In contrast, the fourth estimate shown in the table, which is derived from a factor model that does incorporate information on a range of financial variables, shows not only a noticeably higher probability of a recession, but also that it has risen some since December.	21.0	999.0
201601	2845	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	In an attempt to expand on the financial dimensions of this analysis, the Board staff estimated two different probit regressions, each of which attempts to calculate the probability of the US economy entering an NBER-defined recession sometime during the next six months as a function of one or more financial indicators.	21.0	999.0
201601	2846	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	This is the panel that has been telegraphed beforehand.	21.0	999.0
201601	2847	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The first regression employs the excess bond premium, or EBP—a measure of the average credit spread net of default risk for the outstanding senior unsecured bonds of nonfinancial corporations.	21.0	999.0
201601	2848	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The EBP can be interpreted as an aggregate credit risk premium, and its developers, Simon Gilchrist and Egon Zakrajšek, find that it is a good predictor of GDP growth.	21.0	999.0
201601	2849	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	As shown by the black line in the middle-right panel, the probability of a near-term recession implied by the EBP has risen steadily since last spring and now stands at almost 70 percent.	21.0	999.0
201601	2850	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	A somewhat less alarming picture is presented by the second probit regression, which replaces the EBP with a summary statistic of a wide range of financial variables.	21.0	999.0
201601	2851	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	By this measure, and as shown by the red line, the estimated probability of near-term recession has increased sharply since the turn of the year and now stands at 40 percent.	21.0	999.0
201601	2852	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Of course, any estimate of this sort should be taken with a large block of salt:  These regressions are estimated using long time series because recessions occur infrequently.	21.0	999.0
201601	2853	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The regressions may therefore fail to pick up the evolving structure of financial markets and changing relationships between the explanatory variables and the probability of recession.	21.0	999.0
201601	2854	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	More generally, economists’ failure to predict recessions is notorious, and, as the old saw goes—and here I’m using the old, Samuelson numbers—the stock market has predicted nine of the past five recessions.	21.0	999.0
201601	2855	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	For these and other reasons, you may judge it premature to draw conclusions about the balance of risks to real activity.	21.0	999.0
201601	2856	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The bottom two panels present information relevant to your decision about how to characterize the outlook for inflation and the risks to this outlook.	21.0	999.0
201601	2857	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	All three of the draft alternatives acknowledge that inflation is likely to remain low in the near term due in part to the drop in energy prices.	21.0	999.0
201601	2858	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	They differ in the degree of concern they express about the downside risks to the inflation outlook.	21.0	999.0
201601	2859	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The new language in alternative B stating that the Committee is closely monitoring the implications of global financial and economic developments clearly indicates concern about risks to the inflation outlook but does not suggest a change in the modal outlook that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium term.	21.0	999.0
201601	2860	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	By contrast, alternative C states that the Committee remains reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium term, while alternative A indicates that inflation will remain below 2 percent longer than previously anticipated.	21.0	999.0
201601	2861	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	A significant number of forecasters and market participants appear to have marked down their inflation projections.	21.0	999.0
201601	2862	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The exhibit in the lower left shows that the dealers have pushed out expectations for a firming in core inflation.	21.0	999.0
201601	2863	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Like the staff judgmental forecast, dealer forecasts for core inflation this year, which had stepped down during the fall, have again moved lower, likely reflecting the sharp drop in oil prices over the intermeeting period and the further appreciation of the dollar.	21.0	999.0
201601	2864	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Most dealers still see core inflation in 2017—not shown— as making more progress toward the Committee’s objective than the staff does, but a number appear to see a risk that low inflation will persist longer, perhaps along the lines of the staff baseline.	21.0	999.0
201601	2865	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Several of the staff’s statistical models also show an increase in the risk of persistently low inflation.	21.0	999.0
201601	2866	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The bottom-right panel reports the probability that the four-quarter change in total PCE inflation will be less than 1 percent four quarters from now.	21.0	999.0
201601	2867	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The probability calculated using the FRB/US model increased noteably since December, while estimates from EDO, one of the Board staff’s DSGE models, and the Bayesian VAR model are still quite low.	21.0	999.0
201601	2868	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201601	2869	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	This concludes my prepared remarks.	21.0	999.0
201601	2870	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	22.0	65.0
201601	2871	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	The floor is open for questions.	22.0	65.0
201601	2872	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	22.0	65.0
201601	2873	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	In the chart Thomas presented with the probabilities on the excess bond premium, it looks like there were a couple of spikes in 2002 and 2004.	22.0	91.0
201601	2874	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I think the 2002 is probably Enron, WorldCom, and all of that, but what about 2004?	22.0	91.0
201601	2875	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	It gets up to about 40 percent.	22.0	91.0
201601	2876	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes, I think the salient point is, of course, that these are somewhat noisy indicators of recessions, so there are false positives in here as well.	22.0	999.0
201601	2877	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The excess bond premium is constructed from literally a very large universe of outstanding corporate bonds, so there may be particular factors like corporate governance scandals.	22.0	999.0
201601	2878	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	More recently, you may wonder what role, for example, energy firms are playing in driving that particular variable, and that was the intention of then moving to the red line.	22.0	999.0
201601	2879	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Now, the red line, too, gives you some movement, as you point out, especially in late 2002.	22.0	999.0
201601	2880	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	If I recall correctly, that period actually wasn’t an NBER recession but saw substantial financial stresses in many areas.	22.0	999.0
201601	2881	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	It’s clear that when you base this indicator on financial variables, you may get a false positive.	22.0	999.0
201601	2882	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	But nobody remembers the headline in 2004 that is likely responsible for that little spike?	22.0	91.0
201601	2883	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The increase in rates?	22.0	81.0
201601	2884	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Well, it could be.	22.0	91.0
201601	2885	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	It’s too early for the conundrum to have 10-year rates drop out.	22.0	91.0
201601	2886	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	22.0	91.0
201601	2887	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Sorry.	22.0	91.0
201601	2888	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes, I would be surprised.	22.0	999.0
201601	2889	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Again, this thing is constructed on the basis of the expected excess returns on holding corporate bonds over Treasury securities.	22.0	999.0
201601	2890	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	So I don’t know whether they responded very strongly to the tightening.	22.0	999.0
201601	2891	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	22.0	65.0
201601	2892	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22.0	94.0
201601	2893	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I just want to understand your presentation.	22.0	94.0
201601	2894	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	In this panel on the middle left, “Probability of Recession in 2016:H1,” what I’m understanding is that the Tealbook says 1 percent, and then these other charts, though, are six months ahead.	22.0	94.0
201601	2895	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So you’re talking about the second half of 2016.	22.0	94.0
201601	2896	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	No.	22.0	999.0
201601	2897	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The calculations on the right are the probability of being in recession either already now or within the next six months.	22.0	999.0
201601	2898	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Does that mean the recession would begin then?	22.0	94.0
201601	2899	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Exactly.	22.0	999.0
201601	2900	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So it could begin in July, and then that would be okay, according to the model?	22.0	94.0
201601	2901	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes.	22.0	999.0
201601	2902	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I have to confess that I’m not quite sure whether we picked the window of January to June or February to July, but it was one of the two.	22.0	999.0
201601	2903	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	But if, say, you were thinking a recession might begin later in the year, in the late fall or something like that, it would not be captured in these regressions.	22.0	999.0
201601	2904	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	They ask about now or in the next six months.	22.0	999.0
201601	2905	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	22.0	94.0
201601	2906	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So these three charts, the recession probability charts, are meant to be comparable.	22.0	94.0
201601	2907	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	As much as possible.	22.0	999.0
201601	2908	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	22.0	94.0
201601	2909	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	And the Tealbook is wildly lower than the other probabilities.	22.0	94.0
201601	2910	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So explain that to me.	22.0	94.0
201601	2911	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The Tealbook is not actually shown.	22.0	999.0
201601	2912	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	What are you referring to?	22.0	999.0
201601	2913	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	FRB/US.	22.0	94.0
201601	2914	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Sorry.	22.0	94.0
201601	2915	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Just to create a little space here, that’s different from the Tealbook.	22.0	999.0
201601	2916	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I know.	22.0	94.0
201601	2917	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Sorry.	22.0	94.0
201601	2918	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Just for clarity.	22.0	999.0
201601	2919	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I stand corrected.	22.0	94.0
201601	2920	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Go ahead.	22.0	94.0
201601	2921	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The FRB/US number is based on stochastic simulations, and it’s computing the probability, the number of draws or the percentage of draws for which you get a decline in real GDP in both Q1 and Q2.	22.0	999.0
201601	2922	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Well, another question would be the unconditional probability of going into recession at any particular date, and FRB/US would seem to have a very low number for that, whereas the other models would have something like 10 or 15 percent all of the time.	22.0	94.0
201601	2923	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I think this is a fair point that these models may have different steady-state probabilities of going into recession.	22.0	999.0
201601	2924	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	That is right.	22.0	999.0
201601	2925	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Now, in the case of FRB/US, my guess—so please take it with a grain of salt—would be that it takes a lot of signal from the strong labor market data.	22.0	999.0
201601	2926	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	That’s really what’s keeping it out of recession.	22.0	999.0
201601	2927	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	But that’s a guess.	22.0	999.0
201601	2928	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	22.0	94.0
201601	2929	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	22.0	94.0
201601	2930	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there other questions?	22.0	65.0
201601	2931	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	22.0	65.0
201601	2932	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22.0	110.0
201601	2933	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I have one question.	22.0	110.0
201601	2934	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	On the red line, are you looking at absolute levels, or are you looking at the degree of change from a point in time?	22.0	110.0
201601	2935	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So, for example, I noticed you’re looking at equity prices and other things.	22.0	110.0
201601	2936	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	You’re not looking at absolute valuation levels, but you’re looking at the delta?	22.0	110.0
201601	2937	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	You’re taking a bunch of variables that include the VIX.	22.0	999.0
201601	2938	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	It includes spreads.	22.0	999.0
201601	2939	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I’m actually looking for help from Eric Engstrom, who assisted me in that.	22.0	999.0
201601	2940	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Could you speak about exactly how the stock market is fitting into it?	22.0	999.0
201601	2941	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you.	22.0	999.0
201601	2942	2016-01-27	meeting	ENGSTROM	There are actually both level and change variables in the regression.	22.0	
201601	2943	2016-01-27	meeting	ENGSTROM	There’s a six-month change in the stock market as well as a stock market valuation level, like a P/E ratio, and there are credit spread levels and volatility measures.	22.0	
201601	2944	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Okay.	22.0	110.0
201601	2945	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	22.0	110.0
201601	2946	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	22.0	65.0
201601	2947	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Simple question:  How many models did you estimate?	22.0	81.0
201601	2948	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	For this year?	22.0	999.0
201601	2949	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	For the right panel?	22.0	999.0
201601	2950	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	You’re showing us two.	22.0	81.0
201601	2951	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	How many did you estimate?	22.0	81.0
201601	2952	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Exactly these two.	22.0	999.0
201601	2953	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	No more?	22.0	81.0
201601	2954	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I do not know how many more models the staff is estimating, but when I asked colleagues, like Eric, to help me put this briefing together, we did not engage in a laborious search.	22.0	999.0
201601	2955	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	This is certainly an area that many folks across divisions here at the Board are working on, but, no, we did not engage in a particular search.	22.0	999.0
201601	2956	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The reason I thought these two would be interesting is because we wanted to present something that was using financial variables in order to get at the question “Should you draw a very different view from the financial information?”	22.0	999.0
201601	2957	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	And I deliberately wanted to draw a stark contrast in the sense that you could easily imagine estimating models in which you throw in both nonfinancial and financial variables, and the factor model in the left-hand panel is a bit of that nature.	22.0	999.0
201601	2958	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Again, for contrast, I wanted to focus exclusively on financial variables.	22.0	999.0
201601	2959	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Then we thought that two obvious starting points would be, one, just an agnostic thing, which is the red line,  for which we drew on a bunch of headline variables that you would normally look at in order to get an overall view of financial conditions.	22.0	999.0
201601	2960	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Then the other one, the excess bond premium, is simply quite interesting because of the work that has been done by Simon Gilchrist and Egon Zakrajšek documenting that it is a surprisingly strong predictor of future real GDP growth.	22.0	999.0
201601	2961	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Those were just two candidates that came to my mind, but I’m not claiming that they are representative of a larger universe of things that the staff has looked at.	22.0	999.0
201601	2962	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there further questions for Thomas?	22.0	65.0
201601	2963	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	22.0	65.0
201601	2964	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	22.0	65.0
201601	2965	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, let’s begin our go-round and start with President Rosengren.	23.0	65.0
201601	2966	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201601	2967	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B.	23.0	90.0
201601	2968	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	We need more time to assess the direct effect of recent financial market volatility on the economic outlook and inflation and, more important, to determine whether the volatility is signaling underlying weakness that is not yet evident in the data.	23.0	90.0
201601	2969	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is disappointing that the real GDP growth forecast for last quarter has been revised down.	23.0	90.0
201601	2970	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I am concerned that we also may be revising down estimates of first-quarter real GDP growth.	23.0	90.0
201601	2971	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we are growing slower than potential, then the median path of the federal funds rate in the December SEP may prove to be too steep.	23.0	90.0
201601	2972	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	As I highlighted yesterday, I believe the downside risks to the outlook are elevated relative to December.	23.0	90.0
201601	2973	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	With consumption being an important component of real GDP that could disappoint.	23.0	90.0
201601	2974	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would also add that if both actual as well as expected inflation are important determinants of actions to be taken in March, it is unlikely that we will have much in the way of evidence of higher core or total PCE inflation by that time.	23.0	90.0
201601	2975	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In light of the recent declines in oil prices and the appreciation of the dollar, the Tealbook expects that total PCE inflation for the first quarter of 2016 will be negative, and that core PCE inflation will be 1.2 percent in Q1.	23.0	90.0
201601	2976	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In fact, the Tealbook forecast does not have core inflation showing signs of accelerating until next year.	23.0	90.0
201601	2977	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If this forecast proves correct, the inflation data will not provide evidence of approaching our 2 percent goal for quite some time.	23.0	90.0
201601	2978	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	We have plenty of data yet to be received before the next meeting.	23.0	90.0
201601	2979	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Nonetheless, in view of recent events, we should be reinforcing the idea that the median SEP is a forecast, not a promise, and that we remain data dependent.	23.0	90.0
201601	2980	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I greatly prefer the new sentence substituted in the second paragraph of alternative B to the previous version of alternative B.	23.0	90.0
201601	2981	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It appropriately highlights that we are monitoring recent events for implications on the outlook and the risks to the outlook.	23.0	90.0
201601	2982	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201601	2983	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201601	2984	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23.0	65.0
201601	2985	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201601	2986	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I support alternative B in the version with the revised wording at the end of the second paragraph.	23.0	108.0
201601	2987	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	This gives the right combination of concern over recent developments and calmness in deciding how to appraise them and how to react to them at later meetings.	23.0	108.0
201601	2988	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Although a lot has happened so far in January, this is not the time to change course.	23.0	108.0
201601	2989	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We continue to be faced by the combination of a strong labor market and disappointing real spending, with the recent addition to the mixture of considerable financial market volatility.	23.0	108.0
201601	2990	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’re not expected to change the federal funds rate at this meeting.	23.0	108.0
201601	2991	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And, at least in this regard, we should not disappoint expectations.	23.0	108.0
201601	2992	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Rather, we should, in the words of alt-B, closely monitor “global economic and financial developments” and assess “their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook.”	23.0	108.0
201601	2993	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Our discussions yesterday and today started from the current combination of a labor market that has performed relatively well and that must be near maximum sustainable employment, and, at the same time, the staff’s forecast of PCE inflation for 2016 that is only 0.7 percent, with even the forecast of the core PCE inflation at 1.3 percent.	23.0	108.0
201601	2994	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The discussion yesterday went on to detail the background to this situation:  the large depreciation of the dollar; the ongoing declines in the price of oil; the recent declines in asset and commodity prices; and the fears, particularly of asset market participants, that China’s economic growth may decline more rapidly than the official predictions, and that the exchange rate of the renminbi may depreciate more than the authority’s pronouncements about it would suggest.	23.0	108.0
201601	2995	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	There was concern over Japan, which may want a weaker exchange rate, and the euro zone, which makes no bones about that.	23.0	108.0
201601	2996	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Aside from the market volatility, these are not especially new facts.	23.0	108.0
201601	2997	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Nonetheless, like the markets, the FOMC was in a distinctly less optimistic mood yesterday than it had been only six weeks ago.	23.0	108.0
201601	2998	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	It was striking that the basic view about inflation that had obtained among many of us until now—that inflation has been held down by temporary factors, especially declines in the price of oil and the appreciation of the dollar—appeared to be losing ground.	23.0	108.0
201601	2999	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Simply put, the view I thought I heard from some of you was that we’ve been surprised too often by low inflation, and that we should accept low inflation as a better description of the underlying state of the economy than the view that inflation is low primarily because of temporary factors.	23.0	108.0
201601	3000	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I do not believe that.	23.0	108.0
201601	3001	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	True, we have continually been surprised by oil price declines.	23.0	108.0
201601	3002	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So has almost everyone, including the Saudis.	23.0	108.0
201601	3003	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	That does not mean that the temporary oil price declines and their consequences are not a major factor underlying the behavior of prices.	23.0	108.0
201601	3004	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Similarly, the appreciation of the dollar has had an influence on even core PCE prices.	23.0	108.0
201601	3005	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Among the consequences of declines in the price of oil is the decline in expected inflation.	23.0	108.0
201601	3006	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Those who worry about inflation losing its expected-inflation anchor need, at present, to look no further than the behavior of the price of oil.	23.0	108.0
201601	3007	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Those who ask why core PCE inflation is 1.3 percent rather than closer to the target of 2 percent will find that a significant share of that 0.7 percent gap is taken up by the influence of oil prices and the appreciating exchange rate on core inflation.	23.0	108.0
201601	3008	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Now, one may well ask why movements in energy prices are correlated with expected inflation and core PCE inflation, and everyone is asking.	23.0	108.0
201601	3009	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	There are explanations for both these phenomena, but there is a clear need for further research on these topics.	23.0	108.0
201601	3010	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And I’m sure that WE9, which is Wilcox exhibit 9, marks a good start in getting an answer to that question.	23.0	108.0
201601	3011	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Where would we be if we accept, as I do, the view that inflation will gradually rise to its 2 percent target if labor markets continue to be strong, with unemployment remaining close to the natural rate?	23.0	108.0
201601	3012	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We would essentially remain with the forecast we had last month, which is close to this month’s Tealbook forecast.	23.0	108.0
201601	3013	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We would continue with our approach of gradual increases in the federal funds rate at a rate that depends on incoming data and without any commitment to a fixed number of increases per period.	23.0	108.0
201601	3014	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	What if that view turns out to be wrong and the labor market starts weakening and the unemployment rate moves up in a sustained way?	23.0	108.0
201601	3015	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think it’s premature to start talking seriously about that possibility now, but it is not premature for the staff to start researching that situation and possible courses of action to deal with it.	23.0	108.0
201601	3016	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201601	3017	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201601	3018	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23.0	65.0
201601	3019	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201601	3020	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I support the substance of alternative B.	23.0	88.0
201601	3021	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	As regards the statement language, the objective should be to position the Committee as agnostic about a March policy action but to be careful not to rule out March.	23.0	88.0
201601	3022	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	While I have some sympathy with the alternative A language that the Committee sees risks “tilted slightly to the downside,”	23.0	88.0
201601	3023	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I think the better communication strategy is to avoid explicitly making that declaration.	23.0	88.0
201601	3024	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	To shift the risk assessment to the downside at this meeting would signal, in my opinion, that a rate increase at the March meeting is quite unlikely, and I think it is too early to make such a call.	23.0	88.0
201601	3025	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding the notion in the new alternative B language of omitting an explicit balance-of-risks assessment, yesterday I heard quite a number of comments that the balance of risk may have tilted to the downside.	23.0	88.0
201601	3026	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I think this presents a tricky communication situation.	23.0	88.0
201601	3027	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Avoiding an explicit assessment of risk will be noticed and give rise to lots of commentary.	23.0	88.0
201601	3028	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	It is a departure from past practice.	23.0	88.0
201601	3029	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	It could also be taken as a signal regarding March.	23.0	88.0
201601	3030	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	So, all things considered, I am leaning, after thinking about it over the weekend, toward just sticking with the language in the memo on alternative language circulated on January 20 premising that it’s simply too early, and it’s premature to make an adjustment to the downside in the Committee’s official stance on the balance of risk.	23.0	88.0
201601	3031	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I have a couple of more comments.	23.0	88.0
201601	3032	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Strict adherence to data dependence makes us, to an extent, tethered to the data calendar.	23.0	88.0
201601	3033	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I can imagine incoming data leading up to the March meeting that continue the run of ambiguous signals.	23.0	88.0
201601	3034	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We have two more employment reports before the March meeting.	23.0	88.0
201601	3035	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	A soft reading on the labor market, along with weakness in the spending data, could give pause.	23.0	88.0
201601	3036	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I commented in the economic go-round that inflation data are likely to be messy through the middle of the year.	23.0	88.0
201601	3037	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The February CPI data will arrive on the second day of our March meeting.	23.0	88.0
201601	3038	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Although, as I said, I’m not ready to send any signal that a rate increase in March is off the table, I am anticipating that a rate move in March could feel premature and unsupported by evidence.	23.0	88.0
201601	3039	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	If that’s the situation, I expect I will be comfortable waiting until April for more data that confirm, I hope, that the outlook is holding up.	23.0	88.0
201601	3040	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In some respects, I think it would be a healthy departure to move in April to reinforce that every meeting of this first phase of normalization is live.	23.0	88.0
201601	3041	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201601	3042	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201601	3043	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	23.0	65.0
201601	3044	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201601	3045	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Consistent with my economic forecast, I support alternative B for this meeting.	23.0	999.0
201601	3046	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Labor markets have continued to improve, and inflation is likely to be held back by energy prices and dollar appreciation over the near term.	23.0	999.0
201601	3047	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	But survey- based measures of inflation expectations have remained steady, and I expect that oil prices and the dollar will stabilize in the months ahead.	23.0	999.0
201601	3048	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Monetary policy—and I think it’s important to remind myself—remains accommodative, and a cautious approach seems appropriate in view of the economic and political uncertainties that we face.	23.0	999.0
201601	3049	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	I’ve advocated a gradual normalization of policy that is data dependent, and the current data and forecasts suggest to me that no change in our policy stance is warranted at this meeting.	23.0	999.0
201601	3050	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	While my own view is that the risks to the economy are largely balanced or slightly to the downside, I’m fine with the proposed language in paragraph 2.	23.0	999.0
201601	3051	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	There’s a large and growing divergence of the federal funds rate path in both the Tealbook forecast and the central tendency in the SEPs from the implied funds rate path from the financial markets.	23.0	999.0
201601	3052	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Looking ahead to our next few meetings, we may find ourselves in a situation in which the labor market continues to be relatively strong while realized inflation runs at a slow pace.	23.0	999.0
201601	3053	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	My own view is that such a scenario would call into question the suggested path of our normalization.	23.0	999.0
201601	3054	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Fortunately, I believe we take care in the statement to say that our policy decisions are data dependent.	23.0	999.0
201601	3055	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	However, in the event that there is ongoing tension between our employment and inflation goals, we may need to provide more guidance about how these tensions will be resolved and what that implies for the future course of monetary policy.	23.0	999.0
201601	3056	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Personally, I would need to see convincing evidence that inflation is once again moving toward target, and that is unlikely to occur this quarter.	23.0	999.0
201601	3057	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	In any event, on account of the disconnect between the policy rate path we have in mind and the policy rate path expected by financial markets, it’s important to think about what we would have to see to choose to resume our rate increases.	23.0	999.0
201601	3058	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Lastly, I’d just reiterate a comment I made a few meetings ago, which President Bullard referred to yesterday—Q1 GDP data are notoriously difficult to interpret due to seasonal adjustments.	23.0	999.0
201601	3059	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	And I encourage the Committee to take that with—I don’t know if it’ll be a block of salt or a grain.	23.0	999.0
201601	3060	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Let’s call it a cube of salt.	23.0	999.0
201601	3061	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201601	3062	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201601	3063	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23.0	65.0
201601	3064	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201601	3065	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Financial conditions have tightened considerably since we last met, and market-based measures of inflation expectations have taken another sizable step down.	23.0	107.0
201601	3066	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Equity prices have fallen roughly 7 percent, and credit spreads have widened.	23.0	107.0
201601	3067	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The trade-weighted real exchange rate appreciated a further 3 percent, bringing the total real effective appreciation to 20 percent, roughly 1 percent a month since the summer of 2014.	23.0	107.0
201601	3068	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	As noted earlier, the financial tightening in this period is roughly equivalent to two additional hikes in the federal funds rate.	23.0	107.0
201601	3069	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Over the course of the movements in the exchange rate and oil prices, we have repeatedly noted their transitory nature and stated our willingness to look through them.	23.0	107.0
201601	3070	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	As I discussed yesterday, the factors holding down inflation have proven to be persistent and appear to be related to global forces that are also persistent.	23.0	107.0
201601	3071	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, it would be unwise to dismiss the fluctuations in China’s financial markets as either one-offs or unlikely to perturb global markets sufficiently to matter for the US outlook.	23.0	107.0
201601	3072	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	As China changes the composition of its economic growth trajectory, it is having material effects on commodity producers, which are being amplified in countries whose growth was accompanied by rapid increases in debt.	23.0	107.0
201601	3073	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	China is also undertaking a notable shift in its exchange rate regime, a departure from earlier financial crises, when it hardened rather than loosened its commitment to a peg.	23.0	107.0
201601	3074	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	As China adjusts its exchange rate and attempts to work off large imbalances in its financial markets, this could lead to periodic bouts of volatility with possible amplification associated with post-crisis changes in financial market functioning.	23.0	107.0
201601	3075	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Eighteen months of repeated step-downs in oil prices and step-ups in the exchange rate risk exerting a disinflationary force in the medium-term framework in which we are making policy.	23.0	107.0
201601	3076	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	These may well have important implications for policy when they are accompanied by a significant deterioration in measures of market-based inflation expectations, as we’ve seen, and some hints of softening in survey-based measures.	23.0	107.0
201601	3077	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	From where we sit today, in light of the extent of deterioration we’ve seen to an inflation outlook that was already raising concerns and to measures of inflation expectations, I think it’s unlikely that we would see a set of data that would give me enough reassurance in the intermeeting period to justify an increase in the federal funds rate in March.	23.0	107.0
201601	3078	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	What would it take to reverse that judgment?	23.0	107.0
201601	3079	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	To raise rates and still be confident in progress toward our inflation objective, we would need to see those forces abate at least somewhat and evidence that inflation is moving back toward our goal, along with some firming of expectations.	23.0	107.0
201601	3080	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I would want to see a constellation of data indicating progress on actual and expected inflation, some combination of an inflection on the exchange rate and oil prices that’s durable, a firming in core inflation, and an improvement on market-based measures of inflation expectations.	23.0	107.0
201601	3081	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In view of the current balance of risks, to act without hard evidence that inflation is moving toward our goal threatens to undermine the credibility of our inflation target.	23.0	107.0
201601	3082	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	My views on policy are importantly shaped by the very limited room we have to cushion shocks on the downside using conventional tools.	23.0	107.0
201601	3083	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In contrast, if we were to see an unexpected acceleration in inflation, we have ample room and experience using conventional tools to adjust policy in a manner that is not disruptive.	23.0	107.0
201601	3084	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Interestingly, other advanced-economy central banks have taken note of recent developments and suggested they may warrant adjustments in their path of policy.	23.0	107.0
201601	3085	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In our discussions yesterday and today, I heard around the table a strong sense that recent developments pose downside risks to the outlook for inflation and activity.	23.0	107.0
201601	3086	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	If this is, in fact, a widely held view among those on the Committee, I think it would be helpful to shape market expectations that the path of policy is sensitive to recent negative developments.	23.0	107.0
201601	3087	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I recognize there are risks to reacting both too much and too little, but I believe we can strike the appropriate balance, signaling we are actively engaged and prepared to adjust the path of the policy rate in tune with financial and economic conditions without appearing to lurch or suggesting greater alarm than is warranted.	23.0	107.0
201601	3088	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	If we do not do so, we risk seeing further financial tightening due to expectations of divergence and further deterioration in inflation expectations.	23.0	107.0
201601	3089	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I can support alternative B.	23.0	107.0
201601	3090	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I would find it difficult to support language that continued to describe the risks to activity and inflation as balanced.	23.0	107.0
201601	3091	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201601	3092	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201601	3093	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23.0	65.0
201601	3094	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201601	3095	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I support alternative B.	23.0	91.0
201601	3096	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Yesterday Governor Fischer stated some interesting financial-stability concerns related to equity market pricing and changes in the federal funds rate.	23.0	91.0
201601	3097	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Because I favor continued strong accommodation, I want to clarify my views on those particular concerns.	23.0	91.0
201601	3098	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	After the Lehman Brothers crisis, the financial crisis, and the deep recession that followed, a big output gap emerged, $11 trillion of net worth was destroyed, and risk aversion increased very strongly.	23.0	91.0
201601	3099	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	In that context, monetary policy accommodation was required to facilitate as quick a return to trend economic growth and a closing of the output gap as necessary.	23.0	91.0
201601	3100	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I viewed that as a fundamental improvement that supported equity prices throughout that time and a reduction in risk aversion.	23.0	91.0
201601	3101	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I view so much of that period as a fundamental improvement that supported equity prices.	23.0	91.0
201601	3102	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	As we get closer to closing the gap, then renormalization, I think, properly gets that back.	23.0	91.0
201601	3103	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Anyway, that’s my view regarding why policy accommodation continues to be appropriate, even in the presence of those concerns.	23.0	91.0
201601	3104	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	We made it clear in December that future policy would be data dependent.	23.0	91.0
201601	3105	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	To me, data dependence reflects not just the baseline outlook relative to our dual-mandate goals, but also the uncertainties and balance of risks surrounding that outlook.	23.0	91.0
201601	3106	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	As I noted yesterday, while I’ve not changed my baseline much, the developments since our December meeting have raised uncertainties and shaded the risks further to the downside.	23.0	91.0
201601	3107	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	In addition, financial conditions appear to have already tightened in response to the increase in uncertainty and risks.	23.0	91.0
201601	3108	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	So, for me, data dependence and appropriate risk management dictate that we do not raise rates today, and that we communicate this reasoning for the decision to the public.	23.0	91.0
201601	3109	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Alternative B accomplishes this.	23.0	91.0
201601	3110	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Before we move again, we should be confident that economic growth and inflation have successfully weathered the latest round of downside shocks.	23.0	91.0
201601	3111	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	It could be well into the second half of the year before I have that confidence.	23.0	91.0
201601	3112	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I think we need confirmation that our above-trend outlook for economic growth is still on track to drive continued labor market improvement.	23.0	91.0
201601	3113	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	That is an important channel for many of our inflation projections to rise to trend.	23.0	91.0
201601	3114	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	My December SEP submission envisioned only two quarter-point rate increases in 2016.	23.0	91.0
201601	3115	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	For me, this slow pace of renormalization—or even less—still seems appropriate.	23.0	91.0
201601	3116	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I support the new last sentence in paragraph 2.	23.0	91.0
201601	3117	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	We need to carefully assess the balance of risks.	23.0	91.0
201601	3118	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	In this environment, risk-management arguments weigh more strongly for further delay.	23.0	91.0
201601	3119	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Let me quickly repeat my risk-management views.	23.0	91.0
201601	3120	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	It’s a new year, and we have new Committee members.	23.0	91.0
201601	3121	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I’ll be very brief, and they’re very similar to what Governor Brainard and others have mentioned.	23.0	91.0
201601	3122	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	We continue to be in a special policy environment because of the lower bound.	23.0	91.0
201601	3123	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Our move of 25 basis points in December doesn’t give us enough headroom to use conventional policy to address any meaningful downside shock to economic growth or inflation, but we still can easily raise rates to address upside surprises.	23.0	91.0
201601	3124	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Accordingly, even if the baseline outlook does not change, increases in uncertainty and downside risks generate asymmetric expected policy losses, and risk-management considerations still tell us that this asymmetry should be addressed with accommodative and perhaps looser monetary policy.	23.0	91.0
201601	3125	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Finally, I’ll note that, in paragraph 1, when we’re talking about inflation expectation measures, we still, for survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, simply say that they’re little changed on balance.	23.0	91.0
201601	3126	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	In your own comments, Madam Chair, you mentioned that they’re at near-historic lows for the Michigan survey.	23.0	91.0
201601	3127	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	It would be useful, perhaps, to add that, although challenging.	23.0	91.0
201601	3128	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201601	3129	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, last time, we did say they had edged down, and I think, in reflection of that, we agree they’re low.	23.0	65.0
201601	3130	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	23.0	91.0
201601	3131	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23.0	65.0
201601	3132	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201601	3133	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I support alternative B for today as written.	23.0	94.0
201601	3134	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Real GDP growth for the second half of 2015 appears to have been substantially weaker than I anticipated earlier in 2015.	23.0	94.0
201601	3135	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I do react to the data.	23.0	94.0
201601	3136	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I am concerned about this, and I would hope to see a rebound in the first half of 2016.	23.0	94.0
201601	3137	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	For now, I’m willing to go with the staff view that the US outlook has not changed materially.	23.0	94.0
201601	3138	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	However, this bears careful watching in the coming weeks.	23.0	94.0
201601	3139	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Labor markets have been strong, but there will now be even more pressure on this aspect of the economic data.	23.0	94.0
201601	3140	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Weak jobs reports at this point may change the narrative substantially and perhaps suddenly for the US economy.	23.0	94.0
201601	3141	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I have a few comments on the equity selloff.	23.0	94.0
201601	3142	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	By itself, I’m not particularly concerned about it.	23.0	94.0
201601	3143	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I can summarize President Kaplan’s remarks from yesterday that valuations could be viewed as returning to more normal levels, historically speaking, and this would be a welcome development for the US economy.	23.0	94.0
201601	3144	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	We don’t know if this will intensify, as Vice Chairman Dudley was talking about.	23.0	94.0
201601	3145	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Despite all of that, I would still be concerned that markets are reacting to a deteriorating US outlook that we are dismissing at this point because of strong labor market outcomes.	23.0	94.0
201601	3146	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I have a few comments on declines in crude oil.	23.0	94.0
201601	3147	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Ultimately, I still view this as a positive for the US economy.	23.0	94.0
201601	3148	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Again, I don’t think many would be willing to say that a sharp rise in crude oil prices would be a positive for the US economy.	23.0	94.0
201601	3149	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So it’s got to be that declines are the positive for the US economy.	23.0	94.0
201601	3150	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I do think, though, that the decline in crude oil prices continues to have disconcerting effects on inflation expectations.	23.0	94.0
201601	3151	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	This also bears careful watching, and it’s an important acknowledgment in the statement that market-based inflation expectations have been declining.	23.0	94.0
201601	3152	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I share some of the concerns of President Evans.	23.0	94.0
201601	3153	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	These are at 10-year lows.	23.0	94.0
201601	3154	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	That’s pretty low.	23.0	94.0
201601	3155	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Actual year-over-year Dallas Federal Reserve trimmed mean inflation remains stable at about 1.7 percent.	23.0	94.0
201601	3156	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I take comfort in that, but I’m worried that this will not last if inflation expectations continue to decline.	23.0	94.0
201601	3157	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	My last comment is on the effects on policy of the current global financial developments.	23.0	94.0
201601	3158	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	We made a small rate move at the December meeting.	23.0	94.0
201601	3159	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Even with that rate move, policy remains accommodative, and we say so in our statement.	23.0	94.0
201601	3160	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is normalization, not tightening.	23.0	94.0
201601	3161	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Did markets interpret this as a much larger move?	23.0	94.0
201601	3162	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think that’s a key concern for the Committee.	23.0	94.0
201601	3163	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	If it was a 25 basis point move by itself that was truly data dependent, you wouldn’t have expected major effects.	23.0	94.0
201601	3164	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Markets may have interpreted this as a much larger move, however.	23.0	94.0
201601	3165	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Why would this be?	23.0	94.0
201601	3166	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	It would be because, while we emphasize data dependence, the amount of credibility we have on this issue is limited because of the legacy of the 2004–06 tightening cycle, in which we were not data dependent.	23.0	94.0
201601	3167	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Once we got going in that tightening cycle, we simply increased at a certain pace, which, at that time, was every meeting.	23.0	94.0
201601	3168	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	We also have the QE tapering legacy, in which we said we were data dependent but we actually tapered in a more or less mechanical fashion and did not change the pace of tapering in reaction to economic data.	23.0	94.0
201601	3169	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Now we’re coming into this phase in which we’re again saying we’re data dependent.	23.0	94.0
201601	3170	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Markets—or at least some corners of markets—are saying, “No, you’re not.”	23.0	94.0
201601	3171	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Some corners of financial markets may have viewed the Committee as making a quasi-commitment to four rate increases in 2016.	23.0	94.0
201601	3172	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	The nature of financial pricing is that you pull all of that forward and you get a big selloff in markets and other kinds of effects.	23.0	94.0
201601	3173	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is obviously a very tenuous story, but I would be concerned that we don’t have enough credibility in our data dependency, and this echoes a few of the comments that Chair Yellen just made.	23.0	94.0
201601	3174	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	To the extent that we can build credibility that we are actually willing to react to incoming data, we’ll get better policy results.	23.0	94.0
201601	3175	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I see our normalization cycle as “When we get good news, we’ll make moves.	23.0	94.0
201601	3176	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	When we don’t get good news, we won’t make moves.”	23.0	94.0
201601	3177	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think the market is saying, “You guys are going to plow ahead no matter what the news is.”	23.0	94.0
201601	3178	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	To the extent that we can draw distinctions between those two options and build credibility on data dependence, we’ll get better monetary policy.	23.0	94.0
201601	3179	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you very much.	23.0	94.0
201601	3180	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201601	3181	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	23.0	65.0
201601	3182	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Chair Yellen.	23.0	110.0
201601	3183	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I support alternative B with the language as revised.	23.0	110.0
201601	3184	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In my communication after this meeting, I intend to emphasize that current monetary policy remains accommodative; that any action we take will be data dependent; that there is no predetermined path—or, as President Lockhart said, we are agnostic on the path, and I like that language—and that we will not be, for lack of a better term, Calvinistic in our actions [laughter]; and that any future removal of accommodation will be done only gradually.	23.0	110.0
201601	3185	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I will do everything I can to avoid getting pinned down into predicting the number of moves that we might make in 2016.	23.0	110.0
201601	3186	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I will also, though, emphasize that there are three segments that are distinctive but interrelated:  first, US economic developments, which are obviously GDP, unemployment, and inflation; second, non-US economic developments, which have obviously weakened; and, third, global financial market developments, which have clearly tightened.	23.0	110.0
201601	3187	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I will emphasize that the S&P, as I said yesterday, is not the same as the US economy, although it is affected by it.	23.0	110.0
201601	3188	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It is also heavily affected by non-US developments and global financial developments.	23.0	110.0
201601	3189	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In 2016 or in this part of it, we will have to be patient, and I will talk about that in assessing the ramifications on underlying US economic conditions of the weakness we are seeing so far in non-US economic activity as well as global financial developments.	23.0	110.0
201601	3190	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	While I’ve said before and I do believe that normalization would be desirable because of the potential distortions that excessive accommodation has on asset allocation, investment, and hiring, I don’t believe we can force normalization, and we really do have to be data dependent.	23.0	110.0
201601	3191	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The prospect of normalization has caused markets and risky assets to undergo a revaluation.	23.0	110.0
201601	3192	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	There is now a greater focus on fundamentals and possibly a gradual return to more traditional asset allocation.	23.0	110.0
201601	3193	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I actually think both of those developments are not a bad thing if they don’t go too far.	23.0	110.0
201601	3194	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In that vein, I’m going to be particularly focused in the next few months on S&P earnings forecasts, which, right now, as I mentioned yesterday, are $115 to $120.	23.0	110.0
201601	3195	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I will feel much better if forecasts stay in that range.	23.0	110.0
201601	3196	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’ll obviously be looking at high-yield and investment-grade credit spreads, and I’ll be looking at the 10-year Treasury.	23.0	110.0
201601	3197	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In addition, I’ll be continuing to try to assess the effect of three key secular, apart from cyclical, trends.	23.0	110.0
201601	3198	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The first one is aging demographics in the United States, China, Japan, and Europe, which negatively affect labor participation rates and are expected to have further negative effects on those participation rates in the future, reduce potential GDP, and have a negative effect on r*.	23.0	110.0
201601	3199	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The second secular trend is China, where there’s overcapacity and a transition to a more service-based economy is likely to take many years.	23.0	110.0
201601	3200	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The world is going to have to get used to slower rates of Chinese economic growth, and this is going to happen over a very long period.	23.0	110.0
201601	3201	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The third secular trend I’m focused on and am trying to continue to understand and assess is the end of the so-called debt supercycle.	23.0	110.0
201601	3202	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	That is, it is tougher for countries, including the United States, to boost their economic growth in the future by using leverage.	23.0	110.0
201601	3203	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I think the prospect of removal of central bank accommodation even gradually will likely create greater focus on these secular trends.	23.0	110.0
201601	3204	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	23.0	110.0
201601	3205	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201601	3206	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23.0	65.0
201601	3207	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201601	3208	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I support making no change in the federal funds rate at this meeting, as in alternative B.	23.0	999.0
201601	3209	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In my view, the most likely outcome continues to be that the economy will evolve in a way that warrants a gradually rising path of policy rates over time, although there are risks associated with that outlook.	23.0	999.0
201601	3210	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I view alternative B as consistent with my view on the economy, and I think that policy remains pretty well calibrated to the economic outlook.	23.0	999.0
201601	3211	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In my view, I don’t think we have accumulated enough evidence to conclude that the medium-run outlook or the risks associated with the outlook have changed in a material way that necessitates giving a signal about a change in our policy course.	23.0	999.0
201601	3212	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The proposed change to the description of our inflation outlook acknowledges the further decline in oil prices and that inflation will remain low in the near term but, at the same time, indicates that, over time, inflation is expected to move back once the effects of energy price declines dissipate.	23.0	999.0
201601	3213	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	As I discussed yesterday, if energy prices continue to fall, we’ll need to reconsider that language, but today I’m comfortable with the proposed language in alternative B.	23.0	999.0
201601	3214	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Given the intermeeting developments in financial markets, I do think it’s appropriate to indicate we’re monitoring economic and financial developments closely and assessing their implications for the medium-run outlook.	23.0	999.0
201601	3215	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	This is consistent with past communications that our monetary policy decisions are going to be data dependent.	23.0	999.0
201601	3216	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Regarding the balance of risks, I note that in September, in a similar period of high market volatility, we did not change the balance of risks but indicated we were monitoring developments abroad.	23.0	999.0
201601	3217	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I see today’s situation as somewhat analogous and would have preferred we not change our balance-of-risks assessment, because of the potential that that change might alter expectations further about our March decision.	23.0	999.0
201601	3218	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	And I would like us to remain data dependent with respect to our decision at that meeting, in which we’ll have new projections, and at subsequent meetings.	23.0	999.0
201601	3219	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Now, it is true that we’re monitoring developments and assessing their implications for the outlook and the balance of risks associated with the outlook.	23.0	999.0
201601	3220	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	My concern is not with the truth of the statement but with the signal that would send about our policy rate path for the period ahead.	23.0	999.0
201601	3221	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	That said, I’m prepared to accept that statement as written in the revision of alternative B.	23.0	999.0
201601	3222	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Finally, I do understand it’s important to show that the Committee is aware and cognizant of economic and financial market developments, and I understand that we need to signal that in the statement.	23.0	999.0
201601	3223	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	But at times like this, when we’ve seen a lot of volatility in the markets, it’s easy to signal that we’re focused on the short run.	23.0	999.0
201601	3224	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Of course, as the people around the table have said, in view of the lags with which policy affects the economy, we need to be thinking about the medium-run outlook.	23.0	999.0
201601	3225	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	And I don’t think we should use our statements to encourage short-run thinking.	23.0	999.0
201601	3226	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Again, that said, I’m supportive of alternative B and the revision that was made.	23.0	999.0
201601	3227	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201601	3228	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201601	3229	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23.0	65.0
201601	3230	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	81.0
201601	3231	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I won’t attempt a comprehensive review.	23.0	81.0
201601	3232	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I’ll just make a couple of observations.	23.0	81.0
201601	3233	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	First, I’ve heard a lot of discussion about downside risks.	23.0	81.0
201601	3234	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Obviously, it’s the topic of the day here.	23.0	81.0
201601	3235	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	But I’m also struck that it’s very unclear whether global developments are going to affect our economic growth prospects materially.	23.0	81.0
201601	3236	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	When financial markets move significantly, like they have, without an immediately discernible deterioration in economic fundamentals, we often find ourselves striving to write a statement that shows we’re paying attention without adding to market pessimism unduly.	23.0	81.0
201601	3237	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I think the new language proposed for the end of paragraph 2 strikes as reasonable a balance as possible.	23.0	81.0
201601	3238	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Now, of those two concerns you commented on, Madam Chair, the risk of distorting or biasing market participants’ outlook is, for me, more pressing.	23.0	81.0
201601	3239	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	People take our assessments of economic conditions very seriously, I think.	23.0	81.0
201601	3240	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	They accord a lot of skill and ability to us in our capacity to sift through the data and make a judgment about economic prospects.	23.0	81.0
201601	3241	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	And I think there have been times in the recent past when our actions and statements have had an influence on broad market beliefs about economic prospects.	23.0	81.0
201601	3242	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	So at times like this, we should be really cautious about altering our assessment of the economic outlook as well as the policy outlook.	23.0	81.0
201601	3243	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I’d also point out that this phrase “balance of risks” has been used commonly in our discussions yesterday and today in the sense of where outcomes are likely to fall in terms of economic growth and inflation.	23.0	81.0
201601	3244	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The origin of that language in our statement is as an explicit signal of the likelihood of the direction of the next move.	23.0	81.0
201601	3245	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	So while you might be attracted to one formulation under one interpretation of “balance of risks,”	23.0	81.0
201601	3246	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I think we should be cautious because it has this broader connotation of putting down a marker about which direction the next likely move is going to be.	23.0	81.0
201601	3247	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I want to comment on one other aspect of the language.	23.0	81.0
201601	3248	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	This might be odd to bring up here, considering the tenor of things.	23.0	81.0
201601	3249	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	But I would point out that, in paragraph 1, we say that “a range of ... labor market indicators ... points to some additional decline in underutilization of labor resources.”	23.0	81.0
201601	3250	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We should think about that going forward if things play out the way the Tealbook suggests.	23.0	81.0
201601	3251	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I argued yesterday that underutilization is statistically indistinguishable from zero now, and I think that word is going to be increasingly problematic as we go forward.	23.0	81.0
201601	3252	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Paragraph 1 of alternative C contains what I believe to be more appropriate language.	23.0	81.0
201601	3253	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	There, it says that a range of labor market indicators “points to some additional increase in utilization of labor resources,” without judging what “full” or “underutilization” is.	23.0	81.0
201601	3254	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	That concludes my comments, Madam Chair.	23.0	81.0
201601	3255	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201601	3256	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23.0	65.0
201601	3257	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	103.0
201601	3258	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I support alternative B as an appropriate pause after the first rate hike in several years.	23.0	103.0
201601	3259	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Although volatility in financial markets has already made the path of the funds rate less certain this year than in December, I continue to anticipate moderate economic growth and rising inflation, with further removal of accommodation this year being appropriate.	23.0	103.0
201601	3260	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	My confidence in that forecast, however, will depend on judging between now and March the signal of various risks and uncertainties that have been well highlighted at this meeting.	23.0	103.0
201601	3261	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	In light of that background, I support the revised language in paragraph 2.	23.0	103.0
201601	3262	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	It is what I consider to be an honest assessment on the part of the Committee about the risks.	23.0	103.0
201601	3263	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I would also add that I had a similar comment to President Lacker’s as it relates to how we characterize additional declines in underutilization, versus increases in utilization as described in alternative C.	23.0	103.0
201601	3264	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I hope we’ll consider that as we go forward.	23.0	103.0
201601	3265	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201601	3266	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23.0	65.0
201601	3267	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201601	3268	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I support alternative B.	23.0	104.0
201601	3269	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Both the weaker inflation picture and the likely increase to downside risks suggest to me that the Committee can and should proceed cautiously.	23.0	104.0
201601	3270	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	As I mentioned yesterday, there are several story lines underlying the recent market weakness, and I think that the Committee will need some time to understand whether markets have overreacted.	23.0	104.0
201601	3271	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	As for the language, I support the revised language in the statement.	23.0	104.0
201601	3272	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The Committee, in my view, has to navigate between two risks.	23.0	104.0
201601	3273	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Saying that “risks remain balanced” no longer seems right to me, and I think it also risks suggesting that the Committee is committed to a preset path.	23.0	104.0
201601	3274	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	At the same time, it seems premature to me to say that they are skewed to the downside; I also think that could send too much of a signal.	23.0	104.0
201601	3275	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	So I think that the proposed language navigates between these two risks and suggests that the Committee takes note of potential downside risks, is watching developments carefully, and will react appropriately.	23.0	104.0
201601	3276	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201601	3277	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201601	3278	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	23.0	65.0
201601	3279	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	111.0
201601	3280	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I agree that, as the Chair noted, it’s important to show that we recognize downside risks but do so without appearing to panic or sending a negative signal that could further increase volatility.	23.0	111.0
201601	3281	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I think alternative B strikes that balance appropriately, so I support alternative B.	23.0	111.0
201601	3282	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	As we’ve talked about, there are risks to any outlook, and we have to be prepared to respond if the economy evolves in ways we may not expect.	23.0	111.0
201601	3283	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Like others, I am particularly concerned about downside risks here.	23.0	111.0
201601	3284	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I’ve been thinking about what we’re seeing in the markets, and it’s hard to tell signal from noise.	23.0	111.0
201601	3285	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	One piece of data that has stuck with me, as I read in the Tealbook, is that we estimate the Chinese have spent about $400 billion defending their currency.	23.0	111.0
201601	3286	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	That struck me as pretty revealing that they must be concerned.	23.0	111.0
201601	3287	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So while we don’t have great visibility into what’s happening in China, we do now, I believe, know that they are legitimately concerned.	23.0	111.0
201601	3288	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I think alternative B is the right approach, and I’m concerned about what actions we would consider taking if these financial market developments actually did affect our economy.	23.0	111.0
201601	3289	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	As others have noted, if things are better than we expect, we have a lot more room to react, and we’ve got plenty of levers.	23.0	111.0
201601	3290	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	If things are worse than expected, what would we do?	23.0	111.0
201601	3291	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I’d be very interested in the staff’s analysis of what some of those options could be if these things evolve in ways that we hope they don’t.	23.0	111.0
201601	3292	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	23.0	111.0
201601	3293	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201601	3294	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23.0	65.0
201601	3295	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201601	3296	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Yesterday I said that my baseline expectations, while less optimistic than those of the Committee as a whole, hadn’t changed too much since December, but that I thought the risks had moved from modestly to decidedly weighted to the downside.	23.0	97.0
201601	3297	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	The remarks that a couple of you made yesterday afternoon suggested, I think, the valid point that the weight of the downside risks may itself have affected baseline expectations.	23.0	97.0
201601	3298	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think I actually heard all but a few participants take one or both of those perspectives, and the second seems to me an interesting one.	23.0	97.0
201601	3299	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	But, to me, the more important point was that all but a few people did seem to regard risks as having shifted to the downside.	23.0	97.0
201601	3300	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And there, just to be clear, I agree with Jeff that that doesn’t mean it should be a signal of what the next interest rate move is, but that it’s an honest appraisal of where the economy stands right now.	23.0	97.0
201601	3301	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I said in December that I didn’t have reasonable confidence that inflation would rise to 2 percent.	23.0	97.0
201601	3302	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Nothing since then has increased my confidence.	23.0	97.0
201601	3303	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	To the contrary, a few more doubts have crept in.	23.0	97.0
201601	3304	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Looking at the Committee’s median expectation—this in the December SEP—of a 1.6 percent increase in both headline and core inflation, I think it’s important, as I said yesterday, to make as close a real-time evaluation as possible of the degree to which actual inflation is tracking those expectations.	23.0	97.0
201601	3305	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	We’ve already seen in this Tealbook that the path expected in December has been pushed out a couple of quarters.	23.0	97.0
201601	3306	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	It remains to be seen whether the slope of the path itself will hold after those couple of quarters.	23.0	97.0
201601	3307	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	The staff’s monitoring mechanism, as explained yesterday by David Wilcox, will help answer this question.	23.0	97.0
201601	3308	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	This will be in line with my recurring call for some evidence that expectations derived from models or past correlations are actually being realized before we take policy steps based on them.	23.0	97.0
201601	3309	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	As to the statement, alternative A captures my views better than alternative B, certainly, in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, though I must confess that the subtlety of the difference in the last sentence of paragraph 3 somewhat eludes me.	23.0	97.0
201601	3310	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	So I may be missing something.	23.0	97.0
201601	3311	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Indeed, I think the views of the Committee as expressed yesterday suggest support for at least the weak version of the last sentence of paragraph 2 of alt-A with respect to downside risks, but I hear many participants reluctant to articulate what, as someone said, is a true statement, because of the tactical reasons of what kind of signaling that may indicate about where we are going.	23.0	97.0
201601	3312	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Personally, like Lael, I’d be quite surprised if it was appropriate in March to increase rates further, but one never knows.	23.0	97.0
201601	3313	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	As the policy actions in alt-A and alt-B are, I think, identical—in fact, I know the policy actions are identical, but I just don’t understand that difference in phraseology in paragraph 3—I can certainly go along with alt-B, including the more agnostic version of the last sentence of paragraph 2.	23.0	97.0
201601	3314	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	But I must confess that I do so a little bit reluctantly on the basis of past experience where, just to be direct about it, some participants take agnostic language and then try to go out and shape expectations of how many rate increases that’s going to indicate over the next year.	23.0	97.0
201601	3315	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I hope, as President Kaplan urged, we don’t do that going forward.	23.0	97.0
201601	3316	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I wanted to end with a point that I’ve made before, but I wanted to make it again.	23.0	97.0
201601	3317	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	On the concept of normalization, I resist the notion that whatever we’re engaged in is a normalization process, because that suggests there is a “normal” for monetary policy.	23.0	97.0
201601	3318	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	It’s not a matter of getting the body temperature back to 98.6.	23.0	97.0
201601	3319	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	What is appropriate policy is going to depend on what the circumstances are that we face.	23.0	97.0
201601	3320	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, while some regarded having zero interest rates as abnormal, suggesting that we needed to get off of it as soon as possible, I think we see in the results that it was entirely appropriate, in view of external conditions, to be at zero.	23.0	97.0
201601	3321	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I would also say that the very good r* discussion we had a few meetings ago should have reinforced the idea that, at some level, we don’t really know quite what “normal” is, and that “normal” changes over time.	23.0	97.0
201601	3322	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	So that doesn’t affect how one thinks about actual rate increases, but I think it does, in public communications, sometimes affect people because it suggests that there is this obvious goal.	23.0	97.0
201601	3323	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	We may say we’re data dependent, but we’re going to get to that goal.	23.0	97.0
201601	3324	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	We’re going to normalize, meaning “get back to the normal level.”	23.0	97.0
201601	3325	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Maybe a few of us actually believe that, but I don’t think most of us, including some who use that term, actually mean that.	23.0	97.0
201601	3326	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think they really are making judgments as to what’s appropriate in what circumstances.	23.0	97.0
201601	3327	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201601	3328	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201601	3329	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	May I say something?	23.0	108.0
201601	3330	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	23.0	65.0
201601	3331	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23.0	65.0
201601	3332	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I understand what you say, Governor Tarullo, but I will continue to use the word “normalization.”	23.0	108.0
201601	3333	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think a zero interest rate is a normal situation.	23.0	108.0
201601	3334	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	It hasn’t been historically, and I’d rather be in a situation in which you can move both ways as needed.	23.0	108.0
201601	3335	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Of course, that is not to say that zero was wrong when we were at zero.	23.0	108.0
201601	3336	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And, if I may continue—President Evans, I didn’t say anything critical of QE or policies followed up to 2015 or 2016.	23.0	108.0
201601	3337	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I was just trying to explain why, as we come out of zero, we might expect stock prices to adjust because the capitalization factor is rising.	23.0	108.0
201601	3338	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	That’s all I was saying.	23.0	108.0
201601	3339	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	23.0	91.0
201601	3340	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23.0	65.0
201601	3341	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	On Governor Tarullo’s comments on normalization, I’d be willing to use a different word if you wanted to.	23.0	94.0
201601	3342	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	But “tightening,”	23.0	94.0
201601	3343	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think, is contrary to some of the things that we’re saying, because we’re saying that policy remains accommodative.	23.0	94.0
201601	3344	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	And if you say, “Well, every time you raise rates, you’re tightening,”	23.0	94.0
201601	3345	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’m not sure that the Committee is really there.	23.0	94.0
201601	3346	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Even taking into account the r* discussion, I think we still believe we’ve got an accommodative policy.	23.0	94.0
201601	3347	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I struggled a little bit to describe the situation, but I thought “normalization” was maybe a good term.	23.0	94.0
201601	3348	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’d be happy to switch to something else, but I think the idea was to not be saying that we’re tightening in a situation in which people think the economy is certainly not at the level that it’s been historically.	23.0	94.0
201601	3349	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Well, I wasn’t trying to suggest any particular formulation, Jim.	23.0	97.0
201601	3350	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	One could say “removal of accommodation” or whatever.	23.0	97.0
201601	3351	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I actually, though, think Governor Fischer made my point, even though he was rebutting it [laughter], that zero was appropriate for those conditions, and what will be appropriate in the future will depend on what the conditions are, both cyclical and secular.	23.0	97.0
201601	3352	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	That’s really the only point that I was trying to make, and, as I say, I know you, certainly—and, I suspect, others—have not had in mind that there’s some interest rate that we’re going to end at.	23.0	97.0
201601	3353	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	You’re taking the data and your assessment of the economy as we go.	23.0	97.0
201601	3354	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	But I have read more than one account in which people have said, “They’re normalizing to get to a particular rate,” and the rate is the one that they find in the SEP.	23.0	97.0
201601	3355	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And we just don’t know that yet.	23.0	97.0
201601	3356	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Now, that’s really my only point.	23.0	97.0
201601	3357	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Madam Chair, could I say something?	23.0	91.0
201601	3358	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23.0	65.0
201601	3359	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I’m confused by this.	23.0	91.0
201601	3360	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I thought we had work streams that use the term “renormalization process.”	23.0	91.0
201601	3361	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We do.	23.0	65.0
201601	3362	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	It’s not my work.	23.0	97.0
201601	3363	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	23.0	97.0
201601	3364	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Well, okay.	23.0	91.0
201601	3365	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	But as a Committee, I’ve seen documents in which we refer to this as renormalization, and there have been periods when Chairman Bernanke certainly had strong preferences for certain types of terminology as opposed to others.	23.0	91.0
201601	3366	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I just assumed that, on most occasions, it would be okay to use the official language.	23.0	91.0
201601	3367	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I don’t think I disagree with the substance of what you’re saying, though.	23.0	91.0
201601	3368	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I agree with you that we have to be clear about it.	23.0	91.0
201601	3369	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	We all have our viewpoints of where we’re headed.	23.0	91.0
201601	3370	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23.0	65.0
201601	3371	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Am I next?	23.0	102.0
201601	3372	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	You are.	23.0	65.0
201601	3373	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Number 15.	23.0	102.0
201601	3374	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	All right.	23.0	102.0
201601	3375	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	102.0
201601	3376	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	First of all, I want to correct something in my response to Governor Tarullo’s question to me at the end of my remarks during the economic go-round, when I was talking about the composition effects.	23.0	102.0
201601	3377	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	He asked me if these papers are available.	23.0	102.0
201601	3378	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	They’ve actually been available for years on our website.	23.0	102.0
201601	3379	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	These are the same papers?	23.0	97.0
201601	3380	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	These are the same papers.	23.0	102.0
201601	3381	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I said I wasn’t sure whether they were.	23.0	102.0
201601	3382	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	They are.	23.0	102.0
201601	3383	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	What is new is the update through the current, most recent data, which we’ll be happy to share.	23.0	102.0
201601	3384	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But it’s the same analysis—one paper by John Fernald, Mary Daly, and Bart Hobijn and the other paper by Bart and Mary.	23.0	102.0
201601	3385	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So these are analyses they’ve done in previous work.	23.0	102.0
201601	3386	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ve been updating it regularly.	23.0	102.0
201601	3387	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I support alternative B.	23.0	102.0
201601	3388	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think it does a reasonably good job of paying heed to recent developments while indicating that the medium-term trajectory of the economy remains favorable.	23.0	102.0
201601	3389	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In this regard, the modal outlook hasn’t changed much since the December meeting despite the spike in financial market volatility.	23.0	102.0
201601	3390	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The incoming data on economic activity have been mixed, with a fourth-quarter dip in output growth but the stronger-than-expected job gains.	23.0	102.0
201601	3391	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Like the Tealbook, I take more signal from the employment data.	23.0	102.0
201601	3392	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I continue to expect somewhat slightly above-trend GDP growth and employment growth this year, and that’s sufficient for us to overshoot full employment by a meaningful amount.	23.0	102.0
201601	3393	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Headline inflation data continue to be low, but that’s mainly stemming from another round of transitory restraining factors.	23.0	102.0
201601	3394	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	These, too, shall pass.	23.0	102.0
201601	3395	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, as the labor market tightens further, we should get back on track toward our 2 percent inflation objective.	23.0	102.0
201601	3396	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, in thinking about the future path of policy, I do find it instructive to look at Tealbook B in terms of how the changes in the outlook regarding output, employment, and inflation affect what the path for policy should be.	23.0	102.0
201601	3397	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Whether you’re looking at policy rules or the optimal control simulations, these are ways of thinking about policy that have been studied for decades, and they’ve been highlighted by the Chair in numerous speeches.	23.0	102.0
201601	3398	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And if you look at the very modest changes in the modal forecast—I’ll get to the risks in a moment—basically, that implies the changes in the projected paths for real activity and for inflation that take into account all of the factors that everyone talked about the past few days:  a stronger dollar, the weaker stock market, weaker economic growth abroad, and the weak Q4 data.	23.0	102.0
201601	3399	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Everything that we talk about in the modal forecast is in the Tealbook.	23.0	102.0
201601	3400	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I trust that the staff has incorporated all of the latest information to get their view of where the economy is and where it’s going, and it basically calls for just a slightly shallower path for the funds rate—maybe a ¼ percentage point lower path in the funds rate over the next year or so.	23.0	102.0
201601	3401	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And that’s appropriate, in light of the effects of, especially, the stronger dollar and financial conditions on where the economy is and where it’s going.	23.0	102.0
201601	3402	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, the good news there—and here I am a little perplexed by some of the comments by both the Chair and President Bullard about how the market is locked into thinking we’re raising it four times this year.	23.0	102.0
201601	3403	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Well, with these weaker data and with the changes in conditions, we’ve seen a significant movement in expectations for the funds rate for 2016.	23.0	102.0
201601	3404	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	According to the Tealbook, the primary dealer survey says that, already, even after just a few weeks, they expect one fewer rate increase in 2016.	23.0	102.0
201601	3405	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	If you look at the probabilities in Simon and Lorie’s presentation, for a second rate hike by March, at the beginning of the year, it was around 50 percent.	23.0	102.0
201601	3406	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	According to the latest data that Simon shared with me, we’re under 30 percent today.	23.0	102.0
201601	3407	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So the market expectations are moving, as they should, with a data-dependent policy approach that we have announced and we should stick to.	23.0	102.0
201601	3408	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	My own personal view is similar, based on this analysis—that we should have probably one fewer rate hike this year already on the basis of the changes in the data.	23.0	102.0
201601	3409	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I don’t see there being this clear problem that market expectations see us somehow set on a course of having four rate increases.	23.0	102.0
201601	3410	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think the data strongly contradict that sense out there.	23.0	102.0
201601	3411	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We have to continue to be data dependent.	23.0	102.0
201601	3412	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We have to watch what’s happening.	23.0	102.0
201601	3413	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with the point that Governor Tarullo and, I think, Governor Brainard made about watching the inflation data:  not just hoping—hope is not our strategy—but also making sure it’s consistent with the outlook.	23.0	102.0
201601	3414	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I really like David Wilcox’s approach of showing us how the data have been coming in relative to our expectations.	23.0	102.0
201601	3415	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with all of those points.	23.0	102.0
201601	3416	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I would say that right now, the change in the baseline forecast has actually been quite modest, and I think that calls for a relatively modest modification of our path for policy.	23.0	102.0
201601	3417	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	That brings me to the risks, and here I actually come out with comments very similar to those of Presidents Mester and Lacker.	23.0	102.0
201601	3418	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with the Chair completely about trying to thread a needle here.	23.0	102.0
201601	3419	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’re trying to neither scare markets by saying that the risks are mostly to the downside nor look asleep at the wheel.	23.0	102.0
201601	3420	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	This has been a situation that we’ve been in before, as Presidents Lacker and Mester mentioned.	23.0	102.0
201601	3421	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It doesn’t work as well as we think.	23.0	102.0
201601	3422	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	When I try to thread a needle, with my vision deteriorating, I find that I put the thread next to the needle about 50 times in a row.	23.0	102.0
201601	3423	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think this is what’s going to happen when we try to do this.	23.0	102.0
201601	3424	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	There will be a market interpretation that the FOMC is, with the new language, putting significant weight on or making an acknowledgment that risks to the economic outlook are worse.	23.0	102.0
201601	3425	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	That may be what the Committee wants to do.	23.0	102.0
201601	3426	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that’s just a reality.	23.0	102.0
201601	3427	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do know from September that the commentary I heard from members of the public in my outreach activities was shockingly or surprisingly strong and consistent, indicating that, clearly, the FOMC knew something that the rest of the world didn’t know, and that we were much more worried about global economic and financial developments, which was worrisome to people.	23.0	102.0
201601	3428	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I know we’ve considered all of those issues.	23.0	102.0
201601	3429	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We had a good discussion.	23.0	102.0
201601	3430	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, I can support alternative B.	23.0	102.0
201601	3431	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	My expectation is, when the statement goes out, this will be seen as, in a way, validating the worries out there in the market.	23.0	102.0
201601	3432	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It could make expectations a little bit worse and will definitely lower market perceptions of the probability of a rate hike in March.	23.0	102.0
201601	3433	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, again, it’s a difficult decision to make, and I do support alternative B.	23.0	102.0
201601	3434	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of future language, we were asked for our views on alt-A and alt-C for the future.	23.0	102.0
201601	3435	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	My view is that alt-C, whenever we do think it’s appropriate to raise rates, is a fine starting point.	23.0	102.0
201601	3436	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I did answer their question on that.	23.0	102.0
201601	3437	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thanks.	23.0	102.0
201601	3438	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201601	3439	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23.0	65.0
201601	3440	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201601	3441	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B as written.	23.0	96.0
201601	3442	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I do think we face a tricky communications problem at this meeting.	23.0	96.0
201601	3443	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	As I see it, we have four objectives.	23.0	96.0
201601	3444	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	First, we want to keep our options open in terms of what we do at the March meeting.	23.0	96.0
201601	3445	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, we want to acknowledge the ongoing international financial market developments because they are noteworthy and do, if sustained, have significant implications for the economic outlook and monetary policy.	23.0	96.0
201601	3446	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Third, we don’t want to show so much concern about the outlook that we exacerbate market participants’ fears about the global outlook, making the bad outcome more likely.	23.0	96.0
201601	3447	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Language that showed great anxiety on our part might make households and businesses more skittish.	23.0	96.0
201601	3448	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Fourth, we don’t want to create an impression that monetary policy will necessarily respond to short-term movements in financial asset prices.	23.0	96.0
201601	3449	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In other words, there’s no “Fed put.”	23.0	96.0
201601	3450	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	At the same time, financial conditions do matter because they do affect the outlook for economic growth and inflation.	23.0	96.0
201601	3451	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	My own view is that the risks to the outlook may have tilted slightly to the downside, but I think you can make the case that it is premature to reach that conclusion.	23.0	96.0
201601	3452	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We just don’t know whether the tightening of financial market conditions will be sustained and what the effect will be on the economy’s performance.	23.0	96.0
201601	3453	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	To me, the alternative B formulation says that we’re mulling it over and we haven’t reached a firm conclusion yet.	23.0	96.0
201601	3454	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	March is still open as to whether we will or won’t raise the federal funds rate target.	23.0	96.0
201601	3455	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It depends on the data, broadly defined.	23.0	96.0
201601	3456	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And when I say “broadly defined,”	23.0	96.0
201601	3457	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I mean that it includes global and financial market developments.	23.0	96.0
201601	3458	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think alternative B strikes the right balance.	23.0	96.0
201601	3459	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, I think the March meeting is going to be very consequential.	23.0	96.0
201601	3460	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If we do tighten, it will tend to crystalize the idea that we’re doing four rate hikes this year, and it may contradict our saying we’re data dependent.	23.0	96.0
201601	3461	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	People may start to say, “Oh, they’re on a mechanical path of every quarter.”	23.0	96.0
201601	3462	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Sitting here, not knowing where we’re going to be in March, I guess my inclination is that the bar to tightening in March is a little high.	23.0	96.0
201601	3463	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I need to see a positive reason to tighten in March, as opposed to a strong reason not to tighten in March.	23.0	96.0
201601	3464	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So the bar there is a little higher than it was before, because it will be quite consequential in terms of how markets would react to a March tightening.	23.0	96.0
201601	3465	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201601	3466	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201601	3467	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, I think we’ve had a good round of discussion.	23.0	65.0
201601	3468	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201601	3469	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, Thomas.	23.0	65.0
201601	3470	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Excuse me.	23.0	999.0
201601	3471	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	President George brought to my attention that, unfortunately, there is a tiny typo in alternative B.	23.0	999.0
201601	3472	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	In particular, in paragraph 2, the second line, if you’ll squint, you’ll see that the “s” in the word “adjustments” is struck.	23.0	999.0
201601	3473	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I believe that is not intended.	23.0	999.0
201601	3474	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	So it should stay plural—“with gradual adjustments,” as opposed to “with gradual adjustment.”	23.0	999.0
201601	3475	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I apologize for that mistake.	23.0	999.0
201601	3476	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23.0	65.0
201601	3477	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I hope, without objection, we can accept that change.	23.0	65.0
201601	3478	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Clearly, President George doesn’t have President Williams’s eye problems.	23.0	97.0
201601	3479	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	23.0	97.0
201601	3480	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Keen eye.	23.0	65.0
201601	3481	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you for catching that.	23.0	65.0
201601	3482	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’ve had a very good discussion, and all of us recognize that threading that needle today is difficult.	23.0	65.0
201601	3483	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	The outside commentary, I think, indicates they think we have a hard problem, and, although there are some qualms about the language in alternative B, I think I’ve heard broad-based support around the table for alternative B as written.	24.0	65.0
201601	3484	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So I would like to ask Brian to get us ready for the vote.	24.0	65.0
201601	3485	2016-01-27	meeting	MADIGAN	Okay.	24.0	999.0
201601	3486	2016-01-27	meeting	MADIGAN	This vote will be on the statement for alternative B that appears on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas’s briefing materials, with the correction of the typo that was just noted.	24.0	999.0
201601	3487	2016-01-27	meeting	MADIGAN	It will also be on the directive to the Desk as it appears in the implementation note on pages 10 and 11 of those briefing materials.	24.0	999.0
201601	3488	2016-01-27	meeting	MADIGAN	Chair Yellen  Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Brainard  Yes President Bullard Yes Governor Fischer Yes President George Yes President Mester  Yes Governor Powell  Yes President Rosengren Yes Governor Tarullo  Yes .	24.0	999.0
201601	3489	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Very good.	24.0	65.0
201601	3490	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And I would note that, unlike at our December meeting, there’s no need for the Board to vote on actions pertaining to interest on excess reserves or the discount rate, as we’re leaving those unchanged.	24.0	65.0
201601	3491	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s see.	24.0	65.0
201601	3492	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think at this point, we’re going to have a further discussion on fan charts.	52.0	65.0
201601	3493	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But I think we could take a break for coffee for 20 minutes and reward ourselves for all that we have accomplished.	52.0	65.0
201601	3494	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	52.0	65.0
201601	3496	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	52.0	65.0
201601	3497	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks, everybody.	52.0	65.0
201601	3498	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	There’s one last item on the agenda, and that pertains to the possibility of adding fan charts to the Summary of Economic Projections.	95.0	65.0
201601	3499	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me start off by again thanking the subcommittee on communications and the staff who worked with the subcommittee  We have had a number of discussions over the years about fan charts, and I’m pleased that the subcommittee has put forward what I think is a sensible proposal for moving forward.	95.0	65.0
201601	3500	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me turn it over to Stan to begin our discussion.	95.0	65.0
201601	3501	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	108.0
201601	3502	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The subcommittee on communications indicated last summer that we’d come back to this Committee with a proposal for the use of fan charts in the SEP after doing some work with the staff on possible approaches to the construction of the fan charts.	95.0	108.0
201601	3503	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’ve examined a number of options, and our memo to the Committee on January 11 provided a specific proposal for simple fan charts.	95.0	108.0
201601	3504	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We do not claim that these fan charts are a critical advance, but we do think they offer a real improvement in our communications.	95.0	108.0
201601	3505	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Todd Clark from Cleveland is going to provide the specifics of the proposal, but, before that, let me make a couple of points.	95.0	108.0
201601	3506	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	First, in past Committee discussions of fan charts, there’s been a fair amount of support for the idea that they would be a useful addition to our communications.	95.0	108.0
201601	3507	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	They’d help to communicate that our projections are subject to considerable uncertainty and so help make it clear that policy will depend on incoming data and their implications for the economic outlook.	95.0	108.0
201601	3508	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	In addition, a comparison of the fan charts with the existing SEP chart showing the range of participants’ projections will help make it clear to the public that the differences in view across participants regarding the economic outlook are not that large relative to the uncertainty regarding the projections—information that should avoid the sense, which may arise from time to time, that Committee participants are in sharp disagreement.	95.0	108.0
201601	3509	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Second, in past discussions, a fair number of you have indicated either that you are not confident that the fan charts will be understood by the public or that you would prefer more sophisticated fan charts that could convey a more complex message to the public.	95.0	108.0
201601	3510	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, these two sets of concerns point in opposite directions, of course, and our proposal is a compromise— that is to say, the more complicated it is, the less likely it is to be understood by the public, and you have to get somewhere on that spectrum.	95.0	108.0
201601	3511	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	For those of you who are concerned that fan charts will not be well understood, we’ve aimed to keep the fan charts simple and based them on information that is, for the most part, already included in the SEP and so more likely to be comprehensible to the public.	95.0	108.0
201601	3512	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’d note that a table in the staff memos that you received showed that many advanced-economy central banks use fan charts, suggesting by revealed preference that they view them as a useful communication tool, which is something my conversations with foreign central bankers have confirmed.	95.0	108.0
201601	3513	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	For those of you who’d like a more sophisticated approach, I’d urge you to take this first step.	95.0	108.0
201601	3514	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	At least for now, let’s keep the fan charts simple so that we’re confident that we can successfully explain them to the public.	95.0	108.0
201601	3515	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Simple fan charts like those we’ve proposed are also low cost, which improves the cost-benefit calculation.	95.0	108.0
201601	3516	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Among those costs is how much work the person looking at them has to do to understand them.	95.0	108.0
201601	3517	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And, like all parts of our communications apparatus, they can be enhanced over time.	95.0	108.0
201601	3518	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Indeed, the experience of the Bank of England, which has produced increasingly sophisticated fan charts, shows how such an incremental approach can work to deliver more informative fan charts over time.	95.0	108.0
201601	3519	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	In short, we should not let the best be the enemy of the good—our motto for the day.	95.0	108.0
201601	3520	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	95.0	108.0
201601	3521	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Let me summarize by saying I was aware yesterday that I thanked the members of the subcommittee for all of the work they had done.	95.0	108.0
201601	3522	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I also need to thank the staff associated with the subcommittee—which includes Todd, Bill English, Glenn Rudebusch, Stacey Tevlin, Ellen Meade, and probably others I’ve omitted—for the hard work they have done with regard to both the consensus statement and this work on fan charts.	95.0	108.0
201601	3523	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Todd, would you please take over and provide the details?	95.0	108.0
201601	3524	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	95.0	108.0
201601	3525	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Thank you, Governor Fischer.	95.0	999.0
201601	3526	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	I’ll be referring to the handout titled “Material for Briefing on Proposal for Fan Charts in the Summary of Economic Projections.”	95.0	999.0
201601	3527	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	In broad terms, the addition of fan charts to the SEP would offer several benefits.	95.0	999.0
201601	3528	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	First, compared with the SEP’s current table 2, fan charts would more prominently— and therefore more effectively—communicate the broad magnitude of the uncertainty associated with participants’ projections.	95.0	999.0
201601	3529	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Second, fan charts would clearly communicate that the differences in the forecasts of participants are modest compared with the uncertainty surrounding the outlook.	95.0	999.0
201601	3530	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Finally, a fan chart for the federal funds rate would help market participants understand that the SEP numbers for the funds rate in no way reflect a commitment to a particular path, and that the actual path of appropriate policy will depend on economic developments.	95.0	999.0
201601	3531	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	In light of these potential benefits, the staff has worked with the subcommittee on communications to examine a range of approaches to including fan charts in the SEP.	95.0	999.0
201601	3532	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	On the basis of this examination and in consultation with the Chair, the subcommittee recommends that the Committee adopt, as Governor Fischer described, a relatively simple approach, one similar to those employed by a number of foreign central banks.	95.0	999.0
201601	3533	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	I’ll first review the proposal and then describe some of the alternative approaches that the subcommittee has considered.	95.0	999.0
201601	3534	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	The proposed charts, provided in exhibit 1 of the handout, show median SEP forecasts surrounded by symmetric confidence intervals based on the historical root mean squared errors of private- and public-sector forecasts.	95.0	999.0
201601	3535	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	The underlying root mean squared errors used to construct this chart are taken from the SEP’s current table 2, extended to include the federal funds rate.	95.0	999.0
201601	3536	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	The fan charts deliberately show only 70 percent confidence bands, which suffice to communicate the uncertainty associated with the SEP.	95.0	999.0
201601	3537	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Although the root mean squared errors could be used to form and report 90 percent confidence bands, the historical forecast errors provide relatively few observations of tail occurrences, and the normality of the forecast errors that’s required under a root-mean-squared-error-based approach could be an approximation that’s much less accurate with a 90 percent confidence interval than with a 70 percent interval.	95.0	999.0
201601	3538	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	This proposed approach offers simplicity along several dimensions:  The charts would be straightforward to construct from information already available and, for the most part, already used in the SEP; they would not require any additional information from FOMC participants; and they should be relatively easy to explain.	95.0	999.0
201601	3539	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	That said, the root-mean-squared-error-based approach raises several issues of implementation.	95.0	999.0
201601	3540	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	These issues were all discussed in the staff memo distributed to the Committee on January 11, but, in the interest of brevity, I’ll focus on two of them today.	95.0	999.0
201601	3541	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	First, the two components of the fan charts—median projections from the SEP and confidence intervals based on root mean squared errors from past forecasts—are conceptually different.	95.0	999.0
201601	3542	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	The SEP numbers reflect each participant’s assessment of appropriate policy, not the modal path of policy as in the case of some of the forecasts that are used to calculate the root mean squared errors.	95.0	999.0
201601	3543	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	All of that said, the SEP medians are, in most circumstances, generally close to most participants’ expectations for the economy and the path of policy, and therefore the root mean squared errors underlying table 2 and the fan charts, while not strictly comparable, should provide a reasonable, approximate measure of the uncertainty associated with the median projections.	95.0	999.0
201601	3544	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	A second implementation issue is that, in past discussions of fan charts, some Committee participants have expressed misgivings about providing a fan chart for the federal funds rate.	95.0	999.0
201601	3545	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	A funds rate fan chart could blur the distinction between views regarding appropriate policy and modal projections of the funds rate.	95.0	999.0
201601	3546	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Not providing a fan chart for the funds rate could help maintain that distinction.	95.0	999.0
201601	3547	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	On the other hand, omitting a funds rate fan chart might increase the risk that some members of the public mistakenly view the projected path of the funds rate as a commitment.	95.0	999.0
201601	3548	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	For this reason, other participants have at times suggested that a fan chart for the funds rate would be particularly useful because it would help communicate that the appropriate policy rate path is quite uncertain and dependent on economic developments.	95.0	999.0
201601	3549	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	In the subcommittee’s assessment of the merits of a fan chart covering the funds rate, these advantages are viewed as outweighing the concerns.	95.0	999.0
201601	3550	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	As part of the analysis that led to this recommendation of the simple approach that I’ve outlined, the subcommittee considered several other possible approaches to constructing the fan charts.	95.0	999.0
201601	3551	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	I’ll briefly describe these possible approaches, their potential advantages, and the subcommittee’s reasons for judging these approaches to be less desirable than the proposed approach, at least for now.	95.0	999.0
201601	3552	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Under the first alternative, confidence intervals surrounding the SEP medians could be constructed using the actual historical distributions of forecast errors—and by that I mean the percentiles of the forecast errors—instead of root mean squared errors.	95.0	999.0
201601	3553	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	This alternative approach would not require the assumptions of symmetry or normality that implicitly underlie the root-mean-squared-error-based approach.	95.0	999.0
201601	3554	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Confidence intervals based on the historical distributions of forecast errors could also be useful for capturing possible asymmetries in the forecast errors for the unemployment rate and the federal funds rate.	95.0	999.0
201601	3555	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	But fan charts based on the historical distributions of errors could be somewhat more difficult to explain to the public than fan charts based on just root mean squared errors.	95.0	999.0
201601	3556	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	And, perhaps more important, the available data for quantifying the asymmetries from historical forecast errors may not be enough for the SEP fan charts to reliably represent these relevant asymmetries.	95.0	999.0
201601	3557	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Second, the fan charts could be based on forecast confidence intervals constructed from simulations of an econometric model or models.	95.0	999.0
201601	3558	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	The model-based approach could be attractive for its structural approach to quantifying forecast uncertainty and for allowing these simulations to capture asymmetries due to the effective lower bound on interest rates.	95.0	999.0
201601	3559	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	But against these advantages, the model-based approach could be seen as difficult to explain to the public.	95.0	999.0
201601	3560	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Perhaps more important, this approach would make the fan charts model dependent, and it would require agreement on a model or models, including a policy rule or rules.	95.0	999.0
201601	3561	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	The Committee’s past experiments with constructing a consensus forecast suggest participants may find it difficult to agree on a model and policy rule that could be used to construct such fan charts.	95.0	999.0
201601	3562	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Finally, fan charts could be constructed from participants’ subjective assessments of the uncertainty and risks associated with their projections.	95.0	999.0
201601	3563	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	A subjective approach could ensure that the fan charts capture the judgments of uncertainty and risks that contributed to the Committee’s policy decision at the meeting.	95.0	999.0
201601	3564	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	A subjective approach might also allow the confidence intervals to reflect assessments of appropriate policy rather than simply capture past forecast errors.	95.0	999.0
201601	3565	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Notwithstanding these possible advantages, a subjective approach could present a number of difficulties.	95.0	999.0
201601	3566	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Most importantly, a number of participants would likely find the reporting requirements to be onerous, and some may be concerned about the reliability of any effort to translate subjective judgments of uncertainty and risks into quantitative measures.	95.0	999.0
201601	3567	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Finally, depending on implementation, fan charts based on subjective assessments could be difficult to explain to the public.	95.0	999.0
201601	3568	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	The subcommittee came to these conclusions in part on the basis of an evaluation of an approach sketched by the staff that involved giving SEP respondents the choice of either submitting their own numerical values for confidence intervals or allowing the staff to quantify confidence intervals implied by the historical root mean squared errors and answers to the existing questions about uncertainty and risks.	95.0	999.0
201601	3569	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Although each of these alternative approaches offers some advantages, after careful consideration, the subcommittee concluded that the relatively simple approach to fan charts based on the SEP medians and historical root mean squared errors was the most effective and would constitute a useful addition to Committee communications.	95.0	999.0
201601	3570	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	If there was support for this approach, the subcommittee would plan to introduce the fan charts in the March SEP.	95.0	999.0
201601	3571	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	That concludes my prepared remarks, and I’d be happy to answer any questions you might have.	95.0	999.0
201601	3572	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, Todd.	95.0	65.0
201601	3573	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I’m going to open it up for questions and comments.	95.0	65.0
201601	3574	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But before I do so, I’d like to note my own personal view, which is that the addition of the proposed fan charts to the SEP would serve as a useful enhancement to our communications tools.	95.0	65.0
201601	3575	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	For example, as you know, the number of increases in the federal funds rate during this year as embodied in the median SEP forecast has received quite a bit of attention of late, and discussions along those lines, I think, tend to reinforce the unhelpful and inaccurate view that we’ve embarked on a steady path of rate increases with little regard for how the economy will evolve.	95.0	65.0
201601	3576	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	In that sense, the fan charts would be useful in helping us communicate the uncertainty that’s associated with both our economic forecasts and the path for policy.	95.0	65.0
201601	3577	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And I wanted to note that if this change is adopted today, I would plan to feature these fan charts in my press conference.	95.0	65.0
201601	3578	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	With that comment, let me stop there, and the floor is open for questions for Todd.	95.0	65.0
201601	3579	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	95.0	65.0
201601	3580	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	88.0
201601	3581	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Your comment on press conferences adjusts my question a little bit.	95.0	88.0
201601	3582	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We use the word “public,” but I can’t remember any of my public ever asking me about the SEPs per se.	95.0	88.0
201601	3583	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Do we have any “click on” data as to how many people actually read the SEPs and therefore would see these fan charts?	95.0	88.0
201601	3584	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Do we track that?	95.0	999.0
201601	3585	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	I don’t know if we track that.	95.0	999.0
201601	3586	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I don’t know that we track it.	95.0	65.0
201601	3587	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In some of the Reserve Banks, we track what happens on our website.	95.0	88.0
201601	3588	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m sure we must be doing something like that here.	95.0	88.0
201601	3589	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Do we know how many people actually ever read this stuff?	95.0	88.0
201601	3590	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Of course, one purpose would be to use them at the press conference, so it wouldn’t just be through the website.	95.0	999.0
201601	3591	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Yes, and I acknowledge that.	95.0	88.0
201601	3592	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	That’s why I mentioned it because, as you propose this, we’re talking about one additional figure that would be buried deep in the SEP.	95.0	65.0
201601	3593	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Right.	95.0	999.0
201601	3594	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	It would appear in the “Uncertainty and Risks” section.	95.0	999.0
201601	3595	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	It would be figure 4, following the first figure, which presents the median and the range of views; figure 2, on the funds rate; and figure 3, showing the histogram.	95.0	999.0
201601	3596	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Figure 4 would be covered in the section on uncertainty and risks.	95.0	999.0
201601	3597	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Right.	95.0	65.0
201601	3598	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	That’s why I thought I would mention that if this change is adopted, we would modify the figure that I distribute at the press conference, which does get a lot of immediate attention.	95.0	65.0
201601	3599	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	At present, it shows the median, the range, and the central tendency.	95.0	65.0
201601	3600	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We would include the fan charts in there.	95.0	65.0
201601	3601	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I think that’s quite relevant.	95.0	88.0
201601	3602	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	That’s pushing information out.	95.0	88.0
201601	3603	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	This contrasts with just posting it and having someone click on it and read it.	95.0	88.0
201601	3604	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	But my question preceded your comment, really, in thinking about it.	95.0	88.0
201601	3605	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Do we know who the public is for this?	95.0	88.0
201601	3606	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Certainly, people in markets look at this incredibly closely.	95.0	999.0
201601	3607	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	That’s one version of the public.	95.0	999.0
201601	3608	2016-01-27	meeting	SMITH	And the media.	95.0	999.0
201601	3609	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Are you asking whether you can measure whether someone clicks on a figure?	95.0	91.0
201601	3610	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Because the SEPs are in the minutes, right?	95.0	91.0
201601	3611	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	95.0	65.0
201601	3612	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Well, the minutes get downloaded all of the time.	95.0	91.0
201601	3613	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Could you separate SEP views from the minutes generally?	95.0	91.0
201601	3614	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thomas.	95.0	65.0
201601	3615	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The projection materials are, of course, published at the time of the press conference.	95.0	999.0
201601	3616	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	So for three weeks, the public will pick up, in particular, the dot plot from that place.	95.0	999.0
201601	3617	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	That’s where you’d find it.	95.0	999.0
201601	3618	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I get questions at every speech about the SEPs because I regularly try to inform people about the dot plot, just to share different perspectives.	95.0	91.0
201601	3619	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	I don’t know about downloads, but in some of the public commentary, from the financial press and the economists, there is a tendency to focus on the range of views and confuse that with uncertainty.	95.0	999.0
201601	3620	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	To the extent that people pay attention to the fan charts, they would help clarify that this is the uncertainty—what you’re looking at is the range of views, and, in most cases, the disagreement in views is fairly small in relation to the uncertainty.	95.0	999.0
201601	3621	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I’ll hold the reason why I’m asking until my comments in the go- round.	95.0	88.0
201601	3622	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Sure.	95.0	65.0
201601	3623	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there other questions for Todd before we go to comments?	95.0	65.0
201601	3624	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	95.0	65.0
201601	3625	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Then let’s go to comments and start with President Mester.	95.0	65.0
201601	3626	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	999.0
201601	3627	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	First, I want to thank Todd Clark, Bill English, and the rest of the staff supporting the communications subcommittee for their work on this topic.	95.0	999.0
201601	3628	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In some sense, the simple approach to fan charts being proposed belies the great deal of effort and analysis that went into coming up with the proposal.	95.0	999.0
201601	3629	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I’m going to tip my hand:  I personally see a lot of value in the SEPs, and I think adding the fan charts will be a very useful enhancement.	95.0	999.0
201601	3630	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	We are somewhat behind other central banks.	95.0	999.0
201601	3631	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Most of them publish some type of fan chart.	95.0	999.0
201601	3632	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	And, in the interest of transparency, I think the FOMC should convey to the public that there’s considerable uncertainty associated with our projections, just as it is true that there’s considerable uncertainty associated with private-sector and other central bank forecasts.	95.0	999.0
201601	3633	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	To me, we’re living in uncertain times.	95.0	999.0
201601	3634	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	It seems like an important omission in the SEP not to include something about the uncertainty in an accessible way.	95.0	999.0
201601	3635	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	It would help the public avoid confusing dispersion in the SEP forecasts with the uncertainty surrounding the outlook.	95.0	999.0
201601	3636	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Sometimes when I go out and talk, I know even I point to dispersion as a proxy for uncertainty, and it’s because we have little else to point to in the SEP.	95.0	999.0
201601	3637	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	But, of course, this is misleading because, as Todd and Governor Fischer pointed out, the dispersion is actually pretty modest compared with the uncertainty associated with the projections.	95.0	999.0
201601	3638	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	A subtler benefit, which was noted by Governor Fischer, is that, over discussions even in the Committee, one of the criticisms of the SEP in the past has been that it tends to emphasize the differences across participants rather than convey a sense of the consensus view.	95.0	999.0
201601	3639	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	If we show the relatively wide uncertainty bands, I think it will help put the dispersion into better context.	95.0	999.0
201601	3640	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Since last summer, the subcommittee and the staff have evaluated a number of approaches to fan charts.	95.0	999.0
201601	3641	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Some of them were suggested to us by FOMC participants, and these included the subjective approach that Todd mentioned.	95.0	999.0
201601	3642	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Going in, I had some sympathy for the subjective approach.	95.0	999.0
201601	3643	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	But as we worked through it, I became convinced that, at this time, the simple approach would be preferable.	95.0	999.0
201601	3644	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	We considered a number of different ways of thinking about the subjective approach, which would involve either participants providing their own confidence bands or, for participants who would feel uncomfortable doing that, having the staff map their qualitative assessments of risks and uncertainties that are already in the SEP into confidence bands using historical root mean squared errors.	95.0	999.0
201601	3645	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	But, in the end, we concluded that this would be somewhat complicated to explain to the public.	95.0	999.0
201601	3646	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	And if most responses ended up being based on historical root mean squared errors anyway, then the resulting fan charts would look very similar to the simple ones in the proposal.	95.0	999.0
201601	3647	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Going in—I’m coming clean here—I had some concerns about providing an error band surrounding the funds rate projection, because it would further blur the distinction that the funds rate projection is an assessment of appropriate policy and not a forecast.	95.0	999.0
201601	3648	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	On the other hand, the fan chart would be a very simple way to convey the message that there’s uncertainty associated with the appropriate policy rate path because the outlook is uncertain, and that the policy rate path in the SEP is not a commitment because it’s appropriate for policy to respond to shocks that materially change the outlook.	95.0	999.0
201601	3649	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	So I became convinced that the benefit of providing the confidence band surrounding that funds rate projection was real.	95.0	999.0
201601	3650	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I also became convinced that we could handle, with appropriate wording in the exhibit and in the SEP text, the conceptual issue of the SEP reporting the appropriate, not necessarily the expected, policy rate path.	95.0	999.0
201601	3651	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Finally, no feasible approach to fan charts is perfect.	95.0	999.0
201601	3652	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I think we have to keep in mind that the goal of this project is to better communicate with the public.	95.0	999.0
201601	3653	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Currently, the SEP might be leading the public to underestimate both the degree of uncertainty associated with our projections and the data dependence of our policy rate path.	95.0	999.0
201601	3654	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The proposed approach, while imperfect, would alleviate these problems in a way that would be simple to implement and simple to explain.	95.0	999.0
201601	3655	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I support the proposal to add these fan charts to our next SEP submission in March, and I hope others on the Committee will, too.	95.0	999.0
201601	3656	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	999.0
201601	3657	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	95.0	65.0
201601	3658	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	95.0	65.0
201601	3659	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	88.0
201601	3660	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I know that a lot of work has preceded this recommendation, so thanks to Todd Clark, Bill English, and others, as well as the subcommittee for your good efforts.	95.0	88.0
201601	3661	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I realize that this is not a highly ambitious proposal.	95.0	88.0
201601	3662	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In my mind, it’s one to use pictures to make an already made and simple point to an audience that largely already knows it.	95.0	88.0
201601	3663	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I recently read the claim that more than half of brain activity is processing the visual, so maybe that’s just the reason to go ahead and do this.	95.0	88.0
201601	3664	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Nonetheless, I remain a bit of a skeptic of this communication tool, and let me explain why.	95.0	88.0
201601	3665	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I don’t see how presenting historical error bands derived from both internal and outside forecasts associated with our SEP medians provides useful additional information to our policy communication.	95.0	88.0
201601	3666	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The message that there is substantial inherent uncertainty associated with our forecast is already conveyed in the minutes.	95.0	88.0
201601	3667	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In a world where every FOMC move is scrutinized for profound meaning, there is some risk that the historical forecast accuracy bands will be construed as reflecting how the Committee is viewing the risks to the outlook as of the SEP publication.	95.0	88.0
201601	3668	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	And this, of course, isn’t the case.	95.0	88.0
201601	3669	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	As proposed, the error bands will likely show a nonnegligible chance that the economy will be near or in recession within the time frame of the forecast period.	95.0	88.0
201601	3670	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The error bands will always show a significant chance that inflation will persistently deviate from our 2 percent objective.	95.0	88.0
201601	3671	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	This could be interpreted as weak commitment to achieving our inflation target.	95.0	88.0
201601	3672	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	If economic growth or inflation was to seem to be on a path that is materially off the median projection path, we know that such a deviation would likely trigger a mitigating policy response.	95.0	88.0
201601	3673	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Now, I acknowledge that many of these concerns about interpretation of the error bands are treated in the proposed appendix.	95.0	88.0
201601	3674	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	A careful reading of the appendix should clarify what the fan charts say and what they don’t say.	95.0	88.0
201601	3675	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	But I’m not sure we should expect a careful reading of the appendix to inform the less familiar reader of the SEP, and the reader who understands the fan charts at first glance already knows what we’re trying to convey.	95.0	88.0
201601	3676	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	So I’m not sure I see how emphasizing the inherent uncertainty of economic forecasts, which is a very broad assertion, serves a clear purpose in our communications design.	95.0	88.0
201601	3677	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	It seems like a lot of effort to dissuade people from attaching any significance to our forecast.	95.0	88.0
201601	3678	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	As I said, I know the addition of the fan charts is not intended or expected to be a major communications move, but I’m not sure I see the payoff as greater than the problems that might be caused.	95.0	88.0
201601	3679	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	88.0
201601	3680	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	95.0	65.0
201601	3681	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	95.0	65.0
201601	3682	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair, and thanks to Todd, Bill, and others for all of the work that went into this.	95.0	107.0
201601	3683	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I’m also not enormously supportive of this proposal, although I do have sympathy with the underlying spirit of the proposal, which is to remind the public that any forecast is subject to very large uncertainty bands.	95.0	107.0
201601	3684	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	But I believe the text that accompanies the SEP already does that.	95.0	107.0
201601	3685	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s worth noting that people have made a lot of references to other central banks.	95.0	107.0
201601	3686	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The other central banks that do present fan charts when they display their forecasts are generally using either consensus forecasts or staff forecasts.	95.0	107.0
201601	3687	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	They’re actual forecasts.	95.0	107.0
201601	3688	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The SEP is quite different; it, obviously, is not a forecast.	95.0	107.0
201601	3689	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s a scatterplot of individual member projections.	95.0	107.0
201601	3690	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The median isn’t comparable to a consensus forecast.	95.0	107.0
201601	3691	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I think there is important information content in seeing the range of differences among Committee participants and the median.	95.0	107.0
201601	3692	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And most of the people who care deeply about the SEP put a lot of time and resources into understanding the nature of the information that’s being provided.	95.0	107.0
201601	3693	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	By contrast, as I think was said previously, it’s not obvious what additional information content superimposing errors from other forecasts provides.	95.0	107.0
201601	3694	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The discomfort is particularly acute with regard to the projected path of the policy rate, due both to the asymmetry associated with the effective lower bound and to the fact that this is a policy instrument over which the Committee has some control rather than an exogenous economic variable.	95.0	107.0
201601	3695	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	But I also have concerns even on some of the economic variables.	95.0	107.0
201601	3696	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	For instance, if I think about inflation right now and I just read some of the text in the most recent SEP surrounding members’ views about the distribution of uncertainty, I think it would be skewed to the downside, whereas these bands, as I understand it, would be, by construction, symmetric.	95.0	107.0
201601	3697	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Again, I do see the value of the underlying desire here to remind everybody how much uncertainty there is regarding our projections.	95.0	107.0
201601	3698	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Perhaps we should spend a bit of time on subjective probabilities.	95.0	107.0
201601	3699	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It does sound like a lot of work, but maybe before going in this direction, we should at least see further work on what that would look like, because it might be a better representation of additional information to provide to the public.	95.0	107.0
201601	3700	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	95.0	107.0
201601	3701	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	95.0	65.0
201601	3702	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	95.0	65.0
201601	3703	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	94.0
201601	3704	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	First of all, I also appreciate the work of the communications subcommittee and the staff on this subject, which I think is a complicated subject for the Committee.	95.0	94.0
201601	3705	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I do support the proposal as laid out by the communications subcommittee.	95.0	94.0
201601	3706	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I consider it very important to represent uncertainty when we’re communicating to the public.	95.0	94.0
201601	3707	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with President Lockhart that maybe a picture is worth a thousand words.	95.0	94.0
201601	3708	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’m uncomfortable with either the staff here at this meeting or us communicating anything to the public without putting something around the median projection that shows the amount of uncertainty, because, in general, the public tends to underappreciate the amount of uncertainty associated with economic outlooks.	95.0	94.0
201601	3709	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	You can say in words that, okay, this is very uncertain.	95.0	94.0
201601	3710	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	They might add ½ percent and subtract ½ percent when they should be adding 6 percent and subtracting 6 percent.	95.0	94.0
201601	3711	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So I think it’s very important to make moves in this direction.	95.0	94.0
201601	3712	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Now, I understand that any construction of uncertainty bands will have some inconsistencies.	95.0	94.0
201601	3713	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think the subcommittee has taken an expedient approach here to get a first pass.	95.0	94.0
201601	3714	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	We could do more later, depending on our experience with it if we use it at the March meeting.	95.0	94.0
201601	3715	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee has done a good job of making the tradeoffs and thinking carefully about this.	95.0	94.0
201601	3716	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I do think it gets us closer to meeting an international standard on this dimension.	95.0	94.0
201601	3717	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I agree that we don’t have a consensus forecast.	95.0	94.0
201601	3718	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I would like to work toward that.	95.0	94.0
201601	3719	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’ve proposed that in the past for this Committee.	95.0	94.0
201601	3720	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I understand that it’s a hard thing for us to do, but that shouldn’t preclude us from trying to represent the uncertainty about our projections.	95.0	94.0
201601	3721	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So I think it’s an improvement.	95.0	94.0
201601	3722	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I also agree with Governor Brainard that maybe we should look at the possibility of a subjective probability in the future.	95.0	94.0
201601	3723	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’m not sure everyone will like it, because you do have to answer questions about upper and lower bounds and about what you think can happen.	95.0	94.0
201601	3724	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	That’s not the easiest thing to do, and it would make more work for all of us and all of our staffs.	95.0	94.0
201601	3725	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	But maybe that would be a truer representation within the SEP context of the uncertainty that’s surrounding those kinds of projections.	95.0	94.0
201601	3726	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	With that, I do support the proposal.	95.0	94.0
201601	3727	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	94.0
201601	3728	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	95.0	65.0
201601	3729	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	95.0	65.0
201601	3730	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	91.0
201601	3731	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I started off thinking I don’t have a strong opinion about the inclusion of fan charts in the SEP.	95.0	91.0
201601	3732	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I guess the idea that they don’t do any harm would make them sort of okay.	95.0	91.0
201601	3733	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I have to admit that Governor Brainard’s comments about the symmetry of the bands surrounding the projection is something I need to think carefully about.	95.0	91.0
201601	3734	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	If that were to get in the way of our commentary about how we see the balance of risks as skewed in one direction and if, all of a sudden, people get confused about our comments about the balance of risks compared with this fan chart, the visual, that would be a concern.	95.0	91.0
201601	3735	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I tended to think, coming in, that for the knowledgeable reader, the fan charts are a reasonable way of illustrating the uncertainties already presented in table 2 of the SEP, in which we give error bands.	95.0	91.0
201601	3736	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	And I agree with the recommendation to construct them using the median projections and the historical root mean squared errors for a range of public and private forecasts, as we already do in table 2.	95.0	91.0
201601	3737	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Simple is best.	95.0	91.0
201601	3738	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I certainly take that point.	95.0	91.0
201601	3739	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	But the thing that does make me nervous is a technical point.	95.0	91.0
201601	3740	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	There’s a difference between reporting error bands in the table and putting it in a chart where we’re giving a composite hypothesis–type of projection, and I think that can be misleading.	95.0	91.0
201601	3741	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I have concerns that less knowledgeable readers may view any outcome that falls within the fan as being equally likely.	95.0	91.0
201601	3742	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Now, I expressed that to my staff, and they made fun of me because any line is zero probability.	95.0	91.0
201601	3743	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	They’re all sort of the same.	95.0	91.0
201601	3744	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	But if you tried to construct some composite hypothesis and do some counting, the ones closest to the median would be higher likelihood than the ones farther apart.	95.0	91.0
201601	3745	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	But you look at the fan, and it seems as though they both had that interpretation.	95.0	91.0
201601	3746	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I would support conveying in some way that outcomes closer to the median are more likely than those toward the edges of the fan.	95.0	91.0
201601	3747	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	To the knowledgeable readers, that sounds silly, but to the ones whom I’m worried about, maybe not.	95.0	91.0
201601	3748	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	One way would be to note this in the explanatory text.	95.0	91.0
201601	3749	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Another way would be to show multiple probability bands, as some other central banks do, using the same methods that you do.	95.0	91.0
201601	3750	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I think this is manageable without any added work.	95.0	91.0
201601	3751	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	It would just be shading a little bit differently, with exactly the same calculations but 30 percent—whatever the choices would be.	95.0	91.0
201601	3752	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Maybe that would help.	95.0	91.0
201601	3753	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Given our expected knowledgeable readership for this communications vehicle, I’m reasonably fine with the proposal, although, as I say, Governor Brainard’s comments about the risk assessment—or my interpretation of them—do make me a little nervous.	95.0	91.0
201601	3754	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	95.0	91.0
201601	3755	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	95.0	65.0
201601	3756	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	95.0	111.0
201601	3757	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I support the proposed changes.	95.0	111.0
201601	3758	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And I’ll just observe that, in my first meeting, I’m getting a sense of the complexity that the subcommittee on communications is dealing with.	95.0	111.0
201601	3759	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	You ain’t seen nothing yet.	95.0	97.0
201601	3760	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	95.0	97.0
201601	3761	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	But you have my great admiration, for, as you all are trying to balance the various tradeoffs, there are no easy answers.	95.0	111.0
201601	3762	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I’ll just offer my observation with humility because I’m sure you’ve thought about these things before.	95.0	111.0
201601	3763	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The only concern I have is that I can envision a time when we may want to use forward policy guidance and we do not want to show such wide ranges on the expected outlook for the federal funds rate, and this could then be constraining in such a scenario.	95.0	111.0
201601	3764	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So I like Stan’s suggestion to start simple and maybe add complexity over time.	95.0	111.0
201601	3765	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And if there was a way to embody the Committee’s actual outlook of uncertainty, that may be helpful so that we’re not constraining ourselves in the future.	95.0	111.0
201601	3766	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	95.0	65.0
201601	3767	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	95.0	65.0
201601	3768	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	104.0
201601	3769	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I would like to add my support for the proposal.	95.0	104.0
201601	3770	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The addition of fan charts would pictorially emphasize uncertainty regarding macroeconomic projections and hence for the path of the policy rate.	95.0	104.0
201601	3771	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	It would also show that the uncertainty associated with the forecast is much greater than the dispersion of participants’ views, which I think may be less well understood than some other things.	95.0	104.0
201601	3772	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I’m also pleased that the subcommittee has taken a minimalist approach here, keeping it simple and avoiding difficult methodological and communications issues that lurk if one tries to do too much.	95.0	104.0
201601	3773	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	So I do think that this approach is the most straightforward one to implement and the least likely to leave the public confused.	95.0	104.0
201601	3774	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	104.0
201601	3775	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	95.0	65.0
201601	3776	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	95.0	65.0
201601	3777	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	102.0
201601	3778	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I, too, support the proposal.	95.0	102.0
201601	3779	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Actually, Governor Brainard laid out the challenges on this matter that we discussed at length.	95.0	102.0
201601	3780	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	As Todd and President Mester mentioned, we went back and forth on issues related to the various approaches that we could try to get at subjective assessments of the risks, those concerning the effective lower bound, and many of the other issues that have been brought up.	95.0	102.0
201601	3781	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the end, what we’re trying to accomplish here is something very simple, at least as a first step, and that is to get the point of data dependence out there as clearly as possible.	95.0	102.0
201601	3782	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Basically, you look at the median in the SEP, and it says you raise rates n times during a certain period, and all of the attention in the media and the markets is on the number n.	95.0	102.0
201601	3783	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The idea here is to say, “Yes, we think there’s an appropriate policy rate path, but that’s going to depend on what happens with economic growth, what happens with unemployment, and what happens with inflation.”	95.0	102.0
201601	3784	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s what any good policy strategy would have, and the path of policy will depend on economic circumstances, either up or down.	95.0	102.0
201601	3785	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s really all we’re accomplishing with this proposal, in my personal view.	95.0	102.0
201601	3786	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	This issue of bringing in subjective views is really important because we do already have in the SEP a description of people’s assessment of the risks both in terms of the magnitude and in terms of the direction.	95.0	102.0
201601	3787	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Here we basically are punting on that and saying this is only describing the normal historical relationship, and the SEP would still contain the discussion of whether the current circumstances are different from the past 20 years.	95.0	102.0
201601	3788	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I think the idea of trying to collect better subjective information or something that could be quantitative about the assessment of the magnitude and the direction of the risks is an important step forward.	95.0	102.0
201601	3789	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do struggle with how to aggregate subjective views.	95.0	102.0
201601	3790	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We got to the median as a way to capture the center of the participants, but then, when you look over the history of the SEP, you’ll see that there’s a wide divergence of views about both the magnitude and the direction of the risks relative to history.	95.0	102.0
201601	3791	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s rare that we all—all 19, using David Wilcox’s number of views, or whatever number of views there are in this room—agree that the risks are to one side or the other or where they are.	95.0	102.0
201601	3792	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think how to say “Here’s a median forecast, and then here’s a median assessment of the risks” actually doesn’t work, because often it may be five or six people in the Committee who think the risks are to the downside.	95.0	102.0
201601	3793	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So the median, of course, would be neutral.	95.0	102.0
201601	3794	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We do need to think about how to capture this information more effectively, and we couldn’t figure it out, at least so far.	95.0	102.0
201601	3795	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	This baby step, if you will, is to try to have both—the historical pattern of uncertainty along with the verbal description of the risks.	95.0	102.0
201601	3796	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the end, I agree with President Bullard about the long-run goal I still hold to—maybe we’re the two left—that a consensus forecast and a way of representing the consensus views on the risks would be a great place to land at the end.	95.0	102.0
201601	3797	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I know that’s been really hard in the past.	95.0	102.0
201601	3798	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I know the staff cringes whenever I even say the term “consensus forecast.”	95.0	102.0
201601	3799	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I can see Dave Reifschneider and David Wilcox not appreciating my perspective on this, but I do think the median forecast has already helped a bit to show that this may not be a terrible representation of the center of the Committee.	95.0	102.0
201601	3800	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I think maybe further work that we do in terms of describing the uncertainty will help us down the road toward what I think is the right ultimate goal, which is to have some way of representing quantitatively the views of the Committee.	95.0	102.0
201601	3801	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, again, I support this first baby step, at least, on that longer road.	95.0	102.0
201601	3802	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	95.0	102.0
201601	3803	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	95.0	65.0
201601	3804	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	96.0
201601	3805	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I certainly see some benefit of adding fan charts to the SEP as proposed.	95.0	96.0
201601	3806	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The fan charts would emphasize that the SEP numbers just comprise a modal forecast, one of many possible outcomes.	95.0	96.0
201601	3807	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The charts would also emphasize that at longer time horizons, the level of uncertainty is very high.	95.0	96.0
201601	3808	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I am willing to go along with this proposal.	95.0	96.0
201601	3809	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, I do have some concerns that I want to share with the Committee.	95.0	96.0
201601	3810	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The first one is, because the widths of the fan charts are based on historical experience and are unconditional, they’re not really very informative.	95.0	96.0
201601	3811	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	They don’t take into consideration where you actually are on the business cycle and in terms of all of the other factors that are influencing the outcome.	95.0	96.0
201601	3812	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	They’re also going to change very slowly over time.	95.0	96.0
201601	3813	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Each quarter, you’re going to publish a fan chart that looks essentially just like the fan chart from the last quarter.	95.0	96.0
201601	3814	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So they don’t really contain a lot of information beyond the first time you put them out.	95.0	96.0
201601	3815	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The second concern is that I’m a little bit less convinced than others about this difficulty of doing subjective histograms based on what people think about uncertainty, because we actually do this in our surveys of the primary dealers and the buy-side participants, and they seem able to construct these histograms.	95.0	96.0
201601	3816	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess I find it a little odd that we’re asking others to construct histograms, but we say ourselves that we can’t do it.	95.0	96.0
201601	3817	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If you were asked that question at the press conference, Madam Chair, I wonder how you would answer that.	95.0	96.0
201601	3818	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The third concern is what President Kashkari raised.	95.0	96.0
201601	3819	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think when we’re at the effective lower bound and issuing forward guidance with a commitment, I don’t know what the fan chart for the federal funds rate means in that context.	95.0	96.0
201601	3820	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it’s very odd to have this wide fan chart for the federal funds rate when we’re actually saying something that contradicts that.	95.0	96.0
201601	3821	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Another issue I have with the fan chart for the federal funds rate is, let’s say we’re at the lower bound, should the fan chart go below zero or not?	95.0	96.0
201601	3822	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s actually pretty tricky.	95.0	96.0
201601	3823	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If you think it should go below zero, you’re tacitly conceding that our target federal funds rate could go negative.	95.0	96.0
201601	3824	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If you don’t put it below zero, you’re essentially tacitly communicating that negative interest rates aren’t on the table.	95.0	96.0
201601	3825	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I feel that where you draw that lower bound on the federal funds rate chart is not completely irrelevant in terms of how we communicate.	95.0	96.0
201601	3826	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Obviously, in the appendix, you can explain why you’ve done it the way you’ve done it, but whether people will read the appendix and fully appreciate that is a question.	95.0	96.0
201601	3827	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the histograms, I feel much more strongly about the federal funds rate projections than those for GDP, unemployment, and inflation.	95.0	96.0
201601	3828	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the biggest difficulties with these fan charts lie in the federal funds rate, as opposed to the real economic variables.	95.0	96.0
201601	3829	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think the federal funds rate is more germane to us, because this is something we actually actively control.	95.0	96.0
201601	3830	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I guess I would like to see us try to do a dry run of histograms for the federal funds rate to see what they look like and how they compare with fan charts that were done on the root-mean-squared-error basis.	95.0	96.0
201601	3831	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I’d just like to see what they looked like.	95.0	96.0
201601	3832	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If they were better, then we could move to that approach, and if not, we could discard them.	95.0	96.0
201601	3833	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Would anybody else like to comment?	95.0	65.0
201601	3834	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair.	95.0	81.0
201601	3835	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	95.0	65.0
201601	3836	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I support the idea of fan charts.	95.0	81.0
201601	3837	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I just want to talk about forward guidance and commitment.	95.0	81.0
201601	3838	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I don’t think we’ve ever provided forward guidance with commitment.	95.0	81.0
201601	3839	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We’ve been very careful to word our forward guidance as a prediction about what our future selves will do.	95.0	81.0
201601	3840	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	In that instance, I think a fan chart is perfectly appropriate.	95.0	81.0
201601	3841	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	In fact, the fan chart would provide a great way to signal when we do choose to provide forward guidance with commitment, because then we would omit the fan.	95.0	81.0
201601	3842	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Would anyone—Todd, Stan, or anyone on the subcommittee—like to comment further on the issues?	95.0	65.0
201601	3843	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	One intermediate approach could be to add the funds rate to the set of questions that the Committee is asked their subjective views on, but not quantify it.	95.0	999.0
201601	3844	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	You’re currently asked whether the risk is balanced, to the upside, or to the downside for economic growth and inflation.	95.0	999.0
201601	3845	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	We don’t ask about the funds rate, so adding the funds rate to that set of questions could be a vehicle for providing the fan chart as the historical stuff and still have this discussion of our subjective views.	95.0	999.0
201601	3846	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	When the two are out of line, we would say they’re out of line:  This is the Committee’s judgment, and this is the historical stuff.	95.0	999.0
201601	3847	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	So it could be an intermediate way of not requiring people to provide a probability distribution for the funds rate but still give us a subjective way of communicating, for example, forward guidance having implications or the lower bound having implications.	95.0	999.0
201601	3848	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess I’d also be interested in seeing people’s subjective assessment of the federal funds rate path even if we didn’t actually share it with the public.	95.0	96.0
201601	3849	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s useful information for the Committee, in my opinion.	95.0	96.0
201601	3850	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	95.0	65.0
201601	3851	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, the comments are very interesting, and most of them are things we thought about in the course of trying to figure out what to recommend.	95.0	108.0
201601	3852	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The staff that was working with us, and probably the whole staff, is incredibly inventive, and you can get charts that reflect bias or direction of the risk, downward or upward.	95.0	108.0
201601	3853	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	You could also ask people for their distributions using histograms, as Bill Dudley suggests.	95.0	108.0
201601	3854	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’ve also heard people say that it’s an illusion to think the dealers are filling in those forms; they have a staff who fills in the forms for them.	95.0	108.0
201601	3855	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s usually the desk economist who sits at the fixed- income trading desk who does those forms, typically.	95.0	96.0
201601	3856	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Their backgrounds aren’t that dissimilar to our backgrounds.	95.0	96.0
201601	3857	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Some of our backgrounds.	95.0	65.0
201601	3858	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Some of our backgrounds.	95.0	108.0
201601	3859	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	But I do suggest that we go ahead with this, and that we really take into account the questions that have arisen and that we reflect.	95.0	108.0
201601	3860	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’ll come back to it in about six months’ time and ask you to fill in two other questionnaires:  One will ask you things about what we might want to put into the next one, and the other will ask about what comments you have on what we’ve done.	95.0	108.0
201601	3861	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’ll see if we can get better the next time we revise it, which would be somewhere down the road.	95.0	108.0
201601	3862	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	That’s the request I’d make.	95.0	108.0
201601	3863	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	With regard to Dennis Lockhart’s question, how many hits this will get?	95.0	108.0
201601	3864	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I think once the Chair is talking about it, the answer is “It’s millions,” particularly if it’s the Chair’s press conferences and if the media wants to pick that up.	95.0	108.0
201601	3865	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I exaggerate with “millions” probably, but it’ll get a lot of attention, and then we can seek to improve it.	95.0	108.0
201601	3866	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	95.0	65.0
201601	3867	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Yes.	95.0	107.0
201601	3868	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I was reflecting on Bill Dudley’s last comment and the reality that March is going to be a very complicated time for policy, regardless.	95.0	107.0
201601	3869	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I wonder whether it might be possible to leave off the federal funds rate initially and give some further thought to it, because right now, you’ve made a pretty consequential decision to cut off the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound, so that’s an important message that we would be conveying to the market.	95.0	107.0
201601	3870	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Maybe that’s what we want to do, but I wonder, if this is not essential for March, whether you might want to phase it and do your economic variables in March and give further thought to the federal funds rate.	95.0	107.0
201601	3871	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	If I can clarify something, the current chart for the current target of the funds rate is not actually cut off.	95.0	999.0
201601	3872	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Oh, I’m just looking at this picture.	95.0	107.0
201601	3873	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	It looks like it is, but it’s not—Bill can correct me if I’m wrong.	95.0	999.0
201601	3874	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	On the basis of the rise in rates in December and the future path with historical accuracy, we get very close to zero, but we are above zero.	95.0	999.0
201601	3875	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	And then the text, in the mad rush to get things out, didn’t get fully revised to go from the previous SEP to that SEP.	95.0	999.0
201601	3876	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	So it is really close to zero, and we describe in the text that we think we would impose zero.	95.0	999.0
201601	3877	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	But in that chart, we don’t actually have to impose zero.	95.0	999.0
201601	3878	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But if the path came down, then—	95.0	96.0
201601	3879	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	If the path came down again—	95.0	999.0
201601	3880	2016-01-27	meeting	ENGLISH	If the Committee was to choose to not truncate and allow the bottom of that fan chart to go below zero—	95.0	999.0
201601	3881	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s a consequential decision either way, though.	95.0	96.0
201601	3882	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s the problem.	95.0	96.0
201601	3883	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s consequential.	95.0	107.0
201601	3884	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Do we really need to add that to the set of decisions?	95.0	107.0
201601	3885	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, I think doing it in two phases is pretty difficult and hard to communicate.	95.0	65.0
201601	3886	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So I do worry about introducing the first three, and then, at some later date, adding the federal funds rate.	95.0	65.0
201601	3887	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But I think the issue of whether the band potentially goes below zero is important.	95.0	65.0
201601	3888	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Did the subcommittee have a strong view that it should not go below zero?	95.0	65.0
201601	3889	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Can I just make a clarifying point?	95.0	999.0
201601	3890	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	I think a literal interpretation of these bands is that, without any elaboration, they would imply that there’s a 15 percent probability that the funds rate could be open to that interpretation—a 15 percent probability that the funds rate could go above or below the band.	95.0	999.0
201601	3891	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Is that correct?	95.0	999.0
201601	3892	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Yes, that is correct.	95.0	999.0
201601	3893	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	In the example sketched in the appendix to the memo, the SEP would have text saying, “We would choose to cut this off at zero.	95.0	999.0
201601	3894	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	The Committee has not previously set the target for the federal funds rate below zero,” and leave it at that.	95.0	999.0
201601	3895	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Now, it would be possible to go further and address that point.	95.0	999.0
201601	3896	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	You could add a sentence saying that, without any commitment either way as to whether, in the future, the FOMC might or might not go outside this range.	95.0	108.0
201601	3897	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And the FOMC has taken quantitative easing measures, which could be interpreted as essentially the response when it would call for a below-zero rate.	95.0	65.0
201601	3898	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Presumably, you could clarify some of that in the verbal description in the appendix.	95.0	65.0
201601	3899	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo, do you want to say something?	95.0	65.0
201601	3900	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I’m waiting to see which direction we’re headed here.	95.0	97.0
201601	3901	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	95.0	65.0
201601	3902	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Yes, I have just a thought on this.	95.0	94.0
201601	3903	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee has discussed the possibility of a negative policy rate during the past five years.	95.0	94.0
201601	3904	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	We kicked it around, there are pros and cons, but the Committee never came down and actually did that.	95.0	94.0
201601	3905	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So I think that, at this point, you probably would cut it off, saying the Committee has not done that up to now.	95.0	94.0
201601	3906	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	We reserve the right, of course, to do that in the future.	95.0	94.0
201601	3907	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But, presumably, the text would indicate that this is a convention and has no significance in terms of the Committee’s policy options or intentions, that you’ve used a mechanical approach.	95.0	65.0
201601	3908	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	The other option, which I don’t think the Committee would want to do, would be to follow the approach of the central banks that publish policy rate fan charts.	95.0	999.0
201601	3909	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Two of them, the Norges Bank and the Riksbank, just publish a fan that’s plus or minus root mean squared errors.	95.0	999.0
201601	3910	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	It goes below zero, and then, in the text, they say that this does not reflect asymmetries in the policy rate or constraints associated with the lower bound that we think may apply.	95.0	999.0
201601	3911	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	I don’t know if the Committee would desire that, but there is some precedent.	95.0	999.0
201601	3912	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Did you consider that approach?	95.0	65.0
201601	3913	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Because that that might be a reasonable alternative.	95.0	65.0
201601	3914	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	95.0	65.0
201601	3915	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I must admit listening to this, I am troubled about the federal funds rate, because I do think it is dramatically and completely different than forecasting exogenous factors.	95.0	110.0
201601	3916	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Forecasting the federal funds rate is basically, what do I predict I might do, and all of you around this table will do, in reaction to exogenous factors?	95.0	110.0
201601	3917	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	My concern is, we’re in an extremely sensitive period here in the next three to six months.	95.0	110.0
201601	3918	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I don’t want to gum up the works, but it certainly seems to me, the risk/reward of getting this wrong is definitely asymmetrical.	95.0	110.0
201601	3919	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I would rather do a dry run, give the Committee a chance to look at sample charts on the federal funds rate in March, and have another bite at this.	95.0	110.0
201601	3920	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m sensitive to all the work that’s been done and how difficult it is to get a consensus, but the risks associated with this strike me as so asymmetrical.	95.0	110.0
201601	3921	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This is such a critical measure and one that we’re in control of.	95.0	110.0
201601	3922	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I do think it is different than forecasting exogenous factors.	95.0	110.0
201601	3923	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	95.0	65.0
201601	3924	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard, go ahead.	95.0	65.0
201601	3925	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	To respond to President Kaplan, sure, we control the funds rate, but we’re also reacting to the other data.	95.0	94.0
201601	3926	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So if the other data come in in an extreme way, then you’re going to choose a different value for the funds rate.	95.0	94.0
201601	3927	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is representing that kind of uncertainty, which I thought was the point of this.	95.0	94.0
201601	3928	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Except it’s different from every other factor because it’s a decision that we actually will make here.	95.0	110.0
201601	3929	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Better yet, voters rotate.	95.0	110.0
201601	3930	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	You have a lot of other factors that we all, again, as a group are in control of.	95.0	110.0
201601	3931	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It’s a different kind of factor to me.	95.0	110.0
201601	3932	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m not saying it should be treated differently, but I’d want to make sure we had a conviction around the table before we did this.	95.0	110.0
201601	3933	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	95.0	65.0
201601	3934	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Rob, the forecasters are forecasting, and some of them—very few— forecast the federal funds rate.	95.0	108.0
201601	3935	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	But they forecast short-term rates that are very close to the federal funds rate, and they are aware of all of the factors you’ve mentioned—there’s rotation on this Committee, et cetera.	95.0	108.0
201601	3936	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Yet they produce forecasts, and those forecasts will be the basis of the root mean squared errors that we use.	95.0	108.0
201601	3937	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So I see that it’s different.	95.0	108.0
201601	3938	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	As you were talking, I was reflecting on an obituary yesterday in the New York Times for a guy called Marvin Minsky, who was a computer-thinking founder who said he made the critical breakthrough when he persuaded his colleagues that human beings think like machines think, or that machines think like human beings think.	95.0	108.0
201601	3939	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And here we are—we’re thinking in a particular way.	95.0	108.0
201601	3940	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’re predictable.	95.0	108.0
201601	3941	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	It might not look like it, but we are, and I don’t see what the huge difference is.	95.0	108.0
201601	3942	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We react to the environment, we react to each other, and we’re probably fairly predictable, if we’re good at it.	95.0	108.0
201601	3943	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I guess I’m responding to the fact that this was done by the subcommittee on communications, which means this is more about communication than anything else, and I’m coming at it from that point of view.	95.0	110.0
201601	3944	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We may have conviction in this room, but as it is a PR communication issue, I think some good points have been raised.	95.0	110.0
201601	3945	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	To me, as we’re not under pressure to do this, I just want to make sure we’re comfortable.	95.0	110.0
201601	3946	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This is a process point I’m raising.	95.0	110.0
201601	3947	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	You may be right and probably are, but I don’t want to create a self- inflicted wound, how’s that?	95.0	110.0
201601	3948	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I hear you.	95.0	65.0
201601	3949	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo, did you want to weigh in?	95.0	65.0
201601	3950	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I’d like to associate myself with President Kaplan’s position.	95.0	97.0
201601	3951	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Does anybody else want to weigh in?	95.0	65.0
201601	3952	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think some good points have been raised that require a bit of thought.	95.0	65.0
201601	3953	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Madam Chair, they’ve had a bit of thought.	95.0	108.0
201601	3954	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	95.0	108.0
201601	3955	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, they have.	95.0	65.0
201601	3956	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, I think what I’d like to do is take a straw poll and get a sense of where the Committee is.	95.0	65.0
201601	3957	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We normally decide these matters by taking straw polls of all participants, and I’d like to get a sense of the overall view and the level of concern about this.	95.0	65.0
201601	3958	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Perhaps rather than utterly decide every detail about how we’re going to go forward, after seeing what the straw vote looks like, we could sit down and talk again with the members of the subcommittee and the staff about whether there are some changes we can make in the approach, and, in particular, what I present in the press conference, which is going to be important, and we haven’t quite decided that.	95.0	65.0
201601	3959	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Maybe some changes are appropriate or some thought needs to go into that.	95.0	65.0
201601	3960	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But I’d like to take a straw poll.	95.0	65.0
201601	3961	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Can I see how many people would like to go forward with implementing the approach that the subcommittee has recommended?	95.0	65.0
201601	3962	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Madam Chair, I’m sorry.	95.0	97.0
201601	3963	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Could you state what the other position will be?	95.0	97.0
201601	3964	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	That you would not want to proceed with this.	95.0	65.0
201601	3965	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	At this time.	95.0	97.0
201601	3966	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Yes, at this time.	95.0	999.0
201601	3967	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In March.	95.0	107.0
201601	3968	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	At this time.	95.0	65.0
201601	3969	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Although I think it’s March versus potentially later, right?	95.0	96.0
201601	3970	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	That’s right.	95.0	107.0
201601	3971	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, maybe we should take that as a separate question.	95.0	65.0
201601	3972	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Okay.	95.0	96.0
201601	3973	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we take the timing as separate question—whether we go forward in March, which is a consequential meeting, obviously, or we wait until a later time to move forward with this.	95.0	65.0
201601	3974	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Madam Chair, I think the issue that was raised was that there are some questions to wrestle with.	95.0	96.0
201601	3975	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think some people prefer to wrestle with those questions and answer them definitively, with the presumption that they’ll probably move affirmatively, versus just deciding now to move forward in March.	95.0	96.0
201601	3976	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That seems to be the real question.	95.0	96.0
201601	3977	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I didn’t get a strong sense that people are opposed to this, but I think there are some questions that people feel they really want to make sure are answered correctly, versus just going ahead with this proposal in March.	95.0	96.0
201601	3978	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Those do seem to be the two choices as I hear them.	95.0	96.0
201601	3979	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I agree with Bill.	95.0	91.0
201601	3980	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	You’re okay with that?	95.0	65.0
201601	3981	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I think it captures the discussion.	95.0	110.0
201601	3982	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	95.0	65.0
201601	3983	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So let me, then, first ask, how many people would like to go ahead in March to implement the proposal the subcommittee has recommended?	95.0	65.0
201601	3984	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	At least one alternative, which I’ll next ask about, is, how many people are favorably inclined toward going ahead but feel we should wait until a later date and sort out some of the questions on how we would approach this?	95.0	65.0
201601	3985	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So, first, how many people would like to simply go ahead in March as proposed?	95.0	65.0
201601	3986	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	95.0	65.0
201601	3987	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	95.0	65.0
201601	3988	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	How many people are supportive of this approach in introducing fan charts but would like to wait to think through some of the questions that have been raised, such as, on the symmetry issue, should fan charts go below zero as well as should we necessarily include a funds rate fan chart?	95.0	65.0
201601	3989	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I would think through, perhaps a little bit more carefully, exactly what I would present at the press conference, versus what would go into the SEP when it’s published in the minutes.	95.0	65.0
201601	3990	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to see how many people would prefer to wait and think this through a bit more.	95.0	65.0
201601	3991	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	95.0	65.0
201601	3992	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	95.0	65.0
201601	3993	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And then, finally, is there anybody who thinks that this is just a bad idea—that we should not add fan charts and be done with this?	95.0	65.0
201601	3994	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Because we have considered this on many previous occasions.	95.0	65.0
201601	3995	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I would really not be willing to ask the subcommittee, which has done a huge amount of work and thought through a lot of issues, to go back and try to formulate a totally new proposal.	95.0	65.0
201601	3996	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Ironing out a few details is one thing I would be inclined to ask the subcommittee to do, but going back and considering a significantly different approach, I wouldn’t.	95.0	65.0
201601	3997	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	How many people would just like to can this?	95.0	65.0
201601	3998	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	95.0	65.0
201601	3999	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I have to be consistent with what I said earlier, so I’ll put my finger up.	95.0	88.0
201601	4000	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	95.0	65.0
201601	4001	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I guess I see a sufficient amount of discomfort with simply forging ahead with this in March to feel comfortable concluding that we should do that.	95.0	65.0
201601	4002	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And I would suggest that we sit down and discuss the issues that have been raised and how we might address them, and then we can return with a revised proposal on how we’re going to do that.	95.0	65.0
201601	4003	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	What did he put it up for?	95.0	108.0
201601	4004	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	To can it.	95.0	65.0
201601	4005	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If I could just interject one final thing.	95.0	96.0
201601	4006	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this issue about whether we’re potentially willing to entertain a negative federal funds rate is important to this discussion.	95.0	96.0
201601	4007	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In other words, you can’t do it just as a communication issue unless you actually know—	95.0	96.0
201601	4008	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The answer.	95.0	90.0
201601	4009	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	[Laughter]	95.0	90.0
201601	4010	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	—what people think about that possibility.	95.0	96.0
201601	4011	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Bill, I don’t think that’s true.	95.0	108.0
201601	4012	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	You can simply make a statement that there has been no decision on this issue, and they haven’t been used in the past.	95.0	108.0
201601	4013	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But if the Committee felt that this is something that just was ruled off the table, that could inform what kind of fan chart one would want to show for the federal funds rate, versus if the Committee decided this is something that’s very definitely potentially on the table, that could inform a different decision on the fan charts.	95.0	96.0
201601	4014	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s all I’m saying.	95.0	96.0
201601	4015	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We can draw a chart that is under specified assumptions, which we will say do not represent a Committee decision.	95.0	108.0
201601	4016	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, but you are proposing cutting it off at zero.	95.0	65.0
201601	4017	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Your proposal that you have on the table is to cut it off at zero.	95.0	65.0
201601	4018	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	If we’re not going to do that, maybe we should think it through, come back to the Committee, and let them know how we would propose to handle it.	95.0	65.0
201601	4019	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I don’t want to continue this discussion, but the fact is, as David said, that we’re showing 70 percent confidence intervals.	95.0	108.0
201601	4020	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And there is a 90 percent confidence interval that you could also draw, which would probably go below.	95.0	108.0
201601	4021	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I don’t think there are parts of the band that are feasible when you do that.	95.0	999.0
201601	4022	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	It’s not feasible to get to minus 3 or minus 4, so that will be one issue.	95.0	999.0
201601	4023	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	There’s a mass point somewhere, and that would be the true lower bound, and you can’t go past there.	95.0	999.0
201601	4024	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Because of currency, you’re saying.	95.0	96.0
201601	4025	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Currency, or it’s not effective.	95.0	999.0
201601	4026	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Tangential.	95.0	81.0
201601	4027	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But wouldn’t showing it going below that feasible lower bound simply say that conditions could materialize that would—historically, starting from a different level of the funds rate—have prompted a very large response that would take the funds rate below a meaningful lower bound, wherever it is, and you’re illustrating that the Committee would have a number of options that could come into play?	95.0	65.0
201601	4028	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	It may not be feasible to take the funds rate to minus 2, but further QE or other things certainly are feasible.	95.0	65.0
201601	4029	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	95.0	65.0
201601	4030	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I don’t want to belabor this, but one of the principles when we went into this and when we got to the proposal was the simplicity, right?	95.0	999.0
201601	4031	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	It was important that this be a simple thing.	95.0	999.0
201601	4032	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I may be mischaracterizing it, but the reason we said we’ll truncate at zero is precisely because we didn’t want to signal anything about future policy decisions and we had a history that said we had never gone below zero.	95.0	999.0
201601	4033	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	We thought that we could easily say that in words, and that, the first time we showed the fan charts, those points could be said very simply and we could take all this into consideration that we’ve just gone through about the tradeoffs and how we have QE that might get us below zero.	95.0	999.0
201601	4034	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The whole premise of this was, we need a simple way to communicate that there’s uncertainty regarding these forecasts, it’s bigger than the dispersion typically in the SEP, and our policy will be data dependent and respond to economic shocks to the economy.	95.0	999.0
201601	4035	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	So that was the thought process about exactly why we truncated at zero, saying, “Because we’ve never been below zero, we’re truncating this chart at zero.	95.0	999.0
201601	4036	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Of course, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, we’re not—.”	95.0	999.0
201601	4037	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	That was kind of the thought process.	95.0	999.0
201601	4038	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I just wanted to let you know the history of that.	95.0	999.0
201601	4039	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, an approach might be to clarify that in the appendix.	95.0	65.0
201601	4040	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Exactly.	95.0	999.0
201601	4041	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes, that might be a simple solution.	95.0	96.0
201601	4042	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Right.	95.0	999.0
201601	4043	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	When you talk at the press conference, presumably the first time you show these, you’re going to want to have some words associated with them, because, unfortunately, the chart that you currently show at the press conference looks like a fan chart even though it’s dispersion.	95.0	999.0
201601	4044	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	And so you’re going to want to have some words associated with that, and in those words you can say this.	95.0	999.0
201601	4045	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Disagreement versus uncertainty.	95.0	96.0
201601	4046	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	95.0	65.0
201601	4047	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Would it be acceptable to the subcommittee to think through some of this, respond to some of these comments, and come back to the Committee?	95.0	65.0
201601	4048	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	It may just be a matter of clarifying some of the language in the appendix or perhaps waiting until June to go forward with this.	95.0	65.0
201601	4049	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Yes, I think it would be.	95.0	108.0
201601	4050	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’ll find a subcommittee that will deal with it.	95.0	108.0
201601	4051	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	95.0	108.0
201601	4052	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	This is a highly coveted position.	95.0	91.0
201601	4053	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I’ve already served my term, though.	95.0	91.0
201601	4055	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I should say that, as you know, this is not the first time we’ve had a conversation like this around the table, and it has always come to a similar fate.	95.0	65.0
201601	4056	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Nonetheless, we will try again.	95.0	102.0
201601	4057	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	95.0	102.0
201601	4058	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	95.0	65.0
201601	4059	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	95.0	65.0
201601	4060	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	108.0
201601	4061	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	The meeting is now adjourned, and the Board meeting is ended.	53.0	65.0
201601	4062	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We will next meet Tuesday and Wednesday, March 15 and 16.	53.0	65.0
201601	4063	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Lunch is served.	53.0	65.0
201601	4064	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And for those of you who can stay, Linda Robertson is prepared to give a legislative update.	53.0	65.0
201603	0	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s begin.	50.0	65.0
201603	1	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Welcome, everybody.	50.0	65.0
201603	2	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	As for our past meetings, this entire meeting will be a joint meeting of the FOMC with the Board of Governors, and I need a motion to close the Board meeting.	50.0	65.0
201603	3	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	50.0	108.0
201603	4	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	50.0	65.0
201603	5	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	50.0	65.0
201603	6	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Our first order of business is “Financial Developments and Open Market Operations,” and I’m going to ask Simon to start us off.	61.0	65.0
201603	7	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201603	8	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	I will begin by discussing global financial market developments, and then Lorie will review money markets and operational matters.	61.0	999.0
201603	9	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Following their worst January since 2009, global risk asset prices continued to exhibit significant volatility over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201603	10	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The top-left panel of your first exhibit shows that the period can be divided in two.	61.0	999.0
201603	11	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	In the first half, risk assets declined sharply, generally continuing the moves seen following the turn of the year.	61.0	999.0
201603	12	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	However, since mid-February, risk asset prices have rebounded.	61.0	999.0
201603	13	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Taking a longer view:  On net, since the December FOMC meeting, risk asset prices and advanced economy sovereign debt yields are lower, while the US dollar is a bit weaker.	61.0	999.0
201603	14	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	In order to gain greater insight into the price actions seen year-to-date, we asked respondents to the Desk’s surveys to rate the importance of various factors that may explain the recent financial market volatility.	61.0	999.0
201603	15	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-right panel, on average respondents assigned the highest ratings to three factors:  volatility in oil markets, Chinese FX developments, and changes to the outlook for foreign growth and inflation.	61.0	999.0
201603	16	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	As I will discuss in more detail in the next three panels, a reduction in heightened concerns over these factors likely contributed to the retracement in risk asset prices since mid-February, although key sources of uncertainty underlying these factors have not been resolved, and this may suggest the rebound is tenuous.	61.0	999.0
201603	17	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Survey respondents also highlighted foreign central bank policy as a contributing factor, and, over the period, investors increasingly questioned the efficacy of monetary policy at the  lower bound in certain developed market economies.	61.0	999.0
201603	18	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	I will discuss this later in my briefing.	61.0	999.0
201603	19	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Interestingly, only two respondents mentioned market psychology as an important factor, while one other pointed to reduced market liquidity.	61.0	999.0
201603	20	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Beginning with oil, the middle-left panel shows that oil prices fell back to multi- decade lows in mid-February, and, amid ongoing negotiations between many producers to coordinate an output freeze, prices were volatile over the period, with an intraday trading range generally between 3 and 6 percent.	61.0	999.0
201603	21	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The wide daily swings in oil prices continued to have knock-on effects across global financial markets, and the correlation between changes in oil prices and a number of risk asset prices remained well above longer-run historical averages.	61.0	999.0
201603	22	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Although oil prices increased over the period to roughly $40 per barrel, they’re little changed year-to-date, and the outlook for them remains uncertain.	61.0	999.0
201603	23	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	On the supply side, a coordinated output freeze is only speculative at this point, while the outlook for oil demand does not appear to have materially changed.	61.0	999.0
201603	24	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Against this backdrop, market participants continue to expect volatile trading conditions, and options on oil futures suggest price volatility will remain above its post-crisis average in the near term.	61.0	999.0
201603	25	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Moving to China, the stability in recent weeks in the renminbi−US dollar fixing seems to have soothed market concerns.	61.0	999.0
201603	26	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period, the onshore renminbi was little changed against the US dollar, broadly consistent with movements in the basket of currencies that many Chinese policymakers describe as the new exchange rate peg.	61.0	999.0
201603	27	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	That said, many investors perceive the recent stability as only temporary, in part because it has required high levels of intervention in foreign exchange markets.	61.0	999.0
201603	28	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The middle-right panel shows that Chinese foreign exchange reserves have declined by over $750 billion since the fall of 2014.	61.0	999.0
201603	29	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Despite incremental communication in February from Chinese policymakers indicating an interest in renminbi stability against a basket of exchange rates, many market participants are skeptical that this will be delivered, in light of prior abrupt adjustments to the exchange rate policy.	61.0	999.0
201603	30	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Market participants also point to the perceived pressure from capital outflows, the ongoing opacity concerning the exchange rate regime with respect to the US dollar, and the viability of such a regime.	61.0	999.0
201603	31	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Investors still expect the renminbi to depreciate further against the US dollar over the coming year, and options pricing indicates that the demand for protection against surprise renminbi depreciation is near post-crisis highs and well above levels prevailing prior to the August devaluation.	61.0	999.0
201603	32	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Beth Anne will discuss China and oil prices further in her briefing.	61.0	999.0
201603	33	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	While oil prices and the renminbi–US dollar fixing have stabilized in recent weeks, concerns about longer-run global growth prospects or secular stagnation have not receded.	61.0	999.0
201603	34	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The bottom-left panel shows that five-year, five-year-forward real yields in the United States and euro area continued to decline over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201603	35	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The decline in real yields—alongside persistently low levels of forward inflation compensation—has resulted in a significant flattening in nominal sovereign yield curves, and nominal yields are at or near historic lows.	61.0	999.0
201603	36	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	At the intersection of these three factors, the financial sector has experienced heightened volatility and significant asset price declines since the start of the year.	61.0	999.0
201603	37	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The bottom-right panel shows that domestic and European bank stocks have been notable underperformers, as continued net interest margin compression due to flattening yield curves, energy-sector exposure, and idiosyncratic developments weighed on the sector.	61.0	999.0
201603	38	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Concerns over individual bank earnings and escalated doubts over the ability of certain banks to meet debt obligations exacerbated the steep slide in financial-sector stocks in the euro area, Japan, and the United States.	61.0	999.0
201603	39	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The share prices of some large banks were, at one point, 30 percent below the levels prevailing at the start of the year.	61.0	999.0
201603	40	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	By contrast, some observers point to emerging markets, which have performed comparatively well so far this year, as an indication that financial market concerns have been overblown.	61.0	999.0
201603	41	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	However, the relatively strong performance follows sharp declines across EM assets in the second half of 2015.	61.0	999.0
201603	42	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Further, as I highlighted with respect to China, most assume the current stability has been supported in part by active FX intervention and, therefore, question its sustainability over the medium-to- long term.	61.0	999.0
201603	43	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	As volatility in global financial markets rose, expectations for more- accommodative monetary policies from developed-market central banks increased and have only partially retraced in recent weeks.	61.0	999.0
201603	44	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Year-to-date money market futures rates across the euro area, Japan, and the United States have all declined substantially.	61.0	999.0
201603	45	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Further, going into the G-20 meeting in Shanghai, there was increased market chatter about the possibility of coordinated responses across central banks and fiscal authorities as many market participants focused on the international spillover effects and efficacy of monetary policy actions at the zero bound.	61.0	999.0
201603	46	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	At the end of January, the Bank of Japan announced a negative interest rate policy to complement its ongoing asset purchase program, an unexpected change to its policy stance, as Japanese policymakers had previously been adamantly against using the tool.	61.0	999.0
201603	47	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Despite the attempt to provide further accommodation and a short-lived positive response in financial markets, Japanese financial conditions tightened considerably in the weeks after the announcement.	61.0	999.0
201603	48	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The top-left panel of your next exhibit shows that the Japanese yen appreciated over 5 percent versus the US dollar and Japan’s TOPIX Index declined 14 percent, on net, in the two weeks after the announcement.	61.0	999.0
201603	49	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Market participants link the moves in market prices in part to inconsistent policy communications, a complicated and unclear tiered system of interest rates on reserve balances, and more-fundamental questions about the efficacy of negative interest rate policy and the remaining capacity of BOJ policy tools to stoke inflation.	61.0	999.0
201603	50	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Indeed, in view of the size of the BOJ’s asset purchase program and the operational concerns associated with negative rates in Japan, the main tool remaining with ample capacity appears to be FX intervention.	61.0	999.0
201603	51	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	In contrast, last week the ECB delivered a comprehensive and carefully designed package of accommodative measures, which was generally viewed as surpassing consensus market expectations.	61.0	999.0
201603	52	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	As detailed in the top-right panel, the ECB cut the rates on its main refinancing operations, marginal lending facility, and deposit facility, bringing the deposit rate to minus 40 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201603	53	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Further, it added a new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations, increased the pace of asset purchases, and expanded the list of eligible purchase program assets to include nonfinancial corporate bonds.	61.0	999.0
201603	54	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Unlike the BOJ, the ECB faces self-imposed operational limits related to the share of sovereign issuance it is prepared to hold and a floor on the yields of assets it is prepared to buy.	61.0	999.0
201603	55	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	It also decided not to implement a tiered negative interest rate system, which was apparently viewed adversely by a number of market participants.	61.0	999.0
201603	56	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Despite the unprecedented scale of efforts by the ECB and Bank of Japan to stimulate inflation in a situation in which their policy rate has reached  the lower bound, the middle-left panel shows that the forward measures of inflation compensation remain at or near multiyear lows.	61.0	999.0
201603	57	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Following the election of Prime Minister Abe and the subsequent implementation of QQE, Japan had some success in the financial markets in raising inflation compensation.	61.0	999.0
201603	58	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	However, with disinflationary forces building in the euro area and more broadly across the globe since the summer of 2014, long forward inflation compensation has fallen even as the Bank of Japan increased its pace of asset purchases and the ECB started a QE program.	61.0	999.0
201603	59	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	In the United States, inflation swaps are trading in line with crisis-era lows, although they have shown notable increases in the past few weeks.	61.0	999.0
201603	60	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The cumulative result of the varied actions by the BOJ and ECB, or perhaps the inability to counteract the conditions prompting these actions, is most evident in the extremely low level of nominal yields in these jurisdictions.	61.0	999.0
201603	61	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The middle-right panel shows that 74 percent of Japanese sovereign debt and about one-half of euro-area sovereign debt are trading at negative yields.	61.0	999.0
201603	62	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	These negative yields might be putting downward pressure on US yields through portfolio balance effects.	61.0	999.0
201603	63	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Further, it is unknown whether sustained periods of negative yields will lead to structural changes in financial systems that, in turn, reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy.	61.0	999.0
201603	64	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The heightened market volatility and perceptions of a fragile domestic economic outlook prompted, particularly in early February, expectations of a much more accommodative stance of monetary policy being provided by the FOMC.	61.0	999.0
201603	65	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-left panel, the current market-implied path of the federal funds rate, the dark blue line, remains notably below the path prevailing at the time of the December FOMC meeting, a path shown in the light blue line.	61.0	999.0
201603	66	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Market pricing currently suggests that a less than 10 percent probability is attached to an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, and only one rate hike is fully priced in for the remainder of 2016; the path is still consistent with a very gradual data- dependent approach, with a 50–50 chance of a rate increase at or before the June meeting.	61.0	999.0
201603	67	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	These market-implied expectations are generally consistent with the results of the most recent Desk surveys.	61.0	999.0
201603	68	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Thomas will discuss policy expectations further in his briefing.	61.0	999.0
201603	69	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Following the Bank of Japan decision, market participants began to speculate that negative interest rate policy may be on the horizon in the United States, in part illustrated by a slight inversion of the federal funds futures curve on the morning of February 11, when the value of Eurodollar options that would pay off with negative rates spiked.	61.0	999.0
201603	70	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The Eurodollar option-implied risk-neutral probability of negative policy rates in December 2016 rose from around 2 percent at the start of the year to 12 percent most recently, though it reached as high as 25 percent on February 11.	61.0	999.0
201603	71	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Results in the Desk’s surveys similarly reflect a shift in views, with 18 respondents now estimating the level of the federal funds target range or rate at the effective lower bound as less than zero, compared with only 12 in January.	61.0	999.0
201603	72	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	However, on average, respondents assign a less than 5 percent probability to negative policy rate outcomes occurring over the next three years.	61.0	999.0
201603	73	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Fed policymaker comments over the course of February also served to flatten the expected path of the policy rate.	61.0	999.0
201603	74	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Market participants keyed in on comments from Vice Chairman Dudley and the Chair’s congressional testimony, which were taken by some as suggesting that financial market volatility could factor into the path of policy normalization.	61.0	999.0
201603	75	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Additionally, Vice Chairman Dudley’s comments in early February that US dollar strength could have “significant consequences” for the US economy led to a large and widespread depreciation in the US dollar, which had been continuing to appreciate despite a compression in interest rate differentials, as shown in the bottom-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201603	76	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Arguably, this arrest in broad dollar appreciation helped with the stabilization in global financial markets over the period, reducing both some downward pressures on oil prices and upward pressure on the renminbi fixing.	61.0	999.0
201603	77	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	A key question that remains for market participants, therefore, is the extent to which shifts in US monetary policy expectations have contributed to the stabilization in global financial conditions and, correspondingly, the extent to which the current relative calm would be sustained if expectations for a faster pace of FOMC rate hikes grow or the US dollar starts to appreciate once again.	61.0	999.0
201603	78	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	I’ll begin on exhibit 3, with money markets and operational developments.	61.0	999.0
201603	79	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Our experience during the intermeeting period continued to suggest the operational framework has been effective in maintaining control over the effective federal funds rate.	61.0	999.0
201603	80	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	This has occurred without enlarging the Federal Reserve’s market footprint or having unintended consequences on financial stability during the financial market turmoil in January and early February.	61.0	999.0
201603	81	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel, the effective federal funds rate continued to print near the center of the target range.	61.0	999.0
201603	82	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	I should note that since the previous meeting, we changed the underlying data source for the effective rate to the FR 2420 data and the calculation methodology to a volume-weighted median.	61.0	999.0
201603	83	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	This transition went smoothly, with little market reaction and little change in the effective rate.	61.0	999.0
201603	84	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Treasury repo rates traded at modestly higher spreads to the overnight RRP rate, with the overnight Treasury GCF rate, shown as the red line, printing above the target range early in the period.	61.0	999.0
201603	85	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Treasury bill rates, shown as the light blue line, continued to rise following liftoff as a result of significant increases in net bill issuance.	61.0	999.0
201603	86	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	These higher rates on money market instruments contributed to the substantial decline in daily take-up of Federal Reserve overnight RRPs.	61.0	999.0
201603	87	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	As indicated by the dark blue line in the top-right panel, daily take-up fell, dropping on occasions to less than $40 billion, which is below what we would have expected even after taking the higher rates on alternative money market instruments into account.	61.0	999.0
201603	88	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants reported that an increase in the availability of private repo, as indicated by the increase in private-sector repo volumes shown in the light blue line, also contributed to the reduced overnight RRP facility usage.	61.0	999.0
201603	89	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Contacts attributed this combination of increased private-sector repo availability and higher rates to the increase in the amount of Treasury collateral that dealers needed to finance in the repo market.	61.0	999.0
201603	90	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	This increase in dealer inventory to finance, shown in the middle-left panel, has been driven by sales of US Treasury securities by foreign central banks in support of realized or expected foreign exchange intervention activity, combined with the sustained positive Treasury net bill issuance, shown in your middle-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201603	91	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	The recent increase in Treasury repo volumes and correspondingly low Federal Reserve overnight RRP facility usage appears to have influenced expectations for future usage.	61.0	999.0
201603	92	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the bottom-left panel, the Desk’s March policy surveys showed that median expectations for six-month-ahead and one-year-ahead overnight RRP facility demand declined by roughly $150 billion.	61.0	999.0
201603	93	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	However, respondents largely maintain that demand is likely to increase from current levels later this year, as implementation of SEC money market mutual fund reforms is expected to result in increased supply of cash for investment into short-term high-quality assets.	61.0	999.0
201603	94	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Although overnight RRP usage declined over the period, we continue to see increases in Federal Reserve reverse repurchase agreements with foreign official institutions—otherwise known as the foreign RP pool—as shown in the bottom-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201603	95	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Recall that the vast majority of the increase in the foreign RP pool since December 2014, shown in dark blue, has been driven by one customer seeking larger dollar liquidity buffers as a precaution against potential global financial instability surrounding normalization of US monetary policy.	61.0	999.0
201603	96	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	This customer’s increases have occurred gradually and ended in January.	61.0	999.0
201603	97	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	A few emerging market accounts have been responsible for the growth more recently amid a desire to increase their dollar liquidity buffers either in anticipation of foreign exchange intervention activity or out of concern over Treasury market liquidity in times of stress.	61.0	999.0
201603	98	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	With regard to the final exhibit, I’d like to update you on recent trends in the foreign exchange reserve holdings of the SOMA portfolio, a summary of which is contained in the top-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201603	99	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	The SOMA portfolio holds approximately $12 billion in euro-denominated and $8 billion in yen-denominated investments, which are invested in sovereign bond holdings and deposits at official institutions.	61.0	999.0
201603	100	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in your top-right panel, total income from the euro portfolio has been trending lower since late 2011.	61.0	999.0
201603	101	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Since the adoption of a negative deposit facility rate by the ECB in 2014, income earned on cash and time deposits held at euro-area central banks has been negative.	61.0	999.0
201603	102	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	With the recent further declines in euro-area rates that Simon highlighted, we expect negative overall interest income on the euro portfolio this month.	61.0	999.0
201603	103	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	In contrast, we expect income on the yen portfolio to decline toward zero but remain positive.	61.0	999.0
201603	104	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Although yields on Japanese government bonds with maturities out to 11 years are now negative, we currently earn an interest rate of zero on our deposits left at the BOJ.	61.0	999.0
201603	105	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	We anticipate that the negative income on the euro portfolio will fully offset the reduced—though still positive—income from the yen portfolio in April, resulting in negative total SOMA foreign portfolio interest income in US dollar terms.	61.0	999.0
201603	106	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	This would be reported publicly for the first time in late May within the April financial statement of the Treasury Exchange Stabilization Fund, which the Desk manages in an identical manner to the SOMA portfolio.	61.0	999.0
201603	107	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	It would be subsequently reported in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s quarterly report covering the second quarter and other Federal Reserve financial statements.	61.0	999.0
201603	108	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	As we have noted previously, we are currently conducting a strategic review of the foreign portfolio investment framework.	61.0	999.0
201603	109	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	The goal of this review is to assess and improve the way in which the Desk manages the SOMA’s and the Treasury ESF’s foreign assets in order to better meet the investment objectives.	61.0	999.0
201603	110	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	This strategic review is being conducted in parallel with work to modernize the Committee’s Foreign Authorization documents so that they reflect the current operating environment and can be more easily understood by the public.	61.0	999.0
201603	111	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	We will be providing a memo to the Committee on the results of the strategic review, including a recommended benchmark investment portfolio, in the coming weeks.	61.0	999.0
201603	112	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	With regard to the domestic portfolio, the Desk is planning to publish the SOMA annual report in mid-April, and the Committee can expect to receive a full copy around the end of this month.	61.0	999.0
201603	113	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	In order to demonstrate the sensitivity of income to various factors such as interest rates and the composition of Federal Reserve liabilities, the annual report will include updated SOMA portfolio income projections under both a baseline scenario derived from market expectations and several alternative scenarios.	61.0	999.0
201603	114	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	In comparison with the 2014 annual report, the 2015 baseline projection shows a higher level of net income during the normalization process, as shown in your middle-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201603	115	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	This is primarily due to a delay in the expected end to reinvestments—resulting in a larger SOMA portfolio over a longer time period— combined with a lower interest rate path, which reduces expected interest expense.	61.0	999.0
201603	116	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	In the baseline scenario, the portfolio is expected to reach its steady-state size in the second quarter of 2022, nearly a year and a half later than projected in the previous report.	61.0	999.0
201603	117	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	In terms of portfolio operations, the Desk continued to reinvest repayments of principal on Treasury securities and agency MBS.	61.0	999.0
201603	118	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in your middle-right panel, the Desk completed roughly $37 billion in Treasury rollovers in February, a sharp increase in the monthly Treasury rollovers over the prior three-year period when maturing Treasury securities totaled only $6 billion.	61.0	999.0
201603	119	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	The Desk also reinvested $22 billion in MBS principal payments.	61.0	999.0
201603	120	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	The median respondent to the Desk’s March surveys expected the Committee to first cease some or all reinvestments in June 2017—shown as the dashed line—two months later than in the January survey.	61.0	999.0
201603	121	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	A number of respondents attributed the shift to a flattening in the expected path of the target range.	61.0	999.0
201603	122	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Finally, we would like to review factors that may bear on the Committee’s decision of whether to conduct term RRP operations over March quarter-end.	61.0	999.0
201603	123	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	In a memo sent to the Committee and summarized in your bottom two panels, the staff outlined an option to offer $250 billion in term RRPs at 1 basis point over the ON RRP offered rate, split evenly between seven- and two-day maturities.	61.0	999.0
201603	124	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	On the one hand, conducting term RRPs over quarter-end would provide continuity, support the Committee’s guidance that it expects to reduce elevated capacity in the ON RRPs fairly soon after the commencement of policy firming, and enhance operational readiness.	61.0	999.0
201603	125	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	On the other hand, because ON RRP capacity is currently more than sufficient to meet demand for RRPs over the quarter-end, offering term RRPs will not add to interest rate control.	61.0	999.0
201603	126	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Further, there is the added albeit small interest expense of providing term RRPs at a premium to the ON RRP offered rate.	61.0	999.0
201603	127	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	If the Committee wishes to conduct term RRPs over the March 2016 quarter-end, the instruction to conduct such operations would need to be added to the domestic policy directive, which will be included in the implementation note that is published along with the Committee’s postmeeting statement.	61.0	999.0
201603	128	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	The Desk would also release an operating statement on term RRP operations on the New York Fed’s website, providing the planned schedule and other details such as the allocation mechanism for the operations.	61.0	999.0
201603	129	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	The memo you received and Tealbook B show the draft language that would be added to the directive; the memo also shows the draft operating statement that the Desk would release.	61.0	999.0
201603	130	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	To conclude, as we noted in January, as part of each FOMC briefing, we will provide a summary of the results of any small-value exercises from the prior period and preview upcoming exercises.	61.0	999.0
201603	131	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	This information is summarized in your appendix, which also notes the results of the TDF test operation performed in February.	61.0	999.0
201603	132	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you.	61.0	999.0
201603	133	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	That concludes our prepared remarks.	61.0	999.0
201603	134	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201603	135	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Now, from my own standpoint, I’m not particularly concerned about this because, in either case, the minutes for this meeting can clarify something we have said before, which is that we intend to reintroduce an aggregate cap on the overnight RRP facility at some point, and we intend to phase out the facility when it’s no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate.	62.0	65.0
201603	136	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	So, personally, this isn’t something I feel strongly about.	62.0	65.0
201603	137	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	I’m happy to go along with the prevailing view of the Committee.	62.0	65.0
201603	138	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Before I ask for a show of hands, I’d welcome any comments that you might have.	62.0	65.0
201603	139	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	A few people have indicated a desire to comment on this, and anybody else is welcome to join in.	62.0	65.0
201603	140	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let me turn to the Vice Chairman first.	62.0	65.0
201603	141	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	96.0
201603	142	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think it’s an earth- shattering decision.	62.0	96.0
201603	143	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	If we did one or the other, I don’t think we would be putting the republic at risk.	62.0	96.0
201603	144	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	62.0	96.0
201603	145	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	But all that said, I do favor the option of not doing term RRPs at the end of the quarter for two simple reasons.	62.0	96.0
201603	146	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	One, they’re not necessary, in view of the fact that we don’t have a cap on the overnight RRP facility.	62.0	96.0
201603	147	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s plenty of capacity to accommodate any quarter-end demand.	62.0	96.0
201603	148	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Without a cap, we clearly don’t need them now, so the default should be no term RRP for the time being.	62.0	96.0
201603	149	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Once we establish a cap on the overnight RRP facility, then we should revisit this issue.	62.0	96.0
201603	150	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	At that time we might decide to have a high cap on the overnight RRP facility.	62.0	96.0
201603	151	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In that case, we might still expect to have sufficient headroom at quarter-end so we can safely continue to forgo term RRP, or we can decide to have a lower cap on the overnight RRP facility, which might necessitate term RRP to ensure sufficient headroom at quarter-end.	62.0	96.0
201603	152	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	A second important reason is that I would prefer that we make the decisions in sequence.	62.0	96.0
201603	153	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I’d have the decision on the overnight RRP cap made first.	62.0	96.0
201603	154	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Then, once that decision was made, I would consider the implications for headroom at quarter-end, and that, then, would drive the decision on term RRP.	62.0	96.0
201603	155	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, some might view this decision not to do term RRP as inconsistent with past practice, as we’ve done term RRP operations consistently over recent quarter-ends.	62.0	96.0
201603	156	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I disagree with this.	62.0	96.0
201603	157	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of communication, I completely agree with the Chair.	62.0	96.0
201603	158	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think if we forgo term RRP when we have no cap—I don’t think it’s going to be difficult to explain to anybody.	62.0	96.0
201603	159	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	We can make it clear why we’re doing so in the minutes.	62.0	96.0
201603	160	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	We simply explain that because we don’t have a cap, we don’t need term RRP right now.	62.0	96.0
201603	161	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201603	162	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	62.0	65.0
201603	163	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	999.0
201603	164	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	I agree with Vice Chairman Dudley’s analysis.	62.0	999.0
201603	165	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Although I think it is not putting the republic at risk, I think it’s a close call, and for me there are costs and benefits, obviously, to changing or not changing.	62.0	999.0
201603	166	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	I come down on the side of the cost of changing, at least in terms of too many moving parts, until we get sufficiently on our path toward normalization.	62.0	999.0
201603	167	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	That seems to be the right thing to do.	62.0	999.0
201603	168	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201603	169	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	62.0	65.0
201603	170	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	81.0
201603	171	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	I agree with our Vice Chairman that the term RRP over quarter-end would be superfluous.	62.0	81.0
201603	172	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	I’ve argued that even with a potentially binding cap, it would be superfluous, but we don’t have to get into that discussion today.	62.0	81.0
201603	173	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	I think changes to the program should go in the direction of parsimony rather than adding bells and whistles.	62.0	81.0
201603	174	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	From here on out, we should keep it simple and wind it down.	62.0	81.0
201603	175	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	I don’t see a need to add any term RRPs even if we reduce the cap.	62.0	81.0
201603	176	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	I don’t see why we’d add the term RRPs to the mix.	62.0	81.0
201603	177	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	We should just keep it simple until we wind it down.	62.0	81.0
201603	178	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Would anybody else like to comment on this matter?	62.0	65.0
201603	179	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201603	180	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	On this momentous question, I’m going to ask for a show of hands.	63.0	65.0
201603	181	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let me start with, how many people would be in favor of no term RRPs, just use the overnight RRP?	63.0	65.0
201603	182	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	63.0	65.0
201603	183	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63.0	65.0
201603	184	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	I think I see 13.	63.0	65.0
201603	185	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	And how many people would prefer to offer term RRP?	63.0	65.0
201603	186	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	63.0	65.0
201603	187	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	I’m actually—I would vote for both.	63.0	999.0
201603	188	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	[Laughter]	63.0	999.0
201603	189	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63.0	65.0
201603	190	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	You’ve got it.	63.0	65.0
201603	191	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	I think we have a strong majority in favor of no term RRP.	63.0	65.0
201603	192	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we incorporate that into the directive, and we’ll vote on that tomorrow.	63.0	65.0
201603	193	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Next, now we have to vote on something.	63.0	65.0
201603	194	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	We need to ratify open market operations since the January meeting.	63.0	65.0
201603	195	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Do I have a motion?	63.0	65.0
201603	196	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	63.0	108.0
201603	197	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	63.0	65.0
201603	198	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11.0	999.0
201603	199	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I will be referring to the packet labeled “The US Outlook.”	11.0	999.0
201603	200	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	A small literature in the medical field shows that in the immediate aftermath of a change to daylight saving time, one can document a variety of small but statistically significant adverse outcomes, including unproductive staring at computer screens and workplace accidents.	11.0	999.0
201603	201	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I have experienced one of these—I’ll leave you to guess which—but I hope not to have the other visited on me.	11.0	999.0
201603	202	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	How about FOMC meeting outcomes?	11.0	96.0
201603	203	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So far as I know, that has not been explored in the literature.	11.0	999.0
201603	205	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The first panel in your summary exhibit shows the nowcasts of real GDP growth in the first quarter of this year that have been generated around the System.	11.0	999.0
201603	206	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The black line shows the Board staff weekly judgmental forecast, the red line tracks the daily progress of our own purely statistical factor model, and the blue dashed lines show the forecasts from the various models maintained by the Reserve Banks.	11.0	999.0
201603	207	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Through an intermeeting period that was notable for the volatility in financial markets, the news that was relevant to these models had generally pushed them toward a rough consensus that GDP growth this quarter has been steady, if unspectacular, somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 percent.	11.0	999.0
201603	208	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The Board’s dynamic factor model, shown by the red line, briefly became a little more pessimistic about current-quarter growth during the second half of February, but the source of that pessimism was the higher-than-expected reading on the CPI, not the gyrations in any of the financial variables that the model looks at.	11.0	999.0
201603	209	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Since then, the late-February report on consumption expenditures and early-March employment report boosted the model estimate to about 2½ percent.	11.0	999.0
201603	210	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	For what it’s worth, this model barely flinched in the face of this morning’s retail sales release and took its projection down a mere 15 basis points.	11.0	999.0
201603	211	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	On the judgmental side, in light of the retail sales release, we were a little more taken aback by that news, and, in response, we have revised down our estimate of GDP growth this quarter from about 2 percent—at the right end of the black line in the panel—to 1½ percent.	11.0	999.0
201603	212	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from the chart, the 1 percentage point discrepancy between the judgmental and model estimates is relatively wide and will provide an excellent opportunity for growth and learning for at least one of us.	11.0	999.0
201603	213	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	For now, we continue to expect real GDP growth at about a 2 percent annual rate in the second quarter.	11.0	999.0
201603	214	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The main engine of growth in our near-term forecast continues to be private domestic final demand, which we anticipate to increase at about a 2¾ percent annual pace over the first half of this year, supported by still-low interest rates, solid job gains, lagged effects of previous wealth gains, still-favorable readings on consumer sentiment, and what we continue to estimate is a net boost from low energy prices.	11.0	999.0
201603	215	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	On the other side of the ledger, we expect a slowing pace of inventory investment to subtract about ¼ percentage point from the growth of real GDP over the first half of this year, and we expect net exports to subtract about ¾ percentage point over that period.	11.0	999.0
201603	216	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Fueled partly by the recent bout of turbulence in financial markets, concern has increased during the past several months that the US economy might be heading for a recession.	11.0	999.0
201603	217	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The Board’s staff recently sent you a pair of memos summarizing our views.	11.0	999.0
201603	218	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	One of the memos uses a novel technique to demonstrate that, when it comes to discerning the odds of a recession in the next very small number of months, both nonfinancial and financial variables are informative.	11.0	999.0
201603	219	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	On the other hand, if the goal is to gauge the risk of recession as much as a year ahead, financial variables are more useful and nonfinancial ones not so much.	11.0	999.0
201603	220	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from panel 2, which reproduces some of the results of this exercise, on the basis of the February data that were available as of the time that the memo was closed, the model viewed the probability that the economy would be in recession at some point over the coming year as having risen since December, from very low levels to about their unconditional mean, which, in this model, is about 15 percent (as shown by the dashed line).	11.0	999.0
201603	221	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	For what it’s worth, my colleague Travis Berge was able to rerun the model this morning using updated information, and the difference in probability estimates is imperceptible.	11.0	999.0
201603	222	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I would note, however, that different models can generate markedly different results.	11.0	999.0
201603	223	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	For example, Alessandro Barbarino showed in his briefing yesterday that a model he maintains put the probability of two consecutive quarters with decreases in real GDP as being essentially nil at present.	11.0	999.0
201603	224	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	By contrast, the other memo that was distributed to you last week focused on the movements in a measure of investor sentiment, the so-called excess bond premium constructed by Gilchrist and Zakrajšek, and showed that the estimated cumulative probability of the economy entering into recession sometime over the next 12 months had risen sharply and was above 40 percent in February.	11.0	999.0
201603	225	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In the end, our own view of where the domestic economy currently stands and where it is headed is relatively little changed from where it was in January.	11.0	999.0
201603	226	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The two most recent employment reports point to a pace of improvement in the labor market about in line with our expectations.	11.0	999.0
201603	227	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Folding in this morning’s retail sales news, the recent indicators of aggregate spending and production have been a little below our January expectations.	11.0	999.0
201603	228	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	But the main metrics of financial market conditions that we look to in setting the medium-term projection are now a little more accommodative, on net, than at the time of the January Tealbook, importantly because the turbulence that peaked around mid-February appears to have largely gone into remission for now.	11.0	999.0
201603	229	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Still, in our view, the events of the intermeeting period validate our assessment that the risks to our outlook for real activity remain weighted to the downside, particularly because the capacity for countercyclical monetary and fiscal policy— both here and abroad—seems more limited than has been the historical norm.	11.0	999.0
201603	230	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Panel 3 reproduces a new exhibit from the Tealbook that gives estimates of the short-run real natural rate of interest from three models that are currently part of the System’s DSGE modeling project.	11.0	999.0
201603	231	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The natural rate of interest is defined here as the real risk-free interest rate that would obtain in the absence of nominal wage and price rigidities.	11.0	999.0
201603	232	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The shaded region in the panel shows the range of estimates across the three models, while the solid line gives the median.	11.0	999.0
201603	233	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In the wake of the Great Recession, all three models see aggregate demand as having been hit by adverse shocks that pushed the natural rate into negative territory; the effects of those shocks have been wearing off, but only slowly.	11.0	999.0
201603	234	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	For the past few quarters, the median estimate has hovered right around zero.	11.0	999.0
201603	235	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Over the next several years, however, the median estimate of the short-run real natural rate from these models rises very gradually, reaching about 1 percent at the end of 2018.	11.0	999.0
201603	236	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The next two panels provide an overview of the medium-term outlook for real activity.	11.0	999.0
201603	237	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from panel 4, our forecast of real GDP growth is marginally weaker in the near term but a shade stronger in 2017 and 2018, mostly because of the improvement in overall financial conditions since January.	11.0	999.0
201603	238	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	As shown in panel 5, our unemployment rate projection is almost indistinguishable from the January Tealbook through late next year but creeps a little lower in 2018, reaching 4.3 percent at the end of that year, three-tenths below our January forecast.	11.0	999.0
201603	239	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Part of this downward revision reflects the slightly stronger GDP growth in 2017 and 2018, but part also reflects the fact that in this round we reduced our estimate of the natural rate by one-tenth, to 5 percent, which lowered our projected path for the actual unemployment rate an equal amount.	11.0	999.0
201603	240	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The panels on the next page summarize the inflation forecast.	11.0	999.0
201603	241	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from panel 6, we marked up our projection for total PCE price inflation in the first half of the year.	11.0	999.0
201603	242	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	About half of this revision reflects a higher projected path of energy prices, while the remainder mainly owes to the fact that—as can be seen in panel 7— the January reading on core inflation came in higher than we expected.	11.0	999.0
201603	243	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	This upward surprise to core inflation was largely attributable to several erratic components— including the nonmarket component—where price changes in a single month have historically carried little signal about future inflation.	11.0	999.0
201603	244	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In addition, due to the residual seasonality that is present in the data, we tend to discount high core inflation readings that we see in the first part of the year.	11.0	999.0
201603	245	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Finally, the January jump in core goods prices that we saw seems difficult to square with declining import prices.	11.0	999.0
201603	246	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In light of these considerations, therefore, we left our core inflation projection beyond the near term about unrevised.	11.0	999.0
201603	247	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Tomorrow morning we will receive the February CPI report, which, together with today’s PPI data, will give us a better—but still incomplete—idea of what PCE price inflation was last month.	11.0	999.0
201603	248	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Panels 8 and 9 reproduce two exhibits from the new inflation monitor that we intend to include regularly in upcoming Tealbooks.	11.0	999.0
201603	249	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Thus far, as indicated by the black lines in these two panels, we still have made only small revisions to our total and core PCE price inflation projections since December.	11.0	999.0
201603	250	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The upside surprise in the core inflation reading for January shows up in panel 9 as the yellow-shaded box in the stack for 2016; as you can see, we have neither extrapolated that surprise forward nor assumed that it will be reversed.	11.0	999.0
201603	251	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We have revised down our forecast of core inflation in 2017 and 2018 by about one-tenth since December, partly because of the small adjustment that we made this round to our estimate of underlying inflation.	11.0	999.0
201603	252	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	As we discussed in a memo that we sent to you earlier this month, some market- and survey- based indicators of longer-term expected inflation, such as the Michigan survey’s measure of longer-term expected inflation shown in panel 10, have moved down noticeably over the past couple of years.	11.0	999.0
201603	253	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In light of the accumulation of evidence since we last adjusted our assumption regarding underlying inflation in June 2014, we judged that a small downward adjustment of 5 basis points better balanced the risks.	11.0	999.0
201603	254	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Finally, as Alessandro noted in his briefing yesterday, the latest data provide little sign of labor compensation having accelerated.	11.0	999.0
201603	255	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Under our interpretation of wage dynamics, which was discussed in a memo that you received last fall, the relatively flat contour of hourly compensation growth in recent years is attributable to a slowdown in trend productivity growth that has largely offset the effects of a continued reduction in labor market slack.	11.0	999.0
201603	256	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Over the medium term, we continue to expect that compensation gains will pick up gradually.	11.0	999.0
201603	257	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Beth Anne will continue our presentation.	11.0	999.0
201603	258	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201603	259	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	I’ll be referring to the materials titled, cleverly, “The International Outlook.”	11.0	999.0
201603	260	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Financial markets have taken us on a wild ride since your December SEP round, and many of the twists and turns along the way have been foreign.	11.0	999.0
201603	261	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Much of the market stress appeared to reflect underlying concerns about the pace of global growth.	11.0	999.0
201603	262	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Is the Chinese economy slowing sharply?	11.0	999.0
201603	263	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Did the dropoff in oil prices reflect a collapse in global demand?	11.0	999.0
201603	264	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Has monetary policy lost its mojo?	11.0	999.0
201603	265	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Against this, we received a steady stream of economic data that, while not brilliant, didn’t signal an acute dropoff in performance.	11.0	999.0
201603	266	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	That said, as seen in panel 1, we have again been surprised on the downside.	11.0	999.0
201603	267	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In December, we were expecting some moderation in Q4 foreign growth.	11.0	999.0
201603	268	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In the event, the step-down was somewhat greater than anticipated.	11.0	999.0
201603	269	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Interestingly, it was not concentrated in the emerging market economies, or EMEs, where, except for a few cases like Brazil, growth, though unspectacular, held up fairly well, including in emerging Asia.	11.0	999.0
201603	270	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Instead, our Q4 misses were concentrated in the advanced foreign economies, or AFEs, where we saw sharp dropoffs in Canadian and Japanese growth and less momentum in Europe than we had been anticipating.	11.0	999.0
201603	271	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	We have taken some signal from this weakness in putting together our forecast for this year.	11.0	999.0
201603	272	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In particular, although we appreciated the irony in previous forecasts of Europe being a relatively robust part of our outlook, we have now revised down our projection for the euro area and the United Kingdom noticeably.	11.0	999.0
201603	273	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	The revision reflects recent incoming data and greater financial stresses, especially in the banking sector.	11.0	999.0
201603	274	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In addition, we have built in some drag that arises from rising political uncertainty, including the risk of “Brexit.”	11.0	999.0
201603	275	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In assessing the strength and risks to the global outlook, we wrestled with how to interpret the Sturm und Drang over the Chinese exchange rate, the volatility in the price of oil, and concerns about the efficacy of monetary policy.	11.0	999.0
201603	276	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	The depreciation of the renminbi against the dollar (the black line in panel 2) and clumsy communication by Chinese authorities in early January reverberated negatively across global markets, and markets were calmed after the Chinese restabilized the renminbi against the dollar and, effectively, against the trade- weighted basket (the red line).	11.0	999.0
201603	277	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	We had not bought into the view held by some that the earlier renminbi weakening signaled a collapse in Chinese growth.	11.0	999.0
201603	278	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	We do, however, have Chinese growth slowing from almost 7 percent last year to 6¼ percent this year and 6 percent in 2018.	11.0	999.0
201603	279	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Over the next year, we assume the Chinese achieve a relatively flat path for the renminbi against the dollar and the basket.	11.0	999.0
201603	280	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	This currency forecast reflects several factors:  recent communications by authorities that have stressed the goal of exchange rate stability, waning outflow pressures as repayment of external debt winds down, China’s significant foreign exchange reserves and huge current account surplus, and authorities’ recognition of the economic and credibility costs that would follow from a disruptive devaluation.	11.0	999.0
201603	281	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	But, as Simon has pointed out, there are downside risks to this exchange rate forecast, especially if growth does not pick up after this quarter.	11.0	999.0
201603	282	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	This stability of the renminbi contributes to our forecast of a stable dollar, shown in panel 3.	11.0	999.0
201603	283	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	After appreciating sharply in early January on flight-to-safety flows, the dollar has depreciated against most currencies despite significant easing by AFE central banks and as concerns about global growth have lessened.	11.0	999.0
201603	284	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	On net, these moves have left the value of the broad real dollar remarkably little changed since December.	11.0	999.0
201603	285	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	For the period ahead, we see the dollar appreciating against the AFE currencies as markets are surprised by the extent of monetary policy divergence between the United States and other advanced economies.	11.0	999.0
201603	286	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	This appreciation is almost fully offset by some dollar depreciation against the EME currencies.	11.0	999.0
201603	287	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	The early-year market tailspin was also fueled by concerns about a lack of floor on oil prices, as both spot and far futures prices (panel 4) fell sharply further.	11.0	999.0
201603	288	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Although spot prices have recovered, far futures prices remain down since December, signaling that market participants expect very low oil prices to persist.	11.0	999.0
201603	289	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Much of the volatility of late seems to be linked to news on supply, including incoming data showing rising inventories and robust production, and the waning and waxing— possibly waning—of OPEC members’ willingness to commit to production limits.	11.0	999.0
201603	290	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Even so, swings in oil prices have been strongly positively correlated with US equity prices and forward inflation compensation.	11.0	999.0
201603	291	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	This elevated correlation appears to be importantly reflecting a greater sense of uncertainty about the global outlook.	11.0	999.0
201603	292	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In our baseline, we assume that oil prices follow the futures path, rising ever so slightly over the forecast period but following a lower trajectory than in December.	11.0	999.0
201603	293	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	This lower trajectory led us to shift down our near-term growth forecast for commodity-producing countries—in particular, Canada and Mexico—but still supports the broad recovery of growth abroad.	11.0	999.0
201603	294	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	The fact that oil prices are not expected to fall further also contributes to our expectation of a gradual rise in global inflation (panel 5).	11.0	999.0
201603	295	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	That said, the inflation environment looks more concerning than before:  We have a somewhat weaker outlook for growth; inflation data have disappointed in some AFEs; and there has been a downshift in market-based measures of inflation compensation, which we are not willing to wholly discount.	11.0	999.0
201603	296	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Although we might expect central banks to look through the decline in energy prices, these other developments have spurred greater monetary policy accommodation in Japan and Europe, as discussed by Simon, and since December we also built in more accommodative future policy—with a more gradual rise in rates for Canada and the United Kingdom (panel 6), some additional easing by the Bank of Japan (not shown), and a much larger balance sheet for the ECB (panel 7).	11.0	999.0
201603	297	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	However, the adverse market reaction in the wake of the Bank of Japan’s shift into negative interest rates, the Riksbank’s further cut into negative territory, and the most recent ECB announcements have raised questions about the effectiveness of further monetary policy easing.	11.0	999.0
201603	298	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	As Simon detailed, in the aftermath of the BOJ announcement in late January, the yen appreciated, inflation compensation measures fell, and bank equity prices plunged.	11.0	999.0
201603	299	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In the case of the ECB, press conference comments by President Draghi ruling out further rate cuts led equity prices to decline and bond yields and the euro to rise.	11.0	999.0
201603	300	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	That said, to borrow from Mark Twain, we think reports of the death of monetary policy have been greatly exaggerated.	11.0	999.0
201603	301	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Although the market reaction has been disappointing, it is premature to judge the outcome of recent actions.	11.0	999.0
201603	302	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Part of the negative response to the BOJ’s decision appears to reflect the fact that participants were caught off guard by earlier BOJ statements ruling out negative rates and were thus left scrambling to adjust.	11.0	999.0
201603	303	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	And the ECB appeared to undermine the strength of its actions by seeming to limit itself for the period ahead.	11.0	999.0
201603	304	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Financial markets have been quite volatile, and these initial reactions may fade.	11.0	999.0
201603	305	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Even traditional monetary policy takes time to transmit, and it will take some time to understand and adjust to these more unconventional polices.	11.0	999.0
201603	306	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	But the experience has been a cautionary one.	11.0	999.0
201603	307	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In the face of continued tepid growth and persistently low inflation, central banks are being stretched to design ever more complex and experimental policies that pose increasing challenges in terms of communication, implementation, and transmission.	11.0	999.0
201603	308	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Should monetary policy tools prove to be weaker than we anticipate, the costs of a downturn become greater.	11.0	999.0
201603	309	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	As discussed in your next exhibit, in the forecast we took a stand that the adverse market moves earlier this year were not a harbinger of a sharp step-down in global growth.	11.0	999.0
201603	310	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	But we would not completely discount such fears.	11.0	999.0
201603	311	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In particular, in the Tealbook, we present estimates of recession probabilities for the world economy on the basis of indicators of global macroeconomic activity and financial market conditions.	11.0	999.0
201603	312	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	As outlined for reference in panel 8 and shown in panel 9, our estimated probit model appears to signal the cyclical slowdowns in the world economy since the 1970s, showing increases in the estimated probability ahead of recessions.	11.0	999.0
201603	313	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Because of the deterioration in macroeconomic and financial conditions through February, the estimated probability of recession has risen, pointing to downside risks to the global outlook.	11.0	999.0
201603	314	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In the Tealbook, we looked at the implications for the United States of a global recession with and without effective foreign monetary policy actions.	11.0	999.0
201603	315	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	As described in panel 10, in both scenarios, foreign economies experience sharply tighter financial conditions and declines in confidence, and foreign central banks respond with monetary stimulus.	11.0	999.0
201603	316	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In the first scenario, policy stimulus both boosts domestic demand and depresses the value of the currency.	11.0	999.0
201603	317	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	As seen by the red line in panel 11, despite this stimulus, foreign GDP growth falls to 1 percent, compared with around 3 percent in the baseline.	11.0	999.0
201603	318	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	As a result, the broad real dollar (panel 12) rises 4 percent, and US growth (panel 13) slows, leading to a somewhat lower trajectory for the federal funds rate (panel 14).	11.0	999.0
201603	319	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In the next scenario, measures implemented by foreign central banks prove ineffective at stimulating domestic demand, with the boost to GDP coming through the exchange rate.	11.0	999.0
201603	320	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In this case, foreign GDP growth falls into negative territory, and the broad real dollar appreciates almost 9 percent.	11.0	999.0
201603	321	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Consequently, US real GDP growth slows to below 1 percent, and the federal funds rate follows a much shallower path than in the baseline.	11.0	999.0
201603	322	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	So what do we make of all this?	11.0	999.0
201603	323	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	The wild ride I alluded to at the beginning has, in many respects, left us close to where we started, but changed for the journey.	11.0	999.0
201603	324	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	We are a bit more uncertain about the trajectory of the global economy; a bit more unsettled about the path for global inflation, including how well anchored inflation expectations are; and a bit more wary about the efficacy of monetary policy abroad to achieve its targets.	11.0	999.0
201603	325	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201603	326	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Bob Tetlow will now proceed.	11.0	999.0
201603	327	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Thank you, Beth Anne.	11.0	999.0
201603	328	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	I will be referring to the packet labeled “Material for Briefing on the Summary of Economic Projections.”	11.0	999.0
201603	329	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Exhibit 1 summarizes your economic projections, which, as you know, are conditional on your individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.	11.0	999.0
201603	330	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	As shown in the top panel, a substantial majority of you project that real GDP growth this year will be at least a bit above your assessments of its longer-run rate and anticipate real output to either grow at about the same pace in 2017, or to decelerate, before converging toward its longer-run rate in 2018.	11.0	999.0
201603	331	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Overall, the medians of your projections for real GDP growth this year and next are a bit above the median projection of 2 percent growth in the longer run.	11.0	999.0
201603	332	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	As shown in the second panel, all of you see the unemployment rate declining to, or below, your estimate of its longer-run value by the end of this year, and most of you expect the unemployment rate to decline somewhat further in 2017.	11.0	999.0
201603	333	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	As can be seen in the third panel, on the heels of headline PCE inflation of just 0.5 percent last year, the median of your projections moves up to 1.2 percent in 2016 and 1.9 percent in 2017.	11.0	999.0
201603	334	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Most of you project that headline PCE inflation will reach the Committee’s objective by 2018, and all but three of you expect inflation, in that year, to be within 0.1 percentage point of 2 percent.	11.0	999.0
201603	335	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	As the bottom panel shows, almost all of you expect core inflation to increase gradually over the course of the next three years.	11.0	999.0
201603	336	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Exhibit 2 compares the medians and ranges of your current projections with those in the December Summary of Economic Projections as well as the March Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201603	337	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	As can be seen in the top panel, your median projections for real GDP growth in 2016 and 2017 are 0.2 percentage point and 0.1 percentage point lower, respectively, than in December.	11.0	999.0
201603	338	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Most of you revised down projected growth this year.	11.0	999.0
201603	339	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Only a few of you anticipate some making-up of this shortfall in subsequent years.	11.0	999.0
201603	340	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	As the second panel shows, the median of your forecasts for the unemployment rate is a bit lower in 2017 and 2018 than in December.	11.0	999.0
201603	341	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	However, many of you also reduced your estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, and, thus, although a dozen of you expect the unemployment rate to undershoot its longer-run level this year, that is fewer of you than was the case in December.	11.0	999.0
201603	342	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Even so, the median of your unemployment gaps for this projection is the same as in December.	11.0	999.0
201603	343	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Many of you made substantial downward revisions to your projections for total PCE inflation this year, leaving the median projection, shown in the third panel, down 0.4 percentage point from December’s value.	11.0	999.0
201603	344	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	In contrast, most of you did not change your projection for total PCE inflation at longer horizons.	11.0	999.0
201603	345	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	This in part reflected, as several of you noted, an expectation on your part that the effects of lower oil prices would fade.	11.0	999.0
201603	346	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	As indicated in the final panel, the median path for core PCE inflation was little changed from December.	11.0	999.0
201603	347	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	For both inflation measures, the medians of your projections are a bit above the staff forecast, as has been the case for some time now.	11.0	999.0
201603	348	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Exhibit 3 provides an overview of your assessments of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate over the forecast horizon and in the longer run.	11.0	999.0
201603	349	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	The medians of your funds rate projections, indicated by the red lines in the top panel, stand at 0.9 percent at the end of 2016, 1.9 percent at the end of 2017, 3.0 percent at the end of 2018, and 3¼ percent in the longer run.	11.0	999.0
201603	350	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Since December, most of you have revised down your projected path for the federal funds rate over the next three years.	11.0	999.0
201603	351	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Seven participants reduced their estimates of the longer-run federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, and no participant raised his or her projection of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate for any forecast date.	11.0	999.0
201603	352	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Among the reasons you cited for a more gradual pace of increases in the federal funds rate were a tightening in financial conditions since December, lower energy prices, and reductions in your estimates of longer-run growth or the longer-run normal unemployment rate.	11.0	999.0
201603	353	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Almost all of you project that, at the end of 2018, the appropriate level of the federal funds rates will still lie below your individual judgments of its longer-run level.	11.0	999.0
201603	354	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	The red diamonds in the upper panel of exhibit 3 show the medians of interest rate prescriptions based on a non-inertial Taylor (1999) rule, taking as given your projections for core inflation, the unemployment gap, and the longer-run nominal federal funds rate.	11.0	999.0
201603	355	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Comparing these to the same chart for December, displayed in the lower panel, shows that the median prescription for the end of 2016 shifted down 60 basis points, about the same as the shift in the median of your federal funds rate projections.	11.0	999.0
201603	356	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	By contrast, for 2017 and 2018, the downward revisions in the federal funds rate prescribed by the Taylor rule are small to negligible and notably less than the reductions in the median of your projections.	11.0	999.0
201603	357	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Exhibit 4 shows your assessments of uncertainty and risks surrounding your economic projections.	11.0	999.0
201603	358	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	As shown in the figures to the left, your views regarding uncertainty have not changed in a material way since December.	11.0	999.0
201603	359	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Almost all of you judge the level of uncertainty about your individual projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly similar to the average levels over the past 20 years.	11.0	999.0
201603	360	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	In contrast, your assessments of the risks to GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and both headline and core inflation have shifted adversely since December.	11.0	999.0
201603	361	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	As shown in the panels to the right, about half of you now see the risks to real GDP growth as weighted to the downside—up from just three in December.	11.0	999.0
201603	362	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Four of you now see risks to the unemployment rate as skewed toward higher unemployment—two more than in December—while two of you continue to see risks weighted toward lower unemployment.	11.0	999.0
201603	363	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Your explanations pointed to favorable labor market news over the past three months as a reason why the increase in pessimism regarding the risks to unemployment was less widespread than for real GDP.	11.0	999.0
201603	364	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	You also cited financial market and global economic conditions, on their own or coupled with the limited capacity—or willingness—of policymakers to respond to economic disturbances, as part of the reason for the change in your assessments of risk.	11.0	999.0
201603	365	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	On inflation, 11 of you indicated that the risks to your headline inflation forecasts are skewed to the downside, up from 7 in December; all but 1 of you saw the same tilt to the risks for core inflation.	11.0	999.0
201603	366	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Many of you noted the deterioration, or an absence of improvement, in indicators of long-term inflation expectations as contributing to increased downside risks for inflation, while some pointed to the further declines in energy prices.	11.0	999.0
201603	367	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	For the remainder of this briefing, I will build on material in exhibit 4 by reviewing the history of your assessments of uncertainty and risks, beginning with the first SEP that included your assessments of appropriate policy in January 2012.	11.0	999.0
201603	368	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Exhibit 5 shows a diffusion index of your assessments of uncertainty by projection date.	11.0	999.0
201603	369	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	The index is constructed as the fraction of respondents who said that uncertainty at the time was higher than the average level over the previous 20 years, minus the fraction of respondents who said that uncertainty was lower.	11.0	999.0
201603	370	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Several observations are worth noting.	11.0	999.0
201603	371	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	First, participants have never collectively judged uncertainty for any variable to be lower than average.	11.0	999.0
201603	372	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Second, assessed uncertainty regarding real GDP growth and the unemployment rate began at high levels and has been largely on a downward trend since.	11.0	999.0
201603	373	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	For the two inflation measures, you were less unified in viewing uncertainty as high initially, and the subsequent decline in the indexes was not maintained, presumably because of a sequence of oil price declines beginning in mid-2014.	11.0	999.0
201603	374	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Finally, uncertainty surrounding headline and especially core PCE inflation forecasts has undergone a modest rebound in the past two years, with the rebound in uncertainty regarding core inflation occurring even though downward pressure on prices was arguably contained within noncore prices, and labor market conditions had continued to improve.	11.0	999.0
201603	375	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Exhibit 6 provides a similar exercise for the risks associated with your forecasts.	11.0	999.0
201603	376	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Over the period shown, risk perceptions have nearly always been skewed to the pessimistic side.	11.0	999.0
201603	377	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	But whereas the pessimism for real variables has diminished over time, or at least until 2015, the opposite has occurred for inflation.	11.0	999.0
201603	378	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Your assessments for both headline and core PCE inflation, which in 2012 showed roughly no skew, have turned somewhat pessimistic over the past several years.	11.0	999.0
201603	379	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Of note, some of this degradation in risk assessment coincided with a period of stronger-than-potential output growth and above-trend employment gains and started before oil prices began their marked decline in mid-2014.	11.0	999.0
201603	380	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	The indexes differ very little across the two inflation measures, suggesting that some participants have regarded risks emanating from noncore sources, such as energy prices, as affecting the risks to both core and headline inflation in a similar fashion.	11.0	999.0
201603	381	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201603	382	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	That concludes our presentations.	11.0	999.0
201603	383	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	We welcome your questions.	11.0	999.0
201603	384	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	The floor is open for questions for any of the presenters.	12.0	65.0
201603	385	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, let me start off with a question for David on consumer spending and your reaction to this morning’s retail sales release.	12.0	65.0
201603	386	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	You said that the judgmental forecast has had a very substantial downward revision.	12.0	65.0
201603	387	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	It looks like a larger downward revision than seen in other comments this morning.	12.0	65.0
201603	388	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	You also mentioned, I think, that the Board model doesn’t react very much, or substantially less.	12.0	65.0
201603	389	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Could you talk a little bit more about that data release and what you saw in it that led to such a significant change?	12.0	65.0
201603	390	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In the current quarter, our basic approach is to attempt to mimic, as much as possible, the construction methods that the BEA will use in putting together GDP.	12.0	999.0
201603	391	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We’re trying to process the information in a parallel manner to the way that the statistical agency will use it to put together the GDP estimate.	12.0	999.0
201603	392	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We’re attempting to, for example, build in an assessment of serial correlation.	12.0	999.0
201603	393	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So, for example, there is a slight tendency of big moves in one direction in retail sales to be a little bit offset in subsequent months, so our reaction on the judgmental side takes that into account.	12.0	999.0
201603	394	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	It’s not very large.	12.0	999.0
201603	395	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The main surprise here in this morning’s release is not actually the estimate of growth in February.	12.0	999.0
201603	396	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	It’s the January estimate, which was totally extraordinary.	12.0	999.0
201603	397	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I didn’t mention in my remarks that, according to our sector specialist, that revision was in the leftmost 1 percentile of revisions of retail sales from the prior month.	12.0	999.0
201603	398	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So it was really a very large, very unusual statistical event.	12.0	999.0
201603	399	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The revisions were quite widespread across categories of spending.	12.0	999.0
201603	400	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	They were in general merchandise stores, in the personal and health-care areas, and in food services, so it wasn’t that there was an anomaly in one particular area.	12.0	999.0
201603	401	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We took our judgmental estimate down about ½ percentage point, and the statistical black box model that I referenced took it down about 15 basis points, so by about one-third as much.	12.0	999.0
201603	402	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We’re still, to be honest, gaining experience with how that model reacts.	12.0	999.0
201603	403	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	One of the reasons why I was interested to show it is that it does have a little greater variance, actually, as you can see in that top panel, in its release revisions over this one episode than the judgmental process has.	12.0	999.0
201603	404	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t know at this point which is going to prove more accurate.	12.0	999.0
201603	405	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The sad fact of the matter is that both its estimate and ours are well within the 70 percent confidence interval.	12.0	999.0
201603	406	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I think it does suggest that the momentum of aggregate demand was just a little bit less than we had thought in our Tealbook projection.	12.0	999.0
201603	407	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Whether it’s just a tiny bit, as the model suggests, or more substantial, as our judgmental operation would suggest, is yet to be seen.	12.0	999.0
201603	408	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I think that’s about what I know at this point.	12.0	999.0
201603	409	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I have no reason to discount the retail sales reading.	12.0	999.0
201603	410	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The second estimate is based on a much wider sample of selling institutions than the first one is, so it should be a more complete estimate.	12.0	999.0
201603	411	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	But, as I say, there is a fundamental puzzle.	12.0	999.0
201603	412	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	This was a very big revision.	12.0	999.0
201603	413	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	You’re assuming that services is also moved down?	12.0	65.0
201603	414	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	No, we made no adjustment to the services.	12.0	999.0
201603	415	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The retail sales release only covers goods that are sold through stores.	12.0	999.0
201603	416	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	But you get that big—	12.0	65.0
201603	417	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We get that big of a reaction just from this.	12.0	999.0
201603	418	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Just from this.	12.0	65.0
201603	419	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	That’s right.	12.0	999.0
201603	420	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	As I say, it was a very big event, statistically speaking.	12.0	999.0
201603	421	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	12.0	65.0
201603	422	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	96.0
201603	423	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I have a question for Beth Anne, or an observation that you could comment on.	12.0	96.0
201603	424	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In exhibit 2, chart 9, you show a relatively high probability of recession.	12.0	96.0
201603	425	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	You also express your worries about the effectiveness of monetary policy.	12.0	96.0
201603	426	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	We’ve had chronic misses on the foreign growth outlook over the past few years.	12.0	96.0
201603	427	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	So it raises the question, do you think we are too optimistic about the growth forecast in exhibit 1, or do you think that that’s the modal forecast and there’s a big skew in terms of probability density to the downside?	12.0	96.0
201603	428	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s the question.	12.0	96.0
201603	429	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	And I have a little trouble reconciling chart 9 with the idea of accelerating global growth.	12.0	96.0
201603	430	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Should I have that problem?	12.0	96.0
201603	431	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	We will always be worried about global growth.	12.0	999.0
201603	432	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	So it’s true, we have had serial downward revisions, and I personally think it is probably more risk skewed to the downside than it is to the growth trajectory.	12.0	999.0
201603	433	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	But it is harder and harder to tell stories on the upside of what the risks could be.	12.0	999.0
201603	434	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	One of them might be that over this time, part of our downward revision has come because we have underestimated the costs of low oil prices on oil- producing economies, especially Canada and Mexico, which have a very high trade weight for us.	12.0	999.0
201603	435	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Research that we have done here and that others have done has suggested that it could be that the boost to consumption is delayed, and that we should be seeing that.	12.0	999.0
201603	436	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	So we view that as one upside risk to our forecast.	12.0	999.0
201603	437	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	And then, to look at the elevated probability, that’s come down a little bit with the more recent data that we’ve gotten, including some good IP data from the euro area today, and some diminution of financial stresses, but it still remains high.	12.0	999.0
201603	438	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	One reason it might be elevated is because we look at that estimate using an average across the whole period for global growth.	12.0	999.0
201603	439	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	If you have, like you suggested, some secular trend down in potential output in these economies, that may be overindicating a recession when we are seeing lower growth.	12.0	999.0
201603	440	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	That said, the growth we got in 2015 on average was very, very low for the global economy, and it’s hard to imagine that it would stay that low.	12.0	999.0
201603	441	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I, for one, found your presentation pretty sobering.	12.0	96.0
201603	442	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	12.0	65.0
201603	443	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	102.0
201603	444	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have a couple of questions on the outlook and the presentation of the outlook for David Wilcox.	12.0	102.0
201603	445	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	One is on the inflation data.	12.0	102.0
201603	446	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	In reading the Tealbook and listening to your presentation, you put in a word of caution about overinterpreting the January PCE price index reading.	12.0	102.0
201603	447	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I am reminded of a comment that Governor Brainard made at the US Monetary Policy Forum, which I thought was a great way to say this: that we want to be data dependent but not data-point dependent—so, very much in the spirit of that.	12.0	102.0
201603	448	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I get the fact that we should be careful, that this could be noise.	12.0	102.0
201603	449	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, I am looking at all of the 12-month changes, and some of the arguments you gave were about residual seasonality.	12.0	102.0
201603	450	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, 12-month changes may be minimizing some of that.	12.0	102.0
201603	451	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I am also looking at core and other trimmed means, and things like that, which, again, are designed to smooth on the cross-section and on the time dimension here.	12.0	102.0
201603	452	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And when I look at the past 6 months or the past 12 months, it doesn’t matter how you look at this—over the past 6 months, core PCE 12-month changes is up four-tenths, market-based core PCE is up five-tenths, and trimmed mean is up three-tenths.	12.0	102.0
201603	453	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Over the past 12 months, it is even larger.	12.0	102.0
201603	454	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, how do I put these two together?	12.0	102.0
201603	455	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It seems like you were telling stories about noise in the data versus the idea of “no matter how I clean the data up over the time dimension or cross- section, I kind of get the same answer.”	12.0	102.0
201603	456	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	That is my first question.	12.0	102.0
201603	457	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	My second question is on labor markets, so maybe it would be good to do that one first.	12.0	102.0
201603	458	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Maybe I better get this one off the stack.	12.0	999.0
201603	459	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So there has been some pickup across inflation measures, just as you suggest, but we think it is likely to recede in the near term some.	12.0	999.0
201603	460	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Let me just give you one example, and our analysts have parsed this at a very fine level of detail.	12.0	999.0
201603	461	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	A notable element of the upward surprise in January, just to give you a little bit of a flavor of the general kind of feeling that you come away with, is that jewelry prices, which is an utterly tiny—	12.0	999.0
201603	462	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s a huge part of my spending.	12.0	102.0
201603	463	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	12.0	102.0
201603	464	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I am sure.	12.0	999.0
201603	465	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	You hide it well.	12.0	999.0
201603	466	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	[Laughter]	12.0	999.0
201603	467	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Jewelry prices increased 4 percent in one month, not at an annual rate, but they were flat over 2015.	12.0	999.0
201603	468	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	If I showed you a picture and asked you what piece of data didn’t fit, that would jump out.	12.0	999.0
201603	469	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Now, there is always a danger of making excuses for the pieces of evidence that are inconvenient, and there is a chance that that’s going on here.	12.0	999.0
201603	470	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The pattern of the past few years is that we have tended to get upside surprises in the first half of the year.	12.0	999.0
201603	471	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Last year was the first year when we resisted being overly sensitive to those upside surprises in the first half of the year, and that turned out to be the correct judgment.	12.0	999.0
201603	472	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In the prior years, we revised up our estimate, and, retrospectively, that turned out to be a mistake.	12.0	999.0
201603	473	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Alessandro showed, I thought, quite a striking panel yesterday—I don’t know whether you had a chance to take a look at the briefing—that showed the monthly price increases by month over the past 10 years.	12.0	999.0
201603	474	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	There is really quite a strong pattern that documents the claim of residual seasonality.	12.0	999.0
201603	475	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Now, you might say, well, if you knew about the residual seasonality going in, you shouldn’t have been surprised ex post.	12.0	999.0
201603	476	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	And that would be true on average, but it turns out that the timing of when it shows up by month is also quite variable.	12.0	999.0
201603	477	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Last year, I believe, if memory serves, it was the second quarter that was higher than normal.	12.0	999.0
201603	478	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So it is, at this point, a hypothesis.	12.0	999.0
201603	479	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	It is nothing we can prove that we shouldn’t adjust upward, but it is a hypothesis that is founded on the evidence and the experience of the past few years and supported by the examination of some of these detailed price increases.	12.0	999.0
201603	480	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	That is a perfectly reasonable response.	12.0	102.0
201603	481	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But on the 12-month changes—your story is very subtle, then, about residual seasonality.	12.0	102.0
201603	482	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Because if you do 12-month changes, you don’t have residual seasonality.	12.0	102.0
201603	483	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So it is really maybe more about, as in the briefing, that this varies over time, and so there may still be some leakage into the data.	12.0	102.0
201603	484	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But that’s something we will get a better picture on in the next few months, I am guessing.	12.0	102.0
201603	485	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	That is correct.	12.0	999.0
201603	486	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay.	12.0	102.0
201603	487	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	My second question is really more of, I think the staff needed a little help with thinking about some upside risks to the outlook, on the basis of my reading of the Tealbook.	12.0	102.0
201603	488	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	You know, if you would come to California more often, you will feel better.	12.0	102.0
201603	489	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s sunnier.	12.0	102.0
201603	490	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It will help you there.	12.0	102.0
201603	491	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	One of the scenarios that I was struck by in the Tealbook is actually related to productivity growth.	12.0	102.0
201603	492	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	You have productivity growth output per hour this year of 1.7 percent.	12.0	102.0
201603	493	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I am just reading off the table.	12.0	102.0
201603	494	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Last year it was about—a little more than 1 percentage point slower than that, roughly ½ percentage point.	12.0	102.0
201603	495	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	If we were to generate the 2 percent, 2¼ percent GDP growth that we are penciling in and we did a replay of productivity growth last year of about six-tenths—so 1 percentage point less productivity growth than in the Tealbook—where would the unemployment rate be at the end of the year, all else being equal?	12.0	102.0
201603	496	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I am just trying to think through—last year one of the big reasons the unemployment rate fell 0.6 percentage point is that we had essentially no productivity growth.	12.0	102.0
201603	497	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And you all have a very big rebound in productivity growth coming this year.	12.0	102.0
201603	498	2016-03-16	meeting	WASCHER	So let me try to do this in my head.	12.0	999.0
201603	499	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Well, knock off 1 percentage point of productivity growth.	12.0	102.0
201603	500	2016-03-16	meeting	WASCHER	Let’s see.	12.0	999.0
201603	501	2016-03-16	meeting	WASCHER	I am guessing that would be roughly another ¼ percentage point off the unemployment rate, if I am doing it in my head correctly.	12.0	999.0
201603	502	2016-03-16	meeting	WASCHER	So it would be down about 4 percent—but not next year.	12.0	999.0
201603	503	2016-03-16	meeting	WASCHER	So next year we would be down around—we have 4.8 currently, so we would be down closer to 4½ percent on your counterfactual, I think.	12.0	999.0
201603	504	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So the total decline would be around ½ percentage point.	12.0	102.0
201603	505	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	You have a little bit of pickup in—	12.0	102.0
201603	506	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I am going to be a little more disagreeable than that and question—the math of what you suggest is absolutely correct.	12.0	999.0
201603	507	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I think the plausibility of the experiment—it feels to me like an artificial experiment to hypothesize that we would get the same GDP growth with that much lower productivity.	12.0	999.0
201603	508	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But we did that last year.	12.0	102.0
201603	509	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	We had 1.9 percent GDP growth.	12.0	102.0
201603	510	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	We had 0.6 percent productivity growth.	12.0	102.0
201603	511	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I am just saying, if we relived the big data of last year, we would have an unemployment drop of six-tenths.	12.0	102.0
201603	512	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It is not implausible.	12.0	102.0
201603	513	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	We did it last year.	12.0	102.0
201603	514	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	It is not implausible.	12.0	999.0
201603	515	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t think it’s the most likely—	12.0	999.0
201603	516	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Sure.	12.0	102.0
201603	517	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	No, I was just trying to think through the scenario.	12.0	102.0
201603	518	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Right.	12.0	999.0
201603	519	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t think it is an evenly balanced probability outcome.	12.0	999.0
201603	520	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I think that’s a tail hypothesis.	12.0	999.0
201603	521	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	It’s an upside risk.	12.0	999.0
201603	522	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	That is what I thought President Williams was saying.	12.0	97.0
201603	523	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201603	524	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	We had four years of productivity growth of essentially zero.	12.0	102.0
201603	525	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So it doesn’t seem that implausible.	12.0	102.0
201603	526	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201603	527	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Let me elaborate a little bit on what I’m thinking.	12.0	999.0
201603	528	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	For example, next Tealbook we are going to have one of our alternative view franchises, another installment in that, that will point out that, just as you suggest, we have been repeatedly disappointed, gravely disappointed, to the downside, and arguing that maybe we ought to hypothesize a much worse productivity outlook.	12.0	999.0
201603	529	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Now, if we were to adopt that, and we may well move in that direction, we would also move our projection for actual GDP growth down significantly as well.	12.0	999.0
201603	530	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	That’s the basic point I’m getting at.	12.0	999.0
201603	531	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	12.0	102.0
201603	532	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	12.0	65.0
201603	533	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	94.0
201603	534	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I have several questions.	12.0	94.0
201603	535	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	The first one is on the US outlook—panel number 2, “Recession Probabilities at Various Horizons.”	12.0	94.0
201603	536	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	During your presentation of this, you said, despite what I think this picture says, that you thought that the recession risks were weighted to the downside.	12.0	94.0
201603	537	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	So let me give you a different interpretation of this picture.	12.0	94.0
201603	538	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	These recession probability models actually did fairly well in the 2006−07 time frame, as they did signal that something was amiss in the US economy, and our subsequent recession actually occurred.	12.0	94.0
201603	539	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	And I would interpret that as being that the recession probabilities went up to, say, 30 percent when the unconditional probability is about 15 percent.	12.0	94.0
201603	540	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Now, if you look at the current situation, we are either below the unconditional probability or at the unconditional probability.	12.0	94.0
201603	541	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	So if you just wanted to use these recession probability models to say what the risks were, maybe a sensible thing would be to say, well, we are about where we expect to be in terms of recession probability.	12.0	94.0
201603	542	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I think that would be fine as far as the information that’s available to this model.	12.0	999.0
201603	543	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	What this model doesn’t know is anything about the capacity of fiscal policy or monetary policy to combat an adverse shock, and that’s the basis for our assessment in the Tealbook that the risks are weighted mainly to the downside for real activity.	12.0	999.0
201603	544	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	This model also doesn’t know anything about the slower trend growth of real output.	12.0	999.0
201603	545	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Yes.	12.0	94.0
201603	546	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Well, the recession definition maybe changes if you have a different growth rate.	12.0	94.0
201603	547	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Obviously, a more slowly growing economy would have—	12.0	94.0
201603	548	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t know how the NBER will handle their determination of what constitutes a recession.	12.0	999.0
201603	549	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12.0	94.0
201603	550	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I want to turn to the international outlook panels 8 and 9, which Vice Chairman Dudley has already referred to.	12.0	94.0
201603	551	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I want to learn more about this.	12.0	94.0
201603	552	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	It says “world recession defined as countries comprising two-thirds of world GDP in recession.”	12.0	94.0
201603	553	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Do we literally mean two-thirds of the GDP in the world has had two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth?	12.0	94.0
201603	554	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I think that’s not what you mean, but—	12.0	94.0
201603	555	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	We use the Economic Cycle Research Institute dating methodology.	12.0	999.0
201603	556	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	It does a sort of NBER-esque dating methodology rather than two consecutive quarters of negative growth, but they’re fairly similar.	12.0	999.0
201603	557	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	This database covers 22 countries.	12.0	999.0
201603	558	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	We actually looked at a few more.	12.0	999.0
201603	559	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	But what it does is, we define a world recession as occurring when countries representing two-thirds of world GDP are classified as being in recession by this database’s definition.	12.0	999.0
201603	560	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Right.	12.0	94.0
201603	561	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	If China is one of those countries, does it mean China is actually shrinking, or does it mean China is growing at 3 percent?	12.0	94.0
201603	562	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	I actually don’t know how they do China.	12.0	999.0
201603	563	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Well, for the ones I’ve seen, it really amounts to saying global growth slows to, say, below 2 percent.	12.0	94.0
201603	564	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	So this is a way of capturing that.	12.0	999.0
201603	565	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Because if the world is in recession, it will pull Chinese growth down as well to levels that we could consider, given its potential, to be weak.	12.0	999.0
201603	566	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	But two-thirds of the countries are not really in recession in the conventional sense as defined inside the United States.	12.0	94.0
201603	567	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	To the extent that this mimics the NBER dating process, it would be the countries comprising two-thirds of world GDP, not two-thirds of the countries in the world.	12.0	999.0
201603	568	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Also, why not just define it as a certain—some global growth rate that you want to call recession, and put a dotted line there?	12.0	94.0
201603	569	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	This is one way of doing that.	12.0	999.0
201603	570	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	There are different ways of doing that, and we also did some robustness checks.	12.0	999.0
201603	571	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	We did a two-thirds measure.	12.0	999.0
201603	572	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	We looked at it if it were 60 percent.	12.0	999.0
201603	573	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	We looked at it if it were 70 percent.	12.0	999.0
201603	574	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	The probability of recession changes, but also the sort of unconditional probability changes, and what you observe in each of those cases, if you varied the definition, was an increase in the probability.	12.0	999.0
201603	575	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Well, I guess another way to say this—I’m looking at these shaded regions back here, 75, 80, and so on.	12.0	94.0
201603	576	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Global growth has not been negative, except, I think, for a single quarter.	12.0	94.0
201603	577	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	So what are these shaded regions indicating?	12.0	94.0
201603	578	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Those shaded regions are regions in which countries comprising two- thirds of the world’s GDP are calculated as being in recession.	12.0	999.0
201603	579	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	So global growth is—	12.0	999.0
201603	580	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	What is the world GDP growth rate in these shaded regions?	12.0	94.0
201603	581	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I say that it’s still positive.	12.0	94.0
201603	582	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Per capita is the issue, I think, a little bit.	12.0	999.0
201603	583	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	While countries are growing, population—	12.0	999.0
201603	584	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Yes, it goes back to your question about, is 3 percent for China basically a recession or not.	12.0	999.0
201603	585	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Exactly.	12.0	94.0
201603	586	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	It’s not negative.	12.0	999.0
201603	587	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	I think we’re answering your question in the sense that, no, global growth in some of these cases may not be negative.	12.0	999.0
201603	588	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I just didn’t want the impression to come out to the Committee that global growth is going to shrink with high probability, according to this model, which says 48 percent of a chance of recession.	12.0	94.0
201603	589	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Right.	12.0	999.0
201603	590	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	So I wouldn’t read this as a literal 48 percent.	12.0	999.0
201603	591	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	There are ranges around it reflecting uncertainty.	12.0	999.0
201603	592	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	What I would take away from this is that the probability of recession is higher than it would be unconditionally, that economic conditions are suggestive.	12.0	999.0
201603	593	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I took the black line here to represent the unconditional probability, which looks like 18 percent.	12.0	94.0
201603	594	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	The horizontal black line.	12.0	94.0
201603	595	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	It’s 16 percent, yes.	12.0	999.0
201603	596	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	This number is high.	12.0	94.0
201603	597	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	This number is quite high.	12.0	94.0
201603	598	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Right, and there are a numbers of reasons why.	12.0	999.0
201603	599	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	It could reflect some sort of structural slowing in growth, which we’re not accounting for.	12.0	999.0
201603	600	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	But one of the issues is that last year, growth was very weak, unusually weak.	12.0	999.0
201603	601	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Growth as weak as it was globally last year has occurred very few times outside actual recessions or crises.	12.0	999.0
201603	602	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Well, I’ve complained about this before for this Committee.	12.0	94.0
201603	603	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t think you should come with a recession probability model to this Committee that hasn’t been vetted.	12.0	94.0
201603	604	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	There’s a lot of ways to do these things.	12.0	94.0
201603	605	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	There’s a lot of ways to cut this data, and this looks like a very scary number.	12.0	94.0
201603	606	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	So I’m not sure you should—	12.0	94.0
201603	607	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	We asked the dealers and the buy side what they think about the probability that the global economy would be in recession six months from now using the IMF definition.	12.0	999.0
201603	608	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The probability has moved up since we’ve been asking the question and is just over 20 percent.	12.0	999.0
201603	609	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	So that’s in the ballpark of this estimate.	12.0	999.0
201603	610	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	That’s just a subjective one, but it has moved up.	12.0	999.0
201603	611	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Well, if you want to come to the Committee, come with a memo that summarizes 10 different models of global recession probabilities—and show me how the assumptions matter, something like that.	12.0	94.0
201603	612	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	12.0	65.0
201603	613	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	A lot of this meeting is about how we think about volatility.	12.0	90.0
201603	614	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	The stock market isn’t dramatically lower than it was at the beginning of the year, and if you look at both the Tealbook forecast and the SEP submissions, we have an unemployment rate that’s a little bit lower than what we had before.	12.0	90.0
201603	615	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	We have an inflation rate that’s roughly the same, and yet we’ve moved our interest rate projection over the course of this year by a fairly substantial amount.	12.0	90.0
201603	616	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	So it looks like the volatility wasn’t enough to have dramatically changed our real economic outlook—it doesn’t enter the model.	12.0	90.0
201603	617	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	A Taylor rule doesn’t have volatility in it, so it would be looking just at the inflation and unemployment you’re looking at.	12.0	90.0
201603	618	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	How should we process volatility if nothing changed but the mean?	12.0	90.0
201603	619	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	One way to think about it is, the risks have changed, but we’re looking mostly at modal forecasts of the real economy.	12.0	90.0
201603	620	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	And I’m wondering whether our models should be incorporating that volatility, or should the discussion be more about risks that are implied by that volatility?	12.0	90.0
201603	621	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Do you have any views in terms of how to think about volatility, both in terms of modal and then thinking about tails of the distribution, maybe?	12.0	90.0
201603	622	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Some, but not great.	12.0	999.0
201603	623	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The most direct channel by which volatility enters our baseline projection directly is in our investment projection, in which we have spreads making a modest but noticeable negative contribution in this round relative to previous rounds.	12.0	999.0
201603	624	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We’re able, with some effort, to get spreads to enter modestly negatively in our equations for business fixed investment.	12.0	999.0
201603	625	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	This is an area, as you know, where there’s a very large amount of active research going on.	12.0	999.0
201603	626	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In mid-February, we put out an update to our forecast that had a much more significant downward revision to the outlook on the basis of the volatility that we thought was prevailing at that time.	12.0	999.0
201603	627	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Now, what remains in the Tealbook is a pretty small shadow of what we showed in February for a couple of reasons.	12.0	999.0
201603	628	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	One is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that the turbulence seems to have, to a significant degree, gone into remission.	12.0	999.0
201603	629	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The other is that as we thought harder about the experiment that we had implemented in mid-February, we decided that, all things being equal, just an increase in bond spreads alone was a pretty unusual tail experiment, because what that meant was that all the other financial conditions that we key off are held constant, and that one measure of bond volatility widens out.	12.0	999.0
201603	630	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	That turns out to be a pretty far tail experiment.	12.0	999.0
201603	631	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	What we saw in February didn’t look like it answered to that description.	12.0	999.0
201603	632	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	It had the bond spreads widening, but it had a deterioration on a number of other dimensions that were already captured in our standard operating procedure.	12.0	999.0
201603	633	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So we decided that the amount of weakening that we had in mid-February probably overdid it.	12.0	999.0
201603	634	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	This is one of those areas in which I think the intuition that there must be something there makes a ton of sense.	12.0	999.0
201603	635	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We’ve taken a small step toward building that in when the evidence looks strongest, but other dimensions of it may be at work.	12.0	999.0
201603	636	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We haven’t seen it show up in measures of consumer sentiment, though.	12.0	999.0
201603	637	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So households, as best as we’re able to capture that, aren’t reporting that they’re unnerved by the financial developments.	12.0	999.0
201603	638	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The hiring picture still looks pretty good.	12.0	999.0
201603	639	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We’ve looked hard and have thus far been unable to develop very strong evidence that volatility by itself should be having big effects on our baseline.	12.0	999.0
201603	640	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So I think that puts us mostly in the camp of thinking that what we’re talking about is downside risks.	12.0	999.0
201603	641	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I do think the journey that we went through, from the January Tealbook through a somewhat scary period through mid-February and back, took, at least in my mind, a statement about downside risks in our projection that had felt a little antiseptic, a little theoretical, and put some meat on the bones of how it could be that those downside risks could materialize.	12.0	999.0
201603	642	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions?	12.0	65.0
201603	643	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	12.0	65.0
201603	644	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest we take a 15-minute break.	52.0	65.0
201603	645	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Coffee is ready.	52.0	65.0
201603	646	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	And then we will come back and begin our round.	52.0	65.0
201603	648	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, let us resume.	13.0	65.0
201603	649	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	And President Williams will start us off.	13.0	65.0
201603	650	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	102.0
201603	651	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Other than energy producers and exporters, my business contacts remain optimistic.	13.0	102.0
201603	652	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s probably because of a combination of the sunny skies and the rain we are getting, which is ending our four-year drought.	13.0	102.0
201603	653	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	They tell me they generally look through gyrations in financial markets.	13.0	102.0
201603	654	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And with labor income on the rise and the windfall from low gas prices starting to accumulate, there is more cushion in household budgets.	13.0	102.0
201603	655	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So with the economic data overall meeting or beating my expectations back in December, my outlook also remains upbeat and is essentially unchanged since our meeting in December despite the financial market’s downs and ups.	13.0	102.0
201603	656	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Specifically, I have not meaningfully altered my outlook or my assessment of the balance of risks to the achievement of our dual mandate since we raised rates at the end of last year.	13.0	102.0
201603	657	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	As in December, I expect real GDP to grow 2.2 percent this year, above my estimate of long-run growth of 1.9 percent.	13.0	102.0
201603	658	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	A lot of the fears from heightened financial volatility that were flashing yellow in January have diminished.	13.0	102.0
201603	659	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, there are still risks to growth from global headwinds.	13.0	102.0
201603	660	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s important to recognize that policymakers overseas have acted forcefully to mitigate those risks, and there are upside risks on the domestic side, as both consumer spending and housing construction still have room to grow faster than expected.	13.0	102.0
201603	661	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Another upside risk to the outlook for employment, which I have already made reference to, is that the economy replays its performance of last year.	13.0	102.0
201603	662	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So let’s think back to 2015.	13.0	102.0
201603	663	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	We added over 2.7 million jobs, we had less than 2 percent growth in GDP, and we saw a 0.6 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate.	13.0	102.0
201603	664	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And this all occurred in the face of very weak foreign demand, plummeting commodity prices, and the sharp appreciation of the dollar.	13.0	102.0
201603	665	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, the fact that we got roughly 2 percent growth and 2.7 million jobs, points to two things.	13.0	102.0
201603	666	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	One was the resilience of the US economy and labor market, and the other was the fact that labor productivity was so very slow last year—following a trend that we have seen over the past four years.	13.0	102.0
201603	667	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, as my questions to and discussion with David Wilcox highlighted, I think there is a risk that we could see productivity growth this year be quite slow, which would lead to a much lower path for the unemployment rate.	13.0	102.0
201603	668	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So it does bring me to the key question, I think, for looking at the economy over the next couple of years in terms of our mandate goal of maximum employment, and that’s what’s going to happen to productivity growth.	13.0	102.0
201603	669	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, my own estimate of potential growth is based in large part on a continuation of the modest trend pace of productivity growth that we have seen over the past decade—that’s going back to 2004.	13.0	102.0
201603	670	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	These weak productivity numbers have been particularly disconcerting for many on the West Coast.	13.0	102.0
201603	671	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	There is a really strong disconnect between doing the economic analysis concerning productivity and then talking to anybody in Silicon Valley, in the Bay Area, because the pace of innovation in the Bay Area does seem very fast.	13.0	102.0
201603	672	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I haven’t seen flying cars or jetpacks yet, but self-driving cars and commercial drones are clearly on their way and are getting to market a lot faster than many expected.	13.0	102.0
201603	673	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The general reaction in Silicon Valley to the national productivity statistics is denial.	13.0	102.0
201603	674	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The reported data must be underestimating significant gains from the information revolution that they are leading, and this led to the famous Hal Varian quip that we don’t have a productivity problem, we have a measurement problem.	13.0	102.0
201603	675	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So to try to reconcile this disconnect between the data and innovation that feels so fast and is changing so rapidly in front of us, John Fernald on my staff and Dave Byrne here at the Board, along with Marshall Reinsdorf, wrote a paper that they presented at the Brookings Institution last Thursday.	13.0	102.0
201603	676	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And they looked at the contribution of free digital services, like Google, Wikipedia, and Facebook, which have clearly been deeply interwoven into the fabric of everyday life.	13.0	102.0
201603	677	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, consumers don’t pay for these services, so they don’t show up in the national accounts.	13.0	102.0
201603	678	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Still, the best estimates suggest that even if we were to somehow come up with prices for these services, they’re still such a small factor that they wouldn’t offset the drop in productivity growth that we have seen in the past decade.	13.0	102.0
201603	679	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	A second area that they examined is the mismeasurement of prices for IT hardware and software.	13.0	102.0
201603	680	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	We know that the measurement of prices of IT and communications equipment are misstated, that, in general, the prices are overstated.	13.0	102.0
201603	681	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But in their paper, in a careful analysis, they find there is no evidence that this overstatement of prices has in any way gotten worse as productivity growth has slowed.	13.0	102.0
201603	682	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, after doing all of their careful calculations, they think that mismeasurement actually boosts productivity growth more during the late ’90s and early 2000s, the period of the tech boom, than it does during the past decade.	13.0	102.0
201603	683	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, when you adjust the data for the best measures we have of the true underlying quality of these investment goods, the slowdown in business-sector labor productivity since 2004 has actually been larger than is reported in the data.	13.0	102.0
201603	684	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	One of the factors that I think we know, but it’s important to emphasize, is that domestic production of IT equipment is a much smaller share of the economy than it used to be.	13.0	102.0
201603	685	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, if you think about the ’90s and the tech boom, we were building a lot of computers and IT equipment.	13.0	102.0
201603	686	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Most of the equipment is now being built abroad, so it shows up in export and import prices.	13.0	102.0
201603	687	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It doesn’t affect US GDP and productivity the same way it used to.	13.0	102.0
201603	688	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, again, I think that’s an important factor explaining why the ’90s and today are different.	13.0	102.0
201603	689	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, the bottom line of their work is that mismeasurement of innovation accounts for very little of the weakness in productivity growth that we have seen for, now, 11 years.	13.0	102.0
201603	690	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, in common with the finding in Bob Gordon’s work, they view the slow growth as actually being real.	13.0	102.0
201603	691	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s genuine.	13.0	102.0
201603	692	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s not an issue of mismeasurement.	13.0	102.0
201603	693	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the days of 2½ to 3 percent real output growth on a sustainable basis are over, at least for now, and my longer-run projection of productivity growth and potential output recognizes this lower benchmark for what our longer- run potential is.	13.0	102.0
201603	694	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Also, on the basis of the fact that my view of potential output growth is lower than it used to be, and that this is not a reflection of mismeasurement, it also argues the case that r* is lower.	13.0	102.0
201603	695	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	As in the Laubach-Williams model, there is roughly a one-to-one relationship with the neutral real rate and potential output growth.	13.0	102.0
201603	696	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So my current estimate of r*, the equilibrium real interest rate, is 1¼ percent, the same as it was back in December.	13.0	102.0
201603	697	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Looking ahead with above-trend GDP growth this year, my projection has the labor market overshooting full employment by a substantial margin.	13.0	102.0
201603	698	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I expect we will see unemployment at about 4½ percent by the end of the year.	13.0	102.0
201603	699	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But with monetary policy normalization occurring over the next few years, we are going to need to see output growth somewhat below potential in 2017 and 2018 in order to bring the unemployment rate slowly back to my 5 percent estimate of the natural rate by late 2018.	13.0	102.0
201603	700	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The sustained period of labor market overheating will put upward pressure on inflation and offset some of the lingering disinflationary pressures associated with the pass-through of lower import and energy costs into core prices.	13.0	102.0
201603	701	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The news on inflation, in my view, has generally been good.	13.0	102.0
201603	702	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The January jump in the core PCE to 1.7 percent and the trimmed mean to 1.9 shouldn’t be dismissed completely as statistical noise.	13.0	102.0
201603	703	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I would also note that the forces weighing on import inflation from commodity prices and the dollar are diminishing.	13.0	102.0
201603	704	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	All in all, I continue to expect to see inflation gradually move back to our 2 percent target by the middle of 2018.	13.0	102.0
201603	705	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And for those who would like additional reading on my views, I am respondent number 4 in the SEP.	13.0	102.0
201603	706	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13.0	102.0
201603	707	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	708	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	13.0	65.0
201603	709	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201603	710	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	There has been an interesting dichotomy between the real economy and financial markets since the beginning of the year.	13.0	90.0
201603	711	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	While financial markets have been quite volatile, US real domestic data have continued to be quite solid.	13.0	90.0
201603	712	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	My forecast of real GDP growth over this year is a little over 2 percent, not unlike the average growth we have seen over this recovery.	13.0	90.0
201603	713	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	I continue to expect a consumption-led economy that is restrained by lackluster business fixed investment and weakness in net exports, which will be held back by the lagged impact of dollar appreciation and weakness among major trading partners.	13.0	90.0
201603	714	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	This modest growth will be sufficient to cause continued improvement in labor market conditions and for core PCE to reach 2 percent gradually.	13.0	90.0
201603	715	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	In essence, my forecast is not that different from my previous SEP submission.	13.0	90.0
201603	716	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	In terms of inflation, it remains to be seen how evanescent recent readings on core PCE inflation will be.	13.0	90.0
201603	717	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I view the lower readings on market-based measures of inflation and some survey-based measures as potentially troubling, the recent data on core PCE inflation and some evidence of very gradual increases in wages and salaries now make me somewhat more confident that we will see some pickup in wages and prices.	13.0	90.0
201603	718	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	A study by my staff looking at various measures meant to capture the underlying trend and the 172 detailed components of core PCE finds a modest increase in the trend for inflation in recent data.	13.0	90.0
201603	719	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	In addition, we are already near my estimate of full employment, and we are quite likely to exceed my estimate of full employment over the forecast horizon, though not by the amount assumed in the Tealbook.	13.0	90.0
201603	720	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	If I were to look at the forecast, ignoring financial markets, and based purely on inflation, unemployment, and real GDP readings to date, my view of the economy and appropriate monetary policy would be little changed from my December SEP.	13.0	90.0
201603	721	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, financial markets have been quite volatile.	13.0	90.0
201603	722	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	While stock indexes in Asia have been hardest hit, the S&P had declined notably by the middle of February, although US equity prices in general have recovered much of those losses as of the end of last week.	13.0	90.0
201603	723	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Bank stocks have been particularly volatile.	13.0	90.0
201603	724	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Bank stock prices in Europe were exceptionally hard hit, with declines of 30 percent or more between the beginning of December and the middle of February.	13.0	90.0
201603	725	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Particularly notable was the public announcement by a European finance minister that he was not worried about the financial health of a G-SIB.	13.0	90.0
201603	726	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Such a statement is a fairly reliable indicator that we should actually be worried.	13.0	90.0
201603	727	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	[Laughter]	13.0	90.0
201603	728	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Given the relatively modest change in most domestic forecasts of the US economy, it was a surprising deterioration in the readings from stock prices and CDS of some of our largest banks.	13.0	90.0
201603	729	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	While less dramatic than equity price movements in European banks, stock prices for some of our largest banks and some of our banks that are most dependent on wholesale funds declined approximately 25 percent from the beginning of December to the middle of February.	13.0	90.0
201603	730	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	While US bank stock prices and CDS prices have improved quite significantly going into this meeting, I have been surprised by the financial sensitivity of these banks during a time when the real economic data have remained relatively benign.	13.0	90.0
201603	731	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	It does make me worry that major banks may be more financially fragile than I had assumed despite the improvements that have been made in capital positions.	13.0	90.0
201603	732	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	In summary, data for the real economy remain satisfactory, while the financial data have been worrisome.	13.0	90.0
201603	733	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	So far, it appears that the financial data in the United States are in the process of converging to an outlook more similar to the economic picture we have received on the real side of the economy.	13.0	90.0
201603	734	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	I remain concerned that financial stresses emanating from abroad could leave a larger imprint on our economy as we go forward, but I am heartened by the continued progress in labor markets and the evidence so far that we are likely to grow somewhat faster than potential.	13.0	90.0
201603	735	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201603	736	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	737	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13.0	65.0
201603	738	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201603	739	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Since our decision to raise the interest rate three months ago, we’ve come through a remarkable period.	13.0	108.0
201603	740	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	For nearly two weeks, until the turn of the year, we were able to take satisfaction from the smooth execution of the increase in the federal funds rate and to offer well-deserved congratulations to our New York Federal Reserve colleagues on that achievement.	13.0	108.0
201603	741	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Then came the financial market turmoil through February 11, reflecting, in part, renewed concerns about the Chinese economy, regarding the effects of declines in the price of oil and other commodities, and about whether central banks were running out of ammunition, and the related question of whether negative interest rates could, by reducing banks’ profits, be counterproductive.	13.0	108.0
201603	742	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Our January FOMC meeting and the Chair’s subsequent congressional testimony took place in the midst of the market and media turmoil with her message being the right mixture of “steady as we go” and “our decisions are data driven.”	13.0	108.0
201603	743	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Then, on Thursday, February 11, the tide turned, and we have now virtually returned to where we were in December in terms of the stock market and the continued strength of labor market performance, along with an increase in the price of oil and a probably temporary increase in inflation but with lower interest rates and the memory of an uncomfortable period of volatility.	13.0	108.0
201603	744	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	So where are we now?	13.0	108.0
201603	745	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	We have had two good but slightly mixed employment reports since the previous FOMC meeting.	13.0	108.0
201603	746	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	The 172,000 addition to employment in January was well above the amount needed to hire new entrants to the labor force, and the 242,000 addition in February was impressive and should have reduced concerns about a possibly slowing labor market that the January figure might have raised, especially at its first reported level of 151,000.	13.0	108.0
201603	747	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	In addition, labor force participation rates have risen.	13.0	108.0
201603	748	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	We had some signs of higher wage growth in January, but these reversed in February, and we’ve also seen an increase in core PCE price inflation, although the rise reflects, in large part, increases in the prices of volatile components and perhaps also difficulties with first-quarter seasonal adjustment.	13.0	108.0
201603	749	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	The price of oil has risen, perhaps easing fears that inflation expectations are becoming unanchored, as a positive correlation between declining oil prices and measures of inflation compensation appears to have contributed to a decrease in those measures and then to an increase in recent weeks.	13.0	108.0
201603	750	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	That is to say, some of the signs of inflation that we’ve been expecting for a long time may have begun to appear, but hesitantly, implying that uncertainty about their persistence has not been significantly reduced.	13.0	108.0
201603	751	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	More generally, the volatility of the volatility we have experienced recently has to some extent increased uncertainty about the external environment in which the United States economy will operate in the next few months and possibly years.	13.0	108.0
201603	752	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	That increased uncertainty about the global economy also includes upside risks, among them the results of the strong measures taken by the ECB last week, the first reports that the Japanese consumption-tax increase scheduled for April next year may be postponed, and the impact of the expansionary measures recently decided in China.	13.0	108.0
201603	753	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Most of all, I take from the experience of the past three months the conclusion that the growth of the US economy is resilient, and that conclusion will be further strengthened if it is supported by incoming data over the next few months.	13.0	108.0
201603	754	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Thus, my uncertainty about global growth has increased, while my confidence about the resilience of the US economy has increased.	13.0	108.0
201603	755	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Let me also take stock of where we stand in relation to attainment of the dual mandate.	13.0	108.0
201603	756	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	We are close to the maximum sustainable level of employment in the economy.	13.0	108.0
201603	757	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	The unemployment rate is close to most FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate.	13.0	108.0
201603	758	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	The employment situation has improved for all of the major population groups.	13.0	108.0
201603	759	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	The participation rate has turned around and is beginning to increase.	13.0	108.0
201603	760	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	These are major achievements, but there is more still to be achieved.	13.0	108.0
201603	761	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	There are still more people working part time than would like to, and wage growth has yet to show a sustained pickup.	13.0	108.0
201603	762	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	On the inflation front, the core PCE price deflator for the 12 months ending in January of this year was 1.7 percent per annum.	13.0	108.0
201603	763	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	The median 2016 increase in the core PCE deflator projected in the SEP is 1.6 percent, compared with 1.4 percent in the staff forecast, while the median SEP forecast of actual PCE inflation in 2016 is 1.2 percent, compared with 1.0 percent in the staff forecast.	13.0	108.0
201603	764	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	The medians projected for 2017 with regard to core inflation and PCE inflation are 1.8 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, with the staff forecast being 1.6 percent for both.	13.0	108.0
201603	765	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	In summary, with respect to employment, we are very close to our target.	13.0	108.0
201603	766	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	With respect to inflation, we are reasonably close to our 2 percent target.	13.0	108.0
201603	767	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	And, with the benefit of hindsight, it is becoming even clearer that the divergence between actual inflation and 2 percent over most of 2015 and part of 2014 was primarily due to the effects of the decline in the price of oil and to the strengthening of the dollar.	13.0	108.0
201603	768	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	I’d like to add a few considerations that we will need to take into account as we make our policy decisions at this and future FOMC meetings, and I’ll raise these considerations in the form of questions.	13.0	108.0
201603	769	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	First, central to our future decisions will be estimates, explicit or implicit, of the impact on the exchange rate of changes in the federal funds rate.	13.0	108.0
201603	770	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	One safe but unsatisfactory answer is, it all depends on the context in which we make the decision.	13.0	108.0
201603	771	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Among the key factors we will need to consider—and here, I’m going through material that was presented earlier by Beth Anne—are possible policy changes in foreign countries in response to our decision and their feedback effects on us.	13.0	108.0
201603	772	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Perhaps we can get some estimates using SIGMA or perhaps rules of thumb of what are the key variables of policies at home and abroad that affect the impact abroad and the resulting feedback effects on us.	13.0	108.0
201603	773	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	As our knowledge of these connections increases, we will learn whether we will increasingly be taking decisions that are influenced by the feedback effects on us of the condition of foreign economies and of their likely policy responses to our policy decisions, a situation that, if it develops, could put us in the place of the Bank of England in the 19th century, whose decisions were taken in the interest of the United Kingdom but were often also interpreted as being good for maintenance of the international financial and monetary system.	13.0	108.0
201603	774	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Now, these interactions among monetary policies of different countries are complicated and could give rise to game theoretic elements in our and other countries’ monetary policy decisions.	13.0	108.0
201603	775	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	It may well be that the more monetary policy diverges across the major central banks, the more it may be necessary to agree more clearly on rules of good behavior for central banks operating in the international system.	13.0	108.0
201603	776	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	This, of course, is related to the implicit or sometimes explicit agreements on policies that lead to changes in the exchange rate.	13.0	108.0
201603	777	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Well, it’s easy to say that it may be necessary to agree on rules, but there will no doubt be enormous difficulties in reaching any agreement on such rules, and it is interesting that yesterday Raghuram Rajan, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, also asked to have an agreement on rules for how central banks behave, but I think he was thinking about us as the one that needed to have the rule.	13.0	108.0
201603	778	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	13.0	108.0
201603	779	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Second, we were certainly justified in downplaying the importance of the stock market declines earlier this year, but we are all aware of the fact that changes in market sentiment can have a self-justifying effect on the economy.	13.0	108.0
201603	780	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Thus, at some point, in the event of a serious and apparently persistent financial market decline, we might find ourselves having to act to stabilize the financial markets in order to stabilize the economy.	13.0	108.0
201603	781	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	None of us welcomes the charge that monetary policy contains a “Fed put,” but, in extremis, there may be a need for such a put, if not in the strict sense of the finance term, then at least in regard to the direction of policy.	13.0	108.0
201603	782	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	How should we communicate about such actions, or, as used to be said of the lender of last resort, should we leave such actions shrouded in constructive ambiguity?	13.0	108.0
201603	783	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Third, what lies behind the current correlations between the price of oil and the variety of financial variables?	13.0	108.0
201603	784	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	And to what extent, if any, can we rely on the continuation of these correlations?	13.0	108.0
201603	785	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Presumably, if the price of oil reaches high enough levels, the stock market will cease interpreting a further increase in the price of oil as positive for the economy.	13.0	108.0
201603	786	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	But the level at which the interpretation will change is far from clear at this point.	13.0	108.0
201603	787	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Fourth, how important is it quantitatively if longer-term inflation expectations become unanchored from our target inflation rate?	13.0	108.0
201603	788	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	That must depend, in part, on the extent to which movements in longer-term expectations affect short-term expectations or are correlated with them in the many aspects of economic behavior in which short-term expected inflation matters: at a minimum, in the asset markets; in the goods markets, including the effects of expected inflation on investment via the real interest rate; and in the labor market.	13.0	108.0
201603	789	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	The staff has recently done some work that goes down this road, but further work would be welcome.	13.0	108.0
201603	790	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Fifth and finally, in view of the uncertainties we face, what should we communicate about the likely path of policy?	13.0	108.0
201603	791	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	On this question I believe we need to bear in mind continually the uncertainty that we face today about the circumstances in which we will have to make future policy decisions.	13.0	108.0
201603	792	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	On this question, I can offer at least a partial and a local answer, “local” meaning near in time.	13.0	108.0
201603	793	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	We should be careful not to say anything that takes either April or June off the table.	13.0	108.0
201603	794	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	We do not know what policies will be appropriate at the times of those meetings, and we should keep our options open.	13.0	108.0
201603	795	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	And over longer periods, we should make clear our expectations for future policies, but also make absolutely clear the considerable uncertainty that surrounds them.	13.0	108.0
201603	796	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201603	797	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	798	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13.0	65.0
201603	799	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	13.0	107.0
201603	800	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	I am heartened by the US economic data since our previous meeting, which suggest further movement toward our goals.	13.0	107.0
201603	801	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The labor market continued to strengthen last month, with job growth above 240,000, the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.9 percent, and the labor force participation rate rising noticeably.	13.0	107.0
201603	802	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The turnaround in the participation rate since last summer is particularly encouraging, as it suggests the possibility that labor supply may be more responsive to improved conditions than previously thought, and there may be reasons to believe there is some room for the labor market to improve still further.	13.0	107.0
201603	803	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The employment-to-population ratio for prime-age workers remains 1¾ percentage points below pre-crisis levels.	13.0	107.0
201603	804	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Involuntary part-time employment is still elevated, and wage growth has shown little sign of acceleration.	13.0	107.0
201603	805	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Inflation has also moved closer to our goal recently.	13.0	107.0
201603	806	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The 12-month change in headline PCE inflation moved up to 1.3 percent in January, while core PCE inflation moved up to 1.7 percent.	13.0	107.0
201603	807	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	These moves are encouraging and, if sustained, would be highly reassuring.	13.0	107.0
201603	808	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	However, the broader context suggests some caution.	13.0	107.0
201603	809	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The staff projects the 12-month change in core prices to move back down to 1½ percent in coming months, and, of course, a reversal would not be hard to imagine, as core inflation has remained stuck in the vicinity of 1¼ to 1½ percent for the past three years.	13.0	107.0
201603	810	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, we can’t entirely rule out the risk that this lengthy underperformance of inflation may be having some depressing effect on inflation expectations.	13.0	107.0
201603	811	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Although longer-term inflation expectations of professional forecasters and market participants have remained steady, household expectations have moved lower.	13.0	107.0
201603	812	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In February, 5-to-10-year-ahead inflation expectations in the Michigan survey were 2.5 percent, ½ percentage point below the series longer-run average.	13.0	107.0
201603	813	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Three-year inflation expectations in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s consumer expectations survey have also moved lower in recent quarters, reaching 2.6 percent last month, nearly ¾ percentage point below the level two years ago.	13.0	107.0
201603	814	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	More notably, both the TIPS- and swaps-based measures of inflation compensation are down about 1 percentage point from mid-2014 and remain at very low levels, with the five-year, five-year-forward TIPS-based measures at around 1½ percent.	13.0	107.0
201603	815	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	These indications that inflation expectations may be edging down are concerning and, together with the persistent underperformance of inflation, imply that risks remain weighted to the downside.	13.0	107.0
201603	816	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	With regard to economic activity, the recent data point to continued moderate growth on balance.	13.0	107.0
201603	817	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The pace of consumer spending looks to have slowed a bit recently, but solid job and income growth, together with elevated readings on sentiment and the boost to household purchasing power from low energy prices, should support consumption growth.	13.0	107.0
201603	818	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	And the housing sector has also contributed steadily to growth over the past year and should continue to do so.	13.0	107.0
201603	819	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In contrast, sectors of the economy exposed to the strength of the dollar or the fall in energy prices have struggled.	13.0	107.0
201603	820	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Net exports subtracted about a ½ percentage point from GDP growth in each of the past two years, and staff models suggest that net exports will be a source of another sizable subtraction this year.	13.0	107.0
201603	821	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The extreme financial difficulties faced by some firms in the energy sector have spilled over into financial markets, in which we saw a pronounced widening of corporate bond spreads.	13.0	107.0
201603	822	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Since the middle of last year, triple-B spreads have increased about 75 basis points, while higher- yield bond spreads have increased substantially more despite the recent improvement.	13.0	107.0
201603	823	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Bond spreads are a potentially important gauge of financial frictions.	13.0	107.0
201603	824	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	They play a powerful role in some DSGE models that explicitly incorporate a financial sector—such as the New York Federal Reserve’s DSGE model—and, of course, spreads have proven to be one of the more accurate harbingers of recessions.	13.0	107.0
201603	825	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Although much of the recent increase is concentrated in energy, which likely weakens the signal for the overall economy, spreads have also increased notably outside the energy sector on net.	13.0	107.0
201603	826	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	More broadly, the substantial financial volatility and tightening that we saw from early January through late February was quite sobering.	13.0	107.0
201603	827	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	On net, since that time, financial conditions have eased somewhat and now look less adverse for the US outlook.	13.0	107.0
201603	828	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s possible these reflect improvements in some underlying drivers.	13.0	107.0
201603	829	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, some have seen recent movements in oil prices as a possible inflection point underpinned by a rumored agreement among some of the major producers.	13.0	107.0
201603	830	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	By contrast, the broader foreign environment remains highly uncertain.	13.0	107.0
201603	831	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	What has fundamentally changed on China?	13.0	107.0
201603	832	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The answer is, “Not much.”	13.0	107.0
201603	833	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent news doesn’t materially change the risks concerning China’s path forward.	13.0	107.0
201603	834	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Policymakers have signaled a commitment to some more fiscal stimulus this year, but China’s data on trade, retail sales, and PMIs have been relatively downbeat.	13.0	107.0
201603	835	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Central bank communication has soothed markets, and the exchange rate has been relatively stable against the designated basket of currencies since Golden Week, but so, too, has the dollar.	13.0	107.0
201603	836	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	And the institutional framework and lack of transparency on monetary policy communications, decisionmaking, and even the basic objective function have not changed.	13.0	107.0
201603	837	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Similarly, tough policy tradeoffs remain unchanged.	13.0	107.0
201603	838	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Policymakers confront a sharp slowing in the goods sector, a large buildup in corporate debt, and an apparent surge in demand for foreign assets.	13.0	107.0
201603	839	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	A further slowing in growth, continued increases in leverage, and capital outflow pressures, along with a further weakening in the RMB, are all still possible outcomes.	13.0	107.0
201603	840	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	More broadly, sources of economic strength across the globe are few, and sources of weakness relatively greater.	13.0	107.0
201603	841	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Since mid-2014, the IMF has repeatedly revised down its projections of 2015 growth, with these downward revisions now accumulating to 1 percentage point, and incoming data have similarly led the Board’s staff to mark down further its projection of foreign growth this year.	13.0	107.0
201603	842	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Commodity producers and countries with strong trade ties to China face difficult adjustments.	13.0	107.0
201603	843	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Growth in advanced economies remains extremely weak despite recent moves to reinforce extraordinary monetary accommodation.	13.0	107.0
201603	844	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In Japan, activity contracted last quarter, and growth for the year as a whole was only ¾ percent.	13.0	107.0
201603	845	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In the euro area, growth was only 1¼ percent last quarter, and the mixed financial market reaction to recent announcements of further accommodation by the BOJ, ECB, and Riksbank has contributed to questions about whether foreign policymakers might confront limits, or at least tradeoffs, in their policy responses upon reaching a policy-rate lower bound, if additional unexpected adverse developments were to arise.	13.0	107.0
201603	846	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Weak global growth and low global inflation magnify both the risks and consequences of adverse shocks, and it’s not clear whether policymakers across the globe will be able to deploy all of the necessary tools in order to address these risks adequately.	13.0	107.0
201603	847	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	As we’ve seen, this can lead to strong dollar appreciation and increased concern about downside risks to growth globally in financial markets, spilling across our borders.	13.0	107.0
201603	848	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	As I said earlier, recent weeks have seen an easing in financial conditions, supporting a recovery in equity markets and relieving pressure on the dollar, which is now 2 percent below its trade-weighted value earlier in the winter.	13.0	107.0
201603	849	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	One thing that has changed is the market’s expectations surrounding the FOMC’s path.	13.0	107.0
201603	850	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Changes in the expectations surrounding the policy rate path coincide with material reductions in important long-term interest rates, such as mortgage rates and rates for higher-grade corporate bonds.	13.0	107.0
201603	851	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Since the time corporate bond spreads started to rise, OIS quotes suggest that expectations regarding the federal funds rate at the end of this year and the end of 2017 are down close to 35 basis points and 75 basis points, respectively.	13.0	107.0
201603	852	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Current OIS quotes are consistent with one further rate increase this year, while the median of primary dealer and market participants’ modal forecasts is of two rate increases.	13.0	107.0
201603	853	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s thus quite likely that if we were to signal a materially steeper path, we would see a broader financial tightening in anticipation, perhaps reversing all or some of the important easing in financial conditions we have seen in recent weeks.	13.0	107.0
201603	854	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s thus important that we take into account this endogeneity of financial conditions and their implications for the US outlook as we choose our words and actions in response to the evolution of the economy, a topic to which we return tomorrow.	13.0	107.0
201603	855	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	107.0
201603	856	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	857	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13.0	65.0
201603	858	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201603	859	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Information received since the previous FOMC meeting indicates that business conditions in the Eighth District have been mixed.	13.0	94.0
201603	860	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Business contacts report strengthening wage pressures and modest employment growth.	13.0	94.0
201603	861	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	However, reports also suggest that first quarter sales were generally unchanged compared with one year ago.	13.0	94.0
201603	862	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	The outlook for local economic conditions deteriorated relative to our December 2015 survey of contacts.	13.0	94.0
201603	863	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Respondents who marked down their outlook generally emphasized the negative impact of relatively low agricultural and energy prices.	13.0	94.0
201603	864	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	An uptick in commercial construction activity was the most cited reason for a positive outlook.	13.0	94.0
201603	865	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	District housing market conditions continue to improve.	13.0	94.0
201603	866	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Real estate contacts noted that 2016 has started off well, and they are expecting strong growth.	13.0	94.0
201603	867	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Data on sales, building permits, and prices are consistent with contacts’ assessment of the housing market.	13.0	94.0
201603	868	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I have a few remarks on the national outlook.	13.0	94.0
201603	869	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	From the St Louis perspective, real GDP growth was disappointing in the second half of 2015 and does not look like it will be particularly robust in the first half of 2016.	13.0	94.0
201603	870	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I appreciated President Williams’s comments on potential growth earlier.	13.0	94.0
201603	871	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Accordingly, we at the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis have marked down our real GDP forecast for 2016 into the 2.0 to 2.5 percent range.	13.0	94.0
201603	872	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	This marks the end of a sequence of St.	13.0	94.0
201603	873	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Louis forecasts obtained from our empirical model, which called for at least a several-quarter period of real GDP growth markedly above trend.	13.0	94.0
201603	874	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	This lower growth outlook in turn suggests that policy recommendations may be somewhat less aggressive than previously called for in our SEP.	13.0	94.0
201603	875	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	On labor markets, inflation, and the global outlook, however, recent data have been consistent with our previous projections.	13.0	94.0
201603	876	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	On the basis of these data alone, I think there is a strong case to be made that the Committee is today more or less where it expected to be last December, and, therefore, that the Committee should be more strongly considering a follow-up increase in the policy rate than we apparently are.	13.0	94.0
201603	877	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	This is an important matter for the Committee, as it reflects on the time consistency of monetary policy.	13.0	94.0
201603	878	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	If we did not think we would move in a certain state of the world, arguably we should not have said so via the December SEP.	13.0	94.0
201603	879	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	One way to think about this would be that the SEP does not contain all of the variables that are important to the Committee decision.	13.0	94.0
201603	880	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	During the past several months, I have become more concerned about the state of longer- run inflation expectations in the United States.	13.0	94.0
201603	881	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	In particular, five-year, five-year-forward market-based inflation expectations fell at one point to a post-crisis low, although they have since recovered to still-low December levels.	13.0	94.0
201603	882	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I am not anxious to push a policy of rate normalization with this type of volatility in an important measure of the credibility of the Committee’s resolve to achieve an inflation target of 2 percent.	13.0	94.0
201603	883	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I have several remarks on this issue.	13.0	94.0
201603	884	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	First of all, I appreciated the staff memo on this topic.	13.0	94.0
201603	885	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I thought it was nicely done and a good summary of the issues.	13.0	94.0
201603	886	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Second, I think I want to comment a little bit on the high correlation between oil price movements and market-based inflation expectations.	13.0	94.0
201603	887	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	During 2015, at this table, I argued that we needed to wait for oil prices to stabilize before we could assess the meaning of the inflation expectations measures.	13.0	94.0
201603	888	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	However, last November oil prices resumed falling and have been volatile since then.	13.0	94.0
201603	889	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Market-based inflation expectations fell further.	13.0	94.0
201603	890	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	In my view, they fell too far for comfort, regardless of whether the oil correlation makes sense or not.	13.0	94.0
201603	891	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	And the price of oil correlated with the five-year, five-year-forward inflation rate makes no sense.	13.0	94.0
201603	892	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	But whether it’s there or not, these inflation expectations measures have simply fallen too far as of, say, mid- February.	13.0	94.0
201603	893	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Generally speaking, across the maturity spectrum, inflation compensation has declined 100 basis points from July 2014.	13.0	94.0
201603	894	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I would regard July 2014 as a satisfactory level for inflation expectations in the United States, so the recent lows were well off that level.	13.0	94.0
201603	895	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Third, I regard these market-based compensation numbers as good indicators of inflation expectations.	13.0	94.0
201603	896	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	In a model, on account of the credibility of the monetary authority, these measures should not change much, especially the five-year, five-year-forward rate.	13.0	94.0
201603	897	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	In the real world, the central bank does not have perfect credibility.	13.0	94.0
201603	898	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	The TIPS measures could be interpreted as a day- by-day measure of FOMC credibility.	13.0	94.0
201603	899	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	During the intermeeting period, the five-year, five-year- forward rate fell below 1.5 percent, a value that I would consider the outer bound of where I’d like to see that number go.	13.0	94.0
201603	900	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	There is a literature, often cited here, based in part on affine term structure models, that attempts to decompose inflation compensation into inflation expectations, a risk premium, and a liquidity premium.	13.0	94.0
201603	901	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I do not find these decompositions very convincing, because there are a lot of ways in which to accomplish the decomposition, with quite different implications for the volatility of the various components.	13.0	94.0
201603	902	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Instead, I’d prefer to interpret risk premiums and liquidity premiums as relatively stable and the overall inflation compensation as a rough barometer of inflation expectations and, hence, of FOMC credibility.	13.0	94.0
201603	903	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Fourth, I would add that I do not find survey measures very useful because they do not respond very much to incoming data and therefore don’t help us much via signaling.	13.0	94.0
201603	904	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Finally, market-based inflation expectations have rebounded in recent weeks, but I remain concerned that they fell as far as they did during the intermeeting period, and I would like reassurance that they have stabilized during the coming months.	13.0	94.0
201603	905	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	In short, I think we ignore market-based inflation expectations at our peril, and we should not downplay movements as much as we typically do.	13.0	94.0
201603	906	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201603	907	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	908	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	13.0	65.0
201603	909	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201603	910	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Economic activity in the Third District continues to improve, and there are even signs that manufacturing has bottomed out and may be growing once again, albeit slowly.	13.0	999.0
201603	911	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Employment growth is strong, consumer spending remains healthy, and commercial construction continues to grow modestly.	13.0	999.0
201603	912	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Unlike the nation, however, residential construction has weakened, and house price appreciation is a good bit more restrained.	13.0	999.0
201603	913	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	After six straight months in negative territory, our Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey bounced back strongly in March.	13.0	999.0
201603	914	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	The general activity index now stands at 12.4, which is slightly above its nonrecessionary average of 9.9.	13.0	999.0
201603	915	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Strength was seen both in new orders and especially shipments.	13.0	999.0
201603	916	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Further, inventories continued to be drawn down, but there’s no evidence of any significant improvement in job growth.	13.0	999.0
201603	917	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	There’s also no evidence of any price pressures, either for prices paid or prices received.	13.0	999.0
201603	918	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Area manufacturers are also significantly more upbeat than they were in February, with the diffusion index for future activity jumping 11 points, to 28.8.	13.0	999.0
201603	919	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	As well, all future subindexes reflected a rebound in optimism.	13.0	999.0
201603	920	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	As this is only one report and we don’t want to be data point dependent, I would not wish to get overly carried away by it.	13.0	999.0
201603	921	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	But it does appear that manufacturing in the Third District may have bottomed out and may even be showing signs of slow growth.	13.0	999.0
201603	922	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Nonmanufacturing activity in the District continues to grow modestly, as reflected by our NBOS headline activity index of 25.6 in February.	13.0	999.0
201603	923	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	The index is now only slightly below its nonrecessionary average of 29.7.	13.0	999.0
201603	924	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	There is also some evidence of inflationary pressures building in this sector, as the prices-received index increased to 22.4 and continues to remain above the level that is typical in an expansion.	13.0	999.0
201603	925	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Expectations of future activity also rose modestly in February and remain solidly in positive territory.	13.0	999.0
201603	926	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Our Beige Book contacts report a slight weakening in some sectors in the region, with homebuilding and loan activity declining slightly.	13.0	999.0
201603	927	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Unlike the nation, housing permits actually declined in January.	13.0	999.0
201603	928	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	For the three states in the District, house prices continue to rise but at a less rapid pace than for the nation.	13.0	999.0
201603	929	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	On the positive side, auto sales remain brisk and commercial construction continues to be a source of strength.	13.0	999.0
201603	930	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	The Philadelphia staff also constructs coincident indexes for all 50 states.	13.0	999.0
201603	931	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	The indexes are based on statewide employment growth, unemployment, hours worked in manufacturing, and wage growth.	13.0	999.0
201603	932	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Looking at each state index, we now see seven states that are experiencing negative growth, most of them with significant reliance on the energy sector.	13.0	999.0
201603	933	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	That is a higher number of states than we have seen in the recent past, so we analyzed whether this represented a harbinger of a significant downturn in economic activity.	13.0	999.0
201603	934	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	We did this by creating a diffusion index using the percentage of states that were growing more than 0.1 percentage point minus the percentage of states contracting more than 0.1 percentage point—and that was computed as a three-month rate.	13.0	999.0
201603	935	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	That index stands at 82, which is a very healthy number.	13.0	999.0
201603	936	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Although we have not done any formal statistical work, it appears that one generally needs at least two consecutive quarters for which the index is below 50 before a recession would occur.	13.0	999.0
201603	937	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	For the nation as a whole, the economy looks to be in better shape than it did in our previous meeting.	13.0	999.0
201603	938	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Labor markets remain robust.	13.0	999.0
201603	939	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Consumption appears to be picking up.	13.0	999.0
201603	940	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	And, as in my District, manufacturing may well have bottomed out.	13.0	999.0
201603	941	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Further, recent data on inflation, coupled with the findings contained in the excellent Board staff memo on longer-term inflation expectations, lead me to be more sure that inflation expectations continue to be well anchored and that inflation will return to target, although we have the concerns that President Bullard and others have expressed.	13.0	999.0
201603	942	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	My current forecast of the economy is informed by work by Shigeru Fujita on our staff on the effect that the increasing rate of retirement will have on the behavior of labor force participation.	13.0	999.0
201603	943	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	He finds that over the next three years, the labor force participation rate is likely to fall 1.2 percentage points because of the increase in the retirement rate resulting from the continued aging of our workforce.	13.0	999.0
201603	944	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	The retirement rate continues to decline after 2018, and it is projected to decline 4 percentage points over the next 10 years.	13.0	999.0
201603	945	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	His estimates of labor force participation are in line with the estimates made by Aaronson and others here at the Board.	13.0	999.0
201603	946	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Incorporating the effects of falling participation rates leads me to slightly downgrade my view on employment growth and hence output growth from my previous forecast.	13.0	999.0
201603	947	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	The fall in the growth rate of the labor force may place a bit more upward pressure on wage growth, and that could lead to inflation.	13.0	999.0
201603	948	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	I regard this as placing more upside risk on my inflation projection, but I haven’t as yet marked up my inflation projection.	13.0	999.0
201603	949	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	To summarize, I still believe that we will see economic activity rebound to about 2 percent this quarter, then grow a bit above trend for the rest of the year.	13.0	999.0
201603	950	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Growth will then gradually slow to a trend-like rate by 2018.	13.0	999.0
201603	951	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	This is the same contour as my previous projection, but it takes into account a slightly lower trend growth rate.	13.0	999.0
201603	952	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Thus, I anticipate growth of around 2.3 percent this year and next, falling to 2.1 percent in 2018.	13.0	999.0
201603	953	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	I now anticipate that the unemployment rate will drop to 4.7 percent by the end of the year and 4.4 percent by the end of 2017 and remain there in 2018.	13.0	999.0
201603	954	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	In light of first-quarter weakness in headline PCE inflation, I forecast that inflation will be 1.2 percent this year and move up to 1.9 percent in 2017 and 2 percent in 2018.	13.0	999.0
201603	955	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	I also see gradual firming in core PCE inflation and project that core PCE inflation will be 1.6 percent this year and rise to 1.8 percent in 2017 and 2 percent in 2018.	13.0	999.0
201603	956	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Thus, my forecast is pretty much in line with that as presented in this month’s Tealbook.	13.0	999.0
201603	957	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201603	958	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	959	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	13.0	65.0
201603	960	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201603	961	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I will start, as always, with energy.	13.0	110.0
201603	962	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	There will be a time in the future when we won’t start with energy.	13.0	110.0
201603	963	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Since the previous FOMC meeting, as Beth Anne mentioned, there was an announcement of discussions of a production freeze between OPEC members and Russia.	13.0	110.0
201603	964	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Our own view is, the actual supply–demand impact of this agreement is questionable, particularly as the parties involved are all operating basically at capacity.	13.0	110.0
201603	965	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And the one party that is relevant, Iran, has explicitly said they will not participate in this agreement and they won’t freeze their supply until they reach the presanction production level, which is approximately 3 million barrels a day.	13.0	110.0
201603	966	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	In the previous meeting, I said we thought that during 2016, excess supply would average about a million barrels a day.	13.0	110.0
201603	967	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I said we thought we’d end 2016 with an excess supply of about 500,000 barrels per day, and we thought we’d reach some level of daily supply–demand balance probably by mid-2017.	13.0	110.0
201603	968	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And although there’s disagreement, I must say that the data we’ve seen since the previous meeting are to the downside on all of these measures, and I’ll come back to that.	13.0	110.0
201603	969	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We think if we’re wrong about being in balance, it will take longer.	13.0	110.0
201603	970	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Here’s why.	13.0	110.0
201603	971	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	The International Energy Agency has been very public in saying they are much more optimistic than we are about this forecast.	13.0	110.0
201603	972	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	They think we’ll end 2016 close to balance, but they’re counting on very significant supply reductions in the United States.	13.0	110.0
201603	973	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	The issue is, the shale industry in the United States is about 4 million barrels.	13.0	110.0
201603	974	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	This is relative to world production and petroleum/petroleum equivalents of about 96 million barrels.	13.0	110.0
201603	975	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And what we’ve seen so far is, despite substantial cap-ex cuts and draconian cuts further in 2016, supply reductions have been slow to materialize.	13.0	110.0
201603	976	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And when they have materialized, they’ve been dwarfed by increases of supply outside the United States by Russia, in the Gulf of Mexico, and by Iran.	13.0	110.0
201603	977	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	So we’re skeptical that we can see enough supply cuts in the last half of this year to help offset what is going on in the rest of the world.	13.0	110.0
201603	978	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And, in fact, our own estimate is that, for all the pain and suffering we’ve been through, we think global supply will actually increase slightly from 2015 to 2016 and then will flatten from 2016 to 2017.	13.0	110.0
201603	979	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	So why are people, including us, calling for balance?	13.0	110.0
201603	980	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	One of the things that we are relying on is, we still expect global demand to grow almost 1.2 million barrels a day in 2016.	13.0	110.0
201603	981	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	So even if global supply simply flattens, because of ongoing demand growth, we will eventually get into balance.	13.0	110.0
201603	982	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Here are a couple of other reasons why the price may have firmed recently.	13.0	110.0
201603	983	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We think people in the market probably have an unrealistic expectation that there will be additional OPEC action.	13.0	110.0
201603	984	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We think this is unlikely because the economic incentive of the individual players is to keep pumping.	13.0	110.0
201603	985	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We think there’s been some amount of short covering—the financial players have been short this commodity, and they’re needing to cover their shorts.	13.0	110.0
201603	986	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	The other very significant event that has happened that is very real is, there have been about 2 million barrels of unplanned outages because of pipeline bombings in Nigeria and Iraq.	13.0	110.0
201603	987	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	There’s some uncertainty as to when those 2 million barrels will come back in the market, as we’re waiting for repairs to be made, and we think that has had an effect on firming the price.	13.0	110.0
201603	988	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Our working range on the price of oil is somewhere between $25 and $45 a barrel.	13.0	110.0
201603	989	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We’re right in the middle of that range right now.	13.0	110.0
201603	990	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	It would not surprise us to revisit the lower end of that range.	13.0	110.0
201603	991	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We hope we don’t, but we think that is a real possibility.	13.0	110.0
201603	992	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Time will tell.	13.0	110.0
201603	993	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And in the meantime, we really do expect we’re going to see more price volatility; potentially, downside risks; and bankruptcies, mergers, and restructurings.	13.0	110.0
201603	994	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	But a lot of the question is going to be, in light of the draconian cuts that are being made in the United States, how far can those supply cuts go and can they offset what’s going on in the rest of the world?	13.0	110.0
201603	995	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And we are still skeptical about that.	13.0	110.0
201603	996	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Not surprisingly, because of energy and the strong dollar, there are clear headwinds in the Eleventh District.	13.0	110.0
201603	997	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Manufacturing remains weak, and in fact is now in negative growth territory.	13.0	110.0
201603	998	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	The services sector is slowing but still growing.	13.0	110.0
201603	999	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Houston is obviously suffering.	13.0	110.0
201603	1000	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	But Dallas, San Antonio, and Austin are still growing because they’re diversified and because there’s a continued migration of people and firms to Texas.	13.0	110.0
201603	1001	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Housing remains strong except in Houston.	13.0	110.0
201603	1002	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And we’re now down to the point at which the energy industry in Texas is 2 percent of employment and 10 percent of GDP, and that was 14 percent just two years ago.	13.0	110.0
201603	1003	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	So this industry obviously is shrinking in its importance.	13.0	110.0
201603	1004	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We still expect some positive job growth in 2016 in Texas, but risks are clearly to the downside.	13.0	110.0
201603	1005	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	For the nation, our own GDP forecast is very similar to the 2015 outcome.	13.0	110.0
201603	1006	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We expect 1.9 percent growth in 2016.	13.0	110.0
201603	1007	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We do expect the unemployment rate to continue to decline from 4.9 percent to 4.6 percent during the year even as the participation rate slowly ticks up.	13.0	110.0
201603	1008	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We believe slack in the labor market will decline this year.	13.0	110.0
201603	1009	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	A number of you have mentioned the Dallas trimmed mean.	13.0	110.0
201603	1010	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	It had been running at 1.6 to 1.7 percent from early 2014 to the end of 2015.	13.0	110.0
201603	1011	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	It did tick up in January, as President Williams mentioned, to 1.9 percent.	13.0	110.0
201603	1012	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We don’t know that that will be sustainable, but we will be watching the stability and trend of this measure.	13.0	110.0
201603	1013	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We do expect the consumer to remain strong this year because of lower gas prices, a strong dollar, and a strong jobs market.	13.0	110.0
201603	1014	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	A couple of comments on non-US events.	13.0	110.0
201603	1015	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Much has been discussed already about declining estimates for rates of growth outside the United States, and we view the risks for global growth as to the downside.	13.0	110.0
201603	1016	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We are particularly focused on high levels of debt to GDP in developed economies and aging demographics, as President Harker mentioned, not only in the United States, but in most developed economies.	13.0	110.0
201603	1017	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We’re focused on China, whose growth, as has been said, is slowing.	13.0	110.0
201603	1018	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	In particular, the structural challenges of overcapacity, high levels of debt to GDP, and transition to an economy that is based on consumer services threaten spillovers to emerging markets in other countries.	13.0	110.0
201603	1019	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	But we’re more concerned, and I’m more concerned, about the financial transmission of potential devaluation, stock market turmoil, and capital flight from China.	13.0	110.0
201603	1020	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m more worried about that than the underlying economic conditions.	13.0	110.0
201603	1021	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And on that point, we’ve talked about this before:  The S&P 500 derives as much as 50 percent of its profits from outside the United States.	13.0	110.0
201603	1022	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We carefully track S&P estimates.	13.0	110.0
201603	1023	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	They have been steadily and gradually revised down since January 1, and that continues.	13.0	110.0
201603	1024	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Part of it is energy, part of it is weakness in financials, but part of it is also the strong dollar and weak non- US growth.	13.0	110.0
201603	1025	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Because of that, we believe we will continue to be vulnerable to periodic bouts of financial market tightening, particularly because, on balance, market participants are overallocated to risk assets.	13.0	110.0
201603	1026	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201603	1027	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	1028	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13.0	65.0
201603	1029	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201603	1030	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	The reports on economic activity from my business contacts were similar to January.	13.0	91.0
201603	1031	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Manufacturers with international exposure or businesses with a presence in the energy or agriculture sectors continue to struggle.	13.0	91.0
201603	1032	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	But I heard positive commentary about the US consumer and a few somewhat better reports on construction.	13.0	91.0
201603	1033	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	For example, my director from Discover Financial Services noted that the gyrations in financial markets and other unsettling news did not have much of an effect on retail sales.	13.0	91.0
201603	1034	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	On a year-over-year basis, his nominal credit card receipts excluding gasoline have been growing at about a 5 percent rate for several months in a row.	13.0	91.0
201603	1035	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	My new director from Illinois Tool Works, a large and widely diversified manufacturing conglomerate, reported continued strong demand from the automotive sector.	13.0	91.0
201603	1036	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	He also said that demand for products used in residential and commercial construction had begun to increase after being flat last year.	13.0	91.0
201603	1037	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	But on the downside, their product lines related to capital expenditures continued to be soft.	13.0	91.0
201603	1038	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Others reported similar news.	13.0	91.0
201603	1039	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	With regard to to the economic outlook, the data on spending, when compared with our December SEP, have been broadly in line with our earlier expectation that the labor market has improved somewhat faster, but financial conditions are more restrictive.	13.0	91.0
201603	1040	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Balancing these factors, we left our forecast of real GDP growth in 2016 unchanged at 2.1 percent.	13.0	91.0
201603	1041	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	If you’re keeping score, I’m number one in the SEP packet.	13.0	91.0
201603	1042	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	We’re also looking for growth in 2017 and 2018 to average near this 2¼ percent pace.	13.0	91.0
201603	1043	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	However, our assumptions about potential output growth are somewhat stronger than those in the Tealbook, and we currently see a little more slack in labor markets.	13.0	91.0
201603	1044	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Accordingly, our projection does not overshoot potential output as much as the Tealbook forecast.	13.0	91.0
201603	1045	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	President Williams may be happy to hear that there is some upside potential to our outlook.	13.0	91.0
201603	1046	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	A solid labor market and continued low energy prices could lead to stronger household spending than we are expecting, with attendant spillovers to other components of domestic demand.	13.0	91.0
201603	1047	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	However, we do not see these possibilities as being as likely or as powerful as the downside risks that financial shocks could weigh more heavily on credit conditions, household and business sentiment, and domestic spending than we have assumed.	13.0	91.0
201603	1048	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Accordingly, although I think we’ve written down a reasonable modal forecast, we see the balance of risks to the GDP projection as tilted to the downside.	13.0	91.0
201603	1049	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	I want to spend some time now on credit conditions and market sentiment.	13.0	91.0
201603	1050	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Two economists on my staff, Marco Bassetto and Luca Benzoni, ran an interesting empirical exercise to calibrate the effects of an increase in risk spreads in terms of an equivalent tightening in monetary policy.	13.0	91.0
201603	1051	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	For example, how many rate increases is a 50 basis point increase in spreads actually worth?	13.0	91.0
201603	1052	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	They added a financial conditions indicator to a standard macroeconomic-data vector autoregression (VAR) system that I’ve used in work with Larry Christiano and Marty Eichenbaum.	13.0	91.0
201603	1053	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	The VAR analysis measures shocks in these financial indicators and also policy shocks in the federal funds rate.	13.0	91.0
201603	1054	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	The analysis compared the effects of each shock on macroeconomic variables to gauge their relative effects.	13.0	91.0
201603	1055	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	The most interesting results use the excess corporate bond spread index developed by Simon Gilchrist and Egon Zakrajšek.	13.0	91.0
201603	1056	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	The GZ spread was featured in the Tealbook box and FOMC memos on recession probabilities.	13.0	91.0
201603	1057	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	From last summer to the end of February, the GZ spread widened considerably.	13.0	91.0
201603	1058	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Marco and Luca use an ARIMA analysis to isolate the unexpected component of this spread widening.	13.0	91.0
201603	1059	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	This leads them to estimate that the effects on GDP from such an exogenous GZ spread widening would be roughly equivalent to a 75 basis point tightening of the federal funds rate.	13.0	91.0
201603	1060	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	That’s three rate increases.	13.0	91.0
201603	1061	2016-03-16	meeting	PARTICIPANT	Or one very big one.	13.0	999.0
201603	1062	2016-03-16	meeting	PARTICIPANT	[Laughter]	13.0	999.0
201603	1063	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Always happy to leave something for the table commentary, I guess.	13.0	91.0
201603	1064	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Furthermore, a GZ shock of this magnitude would typically induce an additional endogenous reaction of FOMC policy to limit the damaging effect on GDP growth, and this is an example of influences that Governor Brainard was discussing.	13.0	91.0
201603	1065	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	In the VAR, this response dictates that the federal funds rate falls about 75 basis points over a year.	13.0	91.0
201603	1066	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	In the analysis, if the 75 basis point easing was not taken, that would be another exogenous federal funds tightening of that magnitude.	13.0	91.0
201603	1067	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	In my notes, I mention how many rate increases that is, but I don’t think that’s necessary now.	13.0	91.0
201603	1068	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	13.0	91.0
201603	1069	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Presumably, the reduction in the SEP median path and the market’s lower assessment of this path are responses to events like these tighter financial conditions.	13.0	91.0
201603	1070	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	I can’t stress too strongly that these findings are quite preliminary, and much uncertainty surrounds them.	13.0	91.0
201603	1071	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	But they strongly suggest that the recent financial spread widening is worth multiple federal funds rate increases.	13.0	91.0
201603	1072	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	In addition to past financial tightening, a number of our financial market contacts have expressed the view that we could be in store for recurrent risk-off episodes that lead to a downward skew in financial conditions.	13.0	91.0
201603	1073	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	They see these episodes emanating from ongoing concerns over structural issues in emerging markets and their impact on the global economy.	13.0	91.0
201603	1074	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	In addition, there are the difficulties around the world in policymakers’ ability to address these challenges at the effective lower bound.	13.0	91.0
201603	1075	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	I share these concerns.	13.0	91.0
201603	1076	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Others have mentioned them, too.	13.0	91.0
201603	1077	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	And these downside risks could, on account of their sources, be with us for some time to come.	13.0	91.0
201603	1078	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Let me finish with our outlook for inflation.	13.0	91.0
201603	1079	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	The higher incoming data caused us to raise our forecast of core inflation one-tenth this year to 1.6 percent.	13.0	91.0
201603	1080	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	We then have inflation slowly rising to near target by the end of the forecast period.	13.0	91.0
201603	1081	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	We see the slightly improved higher outlook for inflation as a good modal forecast, albeit one with the risks tilted to the downside.	13.0	91.0
201603	1082	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Although a number of our statistical models expect a good deal of persistence from the recent higher readings on core inflation, we recognize a strong case can be made for the Tealbook’s view that the bump-up in some of the PCE price index components will prove to be transitory.	13.0	91.0
201603	1083	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	In addition, the persistently low readings on inflation breakevens and downward drift in some surveys suggest that longer-run inflation expectations may have already slipped below our inflation target.	13.0	91.0
201603	1084	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	At a minimum, they point to a worrisome fragility in inflation expectations and uncertainty about our nominal anchor.	13.0	91.0
201603	1085	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Any meaningful reduction in expectations would make it all that more difficult to reach our 2 percent target.	13.0	91.0
201603	1086	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	This is the biggest downside risk of all to our inflation forecast, in my opinion.	13.0	91.0
201603	1087	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201603	1088	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	1089	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	13.0	65.0
201603	1090	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Thank you.	13.0	999.0
201603	1091	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Leading into our January meeting, business sentiment had fallen in the Fourth District.	13.0	999.0
201603	1092	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	But over this intermeeting period, sentiment has improved decidedly.	13.0	999.0
201603	1093	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Overall activity in the District remains consistent with continued moderate economic growth.	13.0	999.0
201603	1094	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The Bank’s diffusion index of business contacts reporting better versus worse conditions increased 30 points, from minus 16 in January to plus 14 in February.	13.0	999.0
201603	1095	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	This is the best reading we’ve seen in over six months.	13.0	999.0
201603	1096	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Bankers in the Fourth District reported overall credit demand has increased slightly, with commercial lending mainly financing acquisitions or commercial real estate projects.	13.0	999.0
201603	1097	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	One real estate developer reported that banks are becoming aggressive in lending for commercial development, offering longer-term financing and interest rates approaching historical lows.	13.0	999.0
201603	1098	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	He expressed concern about the ability of some developers to roll over maturing credit obtained during the crisis, because of the high leverage in some of these deals and the decline in appraised value since the bubble burst.	13.0	999.0
201603	1099	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The improved sentiment in the District is consistent with the solid and ongoing improvement we’ve seen in labor markets.	13.0	999.0
201603	1100	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland staff estimates that District employment grew 1.3 percent over the year ended in January.	13.0	999.0
201603	1101	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The District’s unemployment rate was 4.9 percent in January, well below the minimum of 5.2 percent reached during the last expansion.	13.0	999.0
201603	1102	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The staff’s diffusion index of hiring activity increased from minus 1 in January to plus 10 in February.	13.0	999.0
201603	1103	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Now, a broader set of contacts are reporting ongoing signs of labor market tightening, with firms across the service sector saying it’s difficult to find and retain workers.	13.0	999.0
201603	1104	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Retailers and bankers are now experiencing rising wage pressures for lower-skilled workers.	13.0	999.0
201603	1105	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	One Branch director, whose firm assists in placing unemployed workers, indicated that her pool of potential workers has shrunk to those whose skill sets leave them difficult to place.	13.0	999.0
201603	1106	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The relocation of workers in the energy sector has been slow.	13.0	999.0
201603	1107	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Much of the District’s employment in the mining, oil, and gas sector is in Appalachia and eastern Ohio, and those areas do not have diversified economies.	13.0	999.0
201603	1108	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	It seems likely that these displaced workers will need to relocate to other areas to regain employment.	13.0	999.0
201603	1109	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	When we’ve been through a period of very high unemployment, as we have during the recession, sometimes it’s easy to forget the types of inefficiencies that occur if the unemployment rate moves too far below a sustainable rate.	13.0	999.0
201603	1110	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The kind of unintended consequences of an overly tight labor market is conveyed by a report from one of our directors who’s a community banker.	13.0	999.0
201603	1111	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Since the start of the year, he’s been visiting many of his clients across the region.	13.0	999.0
201603	1112	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Mayors in several towns indicated that labor market tightness has become a big enough issue that they’ve had to pull back on efforts to attract new firms to their towns, which would be valuable to the community over the longer run, because of pushback from incumbent firms who would prefer not to have to face increasing competition for the small pool of available workers.	13.0	999.0
201603	1113	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	With regard to the national economy, early indicators suggest the step-down in growth in the fourth quarter of last year and the tightening in financial conditions earlier this year have begun to reverse.	13.0	999.0
201603	1114	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Growth indicators suggest a pickup from the 1 percent seen in the fourth quarter.	13.0	999.0
201603	1115	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland Federal Reserve staff has two nowcasting models that are reported in the Tealbook, and those have been reestimated including the data that have come in over the past week since the Tealbook closed, including today’s retail sales report and PPI data.	13.0	999.0
201603	1116	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Basically, the nowcasts are now about 0.1 percentage point lower than the estimates reported in the Tealbook for Q1 growth.	13.0	999.0
201603	1117	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Financial condition indexes, which had shown significantly tighter conditions in January, eased in February and March, reflecting the increase in stock prices, narrowing of credit spreads, and depreciation of the dollar in recent weeks.	13.0	999.0
201603	1118	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	On balance, financial conditions are only a bit tighter than anticipated.	13.0	999.0
201603	1119	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	These relatively fast moves in financial markets point out some of the challenges in assessing the impact of financial conditions on the medium-run outlook.	13.0	999.0
201603	1120	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	On the basis of available data and anecdotal reports from business contacts, in my view, the underlying fundamentals of the US economy remain sound.	13.0	999.0
201603	1121	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	I’ve made some changes to my projections since the December SEP submission, mainly regarding my longer-run projections.	13.0	999.0
201603	1122	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	In particular, I’ve moved down my estimates of longer-run growth, the longer-run unemployment rate, and the longer-run federal funds rate by 25 basis points each.	13.0	999.0
201603	1123	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	My longer-run growth and unemployment rate estimates had been on the high side of the FOMC projections.	13.0	999.0
201603	1124	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	But because of the combination of continued improvement in labor markets, moderate growth, and low inflation, it seemed like it was time for me to move toward the consensus on these measures.	13.0	999.0
201603	1125	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	I now project longer-run growth at 2 percent, the longer-run unemployment rate at 5 percent, and the longer-run funds rate at 3¼ percent.	13.0	999.0
201603	1126	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	In response to incoming data, I’ve made relatively minor adjustments to my projections over the next three years, and the narrative underlying the forecast remains the same:  Namely, growth slightly above trend will generate further improvement in the labor market, and inflation will gradually return to our target of 2 percent over the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201603	1127	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	My modal forecast has growth picking up to the 2¼ to 2½ percent range this year and next and gradually returning to trend in 2018.	13.0	999.0
201603	1128	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Despite the volatility in financial markets, consumer spending has held up, buoyed by gains in the labor market, low energy prices, and highly accommodative monetary policy.	13.0	999.0
201603	1129	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Housing has also shown slow but steady improvement.	13.0	999.0
201603	1130	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The gains in consumption and housing will help offset continued weakness in manufacturing in sectors exposed to energy and international trade, which I anticipate will remain challenged in the wake of weak growth abroad.	13.0	999.0
201603	1131	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Business investment is something that bears watching, and although it’s just one month of data, January’s improvement in capital goods orders is a positive sign.	13.0	999.0
201603	1132	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Labor markets are showing continued strong performance.	13.0	999.0
201603	1133	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	I believe the economy is basically at our goal of full employment from the perspective of monetary policy.	13.0	999.0
201603	1134	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	With growth above trend, I see the unemployment rate falling below my longer-run rate of 5 percent this year and next before gradually returning to that level by the end of 2018.	13.0	999.0
201603	1135	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Since its low point last September, the labor force participation rate has risen ½ percentage point.	13.0	999.0
201603	1136	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	It’s slightly above its longer-run trend, as estimated by the model developed by the Cleveland Federal Reserve and Board staff.	13.0	999.0
201603	1137	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Certain measures of underemployment, like the number of part-time workers who would rather work full time, remain at higher levels than before the recession.	13.0	999.0
201603	1138	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	At the same time, businesses tell us they cannot find workers with the skills they need.	13.0	999.0
201603	1139	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	I do believe there are longer-run problems, including workforce development issues, affecting US labor markets, and that deep recession and slow recovery have exposed and exacerbated these problems.	13.0	999.0
201603	1140	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	But it’s difficult for me to see how monetary policy can be effective in addressing these remaining issues.	13.0	999.0
201603	1141	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	And at this point in the cycle, using it to try to do so can be counterproductive because it takes the focus off government programs and policies that would be effective.	13.0	999.0
201603	1142	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The recent data on inflation have been encouraging and consistent with the pattern that has been anticipated by the FOMC.	13.0	999.0
201603	1143	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	As oil prices and the value of the dollar have shown some stability, both headline and measures of underlying inflation have moved higher.	13.0	999.0
201603	1144	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	And these moves are not just one month’s data.	13.0	999.0
201603	1145	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Headline and core measures of CPI and PCE inflation have been moving up over the past year.	13.0	999.0
201603	1146	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	As one well-respected economist and monetary policymaker, who happens to go by the name of Stan Fischer, carefully articulated in a speech last Monday, “We may well at present be seeing the first stirrings of an increase in the inflation rate.”	13.0	999.0
201603	1147	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Stable inflation expectations are an important component of inflation dynamics.	13.0	999.0
201603	1148	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Despite some small movements, I view inflation expectations as reasonably well anchored.	13.0	999.0
201603	1149	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Long-run PCE inflation expectations in the SPF moved up this quarter back to 2 percent.	13.0	999.0
201603	1150	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Moves in the Michigan survey’s long-run CPI inflation expectations measure are correlated with changes in oil prices.	13.0	999.0
201603	1151	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	And according to the Board staff memo, much of the decline in this measure since the second half of 2014 can be accounted for by the drop in gasoline prices.	13.0	999.0
201603	1152	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The sharper fall in the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations is difficult to interpret because this survey is new and its measures expected inflation three years ahead, which may be more heavily influenced by recent inflation movements.	13.0	999.0
201603	1153	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Many of the market-based measures of inflation compensation have fallen by more than the survey measures.	13.0	999.0
201603	1154	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	An exception is the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s five-year, five- year-forward measure, which is based on a model that incorporates survey measures of inflation expectations as well as market data on nominal Treasury yields and inflation swaps.	13.0	999.0
201603	1155	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland Federal Reserve measure has been relatively stable at near 2 percent.	13.0	999.0
201603	1156	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Like the survey measures, changes in market-based inflation compensation have shown high correlation with changes in oil prices.	13.0	999.0
201603	1157	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	And in this period of heightened market volatility and flight-to-quality flows into US Treasury securities, I think it’s particularly difficult to discern how much of the moves reflect changes in inflation expectations and how much reflect changes in risk premiums or liquidity premiums.	13.0	999.0
201603	1158	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	So although I agree that it’s very important to continue to monitor all of these measures, so far I don’t see them as alarming, and the movement up in actual inflation is somewhat reassuring.	13.0	999.0
201603	1159	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Hence, if the real side of the economy continues to perform consistent with my projections, I’m reasonably confident that inflation will gradually move back to our goal of 2 percent, likely by the end of 2017.	13.0	999.0
201603	1160	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	I see the risks associated with that forecast as roughly balanced, with lower oil prices being a downside risk in the near term but an upside risk in the medium run because they may spur stronger-than-expected consumer and business spending in an environment of significantly accommodative monetary policy.	13.0	999.0
201603	1161	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	I note that in the chart on page 27 of Tealbook A, which shows the 70 percent confidence interval associated with the staff’s inflation projection based on historical staff forecast errors, the risks are tilted to the upside, not to the downside, throughout the forecast horizon and particularly so for 2016.	13.0	999.0
201603	1162	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Of course, my projections are dependent on appropriate monetary policy, which I continue to believe entails moving the funds rate up gradually over the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201603	1163	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Because I have moved down my longer-run funds rate projection 25 basis points, my funds rate path is now shallower across the forecast horizon than in my December projections.	13.0	999.0
201603	1164	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	I acknowledge there continue to be risks to the forecast, but I see them as roughly balanced and not much larger than what we’ve seen historically.	13.0	999.0
201603	1165	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Of course, I also accept the fact that economic forecasts generally have fairly wide confidence bands around them, but I’m not ready to call them “lack of confidence” bands.	13.0	999.0
201603	1166	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The volatility in financial markets is a risk to my forecast.	13.0	999.0
201603	1167	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	If it were sustained and intensified, it could lead to a sustained pullback in risk appetites among investors, businesses, and consumers.	13.0	999.0
201603	1168	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	But so far we haven’t seen this, and messages from the market can turn around quickly.	13.0	999.0
201603	1169	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	A related risk comes from developments in the global economy.	13.0	999.0
201603	1170	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	If it turns out to be weaker than anticipated, this could lead to weaker growth in the United States.	13.0	999.0
201603	1171	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The actions taken by several foreign central banks to increase monetary accommodation help to mitigate some of this risk.	13.0	999.0
201603	1172	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	It’s good to remember that despite the volatility, despite the pain inflicted on the energy sector from falling oil prices, and despite weaker growth abroad, the US economy has proven to be quite resilient.	13.0	999.0
201603	1173	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	I think this should be the message coming out of our meeting tomorrow.	13.0	999.0
201603	1174	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201603	1175	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	1176	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13.0	65.0
201603	1177	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201603	1178	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	I haven’t materially changed my outlook from my December submission.	13.0	88.0
201603	1179	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m still expecting growth between 2 and 2½ percent for the year, and my submission for this meeting is at the high end of that range.	13.0	88.0
201603	1180	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Although inflation could soften a little over the next few monthly reports, I still expect both headline and core inflation will be firmer in 2016 than 2015, and I expect further strengthening in 2017.	13.0	88.0
201603	1181	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	I asked my staff to do a side-by-side comparison of a list of data elements to identify where, if at all, important indicators were diverging from the basic economic narrative that informed my December submission.	13.0	88.0
201603	1182	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	The one element that stands out as weaker is business fixed investment.	13.0	88.0
201603	1183	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Otherwise, real economy performance seems to be consistent with my outlook going into the December meeting.	13.0	88.0
201603	1184	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	My view at that time was that ongoing solid growth of domestic demand would likely override headwinds resulting from the uncertain global environment.	13.0	88.0
201603	1185	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Because the key driver of real-side performance continues to be domestic demand underpinned by growth of consumer activity, today’s retail sales report was disappointing.	13.0	88.0
201603	1186	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	However, even with the February report and the downward January revision, consumer spending remains at a relatively solid 2.7 percent annual growth rate in my Bank’s current-quarter nowcast calculation.	13.0	88.0
201603	1187	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	My Bank’s nowcast exercise for the first quarter currently has growth coming in at 1.9 percent as of this morning.	13.0	88.0
201603	1188	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	As the February data come in over the next several days, the estimate could move, but my sense of the picture reflected in the data since December is, the economy remains on plan, so to speak, with some downside risk.	13.0	88.0
201603	1189	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	In my team’s outreach to business contacts this cycle, we heard confirming anecdotal reports—or, put differently, we did not hear reports that cast substantial doubt on our basic narrative.	13.0	88.0
201603	1190	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Our contacts report that activity remains reasonably strong, with the exception of sectors connected to offshore demand and energy production.	13.0	88.0
201603	1191	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Retail industry contacts reported solid consumer activity, with expectations of modest acceleration in retail spending in 2016.	13.0	88.0
201603	1192	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Auto sales remain strong, although considerable price discounting and incentives are being used to maintain high sales levels.	13.0	88.0
201603	1193	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	As regards the labor market, we continue to hear reports that conditions are tightening even as underlying pressure on compensation growth remains light.	13.0	88.0
201603	1194	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	So, to summarize the rebound in our tracking estimate for this quarter versus the fourth quarter, we see, on net, positive signals on consumer spending, strength of the labor market, and strong reports from the business community.	13.0	88.0
201603	1195	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	All of this generally affirms the view that the fourth-quarter slowing was an aberration—more aberration than signal—and the economy in 2016 remains on a moderate growth track.	13.0	88.0
201603	1196	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	All that said, to present a complete picture, we did note a slightly more guarded tone in the feedback received from business contacts.	13.0	88.0
201603	1197	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Conversations with our directors reflecting their own recent contacts point to an environment of somewhat heightened uncertainty.	13.0	88.0
201603	1198	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	They attribute this apprehensiveness to the recent financial market volatility.	13.0	88.0
201603	1199	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	In a survey of business contacts completed last week by my Bank, about 20 percent of our panel of CEOs, CFOs, and business owners indicated they have scaled back their cap-ex or employment plans in response to the recent financial volatility.	13.0	88.0
201603	1200	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	We don’t have good methods of benchmarking this response, so we’re just taking note that one in five respondents appears to have postponed, but not canceled, expansion spending.	13.0	88.0
201603	1201	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	This may explain the weaker business fixed investment data.	13.0	88.0
201603	1202	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	My bottom line from all of this is that the spell of volatility experienced in January and early February should be processed in our policy thinking in a way similar to that of last August and its aftermath.	13.0	88.0
201603	1203	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	It’s a bout of nervousness that has raised uncertainty but apparently has not thrown the real-side economy off track.	13.0	88.0
201603	1204	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Just as the October meeting last year was too soon to be comfortable with that conclusion, this meeting may be a little too early to draw such a sanguine conclusion.	13.0	88.0
201603	1205	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	The data calendar has not lined up propitiously with the timing of this meeting, but by the April meeting we will have more information—although, to be fair, not the first-quarter GDP report, unfortunately.	13.0	88.0
201603	1206	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	And I will have more to say about the positioning at the April meeting in the next round.	13.0	88.0
201603	1207	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201603	1208	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	1209	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13.0	65.0
201603	1210	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	103.0
201603	1211	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Weakness in the ag and energy sectors continues to weigh heavily on the Tenth District economy, and growth has diverged between states that are dependent on these sectors and those that are not.	13.0	103.0
201603	1212	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Farm income is expected to weaken modestly in 2016, marking a third consecutive year in the current downturn.	13.0	103.0
201603	1213	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Demand for credit continues to rise.	13.0	103.0
201603	1214	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	And despite reduced cash flow, balance sheets continue to be bolstered by high farmland values, which have only modestly declined.	13.0	103.0
201603	1215	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	In energy-dependent parts of the region, the downturn in the energy sector has spilled over to other segments, such as consumer spending and residential construction activity.	13.0	103.0
201603	1216	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	The financial condition of many District energy firms has also continued to deteriorate.	13.0	103.0
201603	1217	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	In recent weeks, credit ratings have been downgraded, including a four-notch downgrade to one of the largest energy companies headquartered in the District, pulling its debt below investment grade for the first time.	13.0	103.0
201603	1218	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	District manufacturing and export activity continues to contract, and our manufacturing index has fallen to its lowest level since the financial crisis.	13.0	103.0
201603	1219	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	With significant layoffs in energy, anecdotes from our District contacts, however, suggest some of the workers are finding other jobs.	13.0	103.0
201603	1220	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Nationwide, I would note the number of jobs lost in this sector since September 2014 has outstripped the number of job losses in this sector during the Great Recession.	13.0	103.0
201603	1221	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	However, analysis by my staff suggests that energy-sector workers appear to have had an easier time finding employment over the past year than they did during the recession, and at better wages.	13.0	103.0
201603	1222	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Other than ag- and energy-intensive areas, the District economy is performing well, with employment expanding, wage growth strengthening, residential construction activity accelerating, and leisure and tourism improving.	13.0	103.0
201603	1223	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	One of our directors, who is from a major railroad shipping company, reported declines in energy-related shipments but also noted improving activity in automobile, chemical, and lumber shipments.	13.0	103.0
201603	1224	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	On the national outlook, my forecast has changed little since our previous meeting.	13.0	103.0
201603	1225	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Despite another bout of volatility in global financial markets, which has at least temporarily dissipated, I expect growth to step up from about a 2 percent rate in the first half of the year to 2½ percent in the second half as the drags due to energy-related investment cuts and inventory overhang run their course.	13.0	103.0
201603	1226	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	The outlook for consumer spending looks particularly solid to me in light of the recent data on consumption and employment.	13.0	103.0
201603	1227	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Hiring appears to have somewhat more momentum than I expected, and there is now clearly some upside risk to my medium-term growth forecast if wages rise more than expected as firms compete to fill their openings.	13.0	103.0
201603	1228	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	With the quits rate back to its pre-recession average and the hires rate just slightly below its pre- recession average, I agree with the Tealbook’s assessment that the employment gap is essentially closed.	13.0	103.0
201603	1229	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Another positive labor market development has been the increase in labor force participation of prime-age workers over the past six months.	13.0	103.0
201603	1230	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	My staff has looked at this prime- age cohort that transitioned from being outside the labor force to being employed in 2015 and found that reentrants were more likely to be highly educated.	13.0	103.0
201603	1231	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Although this is a positive development for labor markets, the available pool of such potential workers is limited.	13.0	103.0
201603	1232	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	So as this well-educated, flexible pool of workers shrinks, employers will need to curtail hiring or dig more deeply into the pool of the unemployed for new hires.	13.0	103.0
201603	1233	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	I suspect it will be a mix of both.	13.0	103.0
201603	1234	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	So I have lowered my unemployment rate forecast in the medium term, although I still anticipate employment growth to slow from its current pace in the future because of slower growth of the working-age population.	13.0	103.0
201603	1235	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Of course, there are risks to this outlook originating both domestically and abroad, and I remain attentive to these expectations.	13.0	103.0
201603	1236	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Appealing to the wit of the late Alfred Kahn, my staff, too, has been evaluating whether the economy will experience a “banana” in the near term.	13.0	103.0
201603	1237	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	I knew there was a risk to this kind of a joke.	13.0	103.0
201603	1238	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	It’s no longer a risk, Esther.	13.0	97.0
201603	1239	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	13.0	97.0
201603	1240	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	I know.	13.0	103.0
201603	1241	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	I’ve gotten the answer that I worried about there.	13.0	103.0
201603	1242	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	I continue to watch signals stemming mostly from the energy sector and the effect on financial conditions as well as elevated levels of inventories.	13.0	103.0
201603	1243	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	However, the positive slope of the Treasury yield curve and strong job growth relative to the slower underlying trend due to demographics do not seem consistent with the near-term, broad-based downturn.	13.0	103.0
201603	1244	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	And although foreign growth could certainly disappoint or be an ongoing source of concern, modal forecasts are for it to strengthen in 2016.	13.0	103.0
201603	1245	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Regarding inflation, although the strong reading for core PCE price growth in January may have resulted in part from residual seasonality and other temporary factors, as the Tealbook concludes, I would also note that the four-tenths increase in the year-over-year growth rate since last year has been relatively broad based.	13.0	103.0
201603	1246	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Previous health-care payment changes were a contributing factor, but about half of the increase can be explained by stronger durable goods price growth.	13.0	103.0
201603	1247	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Other measures, such as the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas trimmed mean PCE inflation rate and the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI, have increased, suggesting the rise in core PCE was not primarily due to idiosyncratic factors or issues related to seasonal adjustment.	13.0	103.0
201603	1248	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Inflation expectations appear to be relatively stable, although we must remain attentive to signals to the contrary.	13.0	103.0
201603	1249	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	I take some comfort that, as noted in the Board staff’s memo and from my own staff’s research, we have seen declines in the number of forecasts predicting higher than 2 percent inflation—a positive development—and have seen relative stability in the lower end of the distribution.	13.0	103.0
201603	1250	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Also, the distribution of individual longer-term inflation expectations is currently similar to the distribution that existed before the financial crisis.	13.0	103.0
201603	1251	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, as it relates to household views on inflation, I don’t read too much into the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers.	13.0	103.0
201603	1252	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Its measure of longer-term inflation expectations is highly correlated with gasoline prices, so it moves dramatically to news about near-term inflation.	13.0	103.0
201603	1253	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	In fact, when you drill down to the actual survey questions, I wonder how well consumers are able to respond to the time-frame dimension.	13.0	103.0
201603	1254	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	For example, the question “What about the outlook for prices over the next 5 to 10 years?” is then followed by a flow chart to elicit more detail.	13.0	103.0
201603	1255	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	So although consumer expectations bear watching, I am cautious about taking too much signal from small moves in this measure in terms of evaluating the anchoring of long- term inflation expectations.	13.0	103.0
201603	1256	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	13.0	103.0
201603	1257	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	1258	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13.0	65.0
201603	1259	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	81.0
201603	1260	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Economic conditions in the Fifth District appear to have strengthened in recent weeks.	13.0	81.0
201603	1261	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Preliminary readings on our March surveys are quite positive.	13.0	81.0
201603	1262	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	These won’t be released until next Tuesday, so these are preliminary numbers, but the number of responses is pretty high.	13.0	81.0
201603	1263	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	The manufacturing index rose from negative 4 in February to positive 10, with strong readings for shipments, new orders, and hiring.	13.0	81.0
201603	1264	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Similarly, our service-sector survey rebounded strongly from negative 2 in February to positive 10 in March.	13.0	81.0
201603	1265	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	The retail revenue and shopper traffic numbers were particularly strong.	13.0	81.0
201603	1266	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Comments from our directors and roundtable members were also more positive than in January.	13.0	81.0
201603	1267	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Reports from retailers were generally upbeat, particularly for auto dealers.	13.0	81.0
201603	1268	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Labor markets were said to strengthen in the District, and reports of difficulty finding qualified workers continued.	13.0	81.0
201603	1269	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	One contact noted that there was an increased availability of workers in their area due to an influx of laid-off energy workers from the west, so perhaps the Fifth District’s gain is the Tenth District’s loss.	13.0	81.0
201603	1270	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Residential real estate contacts were upbeat as well, except for concerns about the supply of buildable lots in some locales.	13.0	81.0
201603	1271	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	And commercial real estate appears to be strong across all segments:  industrial, multifamily, office, and retail.	13.0	81.0
201603	1272	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	With regard to the national economy, I submitted a projection of real GDP growth in 2016 that’s just a little bit below what I submitted in December—2.1 percent.	13.0	81.0
201603	1273	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	This mostly reflects a somewhat lower path for business fixed investment early in this year.	13.0	81.0
201603	1274	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	My outlook reflects an assessment that the downside risks to US growth that we saw in January and early February as a result of global economic and financial developments have largely dissipated, and I see them as having few downside implications at this point.	13.0	81.0
201603	1275	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	The strong consumption growth we saw last year was an important influence on my December projections, and I believe the fundamentals for housing spending remain solid.	13.0	81.0
201603	1276	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Labor markets have continued to strengthen, and the recent numbers on consumer spending have confirmed that outlook.	13.0	81.0
201603	1277	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	In particular, the strength of vehicle sales and consumer sentiment indexes suggest that US consumers have not been deterred by financial market developments.	13.0	81.0
201603	1278	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Residential investment also appears to be on track for strong growth this year.	13.0	81.0
201603	1279	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Business fixed investment, however, has been soft lately, largely attributable to falling energy prices and the strong dollar as well as broader concerns about global economic growth.	13.0	81.0
201603	1280	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	This is one area in which you might expect to see significant fallout from the weakness in US equity markets or global growth concerns more generally, but the effect so far appears to be limited.	13.0	81.0
201603	1281	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	We have not heard any reports of material cutbacks from our District contacts, for example.	13.0	81.0
201603	1282	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Some others have reported that as well.	13.0	81.0
201603	1283	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	And respondents to the Duke business school’s CFO survey for March, released just last week, expect an average of 2.0 percent capital expenditure growth for this year, down from 2.6 percent for the previous survey in December.	13.0	81.0
201603	1284	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	And this hardly constitutes a massive cut in spending plans.	13.0	81.0
201603	1285	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	It’s still consistent with an economy growing near trend.	13.0	81.0
201603	1286	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	All of this is in line with the Tealbook’s forecast that equipment and intangibles investment will show more strength in the second half.	13.0	81.0
201603	1287	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	The dollar has retraced in recent weeks, and I expect somewhat less drag due to net exports this year than I did in December—again, consistent with the Tealbook.	13.0	81.0
201603	1288	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	The continued strength in labor markets has been remarkable, with employment growth continuing to outpace growth in the working-age population.	13.0	81.0
201603	1289	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	For this year, I expect job growth to slow to levels closer to labor force growth as the unemployment rate bottoms out and moves back toward its longer-term level, which I estimate to be close to where it is right now.	13.0	81.0
201603	1290	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Now that the unemployment rate is at or below most estimates of the natural rate and labor force participation is close to estimates of its trend, the share of those working part time for economic reasons is one utilization indicator that remains somewhat elevated relative to pre-recession levels.	13.0	81.0
201603	1291	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	But we shouldn’t look at this measure in isolation.	13.0	81.0
201603	1292	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	For example, job openings are significantly above pre-recession levels relative to hires or the labor force, which suggests that something other than cyclical factors or deficient demand is keeping the measure of those working part time for economic reasons elevated.	13.0	81.0
201603	1293	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	With regard to inflation, it’s certainly possible that the strong January number will turn out to be transitory.	13.0	81.0
201603	1294	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	That said, the pickup in January was spread pretty broadly across PCE components, and that leads me to place somewhat more probability on inflation returning to 2 percent faster than we’ve been expecting.	13.0	81.0
201603	1295	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	The stability of longer-term inflation expectations is clearly critical to our confidence that inflation will return to target over an acceptable horizon.	13.0	81.0
201603	1296	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	And I appreciate the staff memo.	13.0	81.0
201603	1297	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	It provides a comprehensive review of some of the subtleties involved in estimating longer-term expected inflation.	13.0	81.0
201603	1298	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	TIPS-based inflation compensation has been weak in recent months, although it has rebounded in recent weeks.	13.0	81.0
201603	1299	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Extracting measures of expected inflation from observed inflation compensation requires making assumptions of one sort or another, and the results can be sensitive to the assumptions one chooses.	13.0	81.0
201603	1300	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	At this point, I’m persuaded by the analysis I’ve read that most of the variation we’ve seen in the inflation compensation numbers is attributable to movements in risk and liquidity premiums, and that expected inflation has been relatively stable.	13.0	81.0
201603	1301	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Across an array of financial markets, risk premiums have been found to account for a significant portion of the variation in prices, and this is despite the fact that in models, for convenience, we typically make assumptions that imply conditional variances are fairly stable.	13.0	81.0
201603	1302	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	So I don’t think it should be a surprise if these premiums are driving fluctuations in breakevens, particularly during episodes of greater volatility in financial markets more generally.	13.0	81.0
201603	1303	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	A sizable share of the recent decline in these premiums seems to me to be plausibly attributable to flight-to-quality in response to global developments.	13.0	81.0
201603	1304	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	And if so, I think we should expect to see the compensation measures move back up as global uncertainties continue to subside.	13.0	81.0
201603	1305	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Survey measures of expected inflation have also moved down recently, and these presumably are free from the confounding effects of risk premiums.	13.0	81.0
201603	1306	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	The staff memo points out, however, that consumer-based survey measures tend to react strongly to retail gas prices, as many others have remarked this afternoon.	13.0	81.0
201603	1307	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	And when they adjust the Michigan survey for such effects, the resulting measure is more stable and has not fallen below 2 percent.	13.0	81.0
201603	1308	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Expected inflation from surveys of professional forecasters are also more stable and are not below 2 percent.	13.0	81.0
201603	1309	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	So I still see 2 percent as the effective attractor for inflation over the medium term, and I remain reasonably confident that, barring unexpected developments, inflation will move up.	13.0	81.0
201603	1310	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	To sum up, like many of you, my outlook for growth and inflation is very close to my December outlook.	13.0	81.0
201603	1311	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	As a result, I’m left wondering why our projected policy rate path would be revised down by much.	13.0	81.0
201603	1312	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Presumably, we’ll discuss this tomorrow.	13.0	81.0
201603	1313	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13.0	65.0
201603	1314	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201603	1315	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	In the past six months, financial markets have experienced two significant meltdowns in which volatility spiked, commodity and equity market prices plummeted, the dollar rose, and credit spreads increased substantially as investors fled from risk assets.	13.0	104.0
201603	1316	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Both episodes were tied to concerns of much weaker growth in China and the related possibility of significant depreciation of the RMB—concerns that connected to fears of broader global weakness.	13.0	104.0
201603	1317	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	In both cases, the tightening in financial conditions abated by some measures after a period of turmoil.	13.0	104.0
201603	1318	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	But the recurrence of these episodes nonetheless suggests caution to me for the time being.	13.0	104.0
201603	1319	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	China’s management of the RMB exchange rate may be just reaching a more stable footing, although it’s too early to have comfort in that.	13.0	104.0
201603	1320	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	China seems, for now, to be papering over the hard issues that it confronts in its ongoing economic transition.	13.0	104.0
201603	1321	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Although these issues will be daunting in the medium term, it is probably still true that China can muddle through in the short term despite a troubling and unsustainable buildup of debt, and risks of even slower growth remain in the near term.	13.0	104.0
201603	1322	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	The picture for other emerging market economies is also a challenging one, and the outlook for many advanced foreign economies has also weakened, for example, in Europe, Japan, and Canada.	13.0	104.0
201603	1323	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	The ECB’s strong actions announced last week are welcome but, nonetheless, a sign of deep concern, and the Bank of Japan’s surprise deployment of negative rates has so far not been well received by the markets.	13.0	104.0
201603	1324	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	The question of whether central banks may be running out of tools is very much in the air.	13.0	104.0
201603	1325	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	For the United States, of course, the picture remains a better one.	13.0	104.0
201603	1326	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	In January and February, US market participants were highly focused on the likelihood of a recession in 2016.	13.0	104.0
201603	1327	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Many well-known outside economists wrote pieces addressing that question, generally concluding that recession probabilities had increased but remained low.	13.0	104.0
201603	1328	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	And that is also the view of the fine staff memo distributed before this meeting.	13.0	104.0
201603	1329	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Meanwhile, US economic readings have held up reasonably well.	13.0	104.0
201603	1330	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	For us, the tightening in financial conditions has been unwinding now for over a month, and conditions are now about where they were in December.	13.0	104.0
201603	1331	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Job growth has remained strong, as has consumer spending.	13.0	104.0
201603	1332	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Both household and business sentiment have held up reasonably well.	13.0	104.0
201603	1333	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	After a sharp correction, leveraged finance markets have settled down and show some early signs of recovery.	13.0	104.0
201603	1334	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Spreads have come back in significantly but remain far from fully recovered, and contacts suggest that the pipeline, which was nearly empty a month ago, is showing signs of increased activity.	13.0	104.0
201603	1335	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	So with that background, my modal forecast hasn’t changed much since the December SEP round.	13.0	104.0
201603	1336	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I see growth continuing at around 2 percent, modestly above potential.	13.0	104.0
201603	1337	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I see continued strong job growth.	13.0	104.0
201603	1338	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	The Tealbook calls for a sharp increase in labor productivity growth from the five-year average of 0.5 percent to around 1½ percent in 2016.	13.0	104.0
201603	1339	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	And I have stuck with a more-of-the-same approach instead, with productivity increasing but on a more gradual path.	13.0	104.0
201603	1340	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	As a result, with the continuation of strong job growth, my unemployment rate falls to 4½ percent by the end of this year and edges down further in the out-years.	13.0	104.0
201603	1341	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I’m also very encouraged by the welcome increase in labor force participation.	13.0	104.0
201603	1342	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Looking through the ups and downs, labor force participation has now been flat for two and a half years in the face of an estimated trend decline of roughly 30 basis points annually.	13.0	104.0
201603	1343	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Of course, these readings are noisy, but this kind of an increase would be consistent with the pattern of the past two recoveries in which labor force participation rose above the underlying trend late in the cycle, and that would be a particularly desirable and welcome result in this recovery.	13.0	104.0
201603	1344	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	On inflation, the achievement of our 2 percent objective has once again shifted a bit further out.	13.0	104.0
201603	1345	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I am comfortable with the Tealbook projection, with inflation rising gradually as the effects of lower oil prices and the dollar’s rise eventually fade and the economy tightens.	13.0	104.0
201603	1346	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	The reversal of these transient effects should eventually raise underlying core inflation close to the 2 percent objective.	13.0	104.0
201603	1347	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	More fundamentally, though, it is essential that inflation expectations remain anchored around 2 percent, as I believe they are today.	13.0	104.0
201603	1348	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	For that to remain true, the Committee must be credibly committed to bringing inflation back to 2 percent.	13.0	104.0
201603	1349	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I will add that I find that the staff memo buttresses my view that the low market-based measures of inflation expectations need to be handled with care and should not be given more prominent discussion in our communications.	13.0	104.0
201603	1350	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Although the modal outlook for the US economy is broadly the same as it was in December, the balance of risks, in my view, has shifted to the downside.	13.0	104.0
201603	1351	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	In particular, I continue to see the external sector as an important downside risk.	13.0	104.0
201603	1352	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Overall, the risk of a global recession has increased.	13.0	104.0
201603	1353	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	We will feel weak global demand.	13.0	104.0
201603	1354	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	In addition, weakness abroad in the context of ongoing easing by other major central banks may put further upward pressure on the dollar.	13.0	104.0
201603	1355	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Weak global growth is likely to put a relatively low speed limit on our growth and on the pace at which it will be appropriate to raise interest rates.	13.0	104.0
201603	1356	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	More on that tomorrow.	13.0	104.0
201603	1357	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201603	1358	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	1359	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	13.0	65.0
201603	1360	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	111.0
201603	1361	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	The Ninth District economy continues to perform relatively well.	13.0	111.0
201603	1362	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Employment is strong in the region.	13.0	111.0
201603	1363	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	The unemployment rate in Minnesota, for example, is 3.7 percent.	13.0	111.0
201603	1364	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	The global decline in commodity prices, however, is having a notable impact on my District.	13.0	111.0
201603	1365	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Our contacts report that depressed commodity prices, the strong dollar, and a slowdown in global trade have taken a toll on agriculture, mining, heavy equipment producers, and transportation firms that ship those commodities.	13.0	111.0
201603	1366	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	The sustained drop in oil prices is having a very heavy weight on the oil-producing economy of North Dakota.	13.0	111.0
201603	1367	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	In addition, more than 2,000 workers in Minneapolis’s Iron Range region have been laid off over the past year, as firms have idled mines and processing plants largely in response to declines in iron ore prices and in demand.	13.0	111.0
201603	1368	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	On the positive side, the construction sector and the health services sector are strong, and companies in the District in the food processing, aircraft, fertilizer, electronics, and medical devices industries have all recently announced large investments and plans to increase employment.	13.0	111.0
201603	1369	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	At the national level, the economy’s performance has also been uneven.	13.0	111.0
201603	1370	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	The labor market continues to show strength, with unemployment at low levels and payroll employment growing substantially.	13.0	111.0
201603	1371	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	As Governors Powell and Brainard and others have noted, the uptick in the employment-to-population ratio and the labor force participation rate is clearly a good thing.	13.0	111.0
201603	1372	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	You know, in recent years, many people have been focused on the prospect of a lost generation of workers as the long-term unemployed became permanently unemployable.	13.0	111.0
201603	1373	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	I don’t want to overreact to near-term data, but it is unquestionably a good thing that we’re seeing people come off the sidelines and back into the labor force, and I would encourage us to continue that process as long as we can get it to go because it’s a big benefit for society.	13.0	111.0
201603	1374	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Inflation is more concerning, however, despite the recent uptick.	13.0	111.0
201603	1375	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	As many have noted, inflation is still running below our 2 percent target, and continued undershooting of the target could push down inflation expectations.	13.0	111.0
201603	1376	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	As others have noted, inflation expectations are edging down in surveys and in market-based measures.	13.0	111.0
201603	1377	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Such mixed signals for the national economy are especially worrisome in the context of elevated uncertainty in financial markets and in foreign economies.	13.0	111.0
201603	1378	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Uncertainty about China’s economic and policy outlook continues to be a risk for the health of emerging markets and financial markets in general.	13.0	111.0
201603	1379	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	The Tealbook, as we discussed, reports an increase in the probability of a global recession.	13.0	111.0
201603	1380	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Softening of euro-area economies with the added uncertainty about a potential Brexit has prompted a strong response from the ECB.	13.0	111.0
201603	1381	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	But that action only highlights the divergence between our own monetary policy and those of other major central banks—a divergence that poses downside risks for the US economy, including the potential for further appreciation of the dollar.	13.0	111.0
201603	1382	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	In summary, I view the US economy as gradually recovering, but the mixed signals for labor markets and inflation in the context of global risk tell me that the uncertainty continues to be elevated.	13.0	111.0
201603	1383	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	13.0	111.0
201603	1384	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	1385	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13.0	65.0
201603	1386	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201603	1387	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Like most, if not all, of you, I find that my assessment of the economy hasn’t actually changed much since we did the December SEP, notwithstanding the interesting three-month interval.	13.0	97.0
201603	1388	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	My baseline expectation is still for the US economy to chug along with modestly above-trend growth.	13.0	97.0
201603	1389	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	There’s obviously been, first, volatility and then the stabilization in financial markets between the December SEP and today.	13.0	97.0
201603	1390	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	As several of you have pointed out, that stabilization probably has at least something to do with the recalibration of people’s expectations as to what our policies are going to be.	13.0	97.0
201603	1391	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	So I want to say a few things in the remainder of my remarks about labor markets, inflation, and the balance of risks.	13.0	97.0
201603	1392	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to labor markets, I just wanted to recall that a couple of years ago we were still having a very active debate around this table as to whether the unemployment rate was capturing reasonably well the amount of slack in labor markets.	13.0	97.0
201603	1393	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And some of the issues we were debating at the time included whether there had been a substantial increase in structural unemployment and whether the long-term unemployed would mostly transit out of the labor market completely and, thus, couldn’t really be counted as part of labor market slack.	13.0	97.0
201603	1394	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	In retrospect, it seems quite clear that the unemployment rate did not totally capture the amount of slack that was in the labor market and that it did, indeed, reflect dominantly cyclical factors and not an additional quantum of structural unemployment.	13.0	97.0
201603	1395	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I think that the way in which the labor market continues to improve suggests that there is some slack remaining, though, obviously, considerably less than when we were having those debates a couple of years ago.	13.0	97.0
201603	1396	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Now, people have noted the continuing anecdotal reports about difficulty in finding qualified people.	13.0	97.0
201603	1397	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	You know, I literally was thinking about one of my very first meetings in my first job in the government, which was with a group of auto and steel executives.	13.0	97.0
201603	1398	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	This was in 1979.	13.0	97.0
201603	1399	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And what I still remember from that meeting is one of their complaints—imports was at the top of the list, but right after that, they couldn’t find qualified workers.	13.0	97.0
201603	1400	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And I have to say that in the intervening years, in every government policy job I’ve had, that is a perennial complaint of all employers.	13.0	97.0
201603	1401	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	They can never find qualified workers, and so I think we’re always going to continue to hear that, and we’ve got to look at data to determine the degree to which that’s really translating into economic performance.	13.0	97.0
201603	1402	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I would also say that there’s a reasonably good relationship between periods in which employers really do have trouble finding qualified workers and, thus, are confronted with either having to raise wages or find productivity increases.	13.0	97.0
201603	1403	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And one of those two things usually results when labor markets really do tighten to a substantial degree.	13.0	97.0
201603	1404	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I would expect that we’ll see some combination of those in the quarters ahead.	13.0	97.0
201603	1405	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	So adding a couple of points to those that Lael already made on the hypothesis of some continued slack, well, job creation continues to average more than 200,000 a month.	13.0	97.0
201603	1406	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Metrics such as the average workweek and people working part time for economic reasons have been essentially flat over the past six months, suggesting that the ways in which labor markets are improving are such as to be drawing on some slack and not eliminating it.	13.0	97.0
201603	1407	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	The number of those out of the labor force but wanting a job is still somewhat elevated.	13.0	97.0
201603	1408	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And now I’ve got a new little analytic observation to put into the mix, since everybody is getting tired of hearing about PTER and the average workweek.	13.0	97.0
201603	1409	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	This one our labor economists drew to my attention.	13.0	97.0
201603	1410	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	It’s a little obscure, but it’s actually pretty interesting.	13.0	97.0
201603	1411	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	They point out that although folks have focused on those who are out of the labor force and want a job, the much greater group out of the labor force are those who say they don’t want a job.	13.0	97.0
201603	1412	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And yet approximately 4 percent of that group continues to transition into employment.	13.0	97.0
201603	1413	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And if you look at just prime-age workers, this number is over 6 percent and has been rising over the course of the past year.	13.0	97.0
201603	1414	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	So as the labor market improves, and as employers are more motivated to look for workers, even those out of the labor force, oftentimes through informal mechanisms, are recruited back in—a situation that suggests, once again, that there’s still some slack remaining, although obviously not an enormous amount.	13.0	97.0
201603	1415	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And as a number of you have already noted, a pickup in wage increases is still largely in the realm of anecdote despite a couple of data points to the contrary, which have been given to us and then taken away.	13.0	97.0
201603	1416	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	On inflation, I’m still not at the point at which I can have reasonable confidence that inflation will return to 2 percent within a reasonable period.	13.0	97.0
201603	1417	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Though let me be clear—I don’t think the prospects for achieving this goal have worsened since December, and I think they have actually probably increased a bit along the way and obviously will be strengthened further still if the one-month increase portends more of the same, contrary to current staff expectations.	13.0	97.0
201603	1418	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	The staff estimate that the waning of the energy and dollar effects, which are clearly lingering longer than many expected, will get us only about halfway from the current core PCE inflation rate to the 2 percent goal, and it seems reasonable to expect some effect from further reductions in the output gap, though how much is difficult to say, absent faith in the return of a considerably steeper Phillips curve.	13.0	97.0
201603	1419	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	So the remaining work has to be done by overshooting, by the work of expectations, or by some combination thereof.	13.0	97.0
201603	1420	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Expectations have recently bumped off their lows, but both market- and survey-based expectations are still toward the low end of historical ranges.	13.0	97.0
201603	1421	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	This is a global phenomenon, which some market participants and commentators attribute, in part, to skepticism that central banks will be able to achieve their inflation goals.	13.0	97.0
201603	1422	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And recently, at least—and I am relying here on, I think it was a really good New York Federal Reserve Open Market Desk survey of developments in inflation expectations—it doesn’t appear that liquidity considerations can account for the recent declines in inflation compensation.	13.0	97.0
201603	1423	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	We’re in a global environment of persistently low inflation with some continuing risk of further disinflation.	13.0	97.0
201603	1424	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	In the United States, the combination of the slow waning of some factors and the indeterminate pull of increasing capacity constraints may get us closer to 2 percent.	13.0	97.0
201603	1425	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But as I mentioned a moment ago, some further energizer is needed, at least in the staff projection, for that final ¼ percentage point from 1.75 to 2 percent.	13.0	97.0
201603	1426	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	So those are the reasons why, at this point, I’m still not in the “reasonable confidence” camp, though I may yet get there.	13.0	97.0
201603	1427	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I thought it was useful, though, for my own thinking to consider the other side.	13.0	97.0
201603	1428	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	What are the risks that inflation gets away from us if my absence of reasonable confidence proves to have been—I guess it wouldn’t be misplaced, because it’s an absence—if I should have had reasonable confidence sooner than I did.	13.0	97.0
201603	1429	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I asked the staff to do an alternative scenario that incorporated some pretty optimistic inputs about what would be happening in the US economy, and these are the three key ones that I specified for them.	13.0	97.0
201603	1430	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	One is that the US dollar is immediately 10 percent lower in real terms and remains so through the simulation.	13.0	97.0
201603	1431	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Two, oil prices are up $20 a barrel from the beginning of and through the simulation.	13.0	97.0
201603	1432	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And, three, aggregate demand is boosted so that the output gap is The results of the simulation?	13.0	97.0
201603	1433	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	First, total PCE inflation was about ½ percentage point higher by the end of this year—that’s dominantly the effect of oil prices—and then about 20 basis points higher in each of the next two years, which is primarily the effect of the lower dollar but also a little from overheating.	13.0	97.0
201603	1434	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Second, core PCE inflation is only slightly above the baseline in 2016 since oil doesn’t have that much effect, obviously, on the core.	13.0	97.0
201603	1435	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But even in 2017 and 2018, core is less than 20 basis points higher, mostly attributable to the dollar and the stronger economy.	13.0	97.0
201603	1436	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	In the simulation, just to give you some context on the real side, GDP was, on average, ½ percentage point higher through the period, and the unemployment rate was about ½ percentage point below the baseline by the end of this year, remaining at that interval through the next two years.	13.0	97.0
201603	1437	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And, finally, the simulation pulled the federal funds rate up about 80 basis points above the baseline by the end of 2018.	13.0	97.0
201603	1438	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Now, actually, that looks like a rather nice outcome, if we could get it.	13.0	97.0
201603	1439	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But for me, the key point is that it’s hard to see inflation getting away from us even with substantially different real economy outcomes than any of us believe are likely at this time.	13.0	97.0
201603	1440	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Now, as in all simulations using the staff model, the impact of expectations in holding changes in actual inflation back is pretty significant.	13.0	97.0
201603	1441	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	So if expectations become unanchored or if, as I have wondered from time to time, the inflation expectations hypothesis turns out to be more a matter of correlation between measured expectations and actual inflation over the past 20 years than it does a matter of causation, then the increase in inflation could be greater than that produced by the alternative scenario.	13.0	97.0
201603	1442	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But if you want to postulate the unanchoring of expectations after a relatively brief period of rising inflation, I think you need to explain why that would happen after seven years in which lower-than-target inflation and apparently substantial patience by the FOMC in getting back to 2 percent has produced only a flirting of expectations with historic lows rather than their becoming unanchored.	13.0	97.0
201603	1443	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And I just have to note in passing that as I listen to the conversation around the table, people have now cumulatively disrespected both market measures of expectations and survey measures of expectations, and yet everybody continues to say that expectations are really important, except that we just don’t trust the measures of them.	13.0	97.0
201603	1444	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But I’ll just let that pass for the moment.	13.0	97.0
201603	1445	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Now, if you don’t think that expectations have that much effect on actual inflation, then what’s your theory for explaining the past seven years and why we haven’t been doing more to return to target if you don’t think that expectations are going to pull us back that way?	13.0	97.0
201603	1446	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I hardly need to speculate as to what some members of the Committee would be saying had we been above target for even a year during that period, much less for seven.	13.0	97.0
201603	1447	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	So if you’re sticking with the expectations theory for inflation, I think this alternative scenario should give you considerable reassurance.	13.0	97.0
201603	1448	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And if you’re not, and you want to come over to my self-described pragmatic approach and be more sensitive to actual developments, that’s great.	13.0	97.0
201603	1449	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I welcome the converts.	13.0	97.0
201603	1450	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But I think it’s hard to conclude in either case that there’s a large risk of inflation getting away from us if and as we follow appropriate policy, should a sustained uptick become apparent.	13.0	97.0
201603	1451	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Finally, to risks.	13.0	97.0
201603	1452	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Domestically, I agree with President Williams that risks are roughly balanced.	13.0	97.0
201603	1453	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	On the upside—I’m not sure this totally correlates with yours, President Williams, but I think they’re consistent—some dissipation of uncertainty in the global economy would probably have a confidence effect.	13.0	97.0
201603	1454	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	If wage increases do pick up, as many expect, that should support aggregate demand even with a somewhat slowing pace of employment growth, and that, in turn, might prompt a little bit of acceleration of business fixed investment, which, as a number of you noted, has been lagging somewhat.	13.0	97.0
201603	1455	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	On the downside, we’ve seen some signs of slowdowns in some spending categories.	13.0	97.0
201603	1456	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Some survey-based measures of hiring expectations are edging down.	13.0	97.0
201603	1457	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	The ISM nonmanufacturing index and, most importantly, the orders component of that index have been trending down for about six months now.	13.0	97.0
201603	1458	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	So there are some signs that maybe things are slowing a little bit, notwithstanding the fact that there are other signs that things may be picking up.	13.0	97.0
201603	1459	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Eric, I’m not sure you were positing banks as a downside risk or not, or it just was sort of a financial stability observation, but to the degree it was a downside risk, I’m not sure I totally agree.	13.0	97.0
201603	1460	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I do agree with your assessment of the global banks.	13.0	97.0
201603	1461	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But with the US banks, I actually didn’t see as close a correlation with short-term wholesale funding and the relative equity declines of the banks.	13.0	97.0
201603	1462	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I’ll tell you, the correlation I saw was rather more closely with the banks whose business models are being met with the most skepticism in investor markets as to how profitable these institutions are going to be in the new economic and regulatory environment that they currently occupy.	13.0	97.0
201603	1463	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And so in at least one case, a bank that’s not overly dependent, relatively speaking, on short-term wholesale funding continues to take the biggest hits to its equity price and even to its CDS spread.	13.0	97.0
201603	1464	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And I think—but this is just a hypothesis—it’s probably got more to do with whether you can be profitable, whether you have to make more changes, particularly as more regulation directed at the SIFIs comes online.	13.0	97.0
201603	1465	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But if risks are roughly balanced domestically, I think internationally they’re decidedly weighted to the downside.	13.0	97.0
201603	1466	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	It’s not like the global economy is falling apart, and Beth Anne made this point, I think, in her initial remarks.	13.0	97.0
201603	1467	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I agree with those of you who have said that markets probably overreacted both late last summer and in the January–February period.	13.0	97.0
201603	1468	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But the ECB and the Bank of Japan are both struggling to produce a monetary policy that achieves even very modest growth.	13.0	97.0
201603	1469	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	There’s essentially no chance for a rapid pickup in growth in those rather important economies.	13.0	97.0
201603	1470	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	China should be okay—I think Governor Powell hit the nail on the head.	13.0	97.0
201603	1471	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	For the next six months or so, China should be fine.	13.0	97.0
201603	1472	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I’m pretty certain that nothing bad is going to happen between now and the G-20 meetings.	13.0	97.0
201603	1473	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But after that, there are some problems that they’re going to have to confront, and they pose as more of a medium-term risk.	13.0	97.0
201603	1474	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And, again, there’s not all that much upside risk that they’re going to go back to 9 or 10 percent growth over the next several years.	13.0	97.0
201603	1475	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Emerging markets are in an extended period of readjustment to less-attractive export markets due to China’s slowing, sluggish growth of mature economies, the related end of the so- called commodity supercycle, and the big shifts in capital flows that have occurred over the past couple of years.	13.0	97.0
201603	1476	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Again, it doesn’t seem as though a crisis is likely.	13.0	97.0
201603	1477	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	You know, even in Brazil, the economics suggest hard times rather than a crisis, although politics may push them over the edge.	13.0	97.0
201603	1478	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But it’s still a very vulnerable position, and that’s the way I assess the global economy more generally.	13.0	97.0
201603	1479	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	The baseline is not for a global recession, although I found the staff work that Beth Anne presented very valuable in thinking about the increased risks.	13.0	97.0
201603	1480	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But the odds are up, to some degree—exactly how much, we don’t know—and most importantly, from my point of view, the world economy is very vulnerable to any form of adverse shock, whatever its origin, whether it’s economic, geopolitical, or something else that we can conjure up.	13.0	97.0
201603	1481	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And, thus, we would see not only the modeled effects on the US economy, which will probably only be moderate, but, as Rob points out, some of the flow through to the earnings of US companies, which are increasingly important, and also the harder-to-quantify but very real risk-off sentiment that would occur if you had that kind of global reaction to some external shock.	13.0	97.0
201603	1482	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	So it’s for that reason that, while not wanting to overstate it, I think the risks really are on the downside globally and pretty significantly so, thereby offsetting, in my mind at least, the roughly balanced risks that you’d see if you just looked in an insular fashion at the United States.	13.0	97.0
201603	1483	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201603	1484	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	1485	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13.0	65.0
201603	1486	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201603	1487	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, we’re pretty much like everybody else.	13.0	96.0
201603	1488	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	We haven’t changed our forecast of growth or inflation much for 2016.	13.0	96.0
201603	1489	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	On the growth side, we’ve lowered GDP growth a couple of tenths to 2.1 percent fourth quarter over fourth quarter.	13.0	96.0
201603	1490	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That reflects several factors, including the weaker foreign growth outlook and the fact that there’s even wider corporate credit spreads.	13.0	96.0
201603	1491	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	On inflation, we haven’t made meaningful changes to our forecast.	13.0	96.0
201603	1492	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	There are crosscurrents here that we’ve discussed.	13.0	96.0
201603	1493	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	On the one hand, the January core PCE reading was quite a bit firmer, so that pushed the year-over-year rate up to 1.7 percent.	13.0	96.0
201603	1494	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	But I don’t put much weight on that, because it’s due mainly to one month’s reading.	13.0	96.0
201603	1495	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m sympathetic with the Board staff’s assessment of this, that we should discount it until we get some more information.	13.0	96.0
201603	1496	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	But at the same time, the fact that the core PCE trend has been flat to higher during a period when we’ve been hit with effects of the firmer dollar and lower energy prices, I do take some signal from that, that we’re not really suffering a lot of disinflation either.	13.0	96.0
201603	1497	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	On the other hand, inflation expectations continue to concern me.	13.0	96.0
201603	1498	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	They are still soft.	13.0	96.0
201603	1499	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, maybe this reflects just the drop in energy prices, which is obviously not a big reason for concern, but maybe it reflects the fact that we’ve been running below 2 percent now for some time and this is beginning to weigh on inflation expectations.	13.0	96.0
201603	1500	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	If that’s the correct explanation, then we have to give some weight to that in our decisionmaking.	13.0	96.0
201603	1501	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	On the positive side of the ledger, the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations came out yesterday for February.	13.0	96.0
201603	1502	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I think Governor Brainard referenced this.	13.0	96.0
201603	1503	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	It showed an uptick in both the one-year and three-year median inflation expectations.	13.0	96.0
201603	1504	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	We were at the all-time low for this survey, but the one-year ticked up to 2.7 percent from 2.4, and the three-year, to 2.6 percent from 2.5.	13.0	96.0
201603	1505	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, these figures are still very low relative to the past history of the surveys, but I view the upticks as mildly encouraging.	13.0	96.0
201603	1506	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of our federal funds rate projections, we continue to show two 25 basis point increases in 2016, but we flattened out our federal funds rate trajectory thereafter with three increases in both 2017 and 2018, down from four in each year previously.	13.0	96.0
201603	1507	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	It strikes me that the road back for Europe and Japan is going to be longer and more difficult, and that suggests more persistent drag on trade for us.	13.0	96.0
201603	1508	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The fact that we’re only growing at about a 2 percent pace even with stimulative monetary and fiscal policies in place suggests to me that the headwinds persist, and they may be likely to abate even more slowly than I earlier anticipated.	13.0	96.0
201603	1509	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Even with my lower federal funds rate forecast trajectory, this does still imply a pretty significant rise in long-term interest rates at some point.	13.0	96.0
201603	1510	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we need to take that into consideration.	13.0	96.0
201603	1511	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	When the 10-year Treasury yield is below 2 percent and most of us have 10 increases in the federal funds rate taking us to 3 percent or so over the next few years, that does imply a pretty significant rise in long-term rates at some point, and that is going to have consequences for financial conditions.	13.0	96.0
201603	1512	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	When I look at the valuation of financial assets, for me it all starts with long-term bond yields.	13.0	96.0
201603	1513	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Things don’t look overvalued relative to long-term bond yields, but, boy, long-term bond yields look pretty rich relative to what we think is likely to actually happen for monetary policy looking forward.	13.0	96.0
201603	1514	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of risks to the outlook, I continue to see them skewed to the downside for both growth and inflation.	13.0	96.0
201603	1515	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	This stems mainly from my concerns about the foreign outlook and how this might spill back to the United States.	13.0	96.0
201603	1516	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Although financial markets have recovered somewhat in the past few weeks, it’s important to remember that the market turbulence we saw earlier in the year was not just about animal spirits.	13.0	96.0
201603	1517	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	There really are still a number of significant open issues in terms of the foreign economic outlook.	13.0	96.0
201603	1518	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	To name just a few, we have China’s growth prospects and its currency policy.	13.0	96.0
201603	1519	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	We have the efficacy of negative long-term interest rates in Japan and Europe and the related question of whether Japan and Europe are running out of monetary policy ammunition.	13.0	96.0
201603	1520	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	And, if so, what are the implications on household and business confidence in those areas?	13.0	96.0
201603	1521	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Then we have commodity price weakness and the pressure this puts on commodity-exporting countries and commodity producers.	13.0	96.0
201603	1522	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	And there’s a smaller issue that we haven’t discussed today, Brexit, and all of the uncertainties associated with that.	13.0	96.0
201603	1523	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Sentiment has improved, no doubt, but most of the underlying issues driving the earlier tumult in financial markets still seem quite relevant and pertinent to me.	13.0	96.0
201603	1524	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	So it seems to me the markets can reverse just as quickly as they recently improved.	13.0	96.0
201603	1525	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	And in some ways, the concerns about the absence of further firepower on the monetary policy front means if you do get hit with an adverse shock, the consequences for household and business sentiment could turn out to be more powerful than what people anticipate.	13.0	96.0
201603	1526	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	My particular concern is that the negative interest rate policies in Japan and Europe are not really working well to stimulate demand and lift inflation expectations.	13.0	96.0
201603	1527	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	While it’s true that the negative interest rate policies do appear to provide support to the economy by shifting down the yield curve—and bond yields in Japan and Europe have fallen to levels that I view as basically almost inconceivable—they seem to be offset by some other negative factors.	13.0	96.0
201603	1528	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The first is that the drop in yields is threatening to crimp bank net interest margins and squeeze bank profits.	13.0	96.0
201603	1529	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The second is that the negative yields, I think, do send a bad signal to households and businesses about the outlook.	13.0	96.0
201603	1530	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Households, even when shielded from negative interest rates, may decide they need to save more, in light of the poor expected returns that they can anticipate on their current and future savings.	13.0	96.0
201603	1531	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That doesn’t receive much emphasis, I think, when people talk about this.	13.0	96.0
201603	1532	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m also not convinced that the negative interest rate policies provide appreciable stimulus, on net.	13.0	96.0
201603	1533	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s especially the case with any currency depreciation benefit, which was really the original motivation for these policies, either to generate currency depreciation or prevent currency appreciation.	13.0	96.0
201603	1534	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	If all of the countries are pursuing a negative short-term interest rate policy, most of that currency benefit gets canceled out.	13.0	96.0
201603	1535	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, in terms of the running-out-of-ammunition story, I think the earlier response to the ECB’s actions last week was quite illuminating.	13.0	96.0
201603	1536	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	After initially responding quite positively to the fact that the ECB’s actions were significantly larger and broader than anticipated, the focus turned quickly back to Draghi’s remarks, which implied that no further short-term interest rate reductions were contemplated.	13.0	96.0
201603	1537	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	This suggested to some, rightly or wrongly, that there was not much ammo left, and I think that’s really what people found disconcerting.	13.0	96.0
201603	1538	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The way I reconcile the market reactions to the ECB moves last week—and I don’t think it’s easy to reconcile or explain the reactions—is by interpreting them to mean that there was sort of good news and bad news.	13.0	96.0
201603	1539	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The good news was that the ECB was aggressive.	13.0	96.0
201603	1540	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The bad news was that there’s presumably not much left in the toolkit.	13.0	96.0
201603	1541	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	If inflation expectations were less damped and the international situation was less unsettled, I would favor tightening at this meeting, actually.	13.0	96.0
201603	1542	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	But, to me, the risk-management considerations argue for caution right now.	13.0	96.0
201603	1543	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Clearly, tightening at this meeting at this point would provoke an undesirably large tightening of financial market conditions.	13.0	96.0
201603	1544	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	This is especially a risk, as the likelihood of tightening at this meeting is judged as negligible by market participants.	13.0	96.0
201603	1545	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In my view, one reason why financial conditions have eased recently is precisely because market participants now judge we are likely to go more slowly.	13.0	96.0
201603	1546	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	So that means if we don’t go more slowly, it’s probably going to generate a significant tightening of financial conditions.	13.0	96.0
201603	1547	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	So we do need to consider that in terms of the path of policy that we pursue.	13.0	96.0
201603	1548	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In my mind, the way I think about it conceptually is that Japan and Europe are now going to follow an easier-for-longer path, and if we were to follow the same monetary policy path that we thought we were going to follow in December, the divergence between us and them would be greater, and that would probably lead to a greater tightening of financial conditions than what we thought at the time of the December meeting.	13.0	96.0
201603	1549	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	So in view of the fact that they’re going to be easier for longer, then we need to maintain the same degree of divergence in policy from them.	13.0	96.0
201603	1550	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	To do that we have to actually lower our federal funds rate path, and that’s really what the SEP numbers seem to show.	13.0	96.0
201603	1551	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of where we’re going from here, I think that there is a good chance that the foreign situation could remain stable or improve, and I think inflation expectations could stabilize and increase.	13.0	96.0
201603	1552	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	And if all of that happens, then I would be inclined to move again in the near future, presumably at the June meeting.	13.0	96.0
201603	1553	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I wouldn’t rule out April categorically, but that seems a high bar to me.	13.0	96.0
201603	1554	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Moving at a non–press conference meeting would imply an urgency to tighten that I think I’d find difficult to justify under the current set of circumstances.	13.0	96.0
201603	1555	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, it would be a big surprise.	13.0	96.0
201603	1556	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The Open Market Desk surveys indicate market participants put a very low weight on April and a considerably higher likelihood on June.	13.0	96.0
201603	1557	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	But I’m jumping the gun a little bit, so more on monetary policy tomorrow.	13.0	96.0
201603	1558	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	13.0	65.0
201603	1559	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13.0	65.0
201603	1560	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’d like to ask a question of the Vice Chairman.	13.0	102.0
201603	1561	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	When you think about the ECB’s actions and the comment you just made—you talked about Japan, too, but let’s just take the ECB, case by case.	13.0	102.0
201603	1562	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So in light of the ECB’s action of lower for longer, more of a stimulus, that means that we should, all else being equal, have a lower path for the policy rate.	13.0	102.0
201603	1563	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It kind of reverses my view of the lesson that we had when we did easier monetary policy in, say, 2012, for which the argument is, that’s actually good for the global economy, it’s good for other countries.	13.0	102.0
201603	1564	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So let me ask you the thought experiment, which you put out on the table—say, the ECB, given everything else being equal, did nothing at their meeting or did less.	13.0	102.0
201603	1565	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Would we, therefore, have a tighter path of policy?	13.0	102.0
201603	1566	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	But this is subject to their economic outlook.	13.0	96.0
201603	1567	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I know, but I’m just—	13.0	102.0
201603	1568	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	If they did less, they would have a worse economic outlook.	13.0	96.0
201603	1569	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	They’re doing this to generate an economic outlook similar to the economic outlook that they had before.	13.0	96.0
201603	1570	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	So I’m holding the economic outlook in Europe essentially unchanged.	13.0	96.0
201603	1571	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So the real argument that you’re making was not about the policy action—there was bad news in Europe and, therefore, we need a lower path of interest rates.	13.0	102.0
201603	1572	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	They need a lower path of interest rates to generate outcomes that are—	13.0	96.0
201603	1573	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I just wanted to clarify, because the way you said it was—	13.0	102.0
201603	1574	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s fair.	13.0	96.0
201603	1575	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s fair.	13.0	96.0
201603	1576	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think it actually goes the other way.	13.0	102.0
201603	1577	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that what they’ve done was very strong, and that’s good for the global economic outlook, conditional on the same economic data.	13.0	102.0
201603	1578	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Right.	13.0	96.0
201603	1579	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	But the fact that they had such a strong policy reaction was because the outlook in Europe had actually deteriorated.	13.0	96.0
201603	1580	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s how I—	13.0	96.0
201603	1581	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do see.	13.0	102.0
201603	1582	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I just wanted to clarify, because you don’t want to get into this game—	13.0	102.0
201603	1583	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	No, I understand.	13.0	96.0
201603	1584	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	13.0	65.0
201603	1585	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	My thanks to everyone for an interesting round of reflections on the economic outlook and risks.	13.0	65.0
201603	1586	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	And, if you don’t mind, before we break for dinner, I’d like to wrap up with some comments of my own, including some observations on the policy implications of economic and financial developments over the past few months.	13.0	65.0
201603	1587	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let me start with the labor market, which I would characterize as showing further solid improvement since the December meeting.	13.0	65.0
201603	1588	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Monthly payroll gains have averaged close to 230,000 over the past three months.	13.0	65.0
201603	1589	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	The unemployment rate ticked down one-tenth and would be lower, if not for a most welcome increase in the labor force participation rate.	13.0	65.0
201603	1590	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	U-6 is down 0.2 percentage point since our December meeting, and the employment-to-population ratio has risen almost ½ percentage point.	13.0	65.0
201603	1591	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Some other cyclical indicators that I track also suggest that we’re more or less back to a normal labor market.	13.0	65.0
201603	1592	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	The quits rate has returned to its pre-recession level, as have households’ perceptions of job availability and firms’ assessments of the difficulty of filling jobs.	13.0	65.0
201603	1593	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Nonetheless, I put myself in the camp of those who argue that there remains some scope for further improvement.	13.0	65.0
201603	1594	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	The unemployment rate is still a bit above my estimate of its longer-run level, and voluntary part-time employment for economic reasons remains somewhat elevated and has changed little in recent months.	13.0	65.0
201603	1595	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, the unexpected pickup in the participation rate reinforces my optimism that a tight labor market will draw more people into the labor force permanently, thereby boosting the economy’s productive capacity.	13.0	65.0
201603	1596	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, although there are many anecdotal reports of faster wage increases, the aggregate data still reveal few, if any, signs of upward pressure on wages beyond some selected job categories.	13.0	65.0
201603	1597	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	While the link between nominal wage growth and slack is quite loose, I would, nonetheless, have expected some rise in nominal wage growth in response to the marked tightening of the labor market over the past two years.	13.0	65.0
201603	1598	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	For these reasons alone, I’d like to see further declines in the unemployment rate and improvements in other measures of labor utilization.	13.0	65.0
201603	1599	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	But I also consider a tighter labor market as important to speed the return to 2 percent inflation.	13.0	65.0
201603	1600	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Indicators of spending indicate that household spending continues to be a relative bright spot in this economy, although a little less so in light of this morning’s marked downward revision to retail sales in January.	13.0	65.0
201603	1601	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Still, retail sales were up modestly in February for the control category used to compute PCE, and light motor vehicle sales have continued to run at a high level.	13.0	65.0
201603	1602	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Factoring in projected gains and outlays on services, the staff now estimates that consumer spending is likely to increase at 2½ percent at an annual rate this quarter, which remains a respectable pace.	13.0	65.0
201603	1603	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, residential investment continues along a path of gradual recovery.	13.0	65.0
201603	1604	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, as the Tealbook points out, the fundamentals underpinning near-term growth and household spending look reasonably good, in light of recent gains in real disposable income, an elevated ratio of household wealth to income, lower mortgage rates, and a relatively high level of consumer sentiment.	13.0	65.0
201603	1605	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	In contrast, spending and production indicators for other sectors of the economy have been weak.	13.0	65.0
201603	1606	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods have been essentially flat for some time.	13.0	65.0
201603	1607	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Recent readings on business sentiment have been lukewarm at best, and some surveys suggest a weakening in planned cap-ex.	13.0	65.0
201603	1608	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	I found President Lockhart’s comments about his survey interesting in that regard.	13.0	65.0
201603	1609	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Drilling and mining activity continues to contract at a rapid pace under the weight of very low oil prices.	13.0	65.0
201603	1610	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	As the Tealbook noted, most other components of nonresidential construction have been soft.	13.0	65.0
201603	1611	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, the latest monthly trade data indicate that the combination of dollar appreciation and slow foreign growth continues to hold down exports, and I expect these external factors will continue to do so for some time.	13.0	65.0
201603	1612	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	So, taken together, the available spending and production indicators suggest that the overall economy has been advancing at a moderate pace, with moderate growth in household spending offsetting weakness in other sectors.	13.0	65.0
201603	1613	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	But that’s the past.	13.0	65.0
201603	1614	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	What about the future?	13.0	65.0
201603	1615	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Looking forward, a key question is how much effect the fallout from global economic and financial developments since the turn of the year will have on economic activity.	13.0	65.0
201603	1616	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	In some respects, the answer appears to be, “Surprisingly little.”	13.0	65.0
201603	1617	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Although securities and commodity markets have experienced bouts of volatility and prices were down sharply for a time, conditions have calmed down recently and many asset prices have recovered.	13.0	65.0
201603	1618	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	On net, equity valuations are down only a little since our December meeting, while oil prices and the dollar are essentially unchanged.	13.0	65.0
201603	1619	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	But in other respects, recent global developments have left their mark.	13.0	65.0
201603	1620	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	In the Tealbook, the projected level of trade-weighted foreign GDP at the end of 2016 is now almost ½ percent below the staff’s December forecast.	13.0	65.0
201603	1621	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Risk premiums here and abroad have risen notably on net in recent months, with the spread between the yield on triple-B corporate bonds and long-term Treasury yields up about 30 basis points.	13.0	65.0
201603	1622	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Analysts’ earnings expectations have been marked down, in part reflecting weaker global sales prospects since December.	13.0	65.0
201603	1623	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	By themselves, these developments have negative implications for the baseline outlook.	13.0	65.0
201603	1624	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	But, in addition, the turbulence in recent months suggests that the risks to the outlook from developments abroad have increased.	13.0	65.0
201603	1625	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	At the time of the December meeting, last summer’s market volatility could reasonably have been viewed as a one-time event that was behind us.	13.0	65.0
201603	1626	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	But the developments of recent months, including the missteps of some foreign authorities in dealing with market stress, suggest that the global economy is more fragile than I’d previously thought.	13.0	65.0
201603	1627	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Reflecting these heightened risks, respondents to the dealer survey see a nontrivial probability, as Beth Anne’s analysis also showed, that the global economy will fall into recession this year, and that the next FOMC move will be to lower, not to raise, rates.	13.0	65.0
201603	1628	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Market participants have reacted to these developments by revising down their expectations for the future path of the funds rate considerably since our December meeting.	13.0	65.0
201603	1629	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	As a result, longer-term Treasury yields and residential mortgage rates are down about 30 basis points over that period, while triple-B corporate yields are down a little less despite the widening of risk premiums.	13.0	65.0
201603	1630	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	That financial market participants would respond in this stabilizing manner was not guaranteed.	13.0	65.0
201603	1631	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	If they had, instead, mistakenly believed that policy was on a more or less preset course of funds rate hikes this year, I think it’s safe to presume that financial market conditions would now be considerably less favorable.	13.0	65.0
201603	1632	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Not only would long-term interest rates be higher, but equity valuations and oil prices would likely be lower, and the dollar would probably have appreciated further.	13.0	65.0
201603	1633	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	The possibility that the market might have reacted in this way strikes me as quite real, in view of how many commentators viewed the December dot plot as a commitment to four hikes this year, a misinterpretation I hope we will all strive to correct whenever possible.	13.0	65.0
201603	1634	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Fortunately—and I’m joining a number of my colleagues here in interpreting things in this way—the market responses we have seen suggest that financial market participants do understand that our policy is data dependent, and, as a consequence, current financial conditions remain consistent, in my view, with the baseline outlook for real activity that is little changed.	13.0	65.0
201603	1635	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	As in December, I continue to anticipate that growth will be moderate and that labor market conditions will improve further, conditional on a path of increases in the funds rate over time that are now a bit more gradual than the path I anticipated in December.	13.0	65.0
201603	1636	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to the balance of risks, however, in light of my concerns about the global economy, I now see the risk to real activity as tilted to the downside.	13.0	65.0
201603	1637	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	On inflation, I agree with the staff’s judgment that the bump-up in inflation in January will probably prove to be an artifact of movements in a few volatile items that are unlikely to be repeated and seasonal adjustment issues.	13.0	65.0
201603	1638	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Accordingly, my baseline inflation forecast is little revised from December, as oil prices and the dollar are essentially unchanged.	13.0	65.0
201603	1639	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	In particular, I continue to expect that inflation will remain low through the end of the year but then will move up in early 2017 once the transitory effects of previous declines in energy prices and dollar appreciation finally disappear.	13.0	65.0
201603	1640	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Over the rest of next year and through 2018, I expect inflation to move back to 2 percent, aided by further labor market improvement.	13.0	65.0
201603	1641	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	This unchanged outlook rests heavily on the continued stability of the true long-run inflation expectations that matter for wage and price setting over time.	13.0	65.0
201603	1642	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	On this point, I found the analysis presented in the staff memo on this topic reasonably persuasive and so continue to assume in my baseline forecast that inflation expectations are reasonably well anchored.	13.0	65.0
201603	1643	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Nevertheless, my confidence in this assumption has fallen somewhat in recent months, because I cannot entirely dismiss the possibility that the declines in inflation compensation and some survey measures are signaling some slippage.	13.0	65.0
201603	1644	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	So, like many of you, I now see the risks to the inflation outlook as also tilted slightly to the downside.	13.0	65.0
201603	1645	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	What does this mean for tomorrow’s policy decision?	13.0	65.0
201603	1646	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	For me, the case for leaving the target range unchanged for the moment seems clear.	13.0	65.0
201603	1647	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Reflecting my baseline outlook, my assessment of the risks, my view that the level of the neutral federal funds rate remains low, and some skepticism on my part that the headwinds holding down the neutral rate are apt to subside over the next few years as rapidly as in the Tealbook baseline, I see limited danger of falling “behind the curve.”	13.0	65.0
201603	1648	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, financial market participants do not expect any move at this meeting, and surprising them by unexpectedly tightening would likely be highly disruptive.	13.0	65.0
201603	1649	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, leaving policy unchanged at this meeting will give us more time to confirm that, despite unsettled global conditions and the drag arising from weaker foreign growth, the economy is continuing to expand at a moderate pace, accompanied by further job gains.	13.0	65.0
201603	1650	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	I think such a cautious approach is prudent in light of our asymmetric ability to respond to shocks to the economy.	13.0	65.0
201603	1651	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	While we can speed up the pace of tightening as needed, if conditions turn out to be unexpectedly strong, we have less ability to provide accommodation in case of a downturn because of the effective lower bound and costs associated with our unconventional policy tools.	13.0	65.0
201603	1652	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	To be clear, I do expect that further gradual increases in our target range will be appropriate if the labor market continues to improve, even if the risks pertaining to global conditions do not significantly subside.	13.0	65.0
201603	1653	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	To remain on hold for too long as the labor market improves, assuming that inflation continues to evolve in line with our forecast, would risk inadvertently allowing the economy to become overly tight, although, as I mentioned, I don’t think we’ve reached that point yet.	13.0	65.0
201603	1654	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	So let me stop there.	13.0	65.0
201603	1655	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Do we want to call it quits at this point or let Thomas—	52.0	65.0
201603	1656	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	We should leave something for tomorrow.	52.0	91.0
201603	1657	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	52.0	91.0
201603	1658	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Well, we have dinner across the street at 5:30, but it’s not yet quite 5:30.	52.0	65.0
201603	1659	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ll walk slowly.	52.0	102.0
201603	1660	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	52.0	102.0
201603	1661	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	52.0	65.0
201603	1662	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	So let’s have Thomas start tomorrow morning, and why don’t we call it quits for the day.	52.0	65.0
201603	1663	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	52.0	65.0
201603	1665	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	March 16 Session .	52.0	65.0
201603	1666	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, folks.	52.0	65.0
201603	1667	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	52.0	65.0
201603	1668	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s get going.	52.0	65.0
201603	1669	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	We do have data releases this morning, but David is waiting for a little bit more information to be available to him before he discusses those.	21.0	65.0
201603	1670	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	So what we’d like to do is to start off with Thomas’s briefing, and when David’s ready, we’ll interrupt the policy round and turn to David.	21.0	65.0
201603	1671	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thomas.	21.0	65.0
201603	1672	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201603	1673	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for the Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21.0	999.0
201603	1674	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Central to your policy decision at this meeting is your assessment of the implications of recent financial market volatility and of the current state of inflation expectations for the economic outlook.	21.0	999.0
201603	1675	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternatives A, B, and C present essentially the same modal outlook for economic activity and the labor market but different assessments of the outlook for inflation and of the risks attending the economic outlook, along with corresponding policy choices about adjustments in the federal funds rate today and at subsequent meetings.	21.0	999.0
201603	1676	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	On balance, the turbulence in financial markets earlier this year and continued low readings from various measures of inflation expectations appear to have left only a small imprint on the modal projections of private forecasters.	21.0	999.0
201603	1677	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Like you and the staff, they have marked down slightly their expectations for 2016 real GDP growth and inflation and, as shown in the top-left panel, have barely changed their outlook for 2017.	21.0	999.0
201603	1678	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Those forecasts also appear to build in an assumption of a somewhat lower level of short-term interest rates at the end of 2017, whereas market expectations for the federal funds rate path, shown in the upper right, have shifted more noticeably.	21.0	999.0
201603	1679	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Even though in recent weeks the current path has moved back up to where it was at the time of the January meeting, it remains substantially flatter than in December.	21.0	999.0
201603	1680	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	One possible way of interpreting the divergent messages from economists’ forecasts and investors’ policy expectations is that the modal economic outlook is associated with downside risks that, if realized, would lead to a shallower future path of the federal funds rate.	21.0	999.0
201603	1681	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The colored bars in the middle-left panel present averages across respondents to the primary dealer survey of the probabilities they assign to the level of the federal funds rate at the end of 2017 under two scenarios—one in which the federal funds rate returns to the lower bound at some point between 2016 and 2018, the blue bars, and one in which it does not, the tan bars.	21.0	999.0
201603	1682	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The black dashed line shows the probability distribution that results from assigning weights of ¼ and ¾, respectively, to the blue and the tan bars, ¼ being the probability assigned by the median dealer to returning to the lower bound during the next three years.	21.0	999.0
201603	1683	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	When pricing derivatives contracts, modest shifts in the weights on these two scenarios could result in sizable shifts in the expected policy rate path.	21.0	999.0
201603	1684	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Moreover, some investors might envision scenarios in which the federal funds rate returns to the effective lower bound persistently, explaining the sensitivity of the market-based path at horizons of four years or so.	21.0	999.0
201603	1685	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Despite the recent improvement in market sentiment, it is not difficult to come up with a list of risks to the economic outlook.	21.0	999.0
201603	1686	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Indeed, market participants have been discussing vulnerabilities abroad, including those in China, Japan, and the euro area that were noted by Simon and Beth Anne yesterday.	21.0	999.0
201603	1687	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The striking co-movement observed over recent months among several classes of assets—notably, the price of oil, broad stock market indexes, and corporate bond spreads—could reflect changes in the perceived likelihood of protracted weakness in major economies that would result in policy rates being at their effective lower bounds for quite some time.	21.0	999.0
201603	1688	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	For example, the middle-right panel shows that the correlation between oil and stock prices has been extraordinarily tight since late fall.	21.0	999.0
201603	1689	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	As discussed in Monday’s Board briefing on financial developments, in the recent period, neither demand- nor supply- driven declines in oil prices have been read by investors as conveying good news.	21.0	999.0
201603	1690	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The large and synchronized fluctuations in these asset prices may be related to the downward shift in perceptions of the neutral rate in many major economies implied by expected policy rate paths and attendant concerns about central banks running out of ammunition.	21.0	999.0
201603	1691	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Another possible interpretation of recent market turbulence and associated shifts in the expected policy rate path is that investors simply overreacted to relatively inconsequential economic and financial developments earlier in the year, and that, as fear dissipated, asset prices retraced most of their earlier decline and market conditions may continue to improve.	21.0	999.0
201603	1692	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Thus, to the extent that investor psychology is still scarred by the recent financial crisis, or a deterioration in liquidity in some markets may have amplified the moves in asset prices, it is quite possible that risk aversion will recede and the expected policy rate path will, before too long, shift back to where it was in December or rise even higher.	21.0	999.0
201603	1693	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Under alternative B, the Committee would communicate that it is taking a wait-and-see position on assessing the risks to the economy posed by somewhat weaker economic growth abroad and whether financial market developments have led, on net, to a tightening in financial conditions that might constrain economic activity.	21.0	999.0
201603	1694	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative C, by contrast, places less weight on the possibility that recent developments have heightened the downside risks to the economy and gives greater weight to the view that the outlook for real activity and the labor market is still solid.	21.0	999.0
201603	1695	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternatively, the recent market volatility and lower paths for expected policy rates could reflect a more lasting reassessment of the underlying strength of the major economies and their vulnerability to adverse shocks.	21.0	999.0
201603	1696	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	With a lower path for the neutral real rate and muted inflation, modest adverse shocks could be sufficient to pin policy rates for a long time at the effective lower bound.	21.0	999.0
201603	1697	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Moreover, greater pessimism about the ability of economies to escape the lower bound could become self-fulfilling.	21.0	999.0
201603	1698	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	This sentiment might be more aligned with the view embedded in alternative A in which the Committee would put its policy adjustments on hold until it sees the risks as more closely balanced.	21.0	999.0
201603	1699	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The memo you received regarding the staff’s current assessment of the state of longer-term inflation expectations relates to a second issue you are confronting, which is whether these expectations have moved in ways that would alter either your baseline outlook for inflation or your risk assessment associated with that outlook.	21.0	999.0
201603	1700	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	As discussed in that memo, although we see some evidence pointing toward modest slippage in longer-term inflation expectations, we cannot rule out with confidence either that inflation expectations have remained stable or that they have slipped more noticeably.	21.0	999.0
201603	1701	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The lower-left panel contrasts two views on the role of inflation expectations in explaining the roughly 100 basis point decline in far-forward inflation compensation since mid-2014.	21.0	999.0
201603	1702	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	As shown by the blue portion of the left bar, the respondents to the Desk survey view a decline in inflation expectations as playing a noticeable role in investors’ thinking; by contrast, the right bar shows that Board and Reserve Bank models attribute most of the decline to inflation risk premiums.	21.0	999.0
201603	1703	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The risk-neutral probability of inflation running below 1 percent, on average, over the next 10 years, derived from inflation caps and floors and shown to the right, is quite elevated.	21.0	999.0
201603	1704	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	But the sheer size of this probability suggests sizable premiums for insuring against the risk of protracted low inflation, perhaps because investors have become more concerned that low-inflation scenarios would be associated with persistent economic weakness.	21.0	999.0
201603	1705	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	In light of the ambiguity of the evidence regarding longer-term inflation expectations, the draft alternatives offer various options for how to characterize the outlook for inflation and the risks to this outlook.	21.0	999.0
201603	1706	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternatives A and B acknowledge that inflation is likely to remain low in the near term due in part to the earlier decline in energy prices, while alternative C looks beyond the near term and focuses on the expectation that inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term.	21.0	999.0
201603	1707	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The alternatives also differ in the degree of concern they express about the downside risks to the inflation outlook.	21.0	999.0
201603	1708	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternatives B and C revert to language used before January, stating that “the Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.”	21.0	999.0
201603	1709	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	By contrast, alternative A expresses the judgment that inflation expectations have declined and that “the risks that inflation will fail to rise to 2 percent over the medium term have increased.”	21.0	999.0
201603	1710	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	It therefore announces that no further increase in the target range will occur “until inflation moves closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis and the risks to the economic outlook are more closely balanced.”	21.0	999.0
201603	1711	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201603	1712	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	This concludes my prepared remarks.	21.0	999.0
201603	1713	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	The floor is open for questions for Thomas.	22.0	65.0
201603	1714	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	22.0	65.0
201603	1715	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22.0	88.0
201603	1716	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Thomas, just a little mundane question.	22.0	88.0
201603	1717	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Do you have the latest probability the market is placing on April versus June?	22.0	88.0
201603	1718	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	What’s the latest on that?	22.0	88.0
201603	1719	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	So I believe April is close to 10 percent, whereas June is closer to 50, but I—	22.0	999.0
201603	1720	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	It’s probably 60 percent as of this morning because of the CPI data, and one rate hike is now priced in fully by September.	22.0	999.0
201603	1721	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions for Thomas?	22.0	65.0
201603	1722	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	22.0	65.0
201603	1723	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22.0	102.0
201603	1724	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have a couple of questions for Thomas.	22.0	102.0
201603	1725	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	One is on the primary dealer survey, the lower-left chart.	22.0	102.0
201603	1726	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I’m going to repeat, I guess, a statement/question that I’ve made before on this.	22.0	102.0
201603	1727	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	When I look at Simon Potter’s memo from March 11 to research directors—which I’m allowed to read, apparently—it shows that the median projection of the primary dealers for inflation over the next few years has not changed since January.	22.0	102.0
201603	1728	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So when you were asking primary dealers—that is, the chief economists at the primary dealers—for their own view, at least the median response is that the inflation expectations have not changed.	22.0	102.0
201603	1729	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So you’re asking them to opine on why market participants have changed their views.	22.0	102.0
201603	1730	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I liken this to going to a restaurant that we like and reading Yelp reviews that people don’t like it, and trying to figure out what it is that they think, and trying to come to conclusions, and then maybe divide it among the service, the food, and the prices.	22.0	102.0
201603	1731	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, again, maybe that’s more of a statement than a question, but I just want to be clear on this, that these are people who have not changed their views on inflation, but they are asked why the market pricing has changed.	22.0	102.0
201603	1732	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	They haven’t changed their views on inflation nearly by as much as the persons whose views they are reporting on.	22.0	999.0
201603	1733	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	That’s correct.	22.0	999.0
201603	1734	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Well, actually, the primary dealer surveys have changed very little, I think, at the long horizon since mid-2014.	22.0	999.0
201603	1735	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Simon is better suited to speak in response to this question, but my understanding is that they are asked to report on the views that they hear from the people who are actually trading these securities.	22.0	999.0
201603	1736	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I understand.	22.0	102.0
201603	1737	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	We asked them, “If the change in your expectations is different from what you estimate is the change in market expectations over this period, please explain.”	22.0	999.0
201603	1738	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	And I looked to how they explained it, and that didn’t help.	22.0	999.0
201603	1739	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	[Laughter]	22.0	999.0
201603	1740	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	They are basically as confused as everyone else.	22.0	999.0
201603	1741	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	When we asked a different set of people in the Survey of Market Participants, we basically got exactly the same results.	22.0	999.0
201603	1742	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Having done this years ago, I have a lot of sympathy with your view.	22.0	96.0
201603	1743	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	When I saw this originally, I looked and I said, “Oh, so they don’t really know what’s going on, so we’ll just put a third, a third, a third” was sort of my reaction, frankly.	22.0	96.0
201603	1744	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I can see absolutely where you’re coming from, President Williams.	22.0	96.0
201603	1745	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I even asked myself, if we were to poll ourselves about market expectations, we would probably come up with something similar—so I guess that’s my first comment.	22.0	102.0
201603	1746	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The second question is more substantive, and that is that the SEP rate path is actually quite a bit lower in March than it was in December.	22.0	102.0
201603	1747	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	How do you view the market reaction to that?	22.0	102.0
201603	1748	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Do you think that this is going to get a lot of attention, and how do you think about that?	22.0	102.0
201603	1749	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	There is a question in the dealer survey asking them about their expectations—what the median dot will be—and they’re expecting 25 basis points.	22.0	999.0
201603	1750	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	So the 50 basis point shift in the median at the end of 2016 and 2017 will come as a surprise.	22.0	999.0
201603	1751	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The median response to the question about how the median SEP dot will move is 25 basis points.	22.0	999.0
201603	1752	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	If you read the detailed comments, they’re all aware of how fragile the median can be, so they did understand that it’s possible for one more person to move and to get 50 basis points.	22.0	999.0
201603	1753	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	And the mean of the end-2016 change is actually only 26 basis points.	22.0	999.0
201603	1754	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	So the median in this instance exhibits that fragility to which Simon was referring.	22.0	999.0
201603	1755	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So your answer to the question—Do you think that markets will just see this as, kind of, what they expected, or do you think they’ll see it as a softening of the Committee’s views about the future policy rate path beyond what they were already expecting?	22.0	102.0
201603	1756	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	A fair bit seems to be expected.	22.0	999.0
201603	1757	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	22.0	102.0
201603	1758	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	22.0	65.0
201603	1759	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22.0	94.0
201603	1760	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I just wanted to follow up on President Williams’s first question, and I appreciate his comments on this about inflation expectations and the interpretation.	22.0	94.0
201603	1761	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	So if you look at something like the Survey of Professional Forecasters, they always say 2 percent, no matter what.	22.0	94.0
201603	1762	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Among those people, I’d interpret that to mean we have a lot of credibility.	22.0	94.0
201603	1763	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	It’s a general equilibrium, so if you believe the central bank is going to do the right thing to get back to the inflation target, then you just keep saying 2 percent, because you have full confidence in the central bank.	22.0	94.0
201603	1764	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	But the market as a whole, I don’t think, has that same level of confidence, and that’s why those TIPS five-year, five-year-forwards move around, and so that’s my interpretation—they represent credibility, and I don’t want them to get too far out of line.	22.0	94.0
201603	1765	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Obviously, as I’ve said before, I’m a little bit suspicious of these decompositions into liquidity premiums and inflation.	22.0	94.0
201603	1766	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	So I interpret them mostly as inflation expectations on the part of the market, and I interpret that as—if they’re falling, it’s waning credibility in either the ability or willingness of the Committee to keep inflation at its target.	22.0	94.0
201603	1767	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	22.0	65.0
201603	1768	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22.0	91.0
201603	1769	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Just to pick up on this discussion here, I guess I’m a little confused.	22.0	91.0
201603	1770	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	I always thought the value proposition for the New York Federal Reserve’s Markets Group when they go out and talk to people in the market was—they were talking to people in the market.	22.0	91.0
201603	1771	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	When Vice Chairman Dudley was in charge of that group and we had commentary, he would say that when he worked at Goldman, well, you were supposed to go talk to the people—you know, the traders and that type of thing.	22.0	91.0
201603	1772	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	But some of the chief economists’ forecasts come into play.	22.0	91.0
201603	1773	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	If you tell me that all they’re going to do is report back on forecasts like the Blue Chip or Survey of Professional Forecasters, then the value proposition goes way down for that type of intelligence activity.	22.0	91.0
201603	1774	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	So I can’t say I know exactly—Simon, you’re looking puzzled at that.	22.0	91.0
201603	1775	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	We make sure we ask them much harder questions than the Blue Chip.	22.0	999.0
201603	1776	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	That’s right, but the idea is basically that they’ve sort of heard, right?	22.0	91.0
201603	1777	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	And we want to know what the people who are actually trading in the markets are thinking—so that’s what I’m hoping to get out of this type of commentary.	22.0	91.0
201603	1778	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	I’d say that we focus a lot on what the median response is, and the distribution across types of market participants is really important, and there was some distribution across how you would decompose the drop in inflation compensation.	22.0	999.0
201603	1779	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	You know, a lot of people don’t understand it.	22.0	999.0
201603	1780	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Some of the answers that they gave as to why it might be different are reasonably smart, but it’s not as if anyone’s got a “secret sauce” they can give you that’s different from the models, or from the lack of understanding that we have of what’s happened.	22.0	999.0
201603	1781	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Right.	22.0	91.0
201603	1782	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	So you folks do analysis with that, too.	22.0	91.0
201603	1783	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	So that’s also part of the proposition.	22.0	91.0
201603	1784	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	President Bullard mentioned the Survey of Professional Forecasters flatlining at 2 percent on their long-term inflation forecasts for the PCE, and I always interpret that as, well, they know what π* is—we’ve said it’s 2 percent, so the long-term PCE projection doesn’t move.	22.0	91.0
201603	1785	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	I think it’s much more revealing when you look at the CPI longer term, and that one acts like we don’t give them the answer in the back of the book, so the fact that that one is trailing down a little bit I find much more worrisome.	22.0	91.0
201603	1786	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Any other questions for Thomas?	22.0	65.0
201603	1787	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	22.0	65.0
201603	1788	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	22.0	65.0
201603	1789	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	David, are you ready to talk about the data?	11.0	65.0
201603	1790	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Absolutely.	11.0	999.0
201603	1791	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I’m as ready as I’m going to be.	11.0	999.0
201603	1792	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	[Laughter]	11.0	999.0
201603	1793	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	When I was in high school, I thought I might be a professional French horn player.	11.0	999.0
201603	1794	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	And when you hadn’t really spent enough time in the practice studio, you’d console yourself that you really didn’t want to be overrehearsed when you got to your lesson.	11.0	999.0
201603	1795	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	[Laughter]	11.0	999.0
201603	1796	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So this will test that proposition.	11.0	999.0
201603	1797	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Let me start with the consumer price index and its implications for the PCE price index.	11.0	999.0
201603	1798	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	You have a handout called “Material for Consumer Price Index Update.”	11.0	999.0
201603	1799	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from the top lines in the table, on a rounded basis, the overall CPI came in close to our expectation, declining 0.2 percent in February.	11.0	999.0
201603	1800	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	This is an area, though, in which basis points matter, and, on an unrounded basis, the decrease was 4 basis points less than what we had expected.	11.0	999.0
201603	1801	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So the actual decline, unrounded, was 17 basis points.	11.0	999.0
201603	1802	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We had expected a 21 basis point decline.	11.0	999.0
201603	1803	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Off with your head.	11.0	96.0
201603	1804	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	11.0	96.0
201603	1805	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	There you go.	11.0	999.0
201603	1806	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	It only gets better—or worse, depending on your point of view—from here.	11.0	999.0
201603	1807	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Within the overall index, energy prices declined a little more than we had expected.	11.0	999.0
201603	1808	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We’d looked for a very sharp decline of 5½ percent.	11.0	999.0
201603	1809	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	They were down 6 percent.	11.0	999.0
201603	1810	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Food prices were one-tenth stronger than what we had expected.	11.0	999.0
201603	1811	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The core CPI obviously is a piece that we focus on an awful lot—the bottom set of rows in the table.	11.0	999.0
201603	1812	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Those increased 0.3 percent, and, yes, it was a full 10 basis points stronger than we had been looking for.	11.0	999.0
201603	1813	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The biggest surprises look to have been in the core goods area, in which prices increased 0.3 percent, whereas we’d expected them to be flat.	11.0	999.0
201603	1814	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	This is the second month in a row with core goods price surprises.	11.0	999.0
201603	1815	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Almost all of the miss this time was in apparel, which is quite a volatile component of the price index.	11.0	999.0
201603	1816	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Another piece of the surprise was in the CPI for medical prices, which the BEA does not pick up in constructing PCE prices.	11.0	999.0
201603	1817	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	They use the PPI prices for medical care in putting together the PCE price index.	11.0	999.0
201603	1818	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In terms of the implications for PCE prices, for top-line PCE inflation, we now estimate an increase of 0.4 percent for the first quarter.	11.0	999.0
201603	1819	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	That’s a quarterly figure at an annual rate.	11.0	999.0
201603	1820	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	That is up from our forecast of an increase of 0.1 percent in the Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201603	1821	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	For core PCE prices, we’re now projecting a quarterly increase at an annual rate in the first quarter of 2.2 percent, which is up from 1.9 percent in the Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201603	1822	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In the second quarter for core prices, at this point on a preliminary basis, we’ve nudged up our projection from 1.5 to 1.6.	11.0	999.0
201603	1823	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So we’re still expecting basically the same contour, albeit following a slightly higher path than what we had in the Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201603	1824	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t yet have a full set of 12-month changes for you, but I do have February—that the 12-month change for top-line PCE prices is 1.0 rather than 0.9 as we had projected.	11.0	999.0
201603	1825	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So there is the one-tenth upward surprise in PCE prices.	11.0	999.0
201603	1826	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	And for core, we now have that estimated at 1.8 percent, up from 1.7 in the Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201603	1827	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The piece that I don’t have for you is the 12-month changes for March, April, and so forth.	11.0	999.0
201603	1828	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	That’s for PCE prices?	12.0	65.0
201603	1829	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Those last two figures that I gave you are PCE prices—top line of 1.0, up from 0.9, and core PCE prices of 1.8, up from 1.7 in the Tealbook.	12.0	999.0
201603	1830	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Now, let me turn briefly to our estimate of GDP growth in the first quarter.	11.0	999.0
201603	1831	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The figures that I’m going to report here will all be in terms of their contributions to growth of real GDP.	11.0	999.0
201603	1832	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	And, in case there was any suspense, let me remove it.	11.0	999.0
201603	1833	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I reported yesterday that we’d revised our estimate of GDP growth to 1½ percent from 1.9.	11.0	999.0
201603	1834	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	There have been a bunch of puts and takes since yesterday, but we’re still at 1½.	11.0	999.0
201603	1835	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	As I reported yesterday, we revised down our estimate of the contribution to real GDP growth from PCE, which is one of the pieces that’s informed by the retail sales release, and that took 0.4 percentage point out of our GDP estimate.	11.0	999.0
201603	1836	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Subsequent to my report yesterday, we’ve taken on board some additional information.	11.0	999.0
201603	1837	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Sales at building material and supply stores were a little stronger than what we had expected.	11.0	999.0
201603	1838	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	That points to a little stronger growth in residential improvements, and those are part of residential construction.	11.0	999.0
201603	1839	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In addition, we filtered some of the relevant components of the February PPI.	11.0	999.0
201603	1840	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Those were a little lower than what we had expected, so they imply marginally stronger growth in various categories of equipment investment and both residential and nonresidential construction.	11.0	999.0
201603	1841	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	On the other hand, the higher prices in the CPI today imply yet weaker real growth of PCE, so that’s going to take, on our estimates now, about one-tenth and a half or two-tenths out of GDP from the higher prices deflating the nominals that we learned about.	11.0	999.0
201603	1842	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	All told, we’re at 1½ percent for Q1 and 2 percent for Q2, and, for those who are really keeping track of the details, we’re up one-tenth in Q4, from 1.2 to 1.3.	11.0	999.0
201603	1843	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So that’s where we are.	11.0	999.0
201603	1844	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	The last Q4?	12.0	108.0
201603	1845	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201603	1846	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We’re up one-tenth for the fourth quarter of last year, from 1.2 to 1.3.	12.0	999.0
201603	1847	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We’re still at 1.5 for Q1, as was the case yesterday, but with a bunch of jiggling around.	12.0	999.0
201603	1848	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	And we’re still at 2.0 for Q2.	12.0	999.0
201603	1849	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In the details, what that 2.0 reflects is a little weaker real household spending due to the higher price inflation and marginally stronger residential investment from the higher single-family starts that were also reported this morning.	12.0	999.0
201603	1850	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for David?	12.0	65.0
201603	1851	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let me just note one thing—that in alternative B, as distributed in Thomas’s handout, we did change one word in paragraph 1 describing household spending.	12.0	65.0
201603	1852	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	We changed “solid” to “moderate,” in light of the data that David described.	12.0	65.0
201603	1853	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I realize that, just from Q4 over Q4 for GDP growth, you gave a lot of numbers.	12.0	102.0
201603	1854	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m struggling to do this all in my head and get it right.	12.0	102.0
201603	1855	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	For what year?	12.0	999.0
201603	1856	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	For 2015 and 2016.	12.0	102.0
201603	1857	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m guessing 2015 doesn’t change.	12.0	102.0
201603	1858	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But 2016?	12.0	102.0
201603	1859	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I’m guessing that 2015 doesn’t change, because it’s one-tenth on one quarter, so divide that by 4, and we’d still be at 1.9.	12.0	999.0
201603	1860	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	And our estimate for 2016, I think, should be down one-tenth, to 2.1.	12.0	999.0
201603	1861	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay, that’s what I thought.	12.0	102.0
201603	1862	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	12.0	102.0
201603	1863	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any other questions?	12.0	65.0
201603	1864	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	12.0	65.0
201603	1865	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12.0	65.0
201603	1866	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s begin our policy go-round.	23.0	65.0
201603	1867	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	23.0	65.0
201603	1868	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201603	1869	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B as written.	23.0	90.0
201603	1870	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	While the real data have been about as I expected, problems with major trading partners and the volatility in financial markets make a tightening at this meeting premature.	23.0	90.0
201603	1871	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	I view the global economy as still fragile, which is presumably the source of the volatility we have seen in financial markets.	23.0	90.0
201603	1872	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	With many of our trading partners experiencing very low inflation rates and weak economies and, consequently, with regard to untried new monetary policy tools, a risk-management approach to monetary policy indicates that the benefits of waiting dominate the modest cost of not moving at this time.	23.0	90.0
201603	1873	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, my SEP forecast embeds the assumption that we will raise the federal funds rate three times this year.	23.0	90.0
201603	1874	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	If wage and price data in the intermeeting period provide more evidence that PCE inflation is likely on its way toward 2 percent, and that labor markets are tightening further, I could imagine it would be appropriate to move as soon as April.	23.0	90.0
201603	1875	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	I do not think the current statement sets up that possibility, so if inflation improves and labor markets tighten further, additional communication by the Chair might be necessary.	23.0	90.0
201603	1876	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Of course, I could also imagine that problems abroad start to leave more traces in the financial and economic data after this meeting, and it would then be quite appropriate to wait longer before our next move.	23.0	90.0
201603	1877	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, I am comfortable waiting at this meeting, but I do want to encourage the perception that each meeting is “live.”	23.0	90.0
201603	1878	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Not moving in January and March already indicates that we are responsive to data and potential risks to the economy.	23.0	90.0
201603	1879	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	But many financial market assessments of future FOMC actions suggest that markets remain more pessimistic than many FOMC participants about both the strength of the US economy and our likely path for raising rates.	23.0	90.0
201603	1880	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	For the period ahead, we may need to enhance our communications to address this persistent gap in perceptions so as to avoid a significant disruption to markets at the time we choose next to move.	23.0	90.0
201603	1881	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201603	1882	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	1883	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23.0	65.0
201603	1884	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201603	1885	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	On balance, the medium-run economic outlook has not changed materially since we made our previous SEP submissions in December.	23.0	999.0
201603	1886	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The tightening in financial conditions we saw over January and early February has largely reversed.	23.0	999.0
201603	1887	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Oil prices and the dollar have shown some stability.	23.0	999.0
201603	1888	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Growth was weak in the fourth quarter of last year, but, on the basis of the data we have on the first quarter, it appears that growth is rebounding toward the 2 percent pace we’ve seen over much of the expansion.	23.0	999.0
201603	1889	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Throughout, labor markets have continued to show solid improvement, and the news on inflation over this intermeeting period has also been positive.	23.0	999.0
201603	1890	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	In my view, in light of actual and expected economic performance, it’s appropriate for monetary policy to remain on a gradual upward trajectory this year.	23.0	999.0
201603	1891	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Admittedly, our data on the first quarter are limited.	23.0	999.0
201603	1892	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Because we have not prepared the public for it, a rate increase at this meeting would come as a surprise, which might induce volatility just when it looks like volatility has settled down.	23.0	999.0
201603	1893	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	So I can see a reasonable argument that it’s better to not make a change today and to continue to gather information and assess conditions.	23.0	999.0
201603	1894	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	And I will support alternative B today.	23.0	999.0
201603	1895	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	But I’d like to point out that, while alternative B sounds like the less risky strategy, there are some risks to the strategy as well that we need to consider.	23.0	999.0
201603	1896	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	First, there’s always uncertainty out there, and the FOMC could always make the case that we should wait to act until we gather more information.	23.0	999.0
201603	1897	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	But waiting until all of the data line up in the correct way means waiting too long.	23.0	999.0
201603	1898	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	We risk having to move rates up more aggressively in the future, with negative effects on the economy.	23.0	999.0
201603	1899	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Forestalling rate increases for too long in light of financial market conditions may simply produce more volatility in the future if we find ourselves having to increase rates more aggressively than anticipated.	23.0	999.0
201603	1900	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Second, it’s very important that our lack of action today not be read as a negative message about the economy, which can be a self-fulfilling prophecy and would be inconsistent with our outlook.	23.0	999.0
201603	1901	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	I believe that the proposed language in alternative B is much improved from the preliminary draft in that respect, although I think it will need to be followed up on in the press conference and in the Chair’s other communications after this meeting.	23.0	999.0
201603	1902	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Standing pat on rates today should not be read by the public as our having had a significant rethinking of the medium-term outlook or as indicating that we view the move in December as unjustified.	23.0	999.0
201603	1903	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	I believe the message should be that we are data dependent, yes, but our best assessment at this time is that the economy will evolve in a way that will make gradual reductions in the degree of accommodation this year appropriate.	23.0	999.0
201603	1904	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The path may be a bit shallower than we thought in December because of the weaker growth seen at the end of last year and somewhat tighter financial conditions.	23.0	999.0
201603	1905	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	But the economy has shown considerable resilience, and the outlook supports continuing on the path of normalization.	23.0	999.0
201603	1906	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	I would like us to be in a position to move rates up at any meeting this year should the data support it.	23.0	999.0
201603	1907	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	And we need to recognize that our communications—in particular, the statement, minutes, and, importantly, communications from the Chair—play a critical part in getting us there.	23.0	999.0
201603	1908	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Indeed, had we better prepared the public for a move at this meeting, I would have advocated making such a move, on the basis of the economic outlook.	23.0	999.0
201603	1909	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201603	1910	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	1911	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23.0	65.0
201603	1912	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201603	1913	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	I, too, support the policy action in alternative B and the statement as written.	23.0	88.0
201603	1914	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	As noted in the economic go-round, I think the data to date this year are largely consistent with my December projections.	23.0	88.0
201603	1915	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	But the first-quarter data are still relatively incomplete, and there is enough remaining ambiguity, especially as regards business fixed investment, to warrant some patience in moving ahead with the next adjustment of our policy rates.	23.0	88.0
201603	1916	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	I am of the opinion that a rate move could be justified at the April meeting should the data continue to support the view that the economy is on a modestly above-potential growth track; labor markets remain robust, on the whole; and inflation signals continue to show some firming relative to our objective.	23.0	88.0
201603	1917	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	The language in alternative B today strikes me as consistent with keeping the April meeting live for a potential rate increase.	23.0	88.0
201603	1918	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	However, whether the public perceives April as a “live” option will depend critically on our subsequent communications, including the Chair’s comments following this meeting.	23.0	88.0
201603	1919	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	I would be a little troubled by an alternative approach that, perhaps unintentionally, serves to reinforce the public’s conclusion that April is absolutely off the table and the earliest possible normalization move is June.	23.0	88.0
201603	1920	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	This seems to me a little awkward following a December liftoff decision that was accompanied by a median projection of four rate increases in 2016—of course, in the context of the now well-accepted caveat of being data dependent.	23.0	88.0
201603	1921	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	I don’t think the data alone will demand a reappraisal of the path of the policy rate, so the interpretation could be that the Committee has shifted to a paradigm or changed to a reaction function that places more emphasis on global conditions, the policy stance of other central banks, financial market risk, and other exogenous factors that pose risks or work to tighten financial conditions in our markets.	23.0	88.0
201603	1922	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Effective communications may require an explanation that these factors are data, too, particularly if the baseline domestic economy readings continue to look fine.	23.0	88.0
201603	1923	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Anyway, I think it would be appropriate to convey that the Committee is keeping its options open regarding April.	23.0	88.0
201603	1924	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	If the data we receive between now and the April meeting are broadly affirming of what amounts to the Committee’s base case, I think we should at least consider policy action.	23.0	88.0
201603	1925	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	As of now, it appears that the market participants and observers are placing, per the question I asked earlier, about a 10 percent probability on an April move.	23.0	88.0
201603	1926	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	In part, this is due to an ongoing belief that this Committee will be reluctant to make policy adjustments at meetings without a scheduled press conference.	23.0	88.0
201603	1927	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	I think this is a less-than-ideal situation.	23.0	88.0
201603	1928	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	As I said, I believe that data-dependent criteria may well allow a rate adjustment in April.	23.0	88.0
201603	1929	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	I won’t go so far as to say the probability is 50–50, but, in my view, it’s closer to even odds than it is to 10 percent.	23.0	88.0
201603	1930	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	As a consequence, I think it’s important to adopt communications that nudge the market to be more in line with the possibility that April is truly possible.	23.0	88.0
201603	1931	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201603	1932	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	1933	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	23.0	65.0
201603	1934	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201603	1935	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I support alternative B as written.	23.0	110.0
201603	1936	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m confident we are moving toward reaching our full-employment objective, but I still believe there is additional slack that can be removed from the labor force.	23.0	110.0
201603	1937	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I feel better about the progress we’re making on inflation, but I still would like to see more evidence of progress in reaching our 2 percent objective.	23.0	110.0
201603	1938	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And, as I mentioned yesterday, I would like to see more evidence of oil prices firming.	23.0	110.0
201603	1939	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	This all comes against a global backdrop that I view as challenging.	23.0	110.0
201603	1940	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Slowing global growth and overcapacity, high levels of debt to GDP in advanced economies, and aging populations in advanced economies—I think these issues all have the potential to affect financial conditions and make us susceptible to bouts of tightening, which could manifest themselves in the 10-year Treasury and a flight to quality, widening credit spreads, and a strengthening dollar.	23.0	110.0
201603	1941	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	As a result, I agree with the decision not to act at this meeting, and I think a slower, more gradual path may, over time, allow us to normalize more quickly.	23.0	110.0
201603	1942	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	In my comments after this meeting, I plan to avoid speculating on the timing of future rate moves.	23.0	110.0
201603	1943	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I plan to emphasize that we’re keeping an open mind and are avoiding a predetermined path, and that we will base any action on our ongoing assessment of underlying economic conditions.	23.0	110.0
201603	1944	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I plan to emphasize that any removal of accommodation will be done only gradually, and that, at this juncture, the FOMC remains accommodative.	23.0	110.0
201603	1945	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201603	1946	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	1947	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23.0	65.0
201603	1948	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201603	1949	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I will support alternative B as written.	23.0	104.0
201603	1950	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	The implied probabilities in the markets that Simon cited earlier—a very low probability of a move at the April meeting and about 50–50 or so at the June meeting—strike me as about right.	23.0	104.0
201603	1951	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	With a weak external environment and inflation running below target and likely to go sideways for at least a few quarters, I think that the Committee can afford to be patient.	23.0	104.0
201603	1952	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I’m open to moving in April, but I guess I don’t see it as a likely outcome.	23.0	104.0
201603	1953	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I think it would be great to find a way to deviate from our pattern of only moving at the quarterly meetings associated with a press conference, but I’m afraid doing so now would inevitably send a note of urgency.	23.0	104.0
201603	1954	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I guess I don’t see it as justified, and I see us as being able to be patient anyway.	23.0	104.0
201603	1955	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	The SEP median funds rate path is moving much closer to market forecasts, and I see that as healthy and appropriate.	23.0	104.0
201603	1956	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	The sense that the Committee is likely to move more slowly than the December SEP suggested is probably one of the reasons why financial conditions have improved so much since February 11.	23.0	104.0
201603	1957	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	My own forecast is now for two rate increases this year and three next year, which is not far from the SEP median.	23.0	104.0
201603	1958	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I find it interesting that the SEP medians are moving decidedly away in this round from the Tealbook rate forecast and closer to markets.	23.0	104.0
201603	1959	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Now, of course, the Tealbook rate forecast is, by construction, a mechanical application of a particular Taylor rule without normative aspirations or intent.	23.0	104.0
201603	1960	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Although I’m broadly comfortable with the Tealbook’s real economy forecast, I doubt that forecast would be achieved if rates actually followed the forecast path in the Tealbook.	23.0	104.0
201603	1961	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	The forecast is for eight or nine rate increases in the next two years.	23.0	104.0
201603	1962	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	And if you add in those rate increases plus a reversion of the term premium, the 10-year Treasury yield is forecast to be 3.6 percent at the end of 2017, and those readings all seem to be deep in the tails of market expectations, both in market readings and in surveys, and out of touch with the realities of the global economy.	23.0	104.0
201603	1963	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I don’t really have an answer to suggest.	23.0	104.0
201603	1964	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I just will note that there seems to be a growing disconnect there.	23.0	104.0
201603	1965	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	To wrap up, weak global growth is likely to put a fairly low speed limit on our own growth and on the path of rate increases.	23.0	104.0
201603	1966	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	It strikes me that the Committee faces a tradeoff between policy divergence and economic divergence.	23.0	104.0
201603	1967	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	If our policy diverges too much from what the rest of the world is doing, we’ll be unable to diverge meaningfully from the dismal state of global growth.	23.0	104.0
201603	1968	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Fortunately, I don’t see this tradeoff as a difficult one for us in the near term.	23.0	104.0
201603	1969	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201603	1970	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	1971	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23.0	65.0
201603	1972	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201603	1973	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	I support alternative B.	23.0	91.0
201603	1974	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	My December SEP path assumed two funds rate increases later this year, and, after taking a hard look at my outlook, I found no compelling reason to change that assessment.	23.0	91.0
201603	1975	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	A basic data-dependence calculation calls for holding steady today, in my opinion.	23.0	91.0
201603	1976	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Inflation is higher, but, as I discussed yesterday, we’re also facing tighter financial conditions than we anticipated in December.	23.0	91.0
201603	1977	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	In effect, financial markets have tightened for us.	23.0	91.0
201603	1978	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	In addition, I continue to be concerned that inflation expectations have declined or, at the very least, are fragile.	23.0	91.0
201603	1979	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	The forces holding down inflation expectations are global, and I don’t think it is so easy for us to depart from the rest of the world.	23.0	91.0
201603	1980	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	To me, these developments at least offset what could prove to be a short-lived increase in core inflation, but, of course, monitoring the data developments remains important.	23.0	91.0
201603	1981	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	A risk-management approach also continues to argue for no change in rates today and a plan for only a couple of increases in 2016.	23.0	91.0
201603	1982	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	First, we shouldn’t overreact to the positive news on inflation.	23.0	91.0
201603	1983	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	We’ve underrun 2 percent for quite a long time.	23.0	91.0
201603	1984	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Now we’ve seen high first-quarter readings on inflation.	23.0	91.0
201603	1985	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	This could turn out to be transitory.	23.0	91.0
201603	1986	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	There’s very little cost in waiting a few months to get a better reading on the true underlying trends.	23.0	91.0
201603	1987	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Second, on account of the modest pace of growth in our baseline forecast and the considerable uncertainty and downside risks emanating from international economic conditions, I believe that policy should provide strong support to aggregate demand as a buffer against future downside shocks.	23.0	91.0
201603	1988	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Our continued proximity to the effective lower bound leaves us little conventional ammunition to address such shocks, and, despite the excellent staff memos on policy alternatives we could use if the economy were to weaken, I would prefer to be extracautious this year to avoid having to resort to those contingencies.	23.0	91.0
201603	1989	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Third, a very gradual path of rate increases helps counter the risk that inflation expectations could be lower.	23.0	91.0
201603	1990	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Any appropriately accommodative policy rate path should provide a strong signal of our commitment to a symmetric 2 percent inflation target.	23.0	91.0
201603	1991	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201603	1992	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	1993	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23.0	65.0
201603	1994	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201603	1995	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I also favor alternative B as written.	23.0	97.0
201603	1996	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I think the impulse to allow some time to see if global volatility has actually calmed down may itself be a sufficient reason for maintaining the policy stance.	23.0	97.0
201603	1997	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	For me, there’s the additional, more basic motivation of a risk-management approach that counsels some—although, obviously, not heavy—bias against raising rates under current circumstances and does so for a few reasons.	23.0	97.0
201603	1998	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	First, as people in and out of the Committee have mentioned frequently, there is the asymmetry of tools available to us to meet upside and downside risks.	23.0	97.0
201603	1999	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And, in that regard, I’d recall Beth Anne’s discussion yesterday of the difficulties being encountered by the ECB and the BOJ in trying to implement unconventional policies.	23.0	97.0
201603	2000	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Second, there is what I, at least, regard as the relatively low probability of inflation getting away from us if it proves to have a little bit more bounce than I currently expect.	23.0	97.0
201603	2001	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And here I think—not today, obviously, but over the coming months—I could probably use some help from those of you who keep referring to this possibility of inflation getting away from us, because I want to understand what the theory of that is under current circumstances.	23.0	97.0
201603	2002	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I know there are a couple of historical episodes that people point to, but, with my limited reading and understanding of those episodes, they seem to be characterized by things like the economy having run hot for a considerable period of time; a big fiscal stimulus in one instance coming into play; and being in an era in which central banks, including this one, had not worked as hard as they have more recently to establish the prevailing theory of anchored inflation expectations.	23.0	97.0
201603	2003	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Now, I may have some doubts personally about what I still regard as sort of an undertheorized theory, but if you believe in the anchored expectations approach—and that seems to have animated a good majority of this Committee over the past five or six years—I do have some difficulty understanding how and why those same anchored inflation expectations would not keep inflation anchored during a period in which actual inflation was beginning to move up and thereby give us time to react.	23.0	97.0
201603	2004	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	The reaction could be, by some measure, a little bit slow, but, again, if I understand the inflation expectations hypothesis correctly, it shouldn’t get too far away from us during that period.	23.0	97.0
201603	2005	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And, presumably, as the Committee begins to react, the expectations would have been reinforced—“Oh, yes, they may be a little bit slow, but they’re still committed to 2 percent over the medium term.”	23.0	97.0
201603	2006	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	As I say, I would like to understand better what the current theory is for why things could get away from us.	23.0	97.0
201603	2007	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And I’ll just note very briefly that there’s a third reason for what people term the risk-management approach—the possibility that we’re in a fundamentally different economic environment in which the major challenge is not inflation or stagflation but stubbornly low inflation and growth.	23.0	97.0
201603	2008	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	This is sort of the secular-stagnation hypothesis and its variants.	23.0	97.0
201603	2009	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	You don’t need to believe that this is necessarily the case, but if there’s something to it, we could be assessing things through eyes that were trained for and through very different experiences.	23.0	97.0
201603	2010	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But if these sorts of hypotheses prove to have limited or no salience, again, we should have time to react to actual changes in the economy.	23.0	97.0
201603	2011	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	As to the language, personally, as I noted yesterday, I think the risks are pretty clearly to the downside, but there are good institutional reasons, both positive and normative, for issuing a statement that doesn’t come down too heavily in making that point or, indeed, in making any point substantially different from the ones we’ve been making over the past couple of statements.	23.0	97.0
201603	2012	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	The positive reason is the obvious one that I probably couldn’t garner a consensus for that view and inserting a stronger statement.	23.0	97.0
201603	2013	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But the normative reason, I think, is more powerful, and that’s that I don’t believe we should swing too much from meeting to meeting in what we’re saying in the statements.	23.0	97.0
201603	2014	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	We need to take account of things that are happening, and that’s what paragraph 1 allows us to do.	23.0	97.0
201603	2015	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	It may shift a little bit what we’re expecting, and that’s what paragraph 2 allows us to do.	23.0	97.0
201603	2016	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But too much of a swing, particularly at periods in which we are not actually inclined to make a policy move, strikes me as risking our own credibility as markets begin to try to figure out “Where are they this month?” and “They just kind of veer all over the place.”	23.0	97.0
201603	2017	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I would have felt that way even if things were still somewhat more volatile in markets, so long as the effect was not being significantly felt in the real economy.	23.0	97.0
201603	2018	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I think alt-B does a very nice job of doing that, in that the important clause inserted in paragraph 1 makes the point that, notwithstanding the global developments of recent months, we’ve still been expanding at a moderate pace.	23.0	97.0
201603	2019	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And paragraph 2 notes that there are still some risks out there.	23.0	97.0
201603	2020	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	So I think that actually does quite a good job of maintaining everyone’s optionality right now.	23.0	97.0
201603	2021	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201603	2022	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	2023	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23.0	65.0
201603	2024	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201603	2025	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Although financial markets have improved recently, the underlying drivers of the risk-off movements in markets last summer and at the start of this year remain largely unresolved.	23.0	107.0
201603	2026	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Global growth is very low.	23.0	107.0
201603	2027	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	This low growth, together with concerns about foreign policymakers having limited additional space, increases the vulnerability of important economies to adverse shocks and makes it more difficult to correct financial imbalances.	23.0	107.0
201603	2028	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, the chances that adverse events abroad will, through significant further dollar appreciation or financial turmoil, affect inflation and activity here at home are sobering.	23.0	107.0
201603	2029	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	At the same time, the asymmetry in policy at the effective lower bound makes it more challenging to respond to such adverse shocks.	23.0	107.0
201603	2030	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Of course, there are also risks on the other side.	23.0	107.0
201603	2031	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The strength in household demand and the labor market could be indicating that resource utilization will soon become very tight.	23.0	107.0
201603	2032	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	This could push inflation persistently above our 2 percent target and put upward pressure on inflation expectations above 2 percent.	23.0	107.0
201603	2033	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	I’ve listened carefully to the discussion around this table, and I take these considerations very seriously.	23.0	107.0
201603	2034	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	However, I believe we have much greater policy space using conventional tools to deal with this, and several considerations lead me to assess that the probability of such an outcome is somewhat lower than the alternative.	23.0	107.0
201603	2035	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	First, as the most recent labor market report illustrated, supply in the labor market may be more responsive to improving labor market conditions than we previously thought.	23.0	107.0
201603	2036	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Second, recent research has suggested that the slope of the Phillips curve is flatter now than it has been in previous decades.	23.0	107.0
201603	2037	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, recent data on inflation expectations suggest that the risks to inflation expectations are to the downside, not to the upside.	23.0	107.0
201603	2038	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, these hints of lower inflation expectations have developed against a backdrop of sub–2 percent inflation for nearly every month of the past six years, together with weak and fragile global growth.	23.0	107.0
201603	2039	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	It is difficult to imagine these circumstances reversing—with inflation persistently significantly above our target and worries about inflation expectations moving higher—any time soon.	23.0	107.0
201603	2040	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Indeed, I’m struck that the majority of FOMC participants see risks to headline and core PCE inflation as tilted to the downside, a noticeable shift compared with December.	23.0	107.0
201603	2041	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Third, it’s helpful to remember that the world is in a different place than it was in the decades prior to the financial crisis.	23.0	107.0
201603	2042	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, the natural rate of interest both here and in much of the rest of the world is considerably lower, with many estimates suggesting a rate currently close to zero.	23.0	107.0
201603	2043	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Finally, the backdrop of weak and decelerating global demand suggests that any unexpected strengthening here at home will be absorbed, at least in part, through some combination of further appreciation of the exchange rate and tightening of financial conditions.	23.0	107.0
201603	2044	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	To guard against the downside risks posed by the current environment, monetary policy should focus on carefully preserving and protecting the areas of strength in our economy.	23.0	107.0
201603	2045	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	It should recognize the endogeneity of financial conditions to our expected policy rate path due to the fragility of the global economy.	23.0	107.0
201603	2046	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	By doing so, we can increase the economy’s resilience and make it less susceptible to adverse shocks, and, importantly, we’ll also reduce the probability that we would confront the need to make further use of unconventional policies.	23.0	107.0
201603	2047	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	I think the language in alternative B strikes that careful balance.	23.0	107.0
201603	2048	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Although it notes that global economic and financial developments pose risks, it does not conclude that, therefore, overall risks are tilted to the downside.	23.0	107.0
201603	2049	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	This careful evolution of the language, together with the SEP, should provide useful guidance on how the Committee is likely to adjust the policy rate path in response to the evolution of the data.	23.0	107.0
201603	2050	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201603	2051	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	2052	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	23.0	65.0
201603	2053	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201603	2054	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	As inflation remains below target, and that my economic forecast anticipates only a gradual increase in inflation, I support alternative B at this meeting.	23.0	999.0
201603	2055	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	It is not crucial that we adjust policy today, but I believe it is important, in view of the underlying strength of the economy and the increasing likelihood that inflation will return to target in the not-too-distant future, that a move in April not be taken off the table at this point.	23.0	999.0
201603	2056	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Labor markets continue to improve, and a recent FRBSF Economic Letter—“What’s Up with Wage Growth?”	23.0	999.0
201603	2057	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	There’s been a strong rebound in equity prices, and financial volatility has waned as well.	23.0	999.0
201603	2058	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Inflation has shown signs of firming as oil prices have bottomed and even risen a little bit of late and the dollar has stabilized.	23.0	999.0
201603	2059	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Thus, I am more confident in the economy than I was two months ago and less concerned about the potential for a sustained decrease in inflation or inflation deviating from target for a significant time to come.	23.0	999.0
201603	2060	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Monetary policy remains accommodative, and we will still be accommodative in the event of future rate hikes.	23.0	999.0
201603	2061	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	I think we need to remain, as we’ve all said, data dependent.	23.0	999.0
201603	2062	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	And should the economy evolve somewhat in line with my forecast, a rate hike at the next meeting merits consideration.	23.0	999.0
201603	2063	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Signs of firming in inflation remain an important consideration for the setting of policy.	23.0	999.0
201603	2064	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	But with inflation moving toward our objective and the economy at or above full employment, we risk sending confusing signals to the market if we delay normalization for too long.	23.0	999.0
201603	2065	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	I worry that we are setting up an uncertainty feedback loop in which we consistently emphasize the risk that inflation will not return to target, and the markets reflect that concern, leading to volatility and lower inflation compensation, causing us to, again, pause normalization, which further worries the market.	23.0	999.0
201603	2066	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201603	2067	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23.0	65.0
201603	2068	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201603	2069	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	I support alt-B.	23.0	108.0
201603	2070	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	I believe the federal funds rate should be placed on a very gradually rising path, which should, of course, be data dependent in the sense that every decision depends on economic developments and, primarily, on expectations of the effect of that and expected subsequent decisions on the economy.	23.0	108.0
201603	2071	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	At this time, after a period of serious market and economic turbulence from which the US economy has largely but not totally recovered, we should pause for at least one more meeting in order to assess whether the ill winds of the first six weeks of 2016 have mostly abated, as now appears to be the case.	23.0	108.0
201603	2072	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	By “ill winds,”	23.0	108.0
201603	2073	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	I mean mainly winds that have come from abroad, but also some that are domestic—for example, the apparent loosening of the long-term expected inflation anchor, on whose amazing stability we have long relied.	23.0	108.0
201603	2074	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	As I mentioned yesterday, I believe we need to figure out how changes in the inflation anchor relate to the short- term expectations that matter for critical aspects of the inflationary process, including wage determination.	23.0	108.0
201603	2075	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	In yesterday’s interesting go-round on the state of the economy, there was virtual unanimity that the global environment in which the US economy operates has become more risky—mainly, but not entirely, in a downward direction.	23.0	108.0
201603	2076	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	There was more confidence about the resilience of the US economy, along with concerns about the potential unmooring of inflation expectations; the potential slowdown of domestic demand, which was reinforced by the data that came in at the beginning of yesterday’s session; and the potential damage, in particular, that could be caused by foreign shocks.	23.0	108.0
201603	2077	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	In fact, each of us produced a list of potential problems in both foreign and domestic economies, replete with cautionary adjectives, to an extent that must have frightened all of us.	23.0	108.0
201603	2078	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	In fact, it was enough to make one’s hair curl.	23.0	108.0
201603	2079	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Certainly, my hair has curled, though I must admit that, when my wife explained to me it was the humidity that had done it, I countered that she had not been at the discussion, and that she needed to understand how frightening that was.	23.0	108.0
201603	2080	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	What was lacking was an estimate of what the sum of all of the foreign risks amounted to, in terms of their potential effect on us, whether we move in April—as I would, at this stage, believe appropriate—or, rather, wait until June or even make no further moves this year.	23.0	108.0
201603	2081	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	I understand from a conversation with the staff that the appreciation of the exchange rate since mid-2014 is estimated to have reduced GDP by 1 percent in total so far and is expected to reduce GDP by 1¼ percent in total by the end of next year.	23.0	108.0
201603	2082	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Of course, there are other considerations that explicitly or implicitly affect our decision.	23.0	108.0
201603	2083	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	First, it’s hard to pull the trigger.	23.0	108.0
201603	2084	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Among the 320 million or so Americans are several million, a number of them columnists, who know much better than we do what decisions we should make.	23.0	108.0
201603	2085	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	23.0	108.0
201603	2086	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	So we will be criticized no matter what decisions we make.	23.0	108.0
201603	2087	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	That’s the price we pay for having accepted the responsibilities of making the critical decisions we face eight times each year.	23.0	108.0
201603	2088	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Concern over making a mistake may sometimes point to the value of waiting for more information.	23.0	108.0
201603	2089	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	But prudence requires us to make the right decisions at the right times on the basis of the information available.	23.0	108.0
201603	2090	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Second, and most important, is the credibility of the Federal Reserve.	23.0	108.0
201603	2091	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	I believe we gained credibility by the Chair’s calmness during the recent turbulence, and the expected continuation of that calmness will contribute even more to our credibility.	23.0	108.0
201603	2092	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	But, of course, what ultimately gives an individual or an institution credibility is the quality of its decisions, and I believe we’re making the right decision today.	23.0	108.0
201603	2093	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201603	2094	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	2095	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23.0	65.0
201603	2096	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201603	2097	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I support alternative B for today as written.	23.0	94.0
201603	2098	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I think there is a good case for moving today on the basis of the Committee’s outlook as of December.	23.0	94.0
201603	2099	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	We basically have very good labor market reports, we arguably have an upside surprise on core inflation measures, and the global economy is arguably expected to grow more rapidly in 2016 than it did in 2015.	23.0	94.0
201603	2100	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Nevertheless, I’m advocating that we wait at this juncture because I would like more reassurance that market-based inflation expectations will return to more satisfactory levels.	23.0	94.0
201603	2101	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	My judgment is partially based on my reading of the euro-area experience over the past several years.	23.0	94.0
201603	2102	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	My view is that our European colleagues reacted slowly to declining inflation expectations in Europe.	23.0	94.0
201603	2103	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	They did eventually move aggressively, but it’s a very long road back for them.	23.0	94.0
201603	2104	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	In January 2012, 10-year nominal government bonds in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany had very similar yields, with Japan and Switzerland about 150 basis points lower.	23.0	94.0
201603	2105	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	You could interpret that as differences in inflation expectations in the two sets of countries, with a real interest rate that is equalized across economies.	23.0	94.0
201603	2106	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Today Germany has joined the lower group, and the United States and the United Kingdom remain in the higher group.	23.0	94.0
201603	2107	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I would prefer that we not join the lower group.	23.0	94.0
201603	2108	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I also think that, ultimately, we got a more substantial impact on the basis of the December rate hike than I anticipated at the time when we made that move.	23.0	94.0
201603	2109	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	At the time, I interpreted our move as a small action with a lot of language meant to emphasize data dependence.	23.0	94.0
201603	2110	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	My judgment today is that the market interpretation was very different.	23.0	94.0
201603	2111	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	The market took the view that the December move set in motion a train of calendar-based moves.	23.0	94.0
201603	2112	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	This is not entirely unwarranted on the market’s part—because this is how the Committee actually behaved from 2004 to 2006, when we made 17 straight moves of 25 basis points per meeting.	23.0	94.0
201603	2113	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	The combination of moving off zero and the median of the dot plot seemed to suggest a fixed path of rates regardless of the data.	23.0	94.0
201603	2114	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	And, early in the year, as the data came in negative, that seemed to add up to recession probabilities for the United States, according to market participants.	23.0	94.0
201603	2115	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	To me, this experience calls into question the value of the policy rate portion of the SEP.	23.0	94.0
201603	2116	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	One of the problems with the policy rate portion of the SEP is that we have in the past tried to use that as a tool to commit to the path of interest rates.	23.0	94.0
201603	2117	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	So during the time we were at zero, we wanted to encourage markets to look at the zero rates out into the future as a commitment that we would be sufficiently accommodative to match the state of the economy.	23.0	94.0
201603	2118	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	We are now trying to say that the path of rates suggested in the SEP is not a commitment but is merely a reflection of our judgment of the future evolution of the economy.	23.0	94.0
201603	2119	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I think that this is causing confusion, and our experience over the December/January/February period has made me worry more about it.	23.0	94.0
201603	2120	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	There was a time when we did not give such explicit forward guidance about how we were going to operate in the future, and a lot of that period—in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s— was considered very successful.	23.0	94.0
201603	2121	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Part of the reason it might have been successful is, we did not have this possibly misinterpreted future path of the policy rate sitting out there.	23.0	94.0
201603	2122	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I’m not under any illusions that we would do anything about this immediately, and I think it would help the Committee to put the confidence bands around the policy rate and the other elements of the SEP that we discussed previously and, I think, are going to discuss again.	23.0	94.0
201603	2123	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	But we should think more carefully about the wisdom of giving policy guidance through the SEP if we do not intend it to be some kind of commitment in the future.	23.0	94.0
201603	2124	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Now, we have a lot of language that says everything is data dependent, but I guess my experience over December/January was that we don’t have a lot of credibility on that particular language.	23.0	94.0
201603	2125	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Today’s decision will indeed demonstrate some data dependence but in a somewhat awkward way, since intermeeting jobs reports were strong and inflation seems to be conforming more or less exactly with Committee projections.	23.0	94.0
201603	2126	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	So we’re likely to create with the decision today, even though I support it, a somewhat more confused picture about what the Committee’s policy reaction function actually is.	23.0	94.0
201603	2127	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	If the Committee’s policy reaction function does not simply depend on our mandated inflation and employment variables, why not put the other variables in the SEP?	23.0	94.0
201603	2128	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	If we’re going to cite global GDP growth, then why not have Committee members forecasting global GDP growth and seeing what their outlook is, and we can see how that changes from meeting to meeting?	23.0	94.0
201603	2129	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	If it’s risk associated with the global outlook, let’s put risk in there, and then people can see how that’s evolving over time and how that’s feeding into our policy decisionmaking.	23.0	94.0
201603	2130	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I think what we have is that these kinds of objects are supposed to feed back to employment and inflation outcomes, but what we’re saying today is that, even though those outcomes were relatively good during the intermeeting period and are basically on track, we’re still not going to move today.	23.0	94.0
201603	2131	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Also, I’m citing inflation expectations—those also aren’t in the SEP.	23.0	94.0
201603	2132	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	If I really thought I needed inflation expectations to get to some particular level, then maybe that should be in there as well.	23.0	94.0
201603	2133	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee is, in my view, today taking a calculated risk and possibly getting “behind the curve” later this year.	23.0	94.0
201603	2134	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I guess one thing I’d remind the Committee of is, we’ve moved only once, so it’s not like we’ve had a sequence of moves.	23.0	94.0
201603	2135	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	We’ve made only a single move of 25 basis points.	23.0	94.0
201603	2136	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	We did lay out a path of what we’re going to do, and it could easily get derailed in the first half of the year.	23.0	94.0
201603	2137	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Inflation could continue to go up.	23.0	94.0
201603	2138	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t think this risk is particularly high right now, but it’s becoming palpable.	23.0	94.0
201603	2139	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	A larger risk may be that the signal being sent is that the Committee is growing very pessimistic concerning US macroeconomic prospects.	23.0	94.0
201603	2140	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I think such a signal would be unwarranted, and that should not be the main message of the FOMC in this situation.	23.0	94.0
201603	2141	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201603	2142	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	2143	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23.0	65.0
201603	2144	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	103.0
201603	2145	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	I support the language in alternative B for paragraphs 1 and 2, but I do not agree with its policy prescription.	23.0	103.0
201603	2146	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Since the December meeting, incoming data have largely confirmed my outlook.	23.0	103.0
201603	2147	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	We’ve received three strong labor reports as well as data indicating that inflation is moving higher.	23.0	103.0
201603	2148	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Unfortunately, our initiation of removing accommodation has coincided with what appears to me a more vulnerable global economy and a domestic economy that is threatened by markets that seem to be anxious, uncertain, and volatile.	23.0	103.0
201603	2149	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Faced with these dynamics, I recognize that the Committee’s decisions to continue to normalize its policy settings become far more difficult.	23.0	103.0
201603	2150	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Risks associated with financial volatility and global concerns have diminished recently, but I would agree with others that there have been no fundamental changes that would preclude more bouts of volatility in the days and even months ahead.	23.0	103.0
201603	2151	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	So, in the face of such headwinds and uncertainty, I’m inclined to focus on our longer-run objectives.	23.0	103.0
201603	2152	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	With an unemployment rate of 4.9 percent, the economy is near full employment, and the recent upward movements in year- over-year headline PCE inflation and core PCE inflation suggest that the temporary downward pressures associated with falling oil prices and appreciation of the dollar have been dissipating.	23.0	103.0
201603	2153	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	In the interest of our mandate to promote long-run sustainable growth with healthy employment and price stability, I believe monetary policy should respond to these developments by slowly removing accommodation.	23.0	103.0
201603	2154	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	The Committee has acknowledged that the pace of policy adjustments is expected to be more gradual than would be dictated based solely on economic conditions as prescribed by policy rules.	23.0	103.0
201603	2155	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Likewise, a gradual path does offer a risk-management approach as we face various headwinds and risk in the economy.	23.0	103.0
201603	2156	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	As described in Tealbook B, the real equilibrium interest rate and policy rules continue to point to settings that are, and will continue to be for some time, very accommodative under the baseline assumption regarding the federal funds rate path.	23.0	103.0
201603	2157	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	The current federal funds rate is more than 2 percentage points below the Tealbook-consistent measure of r*, and the only time since 2005 that this gap was larger was immediately prior to the December liftoff.	23.0	103.0
201603	2158	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Postponing the removal of accommodation in the wake of improving economic conditions could very well promote risk that would decrease the likelihood of achieving our longer-run objectives.	23.0	103.0
201603	2159	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	As we near full employment and price stability, continuation of the current level of accommodation invites further misallocation of capital and labor resources to sectors that are most interest sensitive.	23.0	103.0
201603	2160	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	My District is experiencing the fallout of a commodity price boom, and concerns are being raised nationwide regarding risk associated with commercial real estate lending.	23.0	103.0
201603	2161	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	My concern for some time has been that extending monetary policy too far beyond its scope of capability risks undesirable financial, economic, and political distortions.	23.0	103.0
201603	2162	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Waiting may seem costless in the face of benign inflation pressures, and confidence is often expressed that we’ll have the ability to make the necessary or steeper adjustments later.	23.0	103.0
201603	2163	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	This argument might be more persuasive if one was confident that the relationship between employment and inflation was reasonably positive.	23.0	103.0
201603	2164	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	But most estimates suggest that the Phillips curve is pretty flat.	23.0	103.0
201603	2165	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Under this scenario, the challenges of speeding up inflation now, when it is below target, must be equivalent to future challenges of slowing inflation down, should it move above.	23.0	103.0
201603	2166	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	With an output gap that is basically closed, I see costs associated with trying to fine-tune inflation dynamics when the transmission mechanism from unemployment to inflation is relatively weak.	23.0	103.0
201603	2167	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	So staying the course with a gradual path of policy normalization is warranted, in my view.	23.0	103.0
201603	2168	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	A 25 basis point increase at this meeting is consistent with the economy’s fundamentals, keeps policy very accommodative, and does not preclude pausing or responding if downside risks, in fact, materialize.	23.0	103.0
201603	2169	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	103.0
201603	2170	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	2171	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23.0	65.0
201603	2172	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	102.0
201603	2173	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	First of all, I’d like to say that my views align very much with President Mester’s.	23.0	102.0
201603	2174	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So everything I add to that will probably be less coherent.	23.0	102.0
201603	2175	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I think she captured my sentiments very much as well.	23.0	102.0
201603	2176	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The baseline outlook is little changed, in my view, from the time of the December meeting.	23.0	102.0
201603	2177	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	A wide range of labor market indicators—the unemployment rate, U-6, quits, and vacancies—have continued to improve and are at levels consistent with maximum employment.	23.0	102.0
201603	2178	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Survey data on the ease of either finding or filling jobs also point to fairly tight labor markets.	23.0	102.0
201603	2179	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Although we continue to fall short on our inflation goal, the recent news on that front has been encouraging.	23.0	102.0
201603	2180	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Incoming data show some firming of underlying inflation.	23.0	102.0
201603	2181	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Oil and other commodity prices have begun to recover.	23.0	102.0
201603	2182	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The dollar has stabilized, and the continued strength of the labor market should help propel a more rapid pace of price and wage gains.	23.0	102.0
201603	2183	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, risks to the outlook appear roughly balanced, to my mind.	23.0	102.0
201603	2184	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The resilience of the economy in the face of foreign headwinds to date has been notable.	23.0	102.0
201603	2185	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I mentioned this yesterday.	23.0	102.0
201603	2186	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	We saw a big drag to net exports the last couple of years with the strengthening of the dollar and the decline in the oil prices.	23.0	102.0
201603	2187	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	All of those shocks started occurring in 2014 and had their full effects in 2015.	23.0	102.0
201603	2188	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yet the economy continued to grow, adding over 2.7 million jobs last year.	23.0	102.0
201603	2189	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And we’ve seen, as people commented on, a stabilizing, I think, of underlying inflation and are now seeing some signs of a firming of inflation despite the fact that we actually got hit by the big shocks.	23.0	102.0
201603	2190	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Moreover, domestically, there are upside risks to consumer and housing expenditure, and fiscal policy is set to be more accommodative over the near term.	23.0	102.0
201603	2191	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Given that these conditions are consistent with my December modal forecast, I persevere in believing that, in the modal outlook, four 25 basis point increases in the federal funds rate will be appropriate this year.	23.0	102.0
201603	2192	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	In this regard, I found the text of the case for alternative C in Tealbook B compelling.	23.0	102.0
201603	2193	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I thought it was very well written in terms of the description of the issues.	23.0	102.0
201603	2194	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I should say that I think, at least in my interpretation—I’m kind of struggling with this a bit—the difference in my view about the policy rate path really isn’t about the baseline outlook or the modal outlook.	23.0	102.0
201603	2195	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s really about how to evaluate the risks to the outlook and the implications of those risks for the outlook regarding appropriate policy.	23.0	102.0
201603	2196	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I actually don’t think that my views are that different in terms of the modal outlook than those of the median voter, or at least the median participant, of the FOMC.	23.0	102.0
201603	2197	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s really about, how to best take into account the risk-management aspects that Governor Tarullo, President Evans, and others have highlighted— what these risks really look like and what they mean for the economy and our ability to adjust policy in response to those risks.	23.0	102.0
201603	2198	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do think there’s a bit of a bimodal distribution out there in the markets—and, perhaps, in our own views—where the main positive, outlook is actually one of continued solid growth, continued job gains, continued movement of inflation toward 2 percent, and all of that.	23.0	102.0
201603	2199	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	In that modal outlook, I think four rate increases actually are completely consistent.	23.0	102.0
201603	2200	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I disagree a little bit with what Governor Powell was saying.	23.0	102.0
201603	2201	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that, if that outlook eventuates—if we add over 2 million jobs this year and if unemployment gets down toward 4½ percent—three or four funds rate increases this year and movements of the 10-year Treasuries and things wouldn’t be that surprising to markets.	23.0	102.0
201603	2202	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It would be seen as a sign of strength.	23.0	102.0
201603	2203	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I think there’s a consistency in the modal outlook.	23.0	102.0
201603	2204	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think the real issue, again, is how to incorporate the information about this negative scenario in terms of both what’s appropriate policy in the baseline and how we’d react to that.	23.0	102.0
201603	2205	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So that’s just explaining my own thinking in terms of the modal outlook.	23.0	102.0
201603	2206	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I am becoming increasingly concerned that we are falling further “behind the curve” on this modal outlook.	23.0	102.0
201603	2207	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Nonetheless, I do support alternative B as written today.	23.0	102.0
201603	2208	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’d repeat pretty much what everybody has said.	23.0	102.0
201603	2209	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The language of alt-B, I think, is a good balance.	23.0	102.0
201603	2210	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with Governor Brainard’s way of describing that.	23.0	102.0
201603	2211	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think this is a good place to be at this time, and one of the reasons I come to that conclusion, despite my somewhat hawkish view of where the economy is going or where policy should be, is that in our statements in December and January, we emphasized that “the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.”	23.0	102.0
201603	2212	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s a commitment we made as a Committee, and I signed on to that last December and in January.	23.0	102.0
201603	2213	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I think that does make a strong case for not moving in March—to collect some more data and make sure that we have a stronger conviction regarding the data both on the outlook for employment and, especially, on inflation.	23.0	102.0
201603	2214	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	To my mind, not moving in March is completely consistent with my view that we will need to raise rates on a steady path over the next couple of years.	23.0	102.0
201603	2215	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I view, basically, the decision we’re making today as completely consistent with our previous commitments to be data dependent and to assess both actual and expected progress toward our goal.	23.0	102.0
201603	2216	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, in terms of looking forward, I think we’ve successfully convinced the markets that we’re not on some preordained path.	23.0	102.0
201603	2217	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the SEP, when it comes out, will show people that whoever thought we were going to have four increases this year—which I think was nobody— clearly, we’ve changed our view on that, reflecting especially the issues regarding the risks to the outlook.	23.0	102.0
201603	2218	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I think that alternative B is very good.	23.0	102.0
201603	2219	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It keeps our options open to gather more data and basically honor the commitment we made in our statement to both assess and monitor actual and expected progress toward our goals.	23.0	102.0
201603	2220	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I hope the data will verify that what we’ve seen lately with the stronger numbers persists and continues, and then we can make our future decisions based on that.	23.0	102.0
201603	2221	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	My own view is that, if the data do come in as I expect, in future meetings we will have that flexibility to respond as appropriate to normalize policy in a timely manner.	23.0	102.0
201603	2222	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Going 13th has the advantage of allowing me to respond to other people’s comments, so I’ve done that a little bit.	23.0	102.0
201603	2223	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I’d like to respond to President Bullard’s comments about the dot plots.	23.0	102.0
201603	2224	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t agree that the dot plots were a commitment for a specific path of policy.	23.0	102.0
201603	2225	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think they never were described that way, nor have they been interpreted that way.	23.0	102.0
201603	2226	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the dot plots have changed over time.	23.0	102.0
201603	2227	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ve been doing this for years.	23.0	102.0
201603	2228	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	You can see the dots changing as the data evolve and as the outlook evolves.	23.0	102.0
201603	2229	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	When Glenn Rudebusch and I wrote a paper over eight years ago basically kind of making the case for interest rate projections, the whole idea really was not that the dot plots were giving you some commitment or some promise to do something.	23.0	102.0
201603	2230	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It was laying out your thinking about this, and, as the data evolved and as the outlook and the risks to the outlook changed, the projections would change over time and provide information about how the expected policy rate path changes as data, economic conditions, and the outlook change.	23.0	102.0
201603	2231	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, when we were at the effective lower bound for years and years, we didn’t really see that reaction function showing itself, because we weren’t doing anything.	23.0	102.0
201603	2232	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But now we actually are showing the changes in our dots as the information changes, and I think this is a very helpful tool to give people information about our reaction function.	23.0	102.0
201603	2233	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	If our reaction function includes risks to the outlook and risk-management concerns, that’s hard to explain.	23.0	102.0
201603	2234	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with President Bullard that it’s not in our SEP.	23.0	102.0
201603	2235	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But this is something the Chair and the minutes and our SEP assessments of risks will explain.	23.0	102.0
201603	2236	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, insofar as the Committee is deciding to make policy decisions on the basis of the risks to the outlook, we should communicate that, and I think this is what’s going to come out of the March SEP—that the risks to the outlook are a factor in people’s decisions.	23.0	102.0
201603	2237	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The last bit of good news I’ll mention—and this is something that I showed at the Monetary Policy Forum—is that if you looked at the bond market responsiveness to macro news, on the basis of this work that Eric Swanson and I did years ago, you saw that go way down when we were at the effective lower bound and were expected to stay there for two years or so.	23.0	102.0
201603	2238	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Basically, the markets were sitting there saying, “Two-year yields and one-year yields aren’t moving in response to macro news,” because everybody knew that a little bit of good employment data or a weak CPI wasn’t fundamentally going to change the planned path of the policy rate for the next couple of years, as we were so deep underwater, if you will, on the zero bound.	23.0	102.0
201603	2239	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But today, as we move to being just slightly above the lower bound, we’ve seen the market reactions—in terms of the bond rates, in terms of options pricing—move partially.	23.0	102.0
201603	2240	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	On a one-year yield, it’s responding about three-quarters as much as normal—as it did back in the 1990s—and on two-year yields, about half as much as normal.	23.0	102.0
201603	2241	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I’m starting to see that muscle memory coming back to markets.	23.0	102.0
201603	2242	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I was just asking Simon here, you get a strong CPI, sure, market expectations of interest rates are going to go up a little bit.	23.0	102.0
201603	2243	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yields are going to move around.	23.0	102.0
201603	2244	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is a pattern we’re seeing.	23.0	102.0
201603	2245	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is a healthy development.	23.0	102.0
201603	2246	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t think we have the problems that President Bullard was concerned about, that somehow our dot plots or our other communications are confusing markets.	23.0	102.0
201603	2247	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think what’s happening is that markets, now that we’ve moved away from the effective lower bound—and expectations are that we will move very slowly further away from it—are starting to react more as we want them to do.	23.0	102.0
201603	2248	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the saying that we’ve always used as monetary economists is, “Let the markets do the work”—when there’s good news, yields move up, and when there’s bad news, yields move down.	23.0	102.0
201603	2249	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I actually feel much more positive about how our communication is working and about how the markets are reacting to interpreting news in terms of our reaction function.	23.0	102.0
201603	2250	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	We still have some way to go, because we’re still pretty close to the bound—we have a lot of risks that can push us back to the effective lower bound, but I guess my own view is that we’re halfway there in getting back to more-normal market functioning associated with our rate expectations.	23.0	102.0
201603	2251	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think the dot plots could be helpful in that regard.	23.0	102.0
201603	2252	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s it.	23.0	102.0
201603	2253	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I said I support alternative B, right?	23.0	102.0
201603	2254	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Did I give that out?	23.0	102.0
201603	2255	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	23.0	102.0
201603	2256	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23.0	102.0
201603	2257	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	I heard that, yes.	23.0	65.0
201603	2258	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard’s got a two hander.	23.0	65.0
201603	2259	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Yes, if I could just respond a little bit.	23.0	94.0
201603	2260	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I agreed with much of what President Williams said.	23.0	94.0
201603	2261	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I do want to remind the Committee that we did actually have calendar guidance at one point.	23.0	94.0
201603	2262	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Then the dot plots were conforming with that guidance, and we were saying this is a commitment that we’re not going to do anything until some amount of time passes.	23.0	94.0
201603	2263	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	So I think to be able to transition from that kind of thinking about the dot plots to now saying, “This is no commitment out there”—that was very difficult, especially with regard to the first rate increase, and I did not appreciate how hard that was going to be.	23.0	94.0
201603	2264	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	And I think you’re right, muscle memory will probably come back to markets, and everything might be fine eventually.	23.0	94.0
201603	2265	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	But I think, right around this time of liftoff, I didn’t appreciate how much of an issue that might be.	23.0	94.0
201603	2266	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23.0	65.0
201603	2267	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23.0	65.0
201603	2268	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Let me start with a two-handed intervention.	23.0	81.0
201603	2269	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	23.0	81.0
201603	2270	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	All right.	23.0	65.0
201603	2271	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	If you look at the language we used when we were at the zero bound, we were extremely careful not to call it a commitment.	23.0	81.0
201603	2272	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	We were extremely careful to say we were predicting what we would want to do in the future.	23.0	81.0
201603	2273	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	So to say we talked about it as a commitment is a bit of revisionist history.	23.0	81.0
201603	2274	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Now, was it interpreted that way?	23.0	81.0
201603	2275	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	I think so, because we argued that this was useful for achieving our objectives.	23.0	81.0
201603	2276	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	So I think people read that as, the expectation that we would do that would be useful for our objectives, and therefore we wanted people to believe we would behave that way.	23.0	81.0
201603	2277	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	That’s a little bit different from actually articulating a commitment, which I don’t think we did, but there’s a little subtlety here.	23.0	81.0
201603	2278	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Well, I would dispute that it’s revisionist history.	23.0	94.0
201603	2279	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	You had a theory out there, due to Woodford, that says, “This is exactly what you should do when you’re at the zero bound.	23.0	94.0
201603	2280	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	You should commit to be at the zero bound longer.”	23.0	94.0
201603	2281	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	And we talked about that.	23.0	94.0
201603	2282	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Yes, but that’s not how we wrote it.	23.0	81.0
201603	2283	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	We never endorsed that.	23.0	65.0
201603	2284	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	23.0	81.0
201603	2285	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	I don’t think anyone on the Committee endorsed that.	23.0	65.0
201603	2286	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	But that was one of the things we talked about.	23.0	94.0
201603	2287	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	My one-hander.	23.0	81.0
201603	2288	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	23.0	81.0
201603	2289	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	The floor is yours.	23.0	65.0
201603	2290	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Thank you very much.	23.0	81.0
201603	2291	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	In considering the appropriate level for the funds rate target, I always think it’s beneficial to keep our eye on some relevant benchmarks.	23.0	81.0
201603	2292	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	And the four Taylor rules in Tealbook B are alternative ways of encapsulating our past behavior.	23.0	81.0
201603	2293	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	I think they’re a useful reference to the extent that that behavior has served us well in the past.	23.0	81.0
201603	2294	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	In December, those rules all recommended a higher funds rate, and we raised rates with the anticipation of several further rate increases this year to lower the gap between the recommendation of those rules and where we were.	23.0	81.0
201603	2295	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	In January, we faced increased uncertainty in financial markets, and those Taylor rules uniformly prescribed lower rates than they had in December.	23.0	81.0
201603	2296	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	We paused and issued a statement signaling our concern.	23.0	81.0
201603	2297	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Now, however, the adverse financial market developments we saw in the first two months of the year have largely been reversed.	23.0	81.0
201603	2298	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Moreover, the turmoil has left little discernible trace on real economic data, which have largely confirmed our December outlook that there would be solid growth, and I think that’s pretty much a consensus around the table here.	23.0	81.0
201603	2299	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Inflation has moved back pretty smartly toward our objective as well.	23.0	81.0
201603	2300	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Each of the policy rules in the Tealbook now prescribes a higher rate for 2016:Q2 than it had in December, and each rule now prescribes a higher level for the funds rate—some considerably higher—than our current target.	23.0	81.0
201603	2301	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Now, I would not ever advocate slavishly following any of these rules.	23.0	81.0
201603	2302	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	But, together, they capture important elements of our past behavior.	23.0	81.0
201603	2303	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	That past behavior has generally served us well, so it’s hard to think of another pattern of behavior that would be a better benchmark.	23.0	81.0
201603	2304	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	The gaps between, on the one hand, the Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules and, on the other hand, the actual funds rate have grown considerably since a couple of years ago, when they both finally recommended a rate increase.	23.0	81.0
201603	2305	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	So it should be clear that we need to be raising rates over the course of the year, and I didn’t hear much disagreement with that.	23.0	81.0
201603	2306	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	I recognize that a case can be made to adjust the intercept in such rules using the estimates of a time-varying r*.	23.0	81.0
201603	2307	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Such adjustments would fall well short of eliminating cause for concern, however.	23.0	81.0
201603	2308	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Current estimates of r* are at or above zero, as opposed to the 1¼ percent assumed in the Tealbook Taylor rule calculations.	23.0	81.0
201603	2309	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	The current real federal funds rate is below negative 1, so a sizable gap still remains.	23.0	81.0
201603	2310	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	The fact that we’ve been falling further behind these benchmarks leads me to think that staying put today is a risky strategy.	23.0	81.0
201603	2311	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	You’ve been articulate in public, Madam Chair, regarding the risk of waiting too long to remove accommodation.	23.0	81.0
201603	2312	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Inflation prospects can shift rapidly, and policy takes time to work.	23.0	81.0
201603	2313	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	While financial developments should always be taken seriously, the staff has noted several instances in which financial market indicators have signaled adverse developments that never materialized.	23.0	81.0
201603	2314	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	When we have waited too long in the past, it has often been in response to financial market developments that turned out, in hindsight, to be false signals.	23.0	81.0
201603	2315	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Now that there’s overwhelming evidence that the recent surge in financial market volatility is waning, I believe we should get on with the adjustments in the stance of monetary policy that we know we need to make over time.	23.0	81.0
201603	2316	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Many of you argued that, while financial markets may have calmed down, concerns linger nonetheless, and that the prudent choice would be to maintain the current funds rate target.	23.0	81.0
201603	2317	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	In view of the acknowledged need to remove accommodation over the course of the next several quarters and the risks associated with delaying that process, I’d argue that the prudent approach would be to stay the course and continue to raise rates at a gradual pace, including at today’s meeting.	23.0	81.0
201603	2318	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Accordingly, I favor alternative C.	23.0	81.0
201603	2319	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Yes, this might surprise market participants, but we could have—and I believe we should have—prepared markets for this choice.	23.0	81.0
201603	2320	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Keep in mind the instances in the past few years in which an announcement of new monetary stimulus seemed to be taken as a dark signal from us about the outlook.	23.0	81.0
201603	2321	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Raising rates today would be a sign of our confidence in the real economic prospects for our economy.	23.0	81.0
201603	2322	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Should we adopt alternative B, which seems pretty likely, the silver lining for me is that it leaves the door open to an April increase.	23.0	81.0
201603	2323	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	And I hope we convey that publicly, both at the press conference today and elsewhere.	23.0	81.0
201603	2324	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	81.0
201603	2325	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	2326	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	23.0	65.0
201603	2327	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	111.0
201603	2328	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	I support alternative B.	23.0	111.0
201603	2329	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	I see four reasons why we should take a gradual approach to normalizing rates.	23.0	111.0
201603	2330	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	The first reason is inflation.	23.0	111.0
201603	2331	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Notwithstanding today’s data, inflation is pretty consistently coming up short, and inflation expectations appear to be weakening.	23.0	111.0
201603	2332	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Second, as we discussed yesterday, the improvement in labor force participation is welcome progress in putting people back to work.	23.0	111.0
201603	2333	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	I think we should let that process continue so long as inflation is coming up short.	23.0	111.0
201603	2334	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Third, the outlook for the global economy continues to be quite uncertain, especially outside the United States.	23.0	111.0
201603	2335	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Finally, global policy divergence could pose increasing drag on the US economy and on our own inflation if the dollar continues to appreciate.	23.0	111.0
201603	2336	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	My last comment is, I’d like to thank the staff for their work on potential tools for providing additional policy accommodation.	23.0	111.0
201603	2337	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	I found that analysis very helpful.	23.0	111.0
201603	2338	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	I think it’s useful not only in case of another downturn, but also in case we are really entering an environment of low interest rates.	23.0	111.0
201603	2339	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	I would note that I found the options presented not that powerful, with a lot of risks and costs potentially associated with them.	23.0	111.0
201603	2340	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	So I would encourage us to continue to consider a wide range of options in case we need them in the future.	23.0	111.0
201603	2341	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	23.0	111.0
201603	2342	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	2343	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23.0	65.0
201603	2344	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201603	2345	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B.	23.0	96.0
201603	2346	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	My reading of the statement language is that it neither pre-commits us to a move at the April or June meeting nor rules it out.	23.0	96.0
201603	2347	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the statement is appropriately balanced.	23.0	96.0
201603	2348	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	On the one hand, it reaffirms our evaluation of the economic outlook in paragraph 1—that we’re still on course— while, on the other, acknowledges the fact that global economic and financial developments continue to pose risks.	23.0	96.0
201603	2349	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I suppose that the acknowledgment that there are such risks might be considered new information relative to the January statement.	23.0	96.0
201603	2350	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	However, I think this was strongly implied by the January statement’s language that we were assessing the implications for the balance of the risks.	23.0	96.0
201603	2351	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think market participants will interpret the language as indicating a greater level of concern than we had in January.	23.0	96.0
201603	2352	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	As I see it, the risk-management considerations strongly support a decision not to tighten at this meeting.	23.0	96.0
201603	2353	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	There are downside risks, to both growth and inflation, posed by global economic and financial market developments.	23.0	96.0
201603	2354	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Not to take these into consideration when the economy is growing only slightly above its trend rate and inflation remains below our objectives would be inappropriate, in my view.	23.0	96.0
201603	2355	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, it would not surprise me if those risks subsided in coming months.	23.0	96.0
201603	2356	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In particular, China seems to be doing a better job in communicating its currency regime and has been supporting economic activity through fiscal and monetary policy.	23.0	96.0
201603	2357	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	And commodity prices may finally be starting to stabilize and, in some cases, recover.	23.0	96.0
201603	2358	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Oil prices are off the bottom, and other commodities, such as iron ore, have shown strong price recoveries recently.	23.0	96.0
201603	2359	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Brexit probably won’t happen, so that uncertainty will likely be resolved in a favorable way with respect to the global economic outlook.	23.0	96.0
201603	2360	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	If the foreign situation improves and the US recovery remains on track, then I think that would set us up well for a tightening at a future meeting, presumably the June meeting.	23.0	96.0
201603	2361	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	As I noted yesterday, I would be reluctant to move as quickly as April, barring some unusual surprise in the US data that alters the outlook in a material way.	23.0	96.0
201603	2362	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I’d like to think that April is on the table, but the reality is, to move at a non–press conference meeting would signal a sense of urgency to that tightening that I think would be difficult to justify, in view of the relatively sluggish pace of economic growth and the low level of inflation.	23.0	96.0
201603	2363	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	But, of course, we’ll have to wait for the data.	23.0	96.0
201603	2364	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, I have a few thoughts on the issue of negative interest rates in the United States.	23.0	96.0
201603	2365	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m getting a lot of questions about this whenever I speak, and I know a lot of other people are, too.	23.0	96.0
201603	2366	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that we should try to tamp down those expectations when we get those questions.	23.0	96.0
201603	2367	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Speculation and time spent on this question, I think, just reinforces pessimism about the outlook.	23.0	96.0
201603	2368	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, the risk of US recession may lead to concerns about bank profitability and may lead to concerns that we’re running out of ammunition.	23.0	96.0
201603	2369	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	So I don’t really see what’s gained by feeding this speculation.	23.0	96.0
201603	2370	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	How would I tamp down such speculation?	23.0	96.0
201603	2371	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, I would emphasize several things.	23.0	96.0
201603	2372	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	First, the US economy is doing reasonably well.	23.0	96.0
201603	2373	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	We are making progress with respect to our dual-mandate objectives.	23.0	96.0
201603	2374	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In other words, why are you asking me this question?	23.0	96.0
201603	2375	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Most of the significant risks lie abroad, not here in the United States—and this is really important—in contrast to the financial crisis.	23.0	96.0
201603	2376	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	So discussion about negative rates for the United States, at least, is at best extraordinarily premature.	23.0	96.0
201603	2377	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, if the economy were to weaken, we have plenty of tools to respond.	23.0	96.0
201603	2378	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re not close to being out of ammunition.	23.0	96.0
201603	2379	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	We could cut our target for the federal funds rate, lengthen the duration of our portfolio, do more QE, and use forward guidance, all of which are options that I think most of us see as dominating negative interest rates.	23.0	96.0
201603	2380	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Third, given the structure of US money markets and the recent experience of Europe and Japan, it’s not obvious that we would ever turn to negative rates, even in extremis, because the costs might simply outweigh the benefits.	23.0	96.0
201603	2381	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I would remind people that when we looked at this a few years ago, when we were much further away from our objectives, we declined to push the federal funds rate into negative territory, and I think people should draw some inference from that.	23.0	96.0
201603	2382	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201603	2383	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	2384	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23.0	65.0
201603	2385	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Well, I think we’ve had a good round of discussion on the policy issues we face.	23.0	65.0
201603	2386	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	I have heard your comments around the table about the importance of my own communications and will try to take it to heart.	23.0	65.0
201603	2387	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	In particular, let me assure you that I do intend to be positive on the US economy, to emphasize the resilience of the economy in the face of shocks, and to convey a sense of confidence that I think the outlook is favorable.	23.0	65.0
201603	2388	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	I will also try to keep all future meetings on the table but recognize that market expectations are not aligned with an April move.	23.0	65.0
201603	2389	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	And, in the coming weeks, if it looks like that’s something that’s appropriate, there would remain a challenge there that perhaps I’d have to address.	23.0	65.0
201603	2390	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	So, with those comments, I have heard considerable support for alternative B, as worded.	24.0	65.0
201603	2391	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Brian, let me ask you to put forward what we should vote on.	24.0	65.0
201603	2392	2016-03-16	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	24.0	999.0
201603	2393	2016-03-16	meeting	MADIGAN	This vote will be on the policy statement for alternative B on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas’s briefing materials, and it will also be on the directive to the Desk that is included on page 10 of those materials.	24.0	999.0
201603	2394	2016-03-16	meeting	MADIGAN	Chair Yellen Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Brainard Yes President Bullard Yes Governor Fischer Yes President George No President Mester  Yes Governor Powell  Yes President Rosengren Yes Governor Tarullo  Yes .	24.0	999.0
201603	2395	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Madam Chair, may I say one final thing?	24.0	96.0
201603	2396	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	24.0	65.0
201603	2397	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we owe a lot of thanks to the Chair and the staff for working on the statement.	24.0	96.0
201603	2398	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	This is the first time I can remember that the statement went through a lot of iterations, and we actually ended up with a statement for which, as far as I can tell, not one person suggested a change in language.	24.0	96.0
201603	2399	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	So kudos to the staff and the Chair, who worked a lot on this.	24.0	96.0
201603	2400	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That was not an easy needle to thread, so, well done.	24.0	96.0
201603	2401	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	53.0	65.0
201603	2402	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	So, just a couple of final comments.	53.0	65.0
201603	2403	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	The date of our next meeting is April 26 and 27.	53.0	65.0
201603	2404	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	You might want to come to that meeting dressed to the nines, because our photographer will be taking pictures of us for future use.	53.0	65.0
201603	2405	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s see—I think boxed lunches are now available, if you’d like them.	53.0	65.0
201603	2406	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	And there will be a setup in the Special Library for those of you who are staying around and have late planes to catch, if you want to watch me be grilled by the press at 2:30.	53.0	65.0
201603	2407	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	As usual, I will do my best.	53.0	65.0
201603	2408	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, all.	53.0	65.0
201604	0	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest that because we’re all assembled, we begin.	50.0	65.0
201604	1	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Today’s meeting will be a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board of Governors.	50.0	65.0
201604	2	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	I need a motion to close the Board meeting.	50.0	65.0
201604	3	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	50.0	108.0
201604	4	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	50.0	65.0
201604	5	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	50.0	65.0
201604	6	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Our first agenda topic this morning is a special session on the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability.	94.0	65.0
201604	7	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to start off by thanking Mike Kiley and Egon Zakrajšek of the Board’s staff, Anna Paulson of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and Geoff Tootell of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.	94.0	65.0
201604	8	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	These individuals formed the steering committee that solicited contributions on this topic from across the System and selected the four memos we received as background for today’s discussion.	94.0	65.0
201604	9	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	I also, of course, want to thank the staff that produced and contributed to these background documents.	94.0	65.0
201604	10	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	And so with that, let me turn things over to Jeff Fuhrer, who is going to begin the staff presentations.	94.0	65.0
201604	11	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	999.0
201604	12	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	I want to begin with the traditional Federal Reserve greeting at events such as this, which is to say I will be referring to the material in your packets labeled “The Linkages among Monetary Policy, Macroprudential Policy, and Financial Stability.”	94.0	999.0
201604	13	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	The topic that we will discuss during this session is sprawling, complex, widely discussed, tenaciously argued, and little understood.	94.0	999.0
201604	14	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Its aim is to help us avoid the kind of crisis we just went through.	94.0	999.0
201604	15	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	That crisis begat massive unemployment and left in its wake longer-term damage in the form of wealth loss and labor market scarring.	94.0	999.0
201604	16	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	We certainly hope we can do better next time, but the question is, how?	94.0	999.0
201604	17	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	We begin by sketching the key features of financial instability on exhibit 2 of the handout.	94.0	999.0
201604	18	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	The two main ingredients are rapid growth in debt and in asset prices, most often in the real estate sector.	94.0	999.0
201604	19	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	The two can interact with one another in ways that are no doubt obvious to you by now:  Rising collateral valuations and debt issuance mutually reinforce one another.	94.0	999.0
201604	20	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	But if the merry-go-round stops and prices drop, an all-too-familiar chain of events ensues:  Defaults rise, liquidity seizes, fire sales spread, prices fall further, solvency is threatened, and we lurch into a full-blown financial crisis, complete with a huge recession.	94.0	999.0
201604	21	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	It is unlikely that we will forever avoid the dynamics that have historically led to financial instability, no matter the regulatory environment and no matter who wins the presidential race.	94.0	999.0
201604	22	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Strong capital buffers and other structural tools will make the financial system more resilient in the face of disruptions, but they will likely not eliminate all financial instability and the potential for financial crises.	94.0	999.0
201604	23	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Thus, it is critical to think about how best to minimize the effects of financial disruptions on households and businesses using cyclical, time-varying tools to complement structural tools like capital ratios.	94.0	999.0
201604	24	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	A key question is whether monetary policy should be one of these tools.	94.0	999.0
201604	25	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	As emphasized in exhibit 3 in your packet, if macroprudential tools had already proven reliable and fully effective at curtailing financial instability, there would be little need to consider using monetary policy to address financial instability concerns.	94.0	999.0
201604	26	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Other things being equal, it would be better not to charge monetary policy with additional goals beyond those specified in its dual mandate, but instead to allow macroprudential tools, if effective, to address financial instability.	94.0	999.0
201604	27	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	We briefly summarize research on the efficacy of cyclical macroprudential tools in the balance of this exhibit.	94.0	999.0
201604	28	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Developed economies have typically chosen not to use monetary policy to address financial stability concerns.	94.0	999.0
201604	29	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Instead, they have often used housing-related macroprudential tools—notably, loan-to-value, or LTV, and debt- service-to-income caps.	94.0	999.0
201604	30	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Mark Carey’s memo examines the effects of such policies in eight advanced foreign economies, or AFEs, and concludes that the effects on borrowing, while mixed, are somewhat hopeful.	94.0	999.0
201604	31	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Those countries that put in place LTV caps saw a decline in LTVs for newly originated loans—you sort of hope that at least that much happens.	94.0	999.0
201604	32	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Reductions in LTVs likely reduced losses to banks, improving somewhat the resilience of the system.	94.0	999.0
201604	33	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	The effect of these caps on the trajectory of house prices is less clear.	94.0	999.0
201604	34	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Exhibit 4 provides some history on LTV caps and house prices.	94.0	999.0
201604	35	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	It displays house prices for four AFEs, indexed to 100 in 2010.	94.0	999.0
201604	36	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	The vertical dashed lines indicate the dates of the implementation or reduction of LTV caps.	94.0	999.0
201604	37	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Spain and Singapore’s LTV caps began in 2000, at the far left side of the chart.	94.0	999.0
201604	38	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	You can see that the imposition of LTV caps in these countries left little near-term imprint on the subsequent trajectory of housing prices.	94.0	999.0
201604	39	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	In countries whose prices turned down, it was either four years later (as in Singapore, the black line) or in the wake of a wrenching financial crisis (as in Spain, the red line)—perhaps not exactly what was hoped for.	94.0	999.0
201604	40	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	It may be that the limited effects of LTV caps to date reflect a too-timid approach, for as long as asset prices are expected to continue rising rapidly, the incentives to continue borrowing are strong.	94.0	999.0
201604	41	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	And the longer and higher prices rise, the greater is the risk of price collapse.	94.0	999.0
201604	42	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	This is why slowing price appreciation is a much-desired goal for macroprudential tools.	94.0	999.0
201604	43	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	In view of current uncertainty about the efficacy of macroprudential tools, we consider whether monetary policy can and should be used to address episodes of emergent financial instability, the subject of your next exhibit.	94.0	999.0
201604	44	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	To do so, policymakers must be able to detect unsustainable increases in debt and asset prices early enough to take preventative action.	94.0	999.0
201604	45	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	They must also have confidence that monetary policy actions of moderate size can have sizable effects on debt accumulation and asset price increases.	94.0	999.0
201604	46	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	I would note that these two challenges are also faced by macroprudential policymakers.	94.0	999.0
201604	47	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	With respect to the first hurdle, recent US history is not encouraging, and neither is longer-term global history.	94.0	999.0
201604	48	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	It is notoriously difficult to identify undesirable combinations of asset price and debt buildup early enough to take preventative action.	94.0	999.0
201604	49	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	The recent experience of this Committee during the buildup to the financial crisis is sobering.	94.0	999.0
201604	50	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	The paper summarizes the results of a little trip down memory lane via the transcripts of FOMC meetings in 2005 and 2006.	94.0	999.0
201604	51	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	I will not dwell further on painful memories.	94.0	999.0
201604	52	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	With respect to the second hurdle, typical estimates of the elasticities linking the federal funds rate to, say, house prices or household debt appear to be relatively small.	94.0	999.0
201604	53	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	This implies that only large movements in monetary instruments would have sizable effects on the evolution of these key variables.	94.0	999.0
201604	54	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	And our confidence about policy’s effects is especially low during a credit boom or bubble period—how will bubbles respond to a change in fundamentals?	94.0	999.0
201604	55	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	It’s hard to know.	94.0	999.0
201604	56	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Whether monetary policy should address financial instability depends in part on how much such actions are estimated to reduce the probability of a crisis and its severity, should it occur.	94.0	999.0
201604	57	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	But these benefits must be balanced against the potential for monetary policy to inflict collateral damage on the rest of the economy while seeking to mitigate financial instability.	94.0	999.0
201604	58	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	As indicated at the bottom of this exhibit, employing a conventional model, Lars Svensson finds that in almost no case does a monetary policy that leans against the winds of financial instability do more good than harm.	94.0	999.0
201604	59	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	We need more research to assess these tradeoffs, but what we know today suggests we might want to tread lightly in using monetary policy to lean against the winds of financial instability.	94.0	999.0
201604	60	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	As discussed in exhibit 6, because both monetary policy and at least some macroprudential tools are likely to remain in the toolkit for US policymakers, we need to consider the interactions between the two sets of tools and their policymaking bodies.	94.0	999.0
201604	61	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Arguably, the longer-run goals of both policies coincide, although the short- run goals differ, and, of course, the tools differ.	94.0	999.0
201604	62	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	It is clear that monetary policymakers at the least need to take into account the effects that macroprudential policies might have on employment and inflation.	94.0	999.0
201604	63	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Similarly, macroprudential policymakers need to take into account the effect that interest rate policy may have on risk-taking, borrowing, and asset price appreciation.	94.0	999.0
201604	64	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	As illustrated in the diagram on this exhibit, in view of the potential for multiple rounds of feedback—note the primary policy effects that are indicated by the red arrows and the secondary effects indicated by the yellow arrows—a closer coordination of policies might avoid arm’s- length policymaking that ignores or only partially captures the implications of these feedbacks.	94.0	999.0
201604	65	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Institutional implications of these interactions are addressed in your next exhibit, exhibit 7.	94.0	999.0
201604	66	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Whether monetary and macroprudential policy should be set by the same or different committees, within the same institution or not, and what the makeup of those committees should be are the subjects of much recent discussion.	94.0	999.0
201604	67	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	As indicated in the middle of the exhibit, the United Kingdom employs a structure in which two separate committees set monetary and macroprudential policy, but with fairly close coordination.	94.0	999.0
201604	68	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	They sit in the same building, and there is high-level overlap in membership across the committees.	94.0	999.0
201604	69	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Whatever the structure, it seems likely that strong cooperation would be beneficial.	94.0	999.0
201604	70	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Exhibit 8 discusses what to conclude.	94.0	999.0
201604	71	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	In light of uncertainty about the effectiveness of macroprudential policies, we should consider the use of monetary policy to address financial instability.	94.0	999.0
201604	72	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	However, because it would add another potentially conflicting goal, because recognition of instability is difficult, because the effects of monetary policy on asset prices and borrowing during a boom are uncertain, and because the collateral damage may well outweigh the benefits, we suggest relying least on monetary policy for addressing financial-stability concerns.	94.0	999.0
201604	73	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	The first order of business is to make the financial system as resilient as possible, and we hope before facing another episode of financial instability.	94.0	999.0
201604	74	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Macroprudential tools could then be the primary targeted and time-varying approach to slow the buildup of financial imbalances and lower the risk of a crisis.	94.0	999.0
201604	75	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	But, as the exhibit notes, we need to do more to improve our confidence in employing macroprudential tools.	94.0	999.0
201604	76	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Your final exhibit provides a to-do list to that end.	94.0	999.0
201604	77	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	It includes expanding the available set of macroprudential tools, shortening the implementation lags of such tools where possible, adding to extant research on the effectiveness of tools and new transmission channels, considering better coordination of monetary and macroprudential policies, assessing the potential for regulatory arbitrage, and developing strategies to mitigate it.	94.0	999.0
201604	78	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Effective implementation of many of these tools may also require greater independence of macroprudential regulators.	94.0	999.0
201604	79	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	This is indeed a formidable set of tasks.	94.0	999.0
201604	80	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Tobias will now discuss “Financial Vulnerability and Monetary Policy:  The Empirical Evidence.”	94.0	999.0
201604	81	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Thanks, Jeff.	94.0	999.0
201604	82	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	I will now speak about the empirical evidence of financial vulnerability in the risk-taking channel of monetary policy.	94.0	999.0
201604	83	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	This presentation is based on work with Nina Boyarchenko, Richard Crump, and Matthew Plosser, all from the New York Fed.	94.0	999.0
201604	84	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Exhibit 1 explains two views of the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability.	94.0	999.0
201604	85	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	One view is that monetary policy and financial stability are separate.	94.0	999.0
201604	86	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	In that view, the transmission of monetary policy is via the expected path of interest rates.	94.0	999.0
201604	87	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Policy rate expectations capture all financial market information, and risk premiums are either constant or move around exogenously.	94.0	999.0
201604	88	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Another view is that monetary policy transmission and financial stability interact.	94.0	999.0
201604	89	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	In that view, monetary policy influences risk-taking of financial intermediaries.	94.0	999.0
201604	90	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Risk-taking, in turn, influences financial conditions and vulnerabilities.	94.0	999.0
201604	91	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Financial vulnerabilities matter for the macroeconomy, particularly for the downside risks to the dual mandate.	94.0	999.0
201604	92	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	This second view is the risk-taking channel of monetary policy transmission.	94.0	999.0
201604	93	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	We review the existing evidence of this channel and present some new evidence.	94.0	999.0
201604	94	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Before reviewing the so-called risk-taking channel of monetary policy, I will start by reviewing financial stability considerations in the credit channel of monetary policy on exhibit 2.	94.0	999.0
201604	95	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	In the traditional credit channel of monetary policy transmission, a lower short-term policy interest rate spurs lending and spending.	94.0	999.0
201604	96	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	The credit channel features an amplification mechanism beyond the interest rate channel but does not incorporate risk-taking or vulnerabilities of financial institutions.	94.0	999.0
201604	97	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Empirically, based on a data set spanning 16 advanced economies over 140 years, Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor find sizable responses to lower short-term policy interest rates of credit and house prices.	94.0	999.0
201604	98	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Furthermore, credit growth can threaten financial stability.	94.0	999.0
201604	99	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	They estimate that credit growth one standard deviation above its sample mean is associated with a reduction in the level of real GDP by 3 percent.	94.0	999.0
201604	100	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	These costs of activity might suggest interest rates should be raised preemptively to slow credit or housing prices.	94.0	999.0
201604	101	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	However, increasing interest rates preemptively to slow credit or house price growth potentially comes at the cost of distorting the dual-mandate objectives.	94.0	999.0
201604	102	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Svensson argues that such costs of leaning against the wind always outweigh the benefits.	94.0	999.0
201604	103	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	But Svensson’s calculations do not allow for the risk-taking channel of monetary policy—the focus of our memo.	94.0	999.0
201604	104	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Exhibit 3 explains the three key features of the risk-taking channel of monetary policy.	94.0	999.0
201604	105	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	First, monetary policy influences the risk-taking of financial institutions.	94.0	999.0
201604	106	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Risk-taking, in turn, determines leverage and maturity transformation, which are vulnerabilities for the system.	94.0	999.0
201604	107	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Second, risk premiums are endogenous and time varying.	94.0	999.0
201604	108	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Put differently, the pricing of risk determines financial conditions.	94.0	999.0
201604	109	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Third, endogenous risk-taking increases downside risks to real activity.	94.0	999.0
201604	110	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Hence, financial vulnerabilities create risks to the dual mandate.	94.0	999.0
201604	111	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Exhibit 4 presents the existing evidence on the risk-taking channel, which relates the stance of monetary policy to the risk-taking of financial intermediaries.	94.0	999.0
201604	112	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	A number of studies have examined different dimensions of risk-taking, finding that US banks ease lending standards and charge smaller premiums to riskier borrowers during periods of easy monetary policy; a similar result has been found for European banks.	94.0	999.0
201604	113	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Ex ante risk-taking as measured by the risk-rating of the bank’s new loans is negatively associated with increases in short-term policy interest rates.	94.0	999.0
201604	114	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Furthermore, balance sheets of nonbank financial intermediaries tend to expand when monetary policy is expansionary.	94.0	999.0
201604	115	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	In sum, existing empirical evidence shows that looser monetary policy increases financial intermediaries’ risk-taking.	94.0	999.0
201604	116	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	We next turn to additional evidence from financial markets.	94.0	999.0
201604	117	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Exhibit 5 presents evidence that monetary policy announcements are associated with significant increases in financial market volatility.	94.0	999.0
201604	118	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	The figure shows the variability of financial indicators on FOMC announcement days in red triangles and the variability on all other days in blue circles.	94.0	999.0
201604	119	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	The x-axis indicates the specific financial indicators, while the y-axis presents the variability as measured by the average absolute two-day change in units of standard deviations.	94.0	999.0
201604	120	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	The first two indicators, the ACM path and the BHP path, represent estimates of the expected near-term path of policy.	94.0	999.0
201604	121	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	The third and fourth indicators, the ACM and the BHP term premiums, show metrics pertaining to Treasury term premiums.	94.0	999.0
201604	122	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	They indicate that variability of the expected path and of term premiums is significantly higher on FOMC announcement days.	94.0	999.0
201604	123	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	The fifth and sixth indicators show the variability of the equity market return and that of the bank stock return.	94.0	999.0
201604	124	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	In these cases, there is not significantly higher variability.	94.0	999.0
201604	125	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	The seventh and last indicator is equity market implied volatility as measured by the VIX.	94.0	999.0
201604	126	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	In addition, in the memo we show that variability is significantly higher even after controlling for news about monetary policy.	94.0	999.0
201604	127	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Exhibit 6 provides background on our thinking about financial vulnerability.	94.0	999.0
201604	128	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	We use a measure of vulnerability called CoVaR.	94.0	999.0
201604	129	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	CoVaR is defined as the value-at-risk of the financial system conditional on the distress of a particular financial institution.	94.0	999.0
201604	130	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	CoVaR as a summary measure is correlated strongly with measures of leverage, maturity transformation and liquidity transformation, as well as other measures of vulnerability.	94.0	999.0
201604	131	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Financial vulnerabilities are amplification mechanisms that can generate systemic risk, defined as the risk that the intermediation capacity of the financial system as a whole becomes impaired.	94.0	999.0
201604	132	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Exhibit 7 summarizes our main empirical results from regressions of two-day bank equity returns on an announcement-day dummy, a measure of changes in the expected path of interest rates, a measure of the term premium, CoVaR, and associated interaction terms.	94.0	999.0
201604	133	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Our empirical approach exploits differential cross- sectional variation in asset prices—here, bank equity returns—around FOMC announcements relative to non-announcement days.	94.0	999.0
201604	134	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Monetary policy announcements significantly affect the performance of bank equity returns, and even more so for firms with higher CoVaR.	94.0	999.0
201604	135	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	A 25 basis point increase in the expected path of interest rates on an FOMC announcement day, on average, lowers bank equity returns 36 to 50 basis points.	94.0	999.0
201604	136	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	A 15 percent increase in the term premium risk on an FOMC announcement day lowers bank equity returns 8 to 13 basis points.	94.0	999.0
201604	137	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Comparing the most vulnerable with the least vulnerable banks, the decline in returns in response to either a higher expected path of interest rates or a higher term premium is 20 to 24 percent larger than for more vulnerable banks.	94.0	999.0
201604	138	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Our results thus show that there is significant interaction between monetary policy announcements, the evolution of term premiums, and the performance of relatively vulnerable institutions.	94.0	999.0
201604	139	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Let me conclude on exhibit 8.	94.0	999.0
201604	140	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	The empirical evidence that I presented today is consistent with the risk-taking channel of monetary policy transmission.	94.0	999.0
201604	141	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Easier policy increases risk-taking, compresses risk premiums, and thus could create financial sector vulnerabilities.	94.0	999.0
201604	142	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	These findings suggest further work to quantify the effect of risk-taking on downside risk to the dual mandate.	94.0	999.0
201604	143	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Incorporating the risk- taking channel in macroeconomic models might change the tradeoff regarding preemptive moves in interest rates.	94.0	999.0
201604	144	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Next, Jae Sim will talk about such macroeconomic models in the presentation “Monetary Policy and Financial Stability: Lessons from DSGE Models.”	94.0	999.0
201604	145	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	Thank you, Tobias.	94.0	999.0
201604	146	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	As highlighted in exhibit 1, the central question of our memo, written with coauthors Bora Durdu and Matthias Paustian, is what advice a range of DSGE models have to offer about the appropriate response of monetary policy to financial imbalances.	94.0	999.0
201604	147	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	The literature has offered a range of perspectives, highlighted in exhibit 2.	94.0	999.0
201604	148	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	One strand emphasizes the idea that various frictions in credit markets lead to inefficient saving and investment decisions and may contribute to excessive volatility in employment or inflation, calling for a role for monetary policy to lean against excessive credit fluctuations.	94.0	999.0
201604	149	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	This view is often rationalized with the notion that monetary policy transmission partly involves changes in bank risk-taking.	94.0	999.0
201604	150	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	The second bullet of exhibit 2 illustrates one example of how the risk-taking channel works.	94.0	999.0
201604	151	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	Low interest rates may tilt the capital structure of banks toward more debt, which then gives banks an incentive to choose riskier projects, as the higher leverage increases the value of banks’ default option.	94.0	999.0
201604	152	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	If credit expansion is accompanied by increased spending and inflation, a central bank pursuing conventional dual-mandate goals automatically stabilizes the financial system.	94.0	999.0
201604	153	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	However, such divine coincidence may not exist in reality.	94.0	999.0
201604	154	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	While a blunt tool, monetary policy may “get in all the cracks.”	94.0	999.0
201604	155	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	Accordingly, monetary policy should react to a measure of financial imbalances, such as the credit-to-GDP gap or credit spreads.	94.0	999.0
201604	156	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	However, the increase in interest rates required to curb risk-taking may be greater than what is needed to attain price stability and maximum employment.	94.0	999.0
201604	157	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	Exhibit 3 highlights some of the factors weighing against the use of monetary policy to lean against financial imbalances, including the issue of coordination with macroprudential policies.	94.0	999.0
201604	158	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	In many DSGE models, monetary policy is an indirect tool with which to address the underlying microeconomic distortions leading to inefficiency.	94.0	999.0
201604	159	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	Depending on the source of inefficiency, macroprudential tools may more directly affect the underlying distortion.	94.0	999.0
201604	160	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	For example, distortions related to inefficient leverage of financial institutions may be addressed more directly through capital requirements, and the presence of robust, countercyclical capital requirements may eliminate the role for monetary policy, as stressed by Collard, Dellas, Diba, and Loisel.	94.0	999.0
201604	161	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	These authors also show how the combination of monetary and macroprudential policies can improve economic outcomes, a topic I will touch on later.	94.0	999.0
201604	162	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	A central challenge confronting the use of monetary policy to lean against financial imbalances is the measurement of the relevant imbalance, the topic of exhibit 4.	94.0	999.0
201604	163	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	DSGE models differ in the imbalances they emphasize.	94.0	999.0
201604	164	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	Even focusing on an individual imbalance, such as the ratio of nonfinancial credit to GDP, raises difficulties.	94.0	999.0
201604	165	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	The figure shows that real-time estimates of the credit-to-GDP gap, shown by the green line, can substantially differ from the final estimate, shown by the purple line, indicating the risk that any attempt of monetary policy to “lean against the wind” may be informed by noisy and imperfect assessments.	94.0	999.0
201604	166	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	Of course, this issue also applies equally to the measurement of resource utilization in the pursuit of conventional monetary policy goals.	94.0	999.0
201604	167	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	So far, my discussion has been largely qualitative, in line with much of the literature.	94.0	999.0
201604	168	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	Our memo emphasized some of the quantitative lessons from the literature through simulations of a model I developed with Michael Kiley.	94.0	999.0
201604	169	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	As highlighted in exhibit 5, in this model, financial intermediaries choose their leverage ratio in a manner that maximizes their own profits but fails to take into account the social costs imposed by these choices.	94.0	999.0
201604	170	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	Importantly for our purposes, the model is estimated and contains many of the features relevant for monetary policy analysis, allowing for a quantitative evaluation of the potential for monetary policy to lean against the credit cycle.	94.0	999.0
201604	171	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	Some of our results are presented in exhibit 6.	94.0	999.0
201604	172	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	The impulse responses of output, hours worked, and inflation show the response of the economy to a reduction in perceived risk facing financial intermediaries.	94.0	999.0
201604	173	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	The black lines, showing essentially no response, represent the efficient outcomes:  Changes in idiosyncratic risk should lead to no movement in the macroeconomy under ideal conditions because diversification would insulate the economy from such idiosyncratic factors in the absence of inefficiencies in financial markets.	94.0	999.0
201604	174	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	However, a credit boom follows the shock under a standard inertial Taylor rule approach to monetary policy, as shown in the blue lines.	94.0	999.0
201604	175	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	Augmenting the monetary policy strategy with a term reacting to the credit-to-GDP ratio, shown by the red lines, helps stabilize the credit cycle and limit the fluctuations in the labor market and inflation that otherwise would ensue.	94.0	999.0
201604	176	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	As we emphasized in the memo, not all, and probably not even the majority, of fluctuations in credit reflect inefficiencies—rather, credit fluctuations are due importantly to the savings and investment choices of firms and households trying to manage the time profile of consumption, the adoption of new technologies, and other factors.	94.0	999.0
201604	177	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	As a result, the quantitative importance of a role for monetary policy in leaning against the wind depends on the relative importance of different factors.	94.0	999.0
201604	178	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	The figure in exhibit 7 summarizes the overall performance of the economy under monetary policy approaches that do not lean against credit and those that do lean against credit, as implied by the model.	94.0	999.0
201604	179	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	More complicated analyses that take account of the full range of shocks that can hit the economy find that, if the optimal monetary policy already responds to output, inflation, and the lagged funds rate, there’s little to be gained in terms of improved macroeconomic performances by adding the credit- to-GDP ratio to the rule.	94.0	999.0
201604	180	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	This is in stark contrast to the Ramsey allocations shown at the bottom.	94.0	999.0
201604	181	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	The Ramsey allocation with only a monetary policy instrument, shown by the green dot, achieves a significant efficiency gain.	94.0	999.0
201604	182	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	As shown by the red dot, with an additional macroprudential instrument implemented by a time-varying leverage tax, the planner achieves even greater efficiency gain.	94.0	999.0
201604	183	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	Such large efficiency gains are feasible when the planner directly responds to driving sources of credit cycles, distinguishing inefficient credit cycles from efficient ones, but may not be achieved when a monetary policy rule reacts to endogenous fluctuations in the credit- to-GDP ratio.	94.0	999.0
201604	184	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	As I mentioned earlier, the types of inefficiencies emphasized in DSGE models often point to a role for macroprudential policies.	94.0	999.0
201604	185	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	Earlier, Jeff Fuhrer reviewed some of the resulting coordination issues.	94.0	999.0
201604	186	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	The DSGE literature has also confronted these issues, and I discuss a sample of this literature on your final exhibit.	94.0	999.0
201604	187	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	De Paoli and Paustian study a setting in which separate institutions conduct monetary and macroprudential policies, respectively, and each institution is assigned only a subset of the stabilization objectives that are relevant for welfare.	94.0	999.0
201604	188	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	They identify three circumstances in which the coordination problem can be made less severe:  First, when both authorities have effective instruments, the monetary authority can operate independently, taking as given macroprudential policymakers’ effective mitigation of credit distortions; second, if both authorities credibly commit to actions in the future; and, third, if the macroprudential authority does not review instrument settings as frequently as the monetary authority, this can take macroprudential tools as fixed in the short run.	94.0	999.0
201604	189	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	However, we note that this literature has not yet reached a strong consensus on these questions.	94.0	999.0
201604	190	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	That concludes our prepared remarks.	94.0	999.0
201604	191	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	We would be happy to answer your questions.	94.0	999.0
201604	192	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	Thank you.	94.0	999.0
201604	193	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for any of our presenters?	94.0	65.0
201604	194	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	94.0	65.0
201604	195	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	88.0
201604	196	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	A question for Jeff.	94.0	88.0
201604	197	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Just to go back to your very first exhibit, exhibit 2.	94.0	88.0
201604	198	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Back in the ’70s there was an event called “Bankhaus Herstatt” that involved missed payments.	94.0	88.0
201604	199	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	And it may have been hyperbole, but at the time, there was concern that the payment system would break down, and it would create a financial instability event.	94.0	88.0
201604	200	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Did you consider payments in thinking about these sort of high-level definitions?	94.0	88.0
201604	201	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	There’s a bit written about that.	94.0	999.0
201604	202	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	We did not spend much time in our memo discussing the possibility of payment-system disruptions, but there are folks who are worried about that.	94.0	999.0
201604	203	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	To date in the United States, I think, that has not been a terrific problem, and around the world, while there are some examples, that has not been nearly as prominent a problem as the accumulation of debt with rising asset prices.	94.0	999.0
201604	204	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	But it’s a fair point, that that is another possible margin of vulnerability.	94.0	999.0
201604	205	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201604	206	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions for the presenters?	94.0	65.0
201604	207	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	94.0	65.0
201604	208	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Jeff in his presentation talked about monetary policy being the “third resort.”	94.0	90.0
201604	209	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would just be interested if each of the paper-givers agree that “third resort” rather than “never” would be your answer.	94.0	90.0
201604	210	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	And if “third resort” would be your answer, what is the most likely scenario in which you think that third resort would actually apply?	94.0	90.0
201604	211	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Somehow I knew Eric was going to ask that question.	94.0	999.0
201604	212	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	[Laughter]	94.0	999.0
201604	213	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	I think one word that I didn’t use during my presentation but is essential to keep in mind is “humility,” in that none of us, I will submit, know exactly how macroprudential tools work, whether circumstances might arise in which monetary policy was the best option available, and how that would work during such an episode of financial instability.	94.0	999.0
201604	214	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	My imagination is fertile enough that I can imagine circumstances in which either we have chosen not to or are unable to pursue what we call our first choice—that is, use cyclical time-varying macroprudential tools—and yet we have identified what we think are troublesome buildups of financial instability.	94.0	999.0
201604	215	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	And if we are constrained in that way, it is conceivable that we would use monetary policy to address it, with due concern to the issues that are raised in the paper and in the briefing.	94.0	999.0
201604	216	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	First, critically, freighting monetary policy with an additional objective that may be competing with its other objectives—we already have tradeoffs to make within the dual mandate—is not to be done lightly.	94.0	999.0
201604	217	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	And the second is—until research overturns this result, if it is found to do so—the possibility for collateral damage or the possibility that modest movements in monetary policy instruments will have little or no effect on the very strong incentives that build up in a financial boom.	94.0	999.0
201604	218	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	Those considerations are to be taken seriously, but if we are so constrained, I can imagine that that’s a resort—not never, but a last resort.	94.0	999.0
201604	219	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	Lars Svensson’s cost-benefit analysis has had a big effect on many people’s thinking on this topic, and one of the things that I learned from reviewing Svensson’s work is that the relative size of the costs and the benefits depends on the magnitude of the shock.	94.0	999.0
201604	220	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	And so what he basically shows is that, when you think that the crisis is very, very large, then actually the costs are relatively higher than the benefits.	94.0	999.0
201604	221	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	But if you think that the crisis is not as large—think about a crisis on the order of an unemployment increase of 5 percentage points versus a crisis on the order of an unemployment increase of 2 or 3 percentage points or something like that—this cost-benefit calculation can flip around.	94.0	999.0
201604	222	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	So, intuitively, the cost is sort of first order.	94.0	999.0
201604	223	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	The distortion of leaning against the wind relative to the dual-mandate objectives today is a first-order cost while the benefit is second order, but when the magnitude of the crisis is not as large, the benefit can actually be larger than the cost.	94.0	999.0
201604	224	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	One point I would make is that this is important in the context of the magnitude of prudential regulation.	94.0	999.0
201604	225	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	If prudential regulation is inadequate, you would think that the tail risk is very large, and hence you don’t want to use monetary policy.	94.0	999.0
201604	226	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	But if prudential policy is actually at a more stringent level so that the tail risk of the financial crisis is smaller, the cost-benefit analysis actually tells you that leaning against the wind is relatively more beneficial, which is somewhat counterintuitive, but that comes directly out of this analysis.	94.0	999.0
201604	227	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	The second point is, our memo basically shows that there’s a tight interlinkage between monetary policy transmission and financial stability topics.	94.0	999.0
201604	228	2016-04-27	meeting	ADRIAN	I think that taking these interlinkages seriously in our thinking about macro models is very important to really understand threats to the downside risks of the dual mandate, along lines similar to the memo that Jae Sim described.	94.0	999.0
201604	229	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	I don’t have completely different views from those of the first two speakers, but I have several points to raise for consideration.	94.0	999.0
201604	230	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	I think it’s possible that the monetary policy interest rate becomes the first, second, or even third resort, but it’s not crystal clear in which direction to use monetary policy to ensure financial stability.	94.0	999.0
201604	231	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	Let me remind you that from the second half of 2004 to the second half of 2006, the Federal Reserve increased the policy rate 450 basis points.	94.0	999.0
201604	232	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	Now, there is some empirical evidence that the increase decelerated the expansion of the balance sheet of the commercial banking sector.	94.0	999.0
201604	233	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	However, there is some evidence that the deceleration in the expansion of commercial banks’ balance sheet caused lending activity to migrate to the unregulated shadow banking sector.	94.0	999.0
201604	234	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	So it is not always clear that the use of an increase in the monetary policy rate will always bring financial stability.	94.0	999.0
201604	235	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	Another reason to think about the use of monetary policy is that, during the period from 2004 to 2006, the increase in interest rates created huge interest rate differentials between different continents, between Europe and the United States and between Japan and the United States.	94.0	999.0
201604	236	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	That really accelerated capital inflow to the US market.	94.0	999.0
201604	237	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	There may be some situations in which you may want to lower the interest rate to fight carry traders whose behavior may enhance financial stability.	94.0	999.0
201604	238	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	So it is not always one direction.	94.0	999.0
201604	239	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	Another point that I want to make is that, in a situation like the current one, raising the interest rate because of financial stability concerns may weaken the credibility of your commitment to the 2 percent inflation target.	94.0	999.0
201604	240	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	That was a substantial concern in Sweden a few years ago.	94.0	999.0
201604	241	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	My last point is that there can be a situation in which monetary policy can be an important tool to achieve financial stability.	94.0	999.0
201604	242	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	That is, when the economy reacts to a shock in a history-dependent way—for instance, if the response of the economy to a given size of the shock depends on the credit history of the economy—then there may be a stronger case for leaning- against-the-wind monetary policy to reduce the tail risk.	94.0	999.0
201604	243	2016-04-27	meeting	SIM	However, that should be empirically tested before it is brought into the actual policy arena.	94.0	999.0
201604	244	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201604	245	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions?	94.0	65.0
201604	246	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	94.0	108.0
201604	247	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	When you sit around discussing a crisis with veterans of crises, which I have done, they all have words of wisdom for you, and the wisdom is typically not “debt is a big problem,” it’s “the problem is leverage.”	94.0	108.0
201604	248	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Do you know how to differentiate between those two and tell us which one is more likely to be correct?	94.0	108.0
201604	249	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	I’ll take a stab at it.	94.0	999.0
201604	250	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	I think the historical evidence says that, yes, leverage certainly matters.	94.0	999.0
201604	251	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	So having really risky leverage ratios, borrowing a whole bunch against an asset whose price can fluctuate significantly, that is the problem.	94.0	999.0
201604	252	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	I think that’s fair.	94.0	999.0
201604	253	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	If the leverage ratios weren’t so troubling and there was some borrowing and the asset price moved, perhaps we wouldn’t get into quite as much trouble.	94.0	999.0
201604	254	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	I think that’s a fair distinction to make.	94.0	999.0
201604	255	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	That said, when assets prices are increasing rapidly, the historical evidence of the past eight centuries or possibly more is that concern for leverage ratios tends to go out the door because, after all, that ratio is going to look better, and the coverage of the asset price is going to look better next year and the year after and the year after.	94.0	999.0
201604	256	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	That’s the historical experience, and we seemed very capable of getting ourselves into that kind of trouble.	94.0	999.0
201604	257	2016-04-27	meeting	FUHRER	But your distinction is fair, and if you were to observe that the leverage was not as severe, that might not portend as serious a problem.	94.0	999.0
201604	258	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	94.0	108.0
201604	259	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	94.0	108.0
201604	260	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	94.0	65.0
201604	261	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we begin our go-round.	94.0	65.0
201604	262	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	There are some discussion questions that were circulated, but I look forward to your comments.	94.0	65.0
201604	263	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s begin with Governor Tarullo.	94.0	65.0
201604	264	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	97.0
201604	265	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	In the past, President Evans has noted that answering the questions posed by the staff in a special topic discussion is a rookie mistake.	94.0	97.0
201604	266	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	94.0	97.0
201604	267	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	So, while I do want to begin this discussion by addressing those questions, I’m going to be careful not to answer them, and instead I am going to question some of the premises that lie behind the first question and then underscore the importance of the direction in which I think the second question leads us, albeit with some modifications in that premise as well.	94.0	97.0
201604	268	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	The first point is, I would take some issue as a factual matter with the assertion in the first question that there is an emerging consensus that macroprudential instruments are the primary means through which policymakers should address financial stability issues.	94.0	97.0
201604	269	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	In purely numerical terms, there may be a majority for this view, especially among long-time monetary policy economists, but there are quite a few other voices, some of whom have been cited by Tobias and Jae in their presentations today, who I think would argue for a considerably more important role for monetary policy in protecting financial stability.	94.0	97.0
201604	270	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	So I would urge people to pay attention to the nuance in the presentations that were given today and in the background papers.	94.0	97.0
201604	271	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I do resist this notion of a consensus.	94.0	97.0
201604	272	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Maybe it’s true numerically.	94.0	97.0
201604	273	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	But that’s not a consensus, that’s just a majority.	94.0	97.0
201604	274	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think it sweeps aside important questions that have been raised in the background memos.	94.0	97.0
201604	275	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Having said that, I do want to reinforce the suggestion that is implicit in the second question:  The FOMC should be considering, in a somewhat systematic way, how we might respond to specific circumstances in the world as we find it—not in our idealized world, but in the world as we find it—where we could face some difficult tradeoffs between traditional monetary policy goals, or at least monetary policy goals as they’ve been traditionally understood, and financial stability.	94.0	97.0
201604	276	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Let me say at the outset that while I resist the premise that a consensus has emerged on the conceptual issues pertaining to monetary policy and financial stability, I myself don’t, at present, hold a position on the other side of that purported consensus.	94.0	97.0
201604	277	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	It’s just that I think the issues bear considerably more discussion, including how they may relate to our overall conduct of ongoing monetary policy and not just a few decisions in a few discrete moments.	94.0	97.0
201604	278	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Let me also say that I’m not going to try to cover a lot of issues, like the importance of building ex ante resiliency in the financial system, the effect of global capital flows on financial stability, the limited value of precedents provided by countries in which financial intermediation is predominantly bank-centered when thinking about the US position, and the very real constitutional, legal, and political factors that could be raised by the creation of new policy instruments.	94.0	97.0
201604	279	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I’ve got enough to say just on the narrower issues as it is.	94.0	97.0
201604	280	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	In trying to explain why I find myself reacting against that premise in the first question, I did find myself thinking about why I’ve thought what I regard as a kind of conventional monetary policymaker’s response to financial stability is an incomplete or perhaps premature one.	94.0	97.0
201604	281	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I want to try, at the risk, obviously, of some oversimplification, to characterize that response.	94.0	97.0
201604	282	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	This is not being imputed to the staff or the memos.	94.0	97.0
201604	283	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I think you’ve all heard a variant on what I’m about to say.	94.0	97.0
201604	284	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	That response is composed of, I think, four or five parts.	94.0	97.0
201604	285	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	One, monetary policy is too blunt a tool to counteract asset price bubbles because it would adversely affect other parts of the economy.	94.0	97.0
201604	286	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Two, indeed, the amount of monetary policy tightening that would be needed to counteract asset bubbles by the time they develop would be so substantial as to risk bringing economic growth to a screeching halt.	94.0	97.0
201604	287	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, therefore, three, supervisory and other regulatory tools should be relied on.	94.0	97.0
201604	288	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, finally, four, if serious financial stress or a full-blown crisis nonetheless occurs, then monetary policy can be brought to bear to try to mitigate its effects.	94.0	97.0
201604	289	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	A variant on this position is that monetary policy may be held in reserve as a “last resort” if financial stability risks are high enough and other tools are ineffective.	94.0	97.0
201604	290	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	What I’m now about to do is to give you just a partial and only a suggestive list of some of the reasons why I do find the position I’ve just characterized—or caricatured, depending on your perspective—less than fully satisfying.	94.0	97.0
201604	291	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	But let me again emphasize that it’s quite possible I would emerge from the kind of analytic exercise I’m suggesting with a similar view that monetary policy actions explicitly for financial stability purposes might be the unusual rather than regular case.	94.0	97.0
201604	292	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	First, I think the position as I just stated it rather elides the important question of whether monetary policy has itself been an important contributor to the buildup of financial stability risks.	94.0	97.0
201604	293	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, as was evident in the background memo, the models traditionally associated with monetary policy gave very little independent significance to the financial system, to the apparently asynchronous nature of business and credit cycles, and to other salient factors.	94.0	97.0
201604	294	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Indeed, this is slightly unfair.	94.0	97.0
201604	295	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	It’s hard to escape the observation that the traditional monetary policy view failed to see the seriousness of the risks building 11, 12, and 13 years ago.	94.0	97.0
201604	296	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	For example, one might at least ask the question whether the failure of accommodative monetary policy to effect significant improvement in economic growth and employment in the absence of inflation may sometimes be due to an absence of sufficient numbers of promising projects to increase capacity and the consequent diversion of abundant liquidity into asset markets rather than toward increasing productive capacity or innovation.	94.0	97.0
201604	297	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Such metrics as historically high asset value levels, substantial increases in the amount of credit extended in the economy, and the increasing leverage of financial intermediaries could buttress such a case.	94.0	97.0
201604	298	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Second, and related, is the more basic question of how monetary policy is transmitted in the first place.	94.0	97.0
201604	299	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	The background memo did a very nice job, and Tobias Adrian underscored some of this today in drawing our attention to the distinctions between New Keynesian and risk-taking channels’ transmission mechanisms for monetary policy.	94.0	97.0
201604	300	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Those favoring a dominantly New Keynesian model will understandably see less likelihood both of monetary policy contributing to financial stability risks and to its efficacy in counteracting them.	94.0	97.0
201604	301	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	But if a risk-taking channel is an important transmission mechanism, one’s conclusions may be different.	94.0	97.0
201604	302	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Our former colleague Jeremy Stein continues to churn out interesting papers that give increasing credence to variations on this view.	94.0	97.0
201604	303	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Here I take note of the fact that the traditional view tends always to find the cost of monetary policy adjustments made for financial-stability reasons to be higher than its benefits—this is the Svensson hypothesis that Tobias Adrian was talking about—by assigning a very low probability of a financial crisis at any point in time.	94.0	97.0
201604	304	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	But if the buildup of financial stability risk is substantially endogenous to monetary policy, this argument for rejecting monetary policy as a financial stability tool becomes less persuasive.	94.0	97.0
201604	305	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Third, and even more foundational, is the question of whether the secular increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio since World War II, whatever its causal relationship to slowing potential economic growth, may warrant an evolution in how we think about monetary policy, particularly because credit booms tend to be followed by deeper recessions and slower recoveries, and particularly if we believe we may be facing a prolonged period of slower economic growth and low productivity gains.	94.0	97.0
201604	306	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	These last two points have been examples of how thinking about financial stability may not be the addition of a new policy aim, but instead something which is inherent in and important to the traditional dual mandate.	94.0	97.0
201604	307	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Fourth, the relatively easy answer of the traditional view that other tools should be relied on not only glosses over the important question as to whether those tools exist, but also the question of how effective they might be even if we had them.	94.0	97.0
201604	308	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I do think it plausible that macroprudential tools directed at real estate lending could be effective in some circumstances, putting aside for the moment the important questions of who should have those tools and whether they would be wisely used.	94.0	97.0
201604	309	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	But this view is based on the unusual characteristics of real estate lending, including the term of mortgage instruments, the relative illiquidity of its collateral, and its simple pervasiveness.	94.0	97.0
201604	310	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, of course, with the large fraction of mortgage credit extended by nonbanks, an effective policy instrument would have to apply to mortgage lending from all sources.	94.0	97.0
201604	311	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	My suspicion is that whatever one’s conclusions on the broader issues I am raising now, there will be a pretty good theoretical case to be made for something along the lines of macroprudential instruments for real estate lending.	94.0	97.0
201604	312	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Whether our political circumstances and legal system can comfortably accommodate it is another story entirely.	94.0	97.0
201604	313	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	On the other hand, it does not seem at all clear to me that other assets are so segmented and thus susceptible to targeted measures.	94.0	97.0
201604	314	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	That is, I suspect that to some degree taking steps against some perceived asset bubbles will be rather like squeezing on a water balloon.	94.0	97.0
201604	315	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	The liquid will simply slosh around to another part of the balloon unless you squeeze hard enough to burst the whole thing.	94.0	97.0
201604	316	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	The question of whether asset markets other than real estate are sufficiently segmented as to be managed through targeted sectoral or other measures is a very important one and one that I think, up to this point, has been underresearched.	94.0	97.0
201604	317	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	If the answer is generally negative, then the only macroprudential measures that are likely to work would be something akin to interest rates, such as taxes on widely used funding channels.	94.0	97.0
201604	318	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Another relevant point here is that when traditionalists concede that monetary policy might be used as a last resort, they cannot mean that in a purely temporal sense.	94.0	97.0
201604	319	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	If there really is a buildup of highly intermediated credit supporting unsustainable asset prices, waiting until it’s clear nothing else has worked would indeed likely require huge interest rate jumps to have an effect.	94.0	97.0
201604	320	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Imagine waiting until late 2006 and then saying, “Well, nothing else has worked, maybe it’s time to try monetary policy.”	94.0	97.0
201604	321	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	It would actually, of course, have led to exactly the wrong monetary policy response at that moment in time.	94.0	97.0
201604	322	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	It seems quite likely to me that if monetary policy is to be used effectively without risk of substantial, unnecessary collateral damage, it will need to be used earlier rather than later, when its signaling effects may help have an effect beyond what our models suggest a 25 or 50 basis point increase would have.	94.0	97.0
201604	323	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Turning now much more briefly to the second question posed by the staff, I very much want to reinforce the importance of asking ourselves how we would approach the question of whether and how monetary policy decisions should be affected by the financial stability considerations mentioned today well in advance of a time—unlike, in my view, the present moment—when that issue may be highly relevant.	94.0	97.0
201604	324	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	The staff question implies that we should do this because the optimal macroprudential tools may not be available.	94.0	97.0
201604	325	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I would reserve judgment on that point.	94.0	97.0
201604	326	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Indeed, I think the exercise itself may help inform our understanding of some of the more foundational questions to which I have alluded.	94.0	97.0
201604	327	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	While everyone is entitled to her or his opinion on what statutory changes may be desirable, I think our first responsibility lies in considering how we would execute the powerful but limited statutory tool that the Congress gave the FOMC, taking the world as it is at that moment rather than how we would like it to be, just as we do with fiscal or other economic policies that some or all of us might prefer to be different than they are.	94.0	97.0
201604	328	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Obviously, there’s a subset of the FOMC—to wit, the members of the Board—that has a different set of tools, and we presumably would be in a position to communicate to the FOMC what our actions and intentions are.	94.0	97.0
201604	329	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	But even then the communication channels may not be perfect, because there are other parts of the government that have other tools that may be disinclined to as much communication and perhaps even more disinclined to cooperation.	94.0	97.0
201604	330	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think those are all reasons why we need to hypothesize that we’re not going to be in a textbook situation, but instead one that has substantial frictions in the perception of what’s going on and the implementation of policy.	94.0	97.0
201604	331	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think we can do full justice to this responsibility in a single discussion today, so I would suggest more of an ongoing project involving work by Governor Fischer’s and President Rosengren’s financial stability committees—sorry, guys, I didn’t let you know beforehand I was going to suggest this.	94.0	97.0
201604	332	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think we might profitably begin with a retrospective view of an actual decision point rather than a hypothetical view of a future one.	94.0	97.0
201604	333	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	My candidate would be sometime during 2003 when inflation was quiescent, the economy was taking quite a while to recover from what had been only a mild recession, but when prices and leverage across a wide range of assets, not just real estate, were already well into the high end of historical ranges.	94.0	97.0
201604	334	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Gaming out the optimal response at that time could be a very useful heuristic exercise in preparing for a parallel moment in the future when sluggish economic growth and low inflation coexist with rapidly rising asset prices and credit and leverage extension.	94.0	97.0
201604	335	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	97.0
201604	336	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	94.0	65.0
201604	337	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	94.0	65.0
201604	338	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	90.0
201604	339	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I want to thank the Chair and the Vice Chairman for placing this topic on the agenda and the staff for their very thorough briefing papers on the subject.	94.0	90.0
201604	340	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’ll only discuss the questions posed to us now and will discuss some more specific concerns in the financial stability discussion later in the agenda.	94.0	90.0
201604	341	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	To the first question, do we have the right tools or governance to address financial stability concerns?	94.0	90.0
201604	342	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	As the staff papers discussed, financial instability has tended to occur when there is significant borrowing against an asset whose value has declined substantially.	94.0	90.0
201604	343	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Financial instability, both domestically and internationally, has been most commonly associated with real estate assets, either residential or commercial.	94.0	90.0
201604	344	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	As a result, many emerging economies and, increasingly, many developed economies, have used loan-to-value and debt-to-income caps as their main macroprudential tools, as Mark’s paper discussed.	94.0	90.0
201604	345	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	For example, in 2014, the Bank of England Financial Policy Committee set debt-to-income caps to address some of its concerns with escalating prices in real estate markets.	94.0	90.0
201604	346	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The QS report that we will discuss later today does not address these most commonly used tools because the Congress has not given any regulatory body the authority to set such caps across all financial institutions in the United States.	94.0	90.0
201604	347	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Without a direct way to influence levered purchases of real estate across all financial institutions, the Federal Reserve is left with only tools that build resiliency to a real estate price decline over a subset of intermediaries, lending, and real estate markets.	94.0	90.0
201604	348	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The tools that policymakers do have are subject to diffuse governance.	94.0	90.0
201604	349	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because real estate loans are conducted by a wide variety of intermediaries, bank and nonbank, it is unclear that altering regulations that affect only banking organizations will be as effective as might be desired, in view of the potential for regulatory arbitrage.	94.0	90.0
201604	350	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	And any changes, even for banking organizations, require concurrence among bank regulators that have historically not been focused on financial stability concerns.	94.0	90.0
201604	351	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	As a result, there will likely be long delays in implementation and final actions that are heavily compromised compared with original intent.	94.0	90.0
201604	352	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	A good example is the 2006 real estate guidance, which took two years to negotiate and was substantially watered down when it was finally issued.	94.0	90.0
201604	353	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The result was a rather timid response to a period of significantly heightened risk to financial stability.	94.0	90.0
201604	354	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	So my answer to the first question, in short, is “no.”	94.0	90.0
201604	355	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Question two, should financial stability goals affect monetary policy deliberations?	94.0	90.0
201604	356	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Monetary policy tools, both interest rates and our balance sheet, should be focused on our dual mandate.	94.0	90.0
201604	357	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, even this narrow focus can be distorted by actions of others.	94.0	90.0
201604	358	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	For example, both in the United States and most other developed countries, economic policies have been overreliant on monetary policy tools.	94.0	90.0
201604	359	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This is not by choice.	94.0	90.0
201604	360	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Fiscal authorities have chosen to react little to the shocks to the global economy, which has forced monetary policy to extremes to meet its legislated mandates.	94.0	90.0
201604	361	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Had fiscal policy been more aggressively deployed, we might not have seen so many countries at historically low interest rates for such an extended period.	94.0	90.0
201604	362	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Ideally, financial stability concerns would be addressed with supervisory or macroprudential tools, but their effectiveness and our ability to react speedily to building pressures are highly uncertain.	94.0	90.0
201604	363	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Diffuse governance makes their deployment even more difficult.	94.0	90.0
201604	364	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Hence, if macroprudential tools were not used to offset increasing risks of financial instability, I would be left with a dilemma, not unlike the problem we have faced with fiscal policy.	94.0	90.0
201604	365	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The Congress has given the FOMC only the ability to influence interest rates on the balance sheet.	94.0	90.0
201604	366	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If serious financial stability concerns were not being addressed by those who do have financial stability tools to deploy, I would have to consider using monetary policy to address any financial stability concern that could adversely influence the policy of employment and inflation over time.	94.0	90.0
201604	367	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	We might, thus, be forced to address building instability with either somewhat higher interest rates or reducing our balance sheet somewhat more aggressively.	94.0	90.0
201604	368	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	One can certainly argue that a more effective structure is provided by the Bank of England, in which monetary policy, supervisory policy, and financial stability policy are more integrated, and a more comprehensive flow of information occurs between different areas of the bank.	94.0	90.0
201604	369	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Such a structure would likely make the need for using monetary policy to address financial stability concerns much less likely.	94.0	90.0
201604	370	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	90.0
201604	371	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201604	372	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	94.0	65.0
201604	373	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	108.0
201604	374	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’d like to start by thanking the authors of the four papers and all of the other staff who have worked on this project, which was designed— and, on the basis of what the first two speakers said, successfully—to make members of the FOMC think about important policy questions related to financial stability.	94.0	108.0
201604	375	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	And I’d also like to thank the people who provided the expositions today.	94.0	108.0
201604	376	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	The slides are really very, very good.	94.0	108.0
201604	377	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	If I’d only known they were coming, I wouldn’t have had to read the memos.	94.0	108.0
201604	378	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	94.0	108.0
201604	379	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	That’s the problem with good in-class presentations.	94.0	97.0
201604	380	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	94.0	97.0
201604	381	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Most central bankers, when asked whether monetary policy should be used to deal with problems of financial stability, reply that they would prefer to devote monetary policy—defined typically as the monetary policy interest rate, but it could be unconventional policy tools as well—to attaining the major macroeconomic policy goals, which, in our case, are maximum employment and stable inflation.	94.0	108.0
201604	382	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	They go on to say that they would use macroprudential policy tools to deal with potential financial instability.	94.0	108.0
201604	383	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	This, as noted in the fourth paper—in which Mark Carey updated earlier work by David Aikman and others—is how macroprudential policy has been used in and after the Great Recession to deal with incipient financial instability, particularly in the real estate sector, in several mainly small countries.	94.0	108.0
201604	384	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	The financial systems in most of these countries remained reasonably healthy through the Global Financial Crisis.	94.0	108.0
201604	385	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Most of the countries had reduced their interest rates to very low levels during the crisis to prevent large-scale capital inflows they would have faced had they left their interest rates at the levels most suitable for the nontraded sectors of their economies.	94.0	108.0
201604	386	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	But because their interest rates were very low and their financial systems healthy, the demand for housing finance rose rapidly, and the public flocked to take out low interest mortgages.	94.0	108.0
201604	387	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Housing prices rose and continued rising for some time.	94.0	108.0
201604	388	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, what was to be done?	94.0	108.0
201604	389	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	If some financial-sector regulator or regulators had the authority to impose macroprudential measures on housing finance by setting maximum loan-to-value ratios or debt- to-income ratios, or by requiring mortgage lenders to raise the risk rating of mortgages, the authorities could impose such measures.	94.0	108.0
201604	390	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Examples are presented in the fourth paper we received.	94.0	108.0
201604	391	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	These measures appear to have met with mixed results.	94.0	108.0
201604	392	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	In several countries, house prices continued rising rapidly.	94.0	108.0
201604	393	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	But as pointed out by Fuhrer and others, borrowers with a lower LTV ratio have a larger cushion of equity and are therefore protected against subsequent declines in the price of houses.	94.0	108.0
201604	394	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Further, as noted in the Carey paper, some studies have found evidence of effectiveness, and hints are emerging that macroprudential policies can have more effect on vulnerabilities associated with debt volumes and riskiness.	94.0	108.0
201604	395	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, so far so good.	94.0	108.0
201604	396	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	These are cases of countries whose central bank is using the interest rate to attain its macro goals, and some entity, usually the central bank, has the macroprudential tools to deal with resultant threats to financial stability.	94.0	108.0
201604	397	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Presumably, if there were other asset markets behaving in a manner that seemed a threat to financial stability, they could be dealt with via additional macroprudential instruments.	94.0	108.0
201604	398	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	And taken to the limit, all in all, this sounds like the policy literature of an earlier era when a policymaker faced with X goals needs X noncollinear tools to attain them, although, unfortunately, there is one tool missing in this story:  The central banker has only the interest rate through which to influence both inflation and employment.	94.0	108.0
201604	399	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	What if the country doesn’t have a full array of macroprudential measures?	94.0	108.0
201604	400	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	In discussing this question, we need to remind ourselves that we are generally dealing with markets in which lending and borrowing is a central activity, and which are, therefore, to some extent, influenced by changes in the interest rate—that is, by macroeconomic and monetary policy.	94.0	108.0
201604	401	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	What if financial markets generally seem to be overheating and financial instability seems to be threatening to become a macroeconomic problem?	94.0	108.0
201604	402	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	There are at least two reasons why the interest rate could then become the best instrument to deal with the financial stability problem.	94.0	108.0
201604	403	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	First, it may be much more efficient to raise the interest rate than to try to deploy a wide range of macroprudential measures, one aimed at each deviant market, both because managing a wide range of macroprudential measures would require extensive coordination and because the operation of each macroprudential tool certainly also has an effect in other markets.	94.0	108.0
201604	404	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	And so you would be getting into a mess, I believe, of using a lot of instruments when one of them, the interest rate, would suffice to deal with a large part of the difficulties that are causing the financial stability problem.	94.0	108.0
201604	405	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	And the second reason that it may be useful to use the interest rate is that there may be too few macroprudential tools to deal with the generalized financial overheating problem with which the authorities have to contend.	94.0	108.0
201604	406	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	I would, by the way, just like to make an academic point, but I think it’s important even so—I usually think academic points are important.	94.0	108.0
201604	407	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	In footnote 7 on page 5 of their paper, Fuhrer and others state that, “Many developing economies do not enjoy an independent monetary policy to address either macro stabilization or macroprudential concerns.	94.0	108.0
201604	408	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	As a consequence, they have used macroprudential tools much more heavily than have advanced economies.”	94.0	108.0
201604	409	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, in those country cases with which I am familiar, that’s not the story.	94.0	108.0
201604	410	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	It is not that developing economies do not enjoy an independent monetary policy, but rather that they have more macroprudential tools at their disposal than do many of the advanced economies, including the United States, and therefore use these tools more actively.	94.0	108.0
201604	411	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Now, in the case of the United States, the Federal Reserve and even the FSOC have relatively few macroprudential tools.	94.0	108.0
201604	412	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	One solution to that problem has been emphasized by those implementing the Dodd-Frank law:  to strengthen the institutional structure of the financial system as much as possible, for instance, by requiring much higher capital ratios than existed before the crisis, and through a host of other measures with which the regulators and the regulated have been struggling over several years.	94.0	108.0
201604	413	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	That will, no doubt, help a great deal.	94.0	108.0
201604	414	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	This is what the Fuhrer and others paper calls “earthquake” measures—that is, make your buildings stronger so that they can withstand an earthquake.	94.0	108.0
201604	415	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	And, as some have pointed out, stress tests can also, to some extent, be used as macroprudential measures, though I think using them would take probably quite a long time, and they might not be very useful.	94.0	108.0
201604	416	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	But not only do we have few macroprudential measures in the United States to deal with the banking system, we also have very few to deal with the shadow banking system—that is, we have a serious problem.	94.0	108.0
201604	417	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Now, to answer the questions posed by Michael Kiley and others at the beginning of the package of papers we received—it is on page 28 of 28 in today’s handout.	94.0	108.0
201604	418	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Number 1(a):  “No,” policymakers in the United States do not have a sufficiently powerful set of macroprudential tools to ensure financial stability most of the time.	94.0	108.0
201604	419	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	For 1(b):  “Yes,” there is a useful distinction between structural, which are “earthquake” measures, and cyclical, which are called “malaria” measures in the paper—between structural and cyclical tools for dealing with risks.	94.0	108.0
201604	420	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Third, is coordination among US financial regulators potentially a problem in the use of macroprudential tools?	94.0	108.0
201604	421	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think this question was put in just to check whether the reader was awake?	94.0	108.0
201604	422	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	94.0	108.0
201604	423	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	“Yes.”	94.0	108.0
201604	424	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	For 2(a):  I would support using the stance of monetary policy to pursue financial stability goals in the circumstance in which the problem of financial instability is reaching macroeconomic proportions and cannot be addressed with other tools.	94.0	108.0
201604	425	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	I would view such a use as being consistent with the maximization of an expected utility function, dependent only on inflation and output over the course of time.	94.0	108.0
201604	426	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	In other words, we may have to give up some utility in terms of attaining our inflation and output goals today to produce higher utility in the future.	94.0	108.0
201604	427	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	And I find the argument that, well, we would have to raise the interest rate so high to deal with this problem, as quite a complicated and possibly inconsistent one.	94.0	108.0
201604	428	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	What it is saying is, “Yes, we can mop up cheaply.”	94.0	108.0
201604	429	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, we are still trying to mop up cheaply, and we haven’t done it yet.	94.0	108.0
201604	430	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	So I don’t think that the argument, “Well, you can’t do it at some point because it really becomes extremely expensive,” may be a way of keeping us out of political trouble but is not entirely logically correct.	94.0	108.0
201604	431	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	And 2(b) is, “When will we want to do this?”	94.0	108.0
201604	432	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	It is very hard to know today when such policy adjustments would be called for.	94.0	108.0
201604	433	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Most likely they would be called for in relation to problems in housing and real estate markets, and most likely we would be taken by surprise by such an event even after talking about it for a long time.	94.0	108.0
201604	434	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, how can we prepare for future financial instability?	94.0	108.0
201604	435	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	First, by strengthening the structure of the current financial system as the regulators have been doing and have been doing well.	94.0	108.0
201604	436	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Second, I think we have got to recognize some political realities.	94.0	108.0
201604	437	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	There is a line about how the macroprudential regulators should be made independent.	94.0	108.0
201604	438	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	You make independent regulators who are controlling housing and see how long the independence will last.	94.0	108.0
201604	439	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	It’s a very tough problem to be a macroprudential regulator focused on a particular sector, and I am not sure we could rely on that.	94.0	108.0
201604	440	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	You know that in the Bank of England, the Treasury is more represented, I think, in the Financial Policy Committee than in the Monetary Policy Committee, and that’s because they regard it as more of a political issue.	94.0	108.0
201604	441	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	But I think—and this goes along with what Governor Tarullo suggested a few minutes ago—we can prepare for future financial instability by doing research on how to strengthen our existing macroprudential tools, of which we don’t have many, and by asking what other tools we need to add to our collection of policy instruments.	94.0	108.0
201604	442	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	We may not want to have a whole lot of them because I think you then get in a very complicated institutional setting when you decide to change seven instruments in order to stabilize the financial system.	94.0	108.0
201604	443	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	And, as was also emphasized by Dan, we can also prepare by asking what institutional framework the United States economy needs to control the potential instabilities that are present in every modern financial system.	94.0	108.0
201604	444	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	You may say this is all a waste of time, that they are not going to listen to us.	94.0	108.0
201604	445	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	My experience with plans for dealing with future eventualities is, you never get it right.	94.0	108.0
201604	446	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	You never have written a plan that is just exactly ready to be taken off the shelf and put into practice.	94.0	108.0
201604	447	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	But the fact that you did that exercise and asked the questions about how you are going to deal with a variety of plans means that you will deal much better with the next crisis when it comes than if you had just left events to take their course.	94.0	108.0
201604	448	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	108.0
201604	449	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201604	450	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	94.0	65.0
201604	451	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	999.0
201604	452	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	First, I, too, want to thank the authors and the project managers for preparing such a solid set of memos and briefings.	94.0	999.0
201604	453	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	I found them very helpful, and they give us a lot of food for thought.	94.0	999.0
201604	454	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	As the memos articulate, there are a lot of interdependencies between the financial system and the real economy.	94.0	999.0
201604	455	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Moreover, the research and modeling that helps guide our thinking about these interconnections is still being developed.	94.0	999.0
201604	456	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	But the world waits for no one, and it won’t wait for policymakers, so we need to come to some decisions about how we would proceed, in view of our responsibilities for ensuring our dual- mandate monetary policy goals and for promoting financial stability.	94.0	999.0
201604	457	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	I view today’s discussion as a first step toward that.	94.0	999.0
201604	458	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	I would like to suggest that the Committee set itself the goal of working toward a statement articulating the way it will consider financial stability in the context of our statutory responsibilities.	94.0	999.0
201604	459	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	We know from hard experience that getting the needed consensus among participants to produce such a statement can be difficult to achieve.	94.0	999.0
201604	460	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	But even if we end up not publishing something, either as part of our longer-run monetary policy strategy statement or separately, I think working toward such a goal will help drive us to some conclusions.	94.0	999.0
201604	461	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Now, rather than answer the specific questions posed in the staff memo, which I guess, according to President Evans and Governor Tarullo, means I am not a rookie, I am going to make five broad points.	94.0	999.0
201604	462	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Point one, the FOMC cares about financial stability to the extent it affects the health of the real economy.	94.0	999.0
201604	463	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Minor disruptions or volatility in financial markets that represent the ebb and flow of a dynamic economy but do not threaten the health of the economy are not something the FOMC should respond to.	94.0	999.0
201604	464	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	In general, the goals of monetary policy and financial stability are complementary, just like the two goals of our monetary policy dual mandate.	94.0	999.0
201604	465	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	In this, I agree with Governor Tarullo.	94.0	999.0
201604	466	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	However, at times, actions that could be taken to foster financial stability might be in conflict, at least in the short run, with those taken that promote our monetary policy goals, and we need to consider the tradeoffs.	94.0	999.0
201604	467	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	In the United Kingdom, the Financial Services Act recognizes this potential tradeoff and explicitly says that the Financial Policy Committee is not authorized to act in a way that it feels is “likely to have a significant adverse effect on the capacity of the financial sector to contribute to the growth of the UK economy in the medium or long term.”	94.0	999.0
201604	468	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Point two, our experience from the recent financial crisis underscored the importance of creating and maintaining a resilient financial system, one that lowers the probability of instability and that limits the damage when financial shocks arise.	94.0	999.0
201604	469	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	The first memo discusses some of the tools that can be used, including higher capital requirements and liquidity requirements.	94.0	999.0
201604	470	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Living wills and a credible method for resolving failed institutions are very important tools for eliminating moral hazard, and work is being done to implement many of these types of resiliency tools.	94.0	999.0
201604	471	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Point three, incentives matter in all of this—the incentives of the financial institutions, but also the incentives of regulators and policymakers.	94.0	999.0
201604	472	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	There are considerable time inconsistency problems here.	94.0	999.0
201604	473	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	To the extent possible, policymakers should take a systematic approach in applying financial stability policy rather than rely on discretion.	94.0	999.0
201604	474	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	We can issue guidance, but if we aren’t willing to aggressively support it, then it becomes less effective.	94.0	999.0
201604	475	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	The benefit of a systematic approach wasn’t covered in the memos, but it is related to the distinction between the static and cyclical macroprudential tools.	94.0	999.0
201604	476	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Static through-the-cycle tools promote resiliency because they are known and permanent.	94.0	999.0
201604	477	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	But the cyclical macroprudential tools can be made systematic by laying out in advance the contingencies in which they would be invoked.	94.0	999.0
201604	478	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	For example, we can write down a formula for a countercyclical capital buffer, and we can define an explicit trigger for contingent convertible bonds.	94.0	999.0
201604	479	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Point four, any macroprudential action, whether it be by the FOMC or by another authority, must be communicated in a clear way to avoid creating a conflict with or causing confusion over actions taken to foster our monetary policy goals.	94.0	999.0
201604	480	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Careful thought should be given to the types of communications that we should use.	94.0	999.0
201604	481	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Point five, following my reading of the literature and the memos, I think our first line of defense should be the macroprudential tools that are focused on increasing the resiliency of the financial system.	94.0	999.0
201604	482	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Capital liquidity, living wills, resolution—these are the structural tools.	94.0	999.0
201604	483	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	I believe the important work that Governor Tarullo and the staff are doing to implement Dodd-Frank is consistent with this.	94.0	999.0
201604	484	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	I’m less convinced that we have enough knowledge and experience with the countercyclical tools to use them effectively at this point, but I think they are worth further study.	94.0	999.0
201604	485	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	The complications of the financial system in the United States, including multiple regulators, does need to be considered, as they limit the speed with which certain tools can be wielded and potentially limit their coverage.	94.0	999.0
201604	486	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Taking an action that pushes risk away from one set of institutions to another doesn’t eliminate the risk.	94.0	999.0
201604	487	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	It just lets it move around, potentially to a part of the financial system in which the risk is more difficult to monitor and to control.	94.0	999.0
201604	488	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	These considerations lead me to think that we should set the standards and the resiliency tools a tad higher than they would be if we had more confidence in the other tools and our ability to use them effectively.	94.0	999.0
201604	489	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	It also leads me to believe that while I’d want to rely on the financial system’s structural resiliency tools first, and perhaps some of the cyclical macroprudential tools, to the extent they’d be effective, in a situation in which these tools prove to be inadequate and risks to financial instability continued to grow and spread more broadly throughout the financial system, monetary policy should be on the table as a possible defense.	94.0	999.0
201604	490	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	I note, however, that in this case, the blurring between financial stability goals and monetary policy goals would be high.	94.0	999.0
201604	491	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	If we assess the risks of the financial instability to be great, achieving our dual-mandate goals would be in jeopardy as well.	94.0	999.0
201604	492	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	And this is an illustration that, in most cases, the goals of price stability, maximum employment, and financial stability are complementary.	94.0	999.0
201604	493	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	999.0
201604	494	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201604	495	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	94.0	65.0
201604	496	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	102.0
201604	497	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	First, I’d like to lodge a complaint about Brian Madigan.	94.0	102.0
201604	498	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I asked to go early, but he put me after the last four speakers, who have said everything that I think needs to be said and said it very clearly.	94.0	102.0
201604	499	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So here we go with my somewhat uncertain view on many of these subjects, some of which have already been characterized—or should I say, “caricatured.”	94.0	102.0
201604	500	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The staff memos and presentations help frame the many issues related to monetary policy and financial stability.	94.0	102.0
201604	501	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	They point out that, ideally, macroprudential tools should be the first line of defense for financial stability.	94.0	102.0
201604	502	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, unfortunately, as table 1 in the first briefing makes clear, these tools are hard to find in the United States.	94.0	102.0
201604	503	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s one of these cases in which economists assume a can opener, and the problem is solved.	94.0	102.0
201604	504	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The reality is that nearly all of our tools are microprudential in nature.	94.0	102.0
201604	505	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the US context, when I think about macroprudential, it’s LTVs and things like that.	94.0	102.0
201604	506	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the United States, it’s really about how do we take a macroprudential perspective kind of approach when thinking about the use of our microprudential tools.	94.0	102.0
201604	507	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	My favorite example is CCAR, the stress test, because these tests can and have been designed to penalize activities that are viewed to be a financial stability concern.	94.0	102.0
201604	508	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Basically, you put into the severe adverse scenario things that you’re worried about.	94.0	102.0
201604	509	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	You could think about doing this back in 2003.	94.0	102.0
201604	510	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	If we had that tool, you would put a housing bubble in, and then that clearly would penalize institutions that have a lot of exposure to that, creating a “shadow” cost to doing that and, we would hope, creating an incentive to have less exposure to that.	94.0	102.0
201604	511	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Obviously, countercyclical capital buffers are a tool down the road that could have a macroprudential aspect.	94.0	102.0
201604	512	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, there is no question to my mind that the improvement in our microprudential tools have created a much more resilient financial system today.	94.0	102.0
201604	513	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But there are practical limits to mitigating macroprudential concerns using microprudential tools on banks.	94.0	102.0
201604	514	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I think, more importantly—and this was already mentioned—our tools have significant gaps in coverage.	94.0	102.0
201604	515	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s a poor carpenter who blames his or her tools, but when it comes to macroprudential policy, the shortage of tools does limit our policy choices.	94.0	102.0
201604	516	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Just because we have the shortcomings of a macroprudential toolbox, that doesn’t argue for the systematic use of monetary policy to address credit or asset price imbalances.	94.0	102.0
201604	517	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, we can’t and don’t ignore financial stability concerns or financial market conditions in making monetary policy.	94.0	102.0
201604	518	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, in particular, as highlighted by Tobias Adrian’s presentation and the paper, we need to take into account the possibility that monetary policy actions do contribute to imbalances that threaten financial stability and ultimately undermine the achievement of our mandated goals.	94.0	102.0
201604	519	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In this regard, I do think something that Tobias Adrian said is important.	94.0	102.0
201604	520	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	You have to think of this as situation dependent.	94.0	102.0
201604	521	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	You can’t just have a general rule saying, “Should monetary policy lean against imbalances?”	94.0	102.0
201604	522	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do think it matters what the situation is, so let me give you a little bit more on that.	94.0	102.0
201604	523	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	There is considerable uncertainty about the drivers of imbalances and effects of monetary policy.	94.0	102.0
201604	524	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So one concern—and this was brought up a few times, specifically by Governor Fischer—is the potential for a very high cost of trying to burst the house price bubble or some other bubble that’s already become a huge concern.	94.0	102.0
201604	525	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The work that was done by Jorda, Shularick, and Taylor, which was cited in the staff briefing, does suggest that trying to pop a huge bubble could be very high.	94.0	102.0
201604	526	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Just to put some numbers to that, if monetary policy had tried to offset the run-up in the house-price-to-rent ratio that peaked in 2006—again, thinking about it, you’ve already got this bubble—their empirical estimates indicate that real GDP would have to decline by 12 percent.	94.0	102.0
201604	527	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, you can debate the specific numbers or their analysis, but the results still suggest that these are significant costs and roughly twice the peak-to-trough decline in real GDP per capita that we saw in the Great Recession.	94.0	102.0
201604	528	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Everyone has talked about Sweden’s experience as well, and I think that the situation there is relevant and illustrates some of the challenges when you are basically trading off macroeconomic goals with financial stability or credit imbalance concerns.	94.0	102.0
201604	529	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	They have high unemployment and very low inflation, and tightening monetary policy in that situation moved inflation further from their target.	94.0	102.0
201604	530	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And that does bring up this risk, which has already been mentioned, that fighting financial imbalances could undermine the credibility of the central bank in achieving its mandate goals.	94.0	102.0
201604	531	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	There is a risk that tightening monetary policy when inflation is persistently running below target undermines confidence in the central bank’s commitment to that target.	94.0	102.0
201604	532	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We actually saw some evidence on that, both in Sweden and Norway.	94.0	102.0
201604	533	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Both of those central banks did highlight in their public statements the fact that they were using monetary policy to address financial stability concerns at the cost of their inflation and other goals, and we did see, at least in some surveys, a decline in longer-run inflation expectations while they did that.	94.0	102.0
201604	534	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Since then, they have backed off that, and we have seen inflation expectations move back some, but it causes me to worry about some of the longer-term costs associated with the nominal anchor.	94.0	102.0
201604	535	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, on the basis of the analysis and the evidence, my own view at this stage, recognizing all of the uncertainty and all of the work that still needs to be done on this, is that the primary line of defense is microprudential.	94.0	102.0
201604	536	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s about capital, it’s about liquidity, it’s about strong supervision of our deposit-oriented institutions and, we hope, a financial system, as well as we can.	94.0	102.0
201604	537	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that should be complemented increasingly by macroprudential approaches, such as with CCAR and other tools that we do have, that even if they are microprudential by design, they can be implemented with more of a macroprudential perspective.	94.0	102.0
201604	538	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In thinking about monetary policy, I am drawn to the Hippocratic Oath of doing no harm.	94.0	102.0
201604	539	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Our primary focus should remain on our dual-mandate goals.	94.0	102.0
201604	540	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We know from the history of central banking that when you lose focus on price stability, that has very significant costs to society.	94.0	102.0
201604	541	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But assuming that we are in the vicinity of our goals, we should take care that monetary policy does not inadvertently contribute to fostering the emergence of imbalances in the economy, because the cost of trying to use monetary policy to tame imbalances after the fact are simply too large.	94.0	102.0
201604	542	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Early on in my career, I had to write down what my area of research was.	94.0	102.0
201604	543	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Mine was monetary policy under uncertainty.	94.0	102.0
201604	544	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I always thought that was a good choice for research.	94.0	102.0
201604	545	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think this area is one in which we really are very uncertain about how our tools affect the economy, and I would go back to President Mester’s point that, in view of the uncertainty, the argument I would make is that we want to have as robust and resilient a financial system as we can without having to really think that monetary policy is going to be the thing that saves us in the end.	94.0	102.0
201604	546	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	94.0	102.0
201604	547	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201604	548	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	94.0	65.0
201604	549	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	999.0
201604	550	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	I’d also like to thank the staff for some excellent work.	94.0	999.0
201604	551	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	I agree with much of what has been already said.	94.0	999.0
201604	552	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	I’ll keep my remarks short.	94.0	999.0
201604	553	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	First and foremost, I don’t think financial stability concerns should be elevated to the level of a third pillar of the monetary policy mandate.	94.0	999.0
201604	554	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	I share the view of the memos that systemically setting our policy instrument in reaction to financial indicators requires knowledge we don’t yet have, and the economic costs most likely outweigh any potential benefits.	94.0	999.0
201604	555	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Those economic costs, as stated before, could be fairly large, because it would likely take a very significant change of policy to reduce credit and asset prices.	94.0	999.0
201604	556	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Also, as we know, all run-ups in asset prices do not necessarily signal that something is amiss.	94.0	999.0
201604	557	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	So it’s very possible that we could make systemic mistakes when trying to regularly employ policy toward affecting asset prices.	94.0	999.0
201604	558	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Basically, I am skeptical that we can navigate a stability-growth frontier in a reliable manner.	94.0	999.0
201604	559	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	That said, and as others have said, there may indeed be instances when the Committee is fairly confident that it can identify financial imbalances.	94.0	999.0
201604	560	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	In those cases, a monetary policy response may be warranted, but I believe such cases would be infrequent and should be handled on a case- by-case basis.	94.0	999.0
201604	561	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Macroprudential policy should be our tool of choice, especially when considering systemic risk.	94.0	999.0
201604	562	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	I believe our current expansion of regulatory powers has made the banking system more resilient.	94.0	999.0
201604	563	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	And should new risky behavior ensue, we have the abilities in this sphere, albeit imperfect, to avert it.	94.0	999.0
201604	564	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	A recent case in point is the March 2013 guidance to curb risky lending in the leveraged loan market.	94.0	999.0
201604	565	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	It is true that it took some time for leveraged loans to begin contracting in 2014, but it appears that macroprudential intervention was an important element in changing behavior.	94.0	999.0
201604	566	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	But just because regulatory interventions do not work instantaneously, that should not be used as a rationale for substituting monetary policy, because monetary policy is unlikely to result in instantaneous responses either.	94.0	999.0
201604	567	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	999.0
201604	568	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201604	569	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	94.0	65.0
201604	570	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you very much, Madam Chair.	94.0	107.0
201604	571	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The discussion so far has been really excellent, and the papers prepared to inform us were quite excellent as well.	94.0	107.0
201604	572	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I think the discussion is timely.	94.0	107.0
201604	573	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	If, as current research suggests, we’re in a world in which the equilibrium rate of interest is depressed for a prolonged period of time, these kinds of tradeoffs between the setting of monetary policy appropriate for achieving full employment and our inflation target and the risks of financial imbalances associated with a so-called risk channel of monetary policy are likely to be more common.	94.0	107.0
201604	574	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In fact, we are seeing that in some foreign economies.	94.0	107.0
201604	575	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I think there are a few conclusions that these papers suggest, as do external research and close observation of several foreign jurisdictions.	94.0	107.0
201604	576	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The research does support the reality that we’re observing, which is that there can be an important effect on monetary policy through changes in risk premiums and risk-taking in financial markets and, of course, beyond.	94.0	107.0
201604	577	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s difficult enough, though, to get monetary policy settings just right for the specific inflation and employment objectives that we operate under.	94.0	107.0
201604	578	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	If we further burden our single policy instrument, powerful as it is, with a third objective related to credit intermediation, our challenge will become even more complicated.	94.0	107.0
201604	579	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The conclusion of some of the research in this area hints at the complexity as it suggests that the efficacy of such an expanded objective function will depend on the source of the shock, which is likely to be unobservable.	94.0	107.0
201604	580	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And, of course, several people have mentioned the work by Lars Svensson that just points out that, under many conditions, the benefits arising from adjusting monetary policy to address credit growth are likely to be outweighed by the greater cost in terms of higher unemployment and lower inflation, which magnifies the cost of a possible crisis.	94.0	107.0
201604	581	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	On the other hand, I think the research that was presented today does raise some important questions, and I hope that we will return to this because the research agenda is highly dynamic.	94.0	107.0
201604	582	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It leads me, though, to the same conclusion that many have drawn, that it is highly desirable to have time-varying, sector-specific macroprudential tools that operate more directly on the incentives of firms and households to take on excessive leverage in particular asset classes.	94.0	107.0
201604	583	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	That bring us squarely to consideration of our own institutional environment and the adequacy of our authorities in this regard.	94.0	107.0
201604	584	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	To start, I think it’s worth pointing out that we are in a much better position than we were pre-crisis in terms of the authorities that we have and the rigor with which we are exercising them, and, in fact, there have been very important structural innovations.	94.0	107.0
201604	585	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The Committee on Financial Stability has been created here at the Board with overlapping membership with the Committee on Bank Supervision, and of course overlapping membership with the monetary policy committee, the FOMC.	94.0	107.0
201604	586	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	More broadly, because regulatory authorities in the United States are fragmented, the Financial Stability Oversight Council has brought all of those regulatory authorities together for the first time.	94.0	107.0
201604	587	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	We have and are exercising a greatly expanded set of both micro and macroprudential tools that have greatly increased the structural resilience of the banking institutions that are at the core of our system.	94.0	107.0
201604	588	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	We have implemented greatly enhanced requirements that have resulted in much more and higher-quality capital throughout the banking system, and we’ve put in place on top of that a set of very stringent macroprudential capital and liquidity requirements that are tailored to the systemic footprint of the largest firms.	94.0	107.0
201604	589	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Of course, these are through-the-cycle safeguards, meaning that they impose structurally higher standards that are better suited to building resilience than to leaning against the buildup of risks.	94.0	107.0
201604	590	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In fact, because of the institutional environment we sit in, we probably put greater emphasis and build even greater resilience than we would if we had a very complete set of macroprudential tools.	94.0	107.0
201604	591	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	They are generally cumbersome to tailor to sector-specific risks.	94.0	107.0
201604	592	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Beyond this, our capital and liquidity stress tests provide critical capabilities to tailor scenarios in each annual cycle to ensure that the largest institutions have capital buffers that are relatively robust to specific risks that we may see building, for instance, on CRE or on leveraged lending.	94.0	107.0
201604	593	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, when the risks of financial stability increase overall, the Board, in consultation with other banking regulators, will temporarily increase the amount of capital that the large banks are required to hold in order to build resilience and to restrain undue risk-taking on a cyclical basis.	94.0	107.0
201604	594	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	This does ensure that we will systematically and routinely have to consider a quantitative and qualitative set of indicators and vote on whether to impose those buffers.	94.0	107.0
201604	595	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	This is important, I think, as a signaling device, and it puts a lot of responsibility on us, which is new.	94.0	107.0
201604	596	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Of course, on the other hand, it is slow to implement and, again, not sector-specific.	94.0	107.0
201604	597	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	So all of those things, I think, should give us some confidence that we do have a set of additional tools.	94.0	107.0
201604	598	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, I remain uneasy for the specific risk that we’ve highlighted here with regard to housing bubbles in particular—which appear, historically, to be the most deeply damaging sources of periodic financial crises.	94.0	107.0
201604	599	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Given our current authorities, the banking agencies could, perhaps, impose higher risk rates on mortgage loans with particular characteristics either directly or through expectations for the stress test, but it would require upwards of a year to adjust.	94.0	107.0
201604	600	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, as others have noted, it would be narrow in its scope of application, because a large share of mortgage lending is undertaken by nonbanks, and it may prove ineffective at times when bank regulatory capital comfortably exceeds the required thresholds.	94.0	107.0
201604	601	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In this arena, our authorities fall short of other jurisdictions that have deployed time- varying, sector-specific macroprudential policies to cool their housing bubbles.	94.0	107.0
201604	602	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	We noted earlier that financial authorities in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Switzerland, and New Zealand, among others, have confronted rapidly rising residential housing prices in precisely the kinds of environments when there were compelling reasons not to use the policy rate as the first line of defense.	94.0	107.0
201604	603	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Many responded by tightening restrictions on borrowing through loan-to-value or debt- to-income caps—in some cases, in concert with disincentives for lenders, and in many cases, in an escalating pattern.	94.0	107.0
201604	604	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And, indeed, the research that the IMF has undertaken, among others, has shown that macroprudential measures imposed directly on borrowers can have greater and more immediate efficacy than restraints imposed on lending.	94.0	107.0
201604	605	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In our environment, responsibilities for financial stability, on the one hand, are largely separated from those for consumer credit protection, which the CFPB does have across both banks and nonbank lenders, for instance, through imposing LTV caps through their QM rules.	94.0	107.0
201604	606	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	So these authorities exist, but they are fragmented.	94.0	107.0
201604	607	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In order to get agreement across regulators, it may take an unduly slow and cumbersome process working through the FSOC.	94.0	107.0
201604	608	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	That should give us some pause.	94.0	107.0
201604	609	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Under these circumstances, as I think others have also concluded, monetary policy might, by default, carry a greater burden as a second line of defense.	94.0	107.0
201604	610	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	All of that said, I think the research that we should be undertaking should include not just the possible tradeoffs involved in using monetary policy to address the buildup of risks in the credit system, but also contemplate the authorities that we have and do not have and the tradeoffs in the possible setting of those authorities.	94.0	107.0
201604	611	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Again, in circumstances in which we have more authorities to build structural resilience, there may be tradeoffs at keeping those settings higher through the cycle as compensation for not having a full set of macroprudential authorities.	94.0	107.0
201604	612	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And it’s something that I think we would benefit from specific research on.	94.0	107.0
201604	613	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	107.0
201604	614	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201604	615	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	94.0	65.0
201604	616	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	88.0
201604	617	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I, too, want to thank the staff members who participated in teeing up this conversation.	94.0	88.0
201604	618	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Before wading into this topic by reading the materials, I had some general predispositions on the issues highlighted in the memos.	94.0	88.0
201604	619	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	My views going in were, first, that the use of monetary policy tools ought not to be the preferred approach to addressing a buildup in financial stability risks; second, that continuing refinement and implementation of macroprudential tools and programs, although imperfect in a number of dimensions and no guarantee that tail risk will be avoided, still represent the best practical alternative; third, that a resilience-oriented policy and supervision focus will likely have a greater payoff than an emphasis on prevention; and, finally, that sharply raising the policy rate or initiating sizable asset sales in an attempt to prick an asset bubble or to discourage credit expansion and growing leverage or to discourage types of risk-taking or even to correct a perceived economic imbalance is likely to entail undesirable, even unacceptable, costs and consequences.	94.0	88.0
201604	620	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Those were my views before thinking about this.	94.0	88.0
201604	621	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The staff memos did not really move me much fromthose views, although the discussion this morning may do so.	94.0	88.0
201604	622	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	My thinking actually kind of fits Governor Tarullo’s caricature of most monetary policymakers.	94.0	88.0
201604	623	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	But the memos did serve to deepen my understanding of the challenges and uncertainties involved.	94.0	88.0
201604	624	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I understand today’s session to be largely a high-level discussion asking for an initial response.	94.0	88.0
201604	625	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I’ll just make a few comments in response to the questions posed.	94.0	88.0
201604	626	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Are macroprudential tools enough “most of the time?”	94.0	88.0
201604	627	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Yes, I think macroprudential tools should be sufficient, and by that I mean more advisable as a first resort in most circumstances.	94.0	88.0
201604	628	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	And “most circumstances” in my mind, in my imagination, are likely to be ambiguous and not clearly far advanced.	94.0	88.0
201604	629	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	That said, I don’t think mobilization of monetary policy tools should be ruled out, if only because we can’t anticipate all circumstances.	94.0	88.0
201604	630	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	On the question of any distinction between tools through-the-cycle or structural tools versus tools for cyclical buildups of risks, I start with an opinion that risk-taking accretes over time with sustained benign conditions.	94.0	88.0
201604	631	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Said differently, our policy success sows the seeds of financial instability.	94.0	88.0
201604	632	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	And this suggests to me that systemic risk vigilance probably should be pro-cyclical and the application of macroprudential tools, at least for cyclical purposes, may have to be time variant.	94.0	88.0
201604	633	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	As I said earlier, I see macroprudential tools that promote resilience as an important complement.	94.0	88.0
201604	634	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Do the dispersion and fragmentation of regulatory responsibility and the attendant coordination challenges affect my views of macroprudential tools?	94.0	88.0
201604	635	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Yes, this reality reduces the probability of effective action.	94.0	88.0
201604	636	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Unfortunately, this is not a problem likely to be remedied in the foreseeable future.	94.0	88.0
201604	637	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	It’s a problem I simply think has to be worked on as best we can.	94.0	88.0
201604	638	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	And it goes without saying that the Federal Reserve still holds powerful cards in formulating macroprudential policy and its implementation.	94.0	88.0
201604	639	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Would I support using monetary policy tools for financial stability purposes if the dual- mandate objectives had to be subordinated—this is the way I understood the question—and, if so, under what conditions and how likely are they?	94.0	88.0
201604	640	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	My view is, only in very extreme circumstances.	94.0	88.0
201604	641	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	If the Committee had full or very high conviction that the risks of severe financial instability were approaching an untenable state, I could imagine tolerating some higher unemployment or deviation from our inflation target for a time in the interest of avoiding a much more costly development.	94.0	88.0
201604	642	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In these rare cases, using monetary policy to promote financial stability would be consistent with, not contrary to, achieving the dual mandate over the medium- term horizon.	94.0	88.0
201604	643	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	What constitutes an untenable state is subjective but could be informed, I believe, by comparisons with earlier episodes of incipient instability; attention to quantifiable benchmarks for debt buildup and aggregate leverage, for example; and, possibly, recognition of widespread unsound practices and behavior.	94.0	88.0
201604	644	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Nonetheless, the existence of a sizable, evolving, and opaque shadow banking system in this country makes arriving at such judgments extremely challenging.	94.0	88.0
201604	645	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	88.0
201604	646	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201604	647	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	94.0	65.0
201604	648	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	91.0
201604	649	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Thanks to the presenters and their colleagues for providing a collection of insightful memos on a particularly challenging topic.	94.0	91.0
201604	650	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	And the discussion this morning has been fascinating.	94.0	91.0
201604	651	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	I’m apparently going to change my normal behavior today.	94.0	91.0
201604	652	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	I’m going to largely frame my remarks around a couple of the explicit questions that were suggested to us.	94.0	91.0
201604	653	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	94.0	91.0
201604	654	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Question 2a asks about our support for using monetary policy “to pursue financial stability goals.”	94.0	91.0
201604	655	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	In some cases, such as in the depth of the financial crisis, the policy settings to achieve monetary and financial stability goals are complementary, and there is no policy dilemma.	94.0	91.0
201604	656	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	But I am extremely skeptical about using monetary policy to support financial stability goals in situations when doing so would in any way counter or degrade the FOMC’s attainment of our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.	94.0	91.0
201604	657	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Importantly, if this dilemma arose, I expect we would need to make large increases in our policy rate to have a meaningful effect on financial instability risks.	94.0	91.0
201604	658	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	I think the briefings were fairly clear on that.	94.0	91.0
201604	659	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	The recent experiences of Sweden and Norway suggest that moderate tightening has pretty limited effects.	94.0	91.0
201604	660	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Such large rate increases likely would have large and deleterious consequences for output, employment, and inflation.	94.0	91.0
201604	661	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	If our only option to mitigate financial instability risks were a very large monetary policy action, this would be evidence of a substantial flaw in our regulatory regime.	94.0	91.0
201604	662	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	The US economy ought to have adequate resiliency in the financial system so that this Committee does not face that choice.	94.0	91.0
201604	663	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	If we had to take such an action, I think it would be a huge credibility problem for the Federal Reserve.	94.0	91.0
201604	664	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	We’d be raising the funds rate at a time when that action presumably would lead to higher unemployment and lower inflation, and—presumably, because it’s a dilemma— that would be the wrong direction to go.	94.0	91.0
201604	665	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	The public would lose confidence in our abilities, both as monetary policymakers and as financial regulators.	94.0	91.0
201604	666	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	The aftermath of such an event would include, I expect, a serious postmortem.	94.0	91.0
201604	667	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	It is critical that this Committee has substantial confidence that the Board and other regulatory bodies have the appropriate tools to address risks to financial stability, and that these tools will be deployed with the appropriate timing and vigor.	94.0	91.0
201604	668	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	I found Governor Tarullo’s comments particularly provocative and interesting when he mentioned that monetary policy might have to consider weighing in periodically, or he at least asked a question about that.	94.0	91.0
201604	669	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	I have a former colleague, Pedro Teles, who’s now at the Bank of Portugal, and he is a theoretical economist.	94.0	91.0
201604	670	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	He studied models in which he basically inserted marginal tax rates all around the economy on consumers, on businesses, and things like this.	94.0	91.0
201604	671	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Well, these taxes are additional instruments, and he could make the entire model dance and overcome distortions and achieve first-best allocations.	94.0	91.0
201604	672	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	That’s what can happen if you have enough instruments to pursue what you want.	94.0	91.0
201604	673	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	The question is, why not fiscal policy?	94.0	91.0
201604	674	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Why not something like that?	94.0	91.0
201604	675	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	We talk about macroprudential tools, but fiscal policy or the structure of the economy could also do it.	94.0	91.0
201604	676	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Well, it’s because we just assume that it can’t be done, that the fiscal authorities can’t decide on things like that.	94.0	91.0
201604	677	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	It’s a presumption that monetary policy can be bent to address these issues.	94.0	91.0
201604	678	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	But that’s broadening our goals.	94.0	91.0
201604	679	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	If we’re going to do that, we really should have a very serious discussion about it.	94.0	91.0
201604	680	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	That’s how, in many cases in the past, in different contexts completely, we’ve gotten ourselves into trouble.	94.0	91.0
201604	681	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Take the 1970s when we were trying to get the economy going because we thought it wasn’t going fast enough, and we ended up with a lot of inflation.	94.0	91.0
201604	682	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	I agree very much with Governor Fischer’s comments about how you need the same number of instruments as goals.	94.0	91.0
201604	683	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Circling back some, question one asks our opinion of the adequacy of the current macroprudential toolkit.	94.0	91.0
201604	684	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Well, maybe I’m naïve, but I am relatively optimistic that our post- Dodd-Frank regulatory efforts are building greater resiliency into the financial system.	94.0	91.0
201604	685	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	That said, as these memos highlight, significant challenges remain.	94.0	91.0
201604	686	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	I was sympathetic to the memo’s discussion of how difficult it is to identify risks and respond in a timely fashion with regulatory tools.	94.0	91.0
201604	687	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Accordingly, as others have mentioned, tools that are either explicitly or realistically through-the-cycle seem most promising to me in this regard.	94.0	91.0
201604	688	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	The strong role played by enhanced capital requirements in our current regulatory approaches is an excellent step forward.	94.0	91.0
201604	689	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Regular stress testing is another strong tool.	94.0	91.0
201604	690	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Regular stress tests help build confidence in banks’ resiliency, may uncover previously underappreciated risks, and can enhance a baseline discipline that would prove useful in addressing some unforeseen stress in the future.	94.0	91.0
201604	691	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	And resolution planning is beginning to seem promising.	94.0	91.0
201604	692	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	When I hear that Citi garnered only shortcomings and not deficiencies, that sounds like real progress to me.	94.0	91.0
201604	693	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Now, all of that is in the public domain, right?	94.0	91.0
201604	694	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	I fully appreciate that these are extremely difficult regulatory issues, and some risks will always remain.	94.0	91.0
201604	695	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	And I will readily admit that I’m not an expert.	94.0	91.0
201604	696	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	But I am listening carefully to these experts’ views, and I hope they will continue to be shared with the Committee to build further confidence that financial-stability risks will not intrude on monetary policy implementation except in the normal monitoring-the-effects role, which we always do.	94.0	91.0
201604	697	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	My notes say “finally,” but I probably have a couple more comments after this.	94.0	91.0
201604	698	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	94.0	91.0
201604	699	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Finally, as the Fuhrer, Haubrich, and Peek memo discusses, it’s reasonable to ask whether it’s a good idea to separate monetary policy authority from financial-stability responsibilities.	94.0	91.0
201604	700	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	The feasibility of effective separation depends on the structure of the economy and the financial system.	94.0	91.0
201604	701	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Some scholars have studied economic environments in which the authorities have enough policy instruments to approach these objectives separately.	94.0	91.0
201604	702	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	But other environments exhibit too much interdependence so that economic distortions emanating from the real side and from the financial side cannot be fully separated and controlled without more tools and authorities, which are currently absent.	94.0	91.0
201604	703	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Again, that’s Governor Fischer’s point.	94.0	91.0
201604	704	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	In these environments, more coordination between monetary and financial regulatory authorities would be required.	94.0	91.0
201604	705	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	So even though the Committee and the Board have distinct statutory responsibilities when it comes to monetary and financial stability objectives, we should continue to build a joint understanding of the effectiveness of all policies for dealing with any emerging risks that could threaten our best approach to setting monetary policy.	94.0	91.0
201604	706	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Now, I believe that Governor Tarullo offered up a suggestion to the Committee on Financial Stability on a to-do list to look at the early 2000s period.	94.0	91.0
201604	707	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	I think that’s appropriate.	94.0	91.0
201604	708	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	I would also suggest looking at the 2013 “taper tantrum,” because in one of the sections of Ben Bernanke’s book in which I found new information, not things I already knew, was his description of the taper tantrum and the events that led him to make certain comments.	94.0	91.0
201604	709	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	It seemed to me that he was perhaps highlighting concerns in Washington that I had not felt were represented well in our March 2013 discussion on financial stability.	94.0	91.0
201604	710	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	I walked away from the Committee discussions thinking that we were all pretty comfortable with not adjusting our approach on the basis of financial stability.	94.0	91.0
201604	711	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	But in his book, he suggested things a little bit differently.	94.0	91.0
201604	712	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Anyway, I think the taper tantrum is one thing to look at.	94.0	91.0
201604	713	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Okay, finally, if we decide that financial instability risks, when things are really brewing in large, will trump achieving our dual-mandate responsibilities with monetary policy, then I’ve got to be concerned that our inflation objective is almost surely too low, because that would be a circumstance in which we would need to create a contractionary monetary policy that would drive inflation below our 2 percent objective.	94.0	91.0
201604	714	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	I don’t think that’s anything that we’ve contemplated in the setting of this inflation objective.	94.0	91.0
201604	715	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	And it would at least be fair game, if we were going to go that route, to reconsider that.	94.0	91.0
201604	716	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	91.0
201604	717	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201604	718	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	94.0	65.0
201604	719	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	94.0
201604	720	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I thank the staff for an excellent set of memos on this important topic.	94.0	94.0
201604	721	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I regard this as the issue of our times, and I have reviewed the memos in some detail with my staff.	94.0	94.0
201604	722	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	My main conclusion is that the state of thinking on macroeconomics and financial stability interlinkages remains in flux, perhaps not surprisingly.	94.0	94.0
201604	723	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	And I would think it will be some considerable time before professional consensus forms on these issues.	94.0	94.0
201604	724	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	In the meantime, this Committee must make monetary policy decisions in the absence of professional consensus.	94.0	94.0
201604	725	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I have five main comments, which I’ll list here and then comment on each of them.	94.0	94.0
201604	726	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Number one, I’ll talk a little bit about how many elements of the conventional wisdom on this issue do not ring true to me, and this will echo some of Governor Tarullo’s earlier comments.	94.0	94.0
201604	727	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Number two, this set of memos has a glaring omission:  a type of theory that receives substantial attention in the research literature but zero attention in policy circles.	94.0	94.0
201604	728	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	So I’ll talk about that.	94.0	94.0
201604	729	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Number three, my reading of the empirical evidence presented is that it is broadly consistent with ideas that suggest monetary policy may intersect importantly with financial stability.	94.0	94.0
201604	730	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Number four, the theory literature is extremely clear that, under appropriate assumptions, financial stability would be an important concern for monetary policymakers, and the caveats to this are unconvincing.	94.0	94.0
201604	731	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	And, number five, the international experience suggests that, although some foreign economies have experimented with macroprudential policies, it is far from clear that sufficient macroeconomic policy tools exist in the United States to maintain satisfactory financial stability in the absence of monetary policy adjustment.	94.0	94.0
201604	732	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	So let me comment on each of these points.	94.0	94.0
201604	733	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	First of all, many elements of the conventional wisdom do not ring true.	94.0	94.0
201604	734	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I interpreted the Fuhrer, Haubrich, and Peek memo as characterizing portions of the conventional wisdom on this topic.	94.0	94.0
201604	735	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Aspects of the conventional wisdom include:  (a)  Do not freight monetary policy with too many conflicting goals.	94.0	94.0
201604	736	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is commonly said.	94.0	94.0
201604	737	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	In my view, multiple goals can be perfectly fine.	94.0	94.0
201604	738	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Monetary policy in the United States famously has a dual mandate.	94.0	94.0
201604	739	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The entire purpose of preventing a financial crisis is to prevent the effect on the dual-mandate goals.	94.0	94.0
201604	740	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Unemployment spiked to 10 percent following the financial crisis.	94.0	94.0
201604	741	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Surely this is worth preventing by any means, including monetary policy, if necessary.	94.0	94.0
201604	742	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I agree totally with President Evans’s comments on many tools.	94.0	94.0
201604	743	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	It would be nice to have many tools available.	94.0	94.0
201604	744	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	And in models, if you have a lot of tools available, you can do a lot of things.	94.0	94.0
201604	745	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The whole point of the discussion is that this is a second-best world.	94.0	94.0
201604	746	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Also, multiple goals can always be reconciled through an appropriate specification of an objective function.	94.0	94.0
201604	747	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Another part of the conventional wisdom is:  (b)  It may be difficult to identify emerging instability risks early enough.	94.0	94.0
201604	748	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is something that’s commonly said.	94.0	94.0
201604	749	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t think this is right, either.	94.0	94.0
201604	750	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Both the tech bubble and the housing bubble were readily apparently to all observers and were hotly debated, even around this table, as they were occurring.	94.0	94.0
201604	751	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	It wasn’t a matter that we didn’t know that the bubble was upon us.	94.0	94.0
201604	752	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The idea was, we didn’t know what, if anything, to do about it.	94.0	94.0
201604	753	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	So, in my view, the idea that these problems sneak up on us does not ring true.	94.0	94.0
201604	754	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	A third part of the conventional wisdom is:  (c)  The effects of monetary policy on asset prices and credit growth during a bubble are uncertain.	94.0	94.0
201604	755	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	This also doesn’t ring true as a reason for refraining from taking action.	94.0	94.0
201604	756	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The effects of monetary policy are always uncertain.	94.0	94.0
201604	757	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The effect of monetary policy is certainly to mitigate the bubble.	94.0	94.0
201604	758	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	It’s just a question of the magnitude of that effect.	94.0	94.0
201604	759	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	By using monetary policy, one may be preventing a disaster like the one that unfolded from 2007 to 2009.	94.0	94.0
201604	760	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	And part (d) of the conventional wisdom is that significant collateral damage may arise from using monetary policy tools to address financial instability.	94.0	94.0
201604	761	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	This line of thinking, which has been echoed around the table here, has the flavor that you’re going to make a policy mistake.	94.0	94.0
201604	762	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	If you make a policy mistake, yes, there’s going to be a lot of collateral damage.	94.0	94.0
201604	763	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The question is, is there an optimal monetary policy that would work that would take care of financial stability?	94.0	94.0
201604	764	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	So we’re talking not about policy mistakes, which are always a risk; we’re trying to talk about an appropriate application of monetary policy.	94.0	94.0
201604	765	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	An appropriate application of monetary policy in a bubble situation holds the promise of a smoother growth path for the economy as opposed to one that is characterized by a boom-and-bust cycle.	94.0	94.0
201604	766	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	In sum, I think much of the conventional wisdom summarized in this memo is questionable.	94.0	94.0
201604	767	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	My second comment is, there’s a large gap in the coverage of these memos compared with the research literature.	94.0	94.0
201604	768	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	There is a large literature on the multiplicity of equilibria and the possible contribution of monetary policy to creating and sustaining that multiplicity.	94.0	94.0
201604	769	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Many of the exotic equilibria that exist in models feature substantial economic volatility—exactly the sort of boom-and-bust phenomenon that the literature on financial stability is attempting to explain.	94.0	94.0
201604	770	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The “extra” equilibria, which often exist, may seem exotic or special in some sense, but they are fully consistent with rational expectations and market clearing—and so are at least as legitimate as the other equilibriums that we rely on to inform monetary policy choices.	94.0	94.0
201604	771	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	As an example, even in the very simplest New Keynesian model, which ultimately informs much of the analysis presented to this Committee, an interest rate peg is associated with a fundamental equilibrium, which is the one we often use for policy analysis, but also with many volatile equilibria, which could be thought of as implying boom-and-bust cycles.	94.0	94.0
201604	772	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	See, for instance, Jordi Galí in his basic book explaining the New Keynesian model.	94.0	94.0
201604	773	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Furthermore, appropriate policy could easily eliminate these boom-and-bust cycles, and so monetary choices in this kind of thinking would have an enormous effect on whether you’re going to get financial crises of the kind that we think we’ve observed in the United States recently.	94.0	94.0
201604	774	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	My point would be, policy rules can help define the equilibriums that are even possible in the economy.	94.0	94.0
201604	775	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	And in this sense, good monetary policy could put you on a path on which you wouldn’t experience any of the deleterious equilibrium effects that you think we’ve experienced in the past few years.	94.0	94.0
201604	776	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	If you don’t believe me on this, just think about Diamond-Dybvig.	94.0	94.0
201604	777	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	A lot of you know Diamond-Dybvig models of bank runs.	94.0	94.0
201604	778	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	That’s a multiple-equilibrium model.	94.0	94.0
201604	779	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	There’s a normal equilibrium, in which people deposit in the banks and everything goes fine.	94.0	94.0
201604	780	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	There’s a run equilibrium, in which everybody runs on the bank.	94.0	94.0
201604	781	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The run equilibrium is bad.	94.0	94.0
201604	782	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	In that model, you put in deposit insurance, it eliminates the run equilibrium, and everything works fine forever.	94.0	94.0
201604	783	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	That’s a model in which policy has an enormous effect on the kinds of things that can happen in that particular economy.	94.0	94.0
201604	784	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The same kinds of things are true in the New Keynesian economy.	94.0	94.0
201604	785	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	And I think it’d be worth thinking a little bit more about these kinds of issues before saying that monetary policy can’t do anything about bubbles or asset price volatility.	94.0	94.0
201604	786	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is an example of a conception of financial volatility that has considerable support in the literature but is not represented in the span of this discussion.	94.0	94.0
201604	787	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think the omission of this area of research is inappropriate for discussion at the level of this Committee, which purports to provide a review of current thinking on macroeconomics, monetary policy, and financial stability.	94.0	94.0
201604	788	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	My third comment is on the memo by Adrian and others, which was on empirical evidence.	94.0	94.0
201604	789	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I just have a brief comment.	94.0	94.0
201604	790	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The empirical evidence seems to run counter to some of the conventional wisdom on the subject I was reviewing earlier.	94.0	94.0
201604	791	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	In particular, the empirical results seem to confirm the intuition that monetary policy has an important effect on risk-taking in the economy.	94.0	94.0
201604	792	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	And so I found these results quite interesting.	94.0	94.0
201604	793	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’d encourage more work in this area.	94.0	94.0
201604	794	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	My fourth comment is on the Durdu and others memo.	94.0	94.0
201604	795	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The theoretical literature is extremely clear that, under appropriate assumptions, financial stability would be an important concern to monetary policymakers, and the caveats to this view are unconvincing.	94.0	94.0
201604	796	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	What does the theoretical literature say that is so compelling?	94.0	94.0
201604	797	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	It’s a simple argument.	94.0	94.0
201604	798	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The basic friction that motivates monetary policy in leading models is sticky prices.	94.0	94.0
201604	799	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	This means, if taken seriously, that observed prices across a variety of markets do not represent true market-clearing prices.	94.0	94.0
201604	800	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	This motivates monetary policy intervention to help the inappropriate pricing going on in the economy.	94.0	94.0
201604	801	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	But this is in the context of perfectly operating credit markets.	94.0	94.0
201604	802	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	If one assumes an additional friction analogous to sticky prices that also causes credit markets to work imperfectly, then an appropriate monetary policy will want to take this friction into account as well.	94.0	94.0
201604	803	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Furthermore, it’s unlikely in the general equilibrium that you’re going to be able to separate the reaction to these two frictions.	94.0	94.0
201604	804	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Because many economists—and, I believe, many of you—think that there are tangible frictions in actual credit markets, this argument strikes me as extremely powerful, independent of exactly which model one wants to talk about in this area.	94.0	94.0
201604	805	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	This would say, if you’re designing an optimal monetary policy and you think there’s sticky-price friction and you think there are things going wrong in credit markets, then you’re going to want to take into account both of these frictions when you’re making your monetary policy.	94.0	94.0
201604	806	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The caveats to the argument struck me as rather weak, as they concede this theoretical point and start arguing about other matters.	94.0	94.0
201604	807	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	And, finally, my fifth comment is on the international experience.	94.0	94.0
201604	808	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The memo on this topic showed that some foreign economies have experimented with macroprudential policies.	94.0	94.0
201604	809	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The US financial system is far deeper, broader, and more complex than the financial systems in many of these countries, and on this I agree with Governor Fischer’s and President Williams’s comments and those of many others.	94.0	94.0
201604	810	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	It’s far from clear to me that sufficient macroprudential tools exist as of today in the United States to ensure financial stability through this channel alone in the absence of monetary policy adjustment.	94.0	94.0
201604	811	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	For this reason, I think that it will likely be necessary to consider the use of macroprudential policy in conjunction with interest rate policy in order to maintain financial stability in the United States.	94.0	94.0
201604	812	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	94.0
201604	813	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201604	814	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	94.0	65.0
201604	815	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	81.0
201604	816	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Because I might be one of the last speakers between you folks and lunch, I’ll be brief.	94.0	81.0
201604	817	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	I construed the discussion topic as the narrow question of the way in which the setting of monetary policy instruments should vary with the financial stability considerations, or observations of conditions, rather than the broader question of appropriate public policy in relation to financial stability.	94.0	81.0
201604	818	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	I agree that the state of understanding is relatively limited, and so my comments are basically two suggestions for further research.	94.0	81.0
201604	819	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	The staff’s focus is almost entirely on the buildup, or boom, phase, in which financial conditions are evolving in a way that might lead to future distress.	94.0	81.0
201604	820	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	I agree with the staff’s memo that highlighted the difficulty of determining whether some observed developments represent inefficient departures from healthy market functioning.	94.0	81.0
201604	821	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	I agree, therefore, that humility should be our watchword.	94.0	81.0
201604	822	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	For me, this is a powerful argument for central banks to stick to their price- stability knitting, because responding to sectoral developments per se runs the risk of entangling us in distributional politics.	94.0	81.0
201604	823	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Besides, the economic basis for doing so seems not obvious to me in many circumstances.	94.0	81.0
201604	824	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	For me, this is also a powerful argument for more research on how we should know, in real time, what the appropriate response should be.	94.0	81.0
201604	825	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	And here I guess I differ from President Bullard about what we knew in 2005 or 2006.	94.0	81.0
201604	826	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Maybe there was agreement on overvaluation of housing, but exactly how that would play out and exactly how different approaches to monetary policy would affect that were, I think, quite uncertain.	94.0	81.0
201604	827	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	And I contrast this kind of research on how we should know with what I see as the bulk of research that has been cited for us, in which the policymaker is absolutely sure of the model he’s in:  He’s in the model that the modeler wrote down.	94.0	81.0
201604	828	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	As a result, it’s just a matter of deciding what to do about what he knows, as opposed to having to sort through different theories, different models, different estimates, and then different understandings of how to proceed.	94.0	81.0
201604	829	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	In the other direction from leaning against booms, there appears to be little controversy that, as one paper put it, “monetary policy should be used to stabilize the economy and financial markets in the wake of a financial crash”	94.0	81.0
201604	830	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	But I’d like to suggest that there’s a third case that deserves attention as well:  instances in which financial market turbulence arises but does not end up leading to a full-fledged crash and thus ultimately proves transitory.	94.0	81.0
201604	831	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Examples would include the stock market break of 1987 and the LTCM–Russian debt default crisis in 1998–99.	94.0	81.0
201604	832	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	It’s natural at such times to make monetary policy more accommodative out of concern for the downside risks—that is, the increase in the probability of adverse outcomes for economic growth and inflation.	94.0	81.0
201604	833	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	And I view that as the standard monetary policy response to information about the prospects for the fundamental things we care about—employment and inflation—not an additional reaction to financial stability.	94.0	81.0
201604	834	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	But even if the financial market turbulence settles down without causing a recession, it’s common at times like that for monetary policy to remain more accommodative for some time.	94.0	81.0
201604	835	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Clearly, though, it can’t be optimal for the monetary policy reaction to be permanent in the sense that the policy rate path is forever deflected downward by a one-time ratchet effect in response to every instance of financial market tumult.	94.0	81.0
201604	836	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Even short of a strictly permanent reaction, I believe what happened in 1998–99 illustrates that there’s a very real risk that when monetary policy remains more accommodative for too long and sets off a response, it could leave us substantially “behind the curve.”	94.0	81.0
201604	837	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	So I think this portion of the monetary policy reaction function to financial-stability considerations deserves attention from researchers as well.	94.0	81.0
201604	838	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	81.0
201604	839	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201604	840	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	94.0	65.0
201604	841	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	103.0
201604	842	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	I, too, thank the staff and have found today’s conversation useful in refining our expectations for the role of financial stability in policy decisions.	94.0	103.0
201604	843	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	I would just say, the tools we have available in the United States today strike me as the ones we inevitably come back to after crises, a matter of basic supervisory and financial concepts related to capital adequacy, risk diversification, and limits on interbank and market exposures.	94.0	103.0
201604	844	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	The challenge remains, I think, in gaining confidence that such tools are calibrated in a way that keeps up with the dynamic financial system as it innovates and evolves.	94.0	103.0
201604	845	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	And, of course, that confidence depends on understanding whether we can reliably detect the buildup of unhealthy financial pressures and then deploy the appropriate tool before it’s too late.	94.0	103.0
201604	846	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	I think today’s discussion suggests we probably should continue to talk more about that.	94.0	103.0
201604	847	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	I would not draw stark distinctions between through-the-cycle risks and those that are more cyclical.	94.0	103.0
201604	848	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Adequate capitalization, low-to-moderate leverage, appropriate risk-taking, and strong liquidity within a robust microprudential supervisory framework, I think, is a good foundation for fostering financial stability.	94.0	103.0
201604	849	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	And I think our stress-testing approaches have certainly strengthened that framework.	94.0	103.0
201604	850	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	As it relates to the stance of monetary policy to pursue financial stability goals, the tabletop exercise led by President Rosengren’s committee last year considered the role of monetary policy relative to financial stability goals.	94.0	103.0
201604	851	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	As I did then, I continue to think that monetary policy is the wrong tool for responding to financial imbalances, and that it is too broad an instrument to effectively incorporate a specific financial stability mandate.	94.0	103.0
201604	852	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	That said, the pursuit of other macroeconomic objectives cannot ignore the important influence of the stance of policy.	94.0	103.0
201604	853	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	And keeping rates low for long periods with an eye only toward achieving our dual mandate over the medium term can facilitate conditions that encourage risk-taking or misallocations.	94.0	103.0
201604	854	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Policymakers certainly bear responsibility for carefully calibrating the cost and benefits of such policy settings.	94.0	103.0
201604	855	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	However, raising interest rates seems an extreme response to the possibility of an imbalance and risks slowing the entire economy in an attempt to address a specific segment.	94.0	103.0
201604	856	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	For this reason, I prefer to lean on more targeted tools, which coordinate with and complement monetary policy objectives.	94.0	103.0
201604	857	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	And I think it would be worthwhile for us to think about a plan that would respond to a future financial stability scenario.	94.0	103.0
201604	858	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	I like Governor Brainard’s ideas about considering the tradeoffs that might be associated with that as we go forward with this thinking.	94.0	103.0
201604	859	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	94.0	103.0
201604	860	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201604	861	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	94.0	65.0
201604	862	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	111.0
201604	863	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I am generally in the camp that the costs of using monetary policy exceed the benefits.	94.0	111.0
201604	864	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I don’t want to say “never,” but I think it’s unlikely I’d find myself in a situation in which that’d be the tool I would be going toward first.	94.0	111.0
201604	865	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	A couple of people around the table have used the word “humility.”	94.0	111.0
201604	866	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I think that’s probably the most important word to remind ourselves of in these types of situations.	94.0	111.0
201604	867	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	You know, Governor Tarullo mentioned an exercise.	94.0	111.0
201604	868	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We ran a similar exercise in Minneapolis in which I asked our staff, with the benefit of perfect hindsight, to tell me when the FOMC should have raised rates in the past 100 years to deal with a bubble.	94.0	111.0
201604	869	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And we couldn’t reach agreement, whether it was the Great Depression or the Great Recession or the tech bubble.	94.0	111.0
201604	870	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	If we couldn’t reach agreement when having perfect hindsight, I’m skeptical that we’re going to reach agreement on a go-forward basis.	94.0	111.0
201604	871	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And I think about two examples.	94.0	111.0
201604	872	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	One is, since the crisis, we’ve all been laser-focused on financial-stability risks, and I don’t know anybody who saw the price of oil going from $150 per barrel to $30.	94.0	111.0
201604	873	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	That’s a heck of an economic shock, and we all missed it.	94.0	111.0
201604	874	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Now, I don’t know if it was a bubble, and I don’t know if monetary policy should have been deployed to do anything about it—probably not.	94.0	111.0
201604	875	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	But just that example says that while we were looking, we still missed it.	94.0	111.0
201604	876	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	That’s how hard these things are to identify.	94.0	111.0
201604	877	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Then I go back to 2003.	94.0	111.0
201604	878	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Where do bubbles come from?	94.0	111.0
201604	879	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	They come from widespread delusions.	94.0	111.0
201604	880	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We all know that societies are prone to mass delusion.	94.0	111.0
201604	881	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And I think the bubble we experienced in the 2000s was a housing bubble—that we believed home prices would only go up.	94.0	111.0
201604	882	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	It’s so difficult for an individual regulator to stand up to the country and say, “Hey, you’re all wrong.	94.0	111.0
201604	883	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We know better.	94.0	111.0
201604	884	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	You’re all wrong about where home prices are going.”	94.0	111.0
201604	885	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And it’s even harder to then say that we’re going to put the country in a recession, we feel so strongly about that.	94.0	111.0
201604	886	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So I think that some of the other macroprudential tools, even if they’re imperfect, could be more credible tools that we could reach for rather than saying, “We know better, and, as a result, we’re going to put the whole country into a recession.”	94.0	111.0
201604	887	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So I would like to see us further explore what tools we have available.	94.0	111.0
201604	888	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	One of the memos mentioned the idea of a shelf registration of certain policy tools.	94.0	111.0
201604	889	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I know countercyclical capital buffers are an example of that.	94.0	111.0
201604	890	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I would love to see us explore—I just don’t know the answer— how much power there is in shelf-registering potential tools that we could use at a future date.	94.0	111.0
201604	891	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I’d like to learn more about that.	94.0	111.0
201604	892	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And, finally, I also see the benefit of potentially using the bully pulpit.	94.0	111.0
201604	893	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The hardest part about all of this is for us to have confidence that it really is a bubble, and that we really should do something about it.	94.0	111.0
201604	894	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	If we really had confidence that there was a bubble and we should do something about it, if we spoke out about it with enough conviction long enough, I think we could have an effect on markets even if we don’t have a specific policy instrument at our disposal.	94.0	111.0
201604	895	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	94.0	111.0
201604	896	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201604	897	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	94.0	65.0
201604	898	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	110.0
201604	899	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And thank you to the authors of these papers and the team that worked on this project.	94.0	110.0
201604	900	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	When I think about financial stability, I tend to separate structural issues from cyclical issues, specifically cyclical excesses, such as market valuation, the level of risk-taking.	94.0	110.0
201604	901	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And in thinking about structural issues, I try to focus on five in particular, and should note that we’ve made good progress on many of these.	94.0	110.0
201604	902	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Number one, do we have enough capital adequacy in our financial institutions, both banks and large nonbanks?	94.0	110.0
201604	903	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Number two, is there liquidity of capital in a stress scenario?	94.0	110.0
201604	904	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	That is, can a balance sheet be “monetized” to provide capital?	94.0	110.0
201604	905	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I think our stress testing has gone a long way here.	94.0	110.0
201604	906	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The third one, which was extremely problematic in the last crisis, is the level of interconnectedness in the financial system.	94.0	110.0
201604	907	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This is harder to track because usually counterparty transactions are netted.	94.0	110.0
201604	908	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But we found in the last crisis that there were a significant number of counterparty transactions that caused a domino effect.	94.0	110.0
201604	909	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	By some estimates, there was as much as $80 to $90 trillion notional amount of CDS versus about $10 trillion of debt issued globally.	94.0	110.0
201604	910	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	AIG was obviously an example of a party that had a substantial number of counterparty transactions.	94.0	110.0
201604	911	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We need to track this so that you don’t have one weak institution potentially threatening others.	94.0	110.0
201604	912	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The fourth thing I watch is mismatches between asset liquidity and either duration or capital structure, which include redemption provisions.	94.0	110.0
201604	913	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	For example, recently we’ve talked more about these high-yield mutual funds, which have relatively illiquid assets but offer daily liquidity.	94.0	110.0
201604	914	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	That’s a good example of a structural issue that creates a financial instability.	94.0	110.0
201604	915	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It may not be big enough to create a systemic risk, but I view that as a structural issue.	94.0	110.0
201604	916	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And the fifth issue that I try to track is the overall debt relative to GDP in the economy by sector:  household sector, financial sector, nonfinancial businesses, and then the government.	94.0	110.0
201604	917	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	For example, what we found looking at the last crisis was that there was an extraordinarily high level of debt in the household sector relative to GDP, but it didn’t look that significant because of asset values in the household sector, particularly home prices.	94.0	110.0
201604	918	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Those are the five things that I still think, even sitting here today, we should keep track of.	94.0	110.0
201604	919	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It strikes me that, yes, all of these structural issues lend themselves to macroprudential tools as a first line of defense.	94.0	110.0
201604	920	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But they also require regulation from other entities outside the Fed, plus fiscal oversight, and that, through the FSOC and others, requires good coordination among agencies.	94.0	110.0
201604	921	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	As a second line of defense, I do believe that monetary policy does need to be cognizant of cyclical excesses.	94.0	110.0
201604	922	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Cyclical excesses can be dangerous because they amplify or expose structural faults.	94.0	110.0
201604	923	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And monetary policy, as a second line of defense, can certainly help damp some of these cyclical excesses.	94.0	110.0
201604	924	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I think we have made great progress in the United States through CCAR, stress tests, and all the good work that has been done to address many of these structural issues.	94.0	110.0
201604	925	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But the last issue that I’ll mention is that I’m conscious of the fact that many structural faults exist outside the United States in places like China, and those risks threaten to spill over to other countries.	94.0	110.0
201604	926	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We saw some evidence of an episode of this during the first four months of this year, when you saw structural faults in China threaten to create some destabilization in the rest of the world.	94.0	110.0
201604	927	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	When that happened, I thought it was a very appropriate time for monetary policy to act, in this case by not acting.	94.0	110.0
201604	928	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And I think that helped cushion instability that was created from outside the United States.	94.0	110.0
201604	929	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	As we go forward, we need to keep in mind that some structural issues may be as likely to occur outside the United States, and we’re going to find ourselves dealing with them without any, or very few, statutory tools.	94.0	110.0
201604	930	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In that regard, I believe that we will have to consider monetary policy as a second line of defense.	94.0	110.0
201604	931	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	94.0	110.0
201604	932	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201604	933	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	94.0	65.0
201604	934	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	104.0
201604	935	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	On these issues, I have for some time generally accepted the conventional wisdom that called for macroprudential tools as the primary line of defense and for monetary policy to be used rarely.	94.0	104.0
201604	936	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	But at the same time, I am quite uncomfortable with the implications of that recommendation and whether we really have an understanding of why that is the right approach.	94.0	104.0
201604	937	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	And part of that discomfort is just having been familiar with work by Jeremy Stein and many others, including some of you around the table, which calls those things into question for various reasons.	94.0	104.0
201604	938	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	I would say these excellent memos and today’s discussion have, I hope, moved me closer to clarity, but certainly not all the way there.	94.0	104.0
201604	939	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	As these papers and the wider literature illustrate, many of the fundamental questions concerning the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability remain unsettled.	94.0	104.0
201604	940	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	There’s significant uncertainty about our ability to identify threats ex ante and how to think about the tradeoff between type I and type II errors.	94.0	104.0
201604	941	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	The effectiveness of our macroprudential tools is untested.	94.0	104.0
201604	942	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	It’s not clear whether and under what circumstances monetary policy is likely to reduce threats to financial stability without imposing too high a cost.	94.0	104.0
201604	943	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	All of this suggests to me that, as President Mester suggested, the road to achieving an addition to the consensus statement in which we were all agreeing on the relationship between monetary policy and macroprudential and financial stability could well be a long and challenging one.	94.0	104.0
201604	944	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Although I regard the question as somewhat unsettled, my working view is that regulation, including macroprudential policies, should be the primary line of defense against financial instability.	94.0	104.0
201604	945	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	In the United States, increasing the system’s overall resiliency with through-the-cycle policies seems like our best available tool for addressing these risks.	94.0	104.0
201604	946	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Higher capital ratios, larger holdings of liquid assets, and the near elimination of “runnable” bank debt have made the banking system and our overall financial system safer.	94.0	104.0
201604	947	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	If these measures had been in place before the financial crisis, I feel fairly sure that the consequences would have been much less severe.	94.0	104.0
201604	948	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	The efficacy of time-varying tools remains questionable.	94.0	104.0
201604	949	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	CCAR could be used in a targeted and reasonably timely way if financial-stability risks pertain primarily to the banking system.	94.0	104.0
201604	950	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	But the interagency process is slow and will remain so, inadequately addressing problems even in cases in which there is direct authority to do so.	94.0	104.0
201604	951	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	I don’t expect that to change.	94.0	104.0
201604	952	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	There are also important sectors of the financial system in which transparency and the reach of macroprudential tools are limited, and I don’t expect that to change either.	94.0	104.0
201604	953	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	All that said, some of the research comes very close to saying that monetary policy is simply the wrong tool and highly unlikely to ever play a constructive role in addressing threats to financial stability.	94.0	104.0
201604	954	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	And I am uncomfortable—like, it sounds, others around the table are—with categorical statements about what one will or will not do in a crisis.	94.0	104.0
201604	955	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Several have noted that humility is an appropriate watchword here.	94.0	104.0
201604	956	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	I think Mike Tyson actually said it so much more colorfully when he noted that everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.	94.0	104.0
201604	957	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	[Laughter]	94.0	104.0
201604	958	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	In unusual circumstances, therefore, I could be open to using monetary policy to address financial stability threats.	94.0	104.0
201604	959	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	There would be an obvious tension between moving early before the evidence is clear and waiting too long for clarity.	94.0	104.0
201604	960	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	And, of course, the earlier the intervention, the less clear it would be that higher rates would actually reduce the already very low probability of a financial crisis.	94.0	104.0
201604	961	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Despite these challenges, though, there are two key features of the US context that call for keeping one’s mind open and that I don’t think are adequately faced by the literature.	94.0	104.0
201604	962	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	First, as many have mentioned, the US institutional setting is very challenging for macroprudential policy, with our unwieldy regulatory apparatus and vibrant shadow banking sector.	94.0	104.0
201604	963	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Second, while this is not my baseline, it’s plausible to me that rates will have to remain very low for a very long time to achieve stable prices and full employment, but that such low rates will drive excessive credit growth and create irresistible upward pressure on asset prices, including real estate prices.	94.0	104.0
201604	964	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	I’m thinking of a situation in which a broad range of asset prices are moving up well beyond what fundamentals would justify; where the other tools we have don’t seem to be addressing the problem or have failed to do so; and where low interest rates are pushing up asset prices and driving credit to excessive levels, probably over many years, and thus are a principal cause of the threat.	94.0	104.0
201604	965	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Recalling that we have had two major real estate blowups in the past 25 years, I would not rule out a policy of leaning against the wind in such a case as one tool among many.	94.0	104.0
201604	966	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	104.0
201604	967	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201604	968	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	94.0	65.0
201604	969	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	96.0
201604	970	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	First, I want to thank the staff for their thoughtful memos.	94.0	96.0
201604	971	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I thought that how you framed the discussion was great.	94.0	96.0
201604	972	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	While I agree that macroprudential policy measures are the primary instruments through which policy “should,” with quotes around it, promote financial stability, I view the institutional constraints in the United States as making this very difficult to operationalize in practice.	94.0	96.0
201604	973	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that the diffusion of responsibility among many different regulatory agencies and the differences in mandates across these agencies are very important constraints.	94.0	96.0
201604	974	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In my own experience, a number of regulatory agencies do not seem to give much weight, if any, to broad financial stability objectives.	94.0	96.0
201604	975	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In particular, they do not appear to place much emphasis on the effect of how the behavior of any particular firm generates externalities that affect other firms and the broader financial system.	94.0	96.0
201604	976	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thus, rules and regulations tend to have a microprudential focus and a consumer and investor protection focus rather than being oriented toward mitigating risks to the broader financial system.	94.0	96.0
201604	977	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s also a meaningful coordination problem, which suggests that implementing macroprudential tools in a timely way would be very difficult to do in practice.	94.0	96.0
201604	978	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes, we do have the FSOC.	94.0	96.0
201604	979	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But the reality is that the individual agencies guard their prerogatives, and the fact that the FSOC is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury—part of the executive branch—can introduce a political element in the pursuit of its responsibilities.	94.0	96.0
201604	980	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So under the US institutional setup, I think tools that work automatically through-the-cycle might be more effective than those that would have to be implemented on a more discretionary basis.	94.0	96.0
201604	981	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But such automatic tools are difficult to design and calibrate in a world in which the threats in the future are likely to differ significantly from those in the past.	94.0	96.0
201604	982	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	When you think about the different bubbles we’ve had over the past 30 or 40 years, they’re all very, very different.	94.0	96.0
201604	983	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And I imagine that one set of tools that would work very well over the cycle for one set of bubbles might not be totally adequate for another.	94.0	96.0
201604	984	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	As a result, I don’t view macroprudential policies as being at a level of maturity in the United States that we would likely be able to deploy them very successfully to achieve our financial stability objectives.	94.0	96.0
201604	985	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, I do think a number of policies that have up to now been primarily microprudential in nature, such as CCAR, CLAR, and supervisory guidance, could also be used to achieve macroprudential objectives.	94.0	96.0
201604	986	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I suspect that having a CCAR stress test include a significant stress to one particular asset class or activity that we were concerned about from a financial stability perspective—take commercial real estate lending as an example—could influence the credit provision to that sector by driving up the shadow price of capital for that activity.	94.0	96.0
201604	987	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	This suggests to me that we should do more work in three areas:  First, work with other regulatory agencies to sensitize them to the importance of financial stability and to broaden our collective macroprudential toolkit; second, continue to develop how our microprudential instruments could be adapted to pursue macroprudential objectives; and, third, explore in what circumstances monetary policy might play a role.	94.0	96.0
201604	988	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Can it be used effectively to fill in the cracks, or are its financial stability effects likely to be very limited relative to the consequences to broad macroeconomic activity?	94.0	96.0
201604	989	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And what’s the cost-benefit tradeoff here?	94.0	96.0
201604	990	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to monetary policy, I have to admit some skepticism about its efficacy to achieve financial stability objectives.	94.0	96.0
201604	991	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	As I see it, in most cases the benefits of a tighter monetary policy in curbing excess in a particular sector are likely to be outweighed by the costs in terms of greater deviations from the Committee’s medium-term employment and inflation objectives.	94.0	96.0
201604	992	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But I think this conclusion depends on the particular circumstances.	94.0	96.0
201604	993	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, how big the sector is and how sensitive it is to monetary policy probably matter in terms of that cost-benefit tradeoff.	94.0	96.0
201604	994	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If the sector that is out of balance is large—think residential housing—and that sector is very sensitive to interest rates, then I would think the benefits of monetary policy would likely be higher.	94.0	96.0
201604	995	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, monetary policy might be useful in terms of signaling our concern.	94.0	96.0
201604	996	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	One thing we didn’t talk about very much today was expectations, and I think expectations do matter.	94.0	96.0
201604	997	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And if the central bank protested against how a sector was evolving, this might result in meaningful changes in behavior beyond those just generated by the change in the prospective path of short- term interest rates.	94.0	96.0
201604	998	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In monetary policy, we really have a very well developed theory of how these expectations tend to influence behavior.	94.0	96.0
201604	999	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We don’t really seem to have that same work developed on the macroprudential side yet.	94.0	96.0
201604	1000	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I recall how the Carter Administration’s implementation of credit controls in the spring of 1980—and one could argue that was a macroprudential measure—had a very powerful effect well before the controls actually were binding.	94.0	96.0
201604	1001	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, this was not a particularly successful experiment, as it worked a lot more effectively than they imagined.	94.0	96.0
201604	1002	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But it does, I think, underscore the importance of expectations.	94.0	96.0
201604	1003	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So the bottom line for me is, I wouldn’t rule out using monetary policy to achieve financial stability objectives, but I certainly would try to use microprudential and macroprudential tools first to the extent that that was feasible.	94.0	96.0
201604	1004	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	96.0
201604	1005	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	94.0	65.0
201604	1006	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	It’s maybe a bit unfair to have the first word and then try to have one of the last words, but I did want to make a couple of observations about the tenor of the conversation.	94.0	97.0
201604	1007	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	First, I guess I don’t agree with those who say that we understand how monetary policy works really well, we just don’t understand how macroprudential policies work.	94.0	97.0
201604	1008	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I’ve spent seven years here being surprised at how much uncertainty there actually is on the transmission mechanisms for monetary policy.	94.0	97.0
201604	1009	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I keep coming back to our reliance on inflation expectations—something that’s undertheorized, undocumented, and hard to pin down empirically.	94.0	97.0
201604	1010	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	So while there’s certainly more work to be done, I just don’t think it’s as radical a distinction as some have suggested.	94.0	97.0
201604	1011	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	A corollary to that—and this is what I thought Stan and I were trying to get at early on, without success—is, in thinking about the idea, it’s not just popping bubbles.	94.0	97.0
201604	1012	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	The popping bubbles thing is an enormous problem.	94.0	97.0
201604	1013	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	If you get to the point at which you have the bubble and you’re going to try to use monetary policy to pop it, then the sort of thing Charlie was talking about is absolutely going to ensue.	94.0	97.0
201604	1014	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	But, presumably, monetary policy, and how it operates and what effects it has, differs across conditions of countries as well as within particular economies as those economies and their financial systems evolve.	94.0	97.0
201604	1015	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I think we at least have to be somewhat open to the possibility that the ways in which our economy and financial system have evolved are such that it’s not just a Hippocratic Oath thing in which you can’t use monetary policy to do something about financial stability because you may do harm.	94.0	97.0
201604	1016	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	It may be, and I underscore may be, that monetary policy itself is creating some of the problem.	94.0	97.0
201604	1017	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I think we just, intellectually, need to be a bit more open to that.	94.0	97.0
201604	1018	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	You know, there are many times in the past two years when I’ve missed having Jeremy on this corridor.	94.0	97.0
201604	1019	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Today is way high up on my list of times when I wish Jeremy were here to give what I regard as his very powerful, somewhat alternative view of the way in which monetary policy operates.	94.0	97.0
201604	1020	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Can I ask you just a clarifying question about what you’re talking about?	94.0	91.0
201604	1021	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Because I thought that the premise of what I was talking about was, you’re about to make a monetary policy decision on the basis of how you think the economy is going, and then all of a sudden somebody says, “Wait a minute.	94.0	91.0
201604	1022	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Financial stability is more of a problem.”	94.0	91.0
201604	1023	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Then you do something different, and that’s presumably going to push you away from what you thought you were trying to achieve.	94.0	91.0
201604	1024	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	That’s the context.	94.0	91.0
201604	1025	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Charlie, the point I was trying to make—and I think a number of other people did try to make—was, it is not at all clear that there is a sharp distinction between the traditional dual-mandate and financial stability considerations.	94.0	97.0
201604	1026	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	And that is certainly the case in the way in which some have described the situation in which if you pursue a monetary policy that raises a reasonably high risk of a financial stress period resulting in the diminution of employment and, indeed, of inflation, then you can question whether, just within the dual mandate, you’ve perceived the proper policy.	94.0	97.0
201604	1027	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Now, that depends on your own assessment of what those causal relationships are, but I was trying to suggest that it’s something that, intellectually, is perhaps more appropriately on the table than some would have it.	94.0	97.0
201604	1028	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	All right.	94.0	97.0
201604	1029	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Let’s put aside the intellectual stuff for a second.	94.0	97.0
201604	1030	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I really want to underscore just the practical things, which Governor Brainard, President Kaplan, and several other people mentioned.	94.0	97.0
201604	1031	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	First, the “we” of the FOMC has only one tool—or set of tools, but it’s basically with regard to monetary policy.	94.0	97.0
201604	1032	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	We don’t have all these regulatory, supervisory, other tools.	94.0	97.0
201604	1033	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Now, a subset of us has some more, but not unlimited ones.	94.0	97.0
201604	1034	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I really do think it’s important to consider how we would react, in view of all the things that we don’t like about the absence of tools and the fact that I have been singularly unsuccessful in getting the market regulators to think in terms of prudential market regulation.	94.0	97.0
201604	1035	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think we still need to think about that.	94.0	97.0
201604	1036	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Moreover, you can’t just fall back on saying, “The Board needs to do a better job in regulating and supervising financial institutions.”	94.0	97.0
201604	1037	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	The reasons for that, I think, are pretty self- evident.	94.0	97.0
201604	1038	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	We’ve already seen, as we increase regulatory requirements—which I am all for, as people know—you begin to see leakage out of the system.	94.0	97.0
201604	1039	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	And the longer we have tougher requirements in place, the more incentive there’s going to be for those who to this point have not tried to create synthetically large balance sheets in order to do things that right now only a Citi or a J.P.	94.0	97.0
201604	1040	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Morgan can do.	94.0	97.0
201604	1041	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	There’s going to be more incentive to do that.	94.0	97.0
201604	1042	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	And so even if you think the Board has the responsibility for being tough on banks and all of that, that’s not going to be effective over the medium term, either.	94.0	97.0
201604	1043	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	And so I think we have to contemplate, as I said earlier, the world as it may be.	94.0	97.0
201604	1044	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	What I worry about is that some people just want to say, “It’s somebody else’s problem.	94.0	97.0
201604	1045	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	It’s not our problem.”	94.0	97.0
201604	1046	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Just as, in the fiscal area, we may wish that some people did a better job—and several of you may wish that the five of us did a better job than you think we’re doing—but that’s going to be the case sometimes.	94.0	97.0
201604	1047	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	And that’s what I want to think about.	94.0	97.0
201604	1048	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, President Kashkari, I’m not too worried about the fact that you couldn’t get everybody at the Minneapolis Federal Reserve to agree.	94.0	97.0
201604	1049	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	You’ve only been here a few months.	94.0	97.0
201604	1050	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I’ve been here seven years.	94.0	97.0
201604	1051	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	You can never get everyone around this table to agree.	94.0	97.0
201604	1052	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	94.0	97.0
201604	1053	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	But we still have to make decisions sometimes.	94.0	97.0
201604	1054	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Sorry, Madam Chair.	94.0	97.0
201604	1055	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	94.0	65.0
201604	1056	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me just wrap up quickly so we can get to lunch.	94.0	65.0
201604	1057	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	I want to again thank all the staff involved in this effort for your work and thank everyone around the table for very thoughtful comments and for sharing your views.	94.0	65.0
201604	1058	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think, listening to what I heard around the table, the bottom line is that everyone recognizes how important macroprudential tools are and the progress we have made, at least in putting in place through-the-cycle or earthquake-type policies to strengthen the banking system and other aspects of the financial system as well.	94.0	65.0
201604	1059	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	But I’ve also heard most of you recognize that we have very significant gaps in our toolkit and that the framework for coordination among US agencies in implementing macroprudential policy leaves much to be desired.	94.0	65.0
201604	1060	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	On occasion there have been political constraints in deploying these policies.	94.0	65.0
201604	1061	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	And probably the legislative framework in place for the various regulators to take account of systemic risk, as opposed to narrower mandates, leaves many holes and gaps in the macroprudential framework to address financial-stability risks.	94.0	65.0
201604	1062	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Everybody recognizes how costly it could be to use monetary policy to address financial stability threats, in view of the potential cost to achieving our macroeconomic goals.	94.0	65.0
201604	1063	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	But on the other hand, I think what I’ve heard most of you recognize is, the bottom line probably should be to never say never, and that there could potentially be situations in which we might want this Committee to take financial stability considerations into account.	94.0	65.0
201604	1064	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Those situations might be limited.	94.0	65.0
201604	1065	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	But it’s probably important to think more seriously about what those situations might be, whether we could identify them, and how to address them.	94.0	65.0
201604	1066	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think perhaps a natural starting place would be to ask President Rosengren and Governor Fischer  for your committees to collaborate in thinking about what further work we could do or exercises we might have.	94.0	65.0
201604	1067	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	I will talk with the staff, and we’ll try to follow up and consider what more we could do in terms of research and analysis that would clarify what those situations might be in which it would be important for this Committee to be thinking about financial stability concerns in our design of monetary policy.	94.0	65.0
201604	1068	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you all for a very useful, thoughtful discussion, and let’s take a break for lunch.	94.0	65.0
201604	1070	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, folks.	52.0	65.0
201604	1071	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s move along in our agenda to item 2, and I’m going to call on Simon to deliver the first part of the Desk briefing.	61.0	65.0
201604	1072	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Thank you Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201604	1073	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	I’ll first cover global financial market developments.	61.0	999.0
201604	1074	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Lorie will then review money markets and Desk operations, and I’ll conclude with a discussion of the results of the Desk’s recent strategic review of the foreign portfolio investment framework.	61.0	999.0
201604	1075	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	The stabilization and recovery in global risk asset prices that started in mid- February continued into April.	61.0	999.0
201604	1076	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	This is reflected in a broad easing across key measures of domestic financial conditions over the intermeeting period, as shown in the top-left panel of the first exhibit, with interest rates lower, the dollar weaker, equity prices higher, and credit spreads narrower.	61.0	999.0
201604	1077	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	However, compared with levels prevailing just before to last August’s RMB devaluation, financial conditions are more mixed.	61.0	999.0
201604	1078	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	To gain insight into the relative importance of various factors driving global financial markets, we again included a special question in the Desk surveys, but this time we asked for a ranking of factors that calmed markets, rather than the March question on factors that had sparked volatility.	61.0	999.0
201604	1079	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	To allow direct comparison with the results of the March question, we asked respondents to rate the same set of factors.	61.0	999.0
201604	1080	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-right panel, on average, Chinese FX developments and volatility in oil markets again received high ratings, likely reflecting the calming effects of the moderation in RMB volatility and the increase in oil prices above $40 over the period.	61.0	999.0
201604	1081	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	One notable feature of the results is that FOMC policy was identified as a more important factor in calming the volatility than it was in creating it.	61.0	999.0
201604	1082	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	The individual responses, not shown, are especially striking, with most respondents giving a higher rating to FOMC policy as a calming rather than a sparking factor.	61.0	999.0
201604	1083	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Moreover, in aggregate, buy-side respondents ranked Federal Reserve policy above all other factors in explaining the recent decline in volatility.	61.0	999.0
201604	1084	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	A consistent feature in the Desk’s April surveys was, buy-side respondents are expecting a more aggressive response from the FOMC to deviations from what they perceive as mandate- consistent trajectories.	61.0	999.0
201604	1085	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	More generally, numerous market participants have pointed to an increased focus by the FOMC on global financial developments over recent months as a significant change in emphasis.	61.0	999.0
201604	1086	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Steve will discuss this more in his briefing.	61.0	999.0
201604	1087	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Some of this sentiment was clearly driven by the March FOMC events and the Chair’s subsequent speech and is directly reflected in a notable adjustment in market participants’ near-term policy expectations.	61.0	999.0
201604	1088	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	More specifically, short-term interest rates fell sharply around the March meeting, driven by declines in the medians of the SEP policy rate forecasts and the explicit reference in the statement to risks posed from abroad.	61.0	999.0
201604	1089	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-left panel, the two-year Treasury yield fell 11 basis points on the day of the meeting—a large adjustment, though consistent with historical responses to the raw changes in the median SEP projections.	61.0	999.0
201604	1090	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	At the most recent meeting, Thomas and I tried to reassure President Williams that markets would be more nuanced than just looking at the raw change in the median dots, particularly given the expectations for a 25 basis point drop in the median dots.	61.0	999.0
201604	1091	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	The record presented in the panel is more consistent with the headline effect of the SEP change being the driving force behind market reactions.	61.0	999.0
201604	1092	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	The market-implied probability of a rate hike at or before the June meeting declined significantly over the period, as shown by the light blue line in the middle- right panel.	61.0	999.0
201604	1093	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	On the basis of current market pricing, the probability of a rate hike at the April meeting is effectively zero, and the probability at the June meeting has declined to about 20 percent.	61.0	999.0
201604	1094	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Responses to the Desk’s most recent surveys are in line with this market pricing, with the average probability assigned to a June hike at 22 percent.	61.0	999.0
201604	1095	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Some market contacts think that for a rate increase to be delivered in June, the FOMC would have to start preparing the market as soon as this meeting’s statement.	61.0	999.0
201604	1096	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	For context, compared with the experience last year ahead of liftoff, as shown in the dark blue line, the market-based probability of a rate hike at or before the June meeting is currently below the probability of a hike that was priced in the same number of days ahead of the December meeting.	61.0	999.0
201604	1097	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	The market-implied path of the policy rate continued to shift down over the period, as seen in the bottom-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201604	1098	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Prior to the March meeting, a 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate target range was fully priced in by the fourth quarter of 2016, but this was pushed out to mid-2017 in response to key FOMC communications over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201604	1099	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	The survey-implied mean path of policy also shifted down.	61.0	999.0
201604	1100	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	In particular, in the scenario in which the policy rate does not return to the zero bound in the next three years, market participants anticipate the policy rate will be raised more gradually than previously expected.	61.0	999.0
201604	1101	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Medium- and longer-term US Treasury yields fell modestly, on net, over the period.	61.0	999.0
201604	1102	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Market contacts largely attributed the declines to easier monetary policy abroad, which in turn prompted inflows into US Treasury securities, particularly because, as shown in the bottom-right panel, yields on Treasury securities are high relative to yields on sovereign bonds in other G-7 countries.	61.0	999.0
201604	1103	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Over the period, declines in US real yields outpaced declines in nominal yields, leaving market-based measures of US inflation compensation slightly higher.	61.0	999.0
201604	1104	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Inflation compensation moved up with the more accommodative FOMC communications and gains in oil prices, then fell back somewhat in response to below-consensus inflation data in mid- April.	61.0	999.0
201604	1105	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Lower domestic short-term rate expectations led to a slight narrowing of interest rate differentials between the United States and other countries, as shown in the top- left panel of exhibit 2.	61.0	999.0
201604	1106	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	The narrowing spread contributed to a decline of 2.6 percent in the Bloomberg Dollar Index over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201604	1107	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	This brought the cumulative decline in the index over the past two intermeeting periods to over 5 percent—the largest such decline since the financial crisis, with significant declines associated with FOMC communication.	61.0	999.0
201604	1108	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Incrementally contributing to the dollar move, some market participants discussed the possibility of an informal currency agreement brokered at the February G-20 meeting.	61.0	999.0
201604	1109	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Both the weaker dollar and the more gradual expected path of US policy rate increases were perceived by market contacts as supporting domestic risk asset prices over the period.	61.0	999.0
201604	1110	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-right panel, the S&P 500 returned to early August 2015 levels and is currently within 2 percent of its all-time nominal high.	61.0	999.0
201604	1111	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Further, option-adjusted spreads on high-yield corporate bonds continued to narrow, mirroring an increase in oil prices as the energy subindex accounted for the majority of the improvement.	61.0	999.0
201604	1112	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Investors generally perceived China as less of a near-term risk factor this intermeeting period than earlier in the year amid stability in the renminbi–dollar exchange rate, additional easing measures in China, and perceptions that easing measures are gaining traction.	61.0	999.0
201604	1113	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Market participants suggested the broad depreciation of the US dollar helped ease pressure on the RMB and lessened the urgency for Chinese officials to provide more clarity on its exchange rate policy.	61.0	999.0
201604	1114	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Market expectations for a sharp devaluation of the renminbi declined, as reflected in the middle-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201604	1115	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	The relative cost of protection against a depreciation of the RMB, as implied by options, eased to the lowest level this year, and similar measures of volatility also subsided.	61.0	999.0
201604	1116	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Beyond China, sentiment toward emerging markets also perked up, supported by a trifecta of tailwinds:  lower US interest rates, the stabilization in oil prices, and moderating concerns over China.	61.0	999.0
201604	1117	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-right panel, EM equity and bond funds registered their first consecutive months of net inflows since 2014, and an index of broad EM ex China currencies increased against the dollar alongside the shift in capital flows.	61.0	999.0
201604	1118	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	The MSCI EM equity index rose 6.8 percent, extending its strong year-to-date performance despite the January financial market volatility.	61.0	999.0
201604	1119	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	The global search for yield also benefited EM assets, as illustrated by Argentina’s return to the international bond market after a 15-year absence.	61.0	999.0
201604	1120	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Despite the continued stabilization and recovery in risk assets over the period, concerns regarding longer-running global themes persist.	61.0	999.0
201604	1121	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Market contacts continued to question the monetary policy efficacy of the Bank of Japan and, to a lesser extent, the European Central Bank.	61.0	999.0
201604	1122	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Foreign exchange markets continue to send the strongest signal:  Since these two central banks added incremental accommodation in January and March, respectively, both the euro and yen have appreciated notably versus the dollar, as shown in the bottom-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201604	1123	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	In fact, despite the combined force of the yen’s recent sharp appreciation, expectations for the BOJ to add accommodation, and mounting expectations for intervention to weaken the currency, net positioning by speculative investors for further yen appreciation has reached its highest level since the 1990s.	61.0	999.0
201604	1124	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	For both the BOJ and ECB, market commentary continues to question the ability of available tools to realize their policy objectives.	61.0	999.0
201604	1125	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Indeed, five-year, five-year inflation swap rates in the euro area and Japan have fallen since the two central banks announced their respective large easing measures, and banks have continued to struggle in the low-growth and negative interest rate environment.	61.0	999.0
201604	1126	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Elsewhere, a new global risk came into focus—the UK referendum vote on European Union membership on June 23.	61.0	999.0
201604	1127	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	The outcome is currently seen as a close call by market participants.	61.0	999.0
201604	1128	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-right panel, market participants seem to be pricing in substantial event risk in the foreign exchange market:  The relative cost of protection against a large sterling depreciation against the dollar rose discretely as the related option expiration date spanned the referendum date.	61.0	999.0
201604	1129	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	More directly relevant to US monetary policy, several market participants have suggested the referendum could present an obstacle to any desire by the FOMC to tighten policy in June, due to the possibility of widespread volatility in European financial markets following a “leave” vote in the referendum and amid a perceived increased responsiveness of monetary policy to global developments.	61.0	999.0
201604	1130	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	Our experience during the intermeeting period continued to suggest the operational framework has been effective in maintaining control over the effective federal funds rate.	61.0	999.0
201604	1131	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the dark blue line in the top-left panel of your next exhibit, the effective federal funds rate continued to print at the center of the target range outside quarter-end.	61.0	999.0
201604	1132	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	On March quarter-end, the effective rate printed at 25 basis points, a smaller decline than the change observed on December 31.	61.0	999.0
201604	1133	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	This control also continues to extend to other money market rates.	61.0	999.0
201604	1134	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	The overnight Treasury GCF rate, shown as the dark red line, mostly continued to trade in the upper half of the target range.	61.0	999.0
201604	1135	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	This series provides an indication of the rate at which some dealers that are perceived as less creditworthy can finance Treasury securities, and it is also a useful proxy for the rate at which some buy-side firms obtain financing for these securities.	61.0	999.0
201604	1136	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	The broader overnight Treasury triparty repo rate, excluding GCF and Federal Reserve RRPs—the rate at which stronger dealers tend to obtain financing from money funds and other cash investors, shown in the light red line— generally traded in the lower half of the range.	61.0	999.0
201604	1137	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	Treasury bill rates declined modestly, as shown by the light blue line, as Treasury bill issuance began its typical seasonal decline associated with the April tax receipts.	61.0	999.0
201604	1138	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	The stability of the effective rate and other money market rates has come in the context of low usage of the overnight RRP facility, as shown in the top-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201604	1139	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	Excluding the March quarter-end, when demand for the facility increased to $304 billion, overnight RRP usage averaged less than $50 billion over the intermeeting period and reached a trough last seen in December 2013.	61.0	999.0
201604	1140	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants have attributed the low usage to the larger supply of—and, in most cases, higher rates offered by—other money market investments.	61.0	999.0
201604	1141	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle- left panel, supply of these assets has increased since last year despite the more recent seasonal tick-down in Treasury bill supply that I just mentioned.	61.0	999.0
201604	1142	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	Although overnight RRP usage has been low—certainly lower than market participants’ expectations before liftoff—cash investors continue to suggest the facility enhances their bargaining power when negotiating rates on money market instruments.	61.0	999.0
201604	1143	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	In any case, low usage may not persist for two reasons.	61.0	999.0
201604	1144	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	First, estimates are for Treasury bill supply to fall roughly another $120 billion through the end of June.	61.0	999.0
201604	1145	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	This should put further downward pressure on Treasury bill rates and limit investors’ reinvestment options when their existing bill holdings mature, particularly for government money funds.	61.0	999.0
201604	1146	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	Second, there is considerable uncertainty regarding how SEC money market fund reform, which takes full effect this October, will affect demand for different money market instruments, including Federal Reserve RRP.	61.0	999.0
201604	1147	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	As we’ve discussed in the past, the reforms are expected to lead to flows from prime funds into government funds, increasing demand for government securities and repo investments, which could include Federal Reserve RRPs.	61.0	999.0
201604	1148	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the dark blue bar in the middle-right panel, the conversion of prime funds into government funds is well under way, with Federal Reserve RRP counterparty prime funds totaling $225 billion in AUM already having switched to become government funds.	61.0	999.0
201604	1149	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	About $800 billion in prime funds, the red bar, have announced that they will not convert, while another $330 billion is yet to be determined.	61.0	999.0
201604	1150	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	So far, the money fund industry appears to be adjusting smoothly to the new reforms.	61.0	999.0
201604	1151	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	However, it’s important to note that it may not be clear for some time how end investors will respond to these changes.	61.0	999.0
201604	1152	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	Money fund preparations for upcoming SEC reforms continue to affect the RRP counterparty list.	61.0	999.0
201604	1153	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	Over the intermeeting period, 5 RRP counterparties were removed from the list.	61.0	999.0
201604	1154	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	Money fund counterparties now total 105, with total RRP counterparties at 138.	61.0	999.0
201604	1155	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	I should note that the staff continues progress on the broader Desk counterparty framework, which we intend to bring to the Committee in the fall.	61.0	999.0
201604	1156	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	As part of this framework, we intend to clarify that our counterparties for foreign exchange operations will be required to adhere to best practices, including the FX global code of conduct, which is in the process of being established under the umbrella of the BIS Foreign Exchange Working Group.	61.0	999.0
201604	1157	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	A draft of part of this code will be released publicly in late May, and the full code will be finalized next year.	61.0	999.0
201604	1158	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	As discussed in the memo sent to the Committee on April 19, we request that the Committee vote to renew the standing liquidity swap lines with the Bank of Canada, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, ECB, and Swiss National Bank, as well as the North America Framework Agreement, or NAFA, arrangements with the central banks of Canada and Mexico.	61.0	999.0
201604	1159	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	The liquidity swap lines and NAFA arrangements are a tangible and constructive signal of cooperation among central banks, and we view the costs of maintaining the lines as minimal.	61.0	999.0
201604	1160	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	The liquidity swap lines also support the approach that the Federal Reserve, along with other major central banks, endorsed that there are “no technical obstacles” to central bank capabilities to provide liquidity quickly to a systemically important financial market utility.	61.0	999.0
201604	1161	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	In this context, the Desk annually tests its NTO operational framework with the Bank of England and recently finalized a similar NTO framework with the Bank of Canada.	61.0	999.0
201604	1162	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	Importantly, reauthorization does not constitute automatic approval of any request to use the lines.	61.0	999.0
201604	1163	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	All drawings are subject to the approval of the Chair in consultation with the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, and the Chair or subcommittee would consult with the FOMC, if possible, before the initial drawing on the dollar or foreign currency liquidity swap lines.	61.0	999.0
201604	1164	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	Foreign central bank counterparts support the renewal of these arrangements.	61.0	999.0
201604	1165	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the bottom-left panel, recent usage of the swap lines has been low.	61.0	999.0
201604	1166	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	Other than occasional increases in the cost of dollar funding on quarter-ends, it remains cost effective to obtain dollar funding through the FX swaps market.	61.0	999.0
201604	1167	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	That said, FX swap bases, which represent the cost of dollar funding via the FX swap market minus the cost of funding directly, have widened over the past two years, particularly for the euro and yen, as shown in the bottom-right panel and also discussed in Tealbook A.	61.0	999.0
201604	1168	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants do not believe this increase indicates acute dollar liquidity pressure.	61.0	999.0
201604	1169	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	Instead, they argue that divergent monetary policy stances have contributed to an imbalance between the demand for dollar-denominated assets and the supply of euro- and yen-denominated liabilities, and that increased balance sheet costs, in part as a result of regulatory reforms, have made it more costly for banks to provide the FX swaps liquidity needed to arbitrage the difference in dollar borrowing costs.	61.0	999.0
201604	1170	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	On a final swaps-related note, the Desk recently conducted a small-value exercise to draw euros from the ECB.	61.0	999.0
201604	1171	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	The test was not fully successful, as a delay in trade execution and confirmation prevented the movement of euros before the close of the euro area’s payment system—though in an actual period of financial stress, the ECB may have agreed to extend operating hours.	61.0	999.0
201604	1172	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	The experience highlights, though, the value of these exercises in identifying risks to our operations.	61.0	999.0
201604	1173	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	A summary of the other small-value exercises conducted over the intermeeting period, along with a list of upcoming intended exercises, is shown in the appendix of your handout.	61.0	999.0
201604	1174	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	Finally, to follow up on the previous meeting’s update on SOMA foreign exchange reserves holdings, I wanted to report that total interest income on the portfolio remained marginally positive in March, at about $100,000.	61.0	999.0
201604	1175	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel of your final exhibit, we anticipate that income on the euro portfolio will turn negative in April.	61.0	999.0
201604	1176	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	And although yen portfolio income will likely remain positive, we estimate that total income, which is not shown, will be negative.	61.0	999.0
201604	1177	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	April income will be reported publicly for the first time in late May in the financial statement of the Treasury Exchange Stabilization Fund, which the Desk manages in an identical manner to the SOMA portfolio.	61.0	999.0
201604	1178	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	The experience of investing the foreign portfolio in a negative rate environment has highlighted the need for a more systematic framework for the investment of the portfolio, one that would be more flexible to changes in market conditions or policymakers’ preferences.	61.0	999.0
201604	1179	2016-04-27	meeting	LOGAN	The staff recently completed a strategic review of the portfolio with these goals in mind, and Simon will now discuss that in more detail.	61.0	999.0
201604	1180	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	As discussed in the memo I sent to the Committee on April 18 and outlined in the top-right panel, the review addressed the policy purpose for holding FX reserves, the investment approach, and the internal processes that support ongoing FX reserve management.	61.0	999.0
201604	1181	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	As we conducted the review, we received feedback from the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and US Treasury officials.	61.0	999.0
201604	1182	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	As Lorie just noted, it’s important to bear in mind that we manage the ESF and SOMA portfolios identically.	61.0	999.0
201604	1183	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Both the size and currency composition of the portfolios were taken as given, although we intend to think further about those issues in a subsequent stage of the project.	61.0	999.0
201604	1184	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Historically, the Desk has managed the portfolio by laddering investments in eligible assets evenly across maturities, subject to a duration limit.	61.0	999.0
201604	1185	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	The staff’s proposed new investment framework establishes a process for assessing policymakers’ investment preferences for the period ahead and uses a more robust risk–return methodology that incorporates those preferences.	61.0	999.0
201604	1186	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	As described in the middle-left panel, the new investment framework has five steps, each intended to be periodically reassessed.	61.0	999.0
201604	1187	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	The first step is to establish the policy purpose for holding FX reserves.	61.0	999.0
201604	1188	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	The staff’s assessment is that the purpose of the portfolio is to provide resources that can be used to conduct purchases of US dollars, giving policymakers an important tool with which to counter disorderly conditions in FX markets and influence the exchange value of the dollar.	61.0	999.0
201604	1189	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	The Federal Reserve and the US Treasury—the US monetary authorities—have closely coordinated on such operations since 1962, although, of course, the Treasury has the lead role in setting US exchange rate policy.	61.0	999.0
201604	1190	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	The second step is to establish the investment objectives.	61.0	999.0
201604	1191	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Our assessment is that the primary investment objective of the portfolio is liquidity, as the timing and size of an FX intervention cannot be known in advance.	61.0	999.0
201604	1192	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	We propose that the next objective is safety, which translates into a strong preference for low-risk investments, and that the final objective is return, which suggests that the portfolio should be invested to earn the highest expected rate of return in view of policymakers’ risk preferences.	61.0	999.0
201604	1193	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	The third step is to determine funding needs, estimating the amount of funding that US monetary authorities are likely to require in the event of an intervention to purchase dollars.	61.0	999.0
201604	1194	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	In view of recent history, our current estimates for funding needs are based on the assumption that US monetary authorities would conduct an intervention to either reinforce the signal of a foreign monetary authority or reduce FX market volatility.	61.0	999.0
201604	1195	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	To arrive at an estimated funding need, we considered the history of such reinforcing or market-calming interventions and scaled up the transaction amounts to account for growth in FX markets.	61.0	999.0
201604	1196	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	This approach suggests a funding need of $8 billion across the SOMA and ESF portfolios, or about 5 billion euros or 275 billion yen.	61.0	999.0
201604	1197	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	The fourth step is to establish appropriate risk constraints on the basis of policymakers’ willingness to bear market, credit, and liquidity risk.	61.0	999.0
201604	1198	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Some of the considerations here are given as the fourth item in the middle-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201604	1199	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	These were discussed in detail in the memo, and I will just focus on the risk–return constraint produced by the need to assure, with high probability, adequate intervention capacity.	61.0	999.0
201604	1200	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	To analyze this, we focused on the concept of expected shortfall from model returns at the first percentile.	61.0	999.0
201604	1201	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	We recommend limiting the expected decrease in intervention capacity in this adverse market scenario to 4 percent or less.	61.0	999.0
201604	1202	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	The final step is to formulate an asset allocation for the funding needs and investment risk preferences we’ve defined.	61.0	999.0
201604	1203	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	This step provides a benchmark allocation for managing the portfolio that reflects policymakers’ risk tolerance.	61.0	999.0
201604	1204	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	We place an additional constraint of no asset sales to achieve the new asset allocation.	61.0	999.0
201604	1205	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Some features of the new portfolio allocation are shown in the middle-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201604	1206	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	For the euro portfolio, the shift would increase holdings of cash and longer-term sovereign debt.	61.0	999.0
201604	1207	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Relative to the current portfolio, the resulting asset allocation would increase the projected one-year market return from negative 23 basis points to positive 12 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201604	1208	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	It also involves some increase in portfolio risk.	61.0	999.0
201604	1209	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	For example, if total liquidation of the portfolio was necessary in a very adverse environment, intervention capacity would be reduced by 200 million euros from that of the current portfolio.	61.0	999.0
201604	1210	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	For the yen portfolio, the new allocation is affected by the fact that the Bank of Japan currently offers a rate of 0 percent on our deposits despite the negative yields on much of the universe of Japanese sovereign debt.	61.0	999.0
201604	1211	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	In contrast, our deposits with the euro system earn, on the margin, negative 55 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201604	1212	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Due to the higher return on BOJ deposits, we propose moving maturing holdings into cash.	61.0	999.0
201604	1213	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	This recommendation would need to be revisited in the event that the BOJ lowered the interest rate offered on official deposits to the US monetary authorities.	61.0	999.0
201604	1214	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	As I noted, this allocation, along with our recommendations about the risk constraints and their recommended settings, reflect discussions with the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and US Treasury officials.	61.0	999.0
201604	1215	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	We welcome your feedback as well.	61.0	999.0
201604	1216	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Our goal is to implement the new framework later this year.	61.0	999.0
201604	1217	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	These changes to the framework also intersect with another effort currently under way to revise the set of foreign authorization documents, which we will return to at a future meeting.	61.0	999.0
201604	1218	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	The revisions to the governing documents will require a vote by the Committee.	61.0	999.0
201604	1219	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201604	1220	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	That concludes our prepared remarks.	61.0	999.0
201604	1221	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	We would be happy to take questions.	61.0	999.0
201604	1222	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	62.0	65.0
201604	1223	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	81.0
201604	1224	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	I just want to say that I applaud the Desk staff for undertaking a rigorous look at how we manage the foreign exchange reserves we find ourselves with.	62.0	81.0
201604	1225	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	They’ve grounded their approach in what seems like a reasonably sensible set of principles, and I think that should protect us from undue criticism regarding stewardship of these funds.	62.0	81.0
201604	1226	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	I think that’s important.	62.0	81.0
201604	1227	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	I want to point out, though, that the magnitude of the estimate of the funding needs just highlights what an anachronistic arrangement these funds represent.	62.0	81.0
201604	1228	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	I find it hard to believe that anyone believes a $6 billion intervention in the euro-dollar market would make a meaningful difference and would leave some imprint.	62.0	81.0
201604	1229	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	This is trivial in relation to the size of US reserve account balances or European reserve account balances.	62.0	81.0
201604	1230	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	And under current operating procedures when we set the IOER rate, it’s hard to see how monetary conditions would change in the United States.	62.0	81.0
201604	1231	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	So it would be exactly like the old regime in which sterilized foreign exchange interventions were basically meaningless.	62.0	81.0
201604	1232	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Now, the only real effect it could have is if it signaled something about the future course of monetary policy.	62.0	81.0
201604	1233	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	But because the Treasury is acknowledged to be in the lead and have the authority over US dollar policy, it’s sort of problematic for the independence of our monetary policy if we’re perceived to be bending future monetary policy at the behest of the Treasury’s desires about dollar policy.	62.0	81.0
201604	1234	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	In Richmond we’ve complained about these arrangements for a couple of decades now.	62.0	81.0
201604	1235	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	We don’t expect a lot of action soon.	62.0	81.0
201604	1236	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	62.0	81.0
201604	1237	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	But at some point we need to start educating policymakers and the public about these arrangements, that the operations really are anachronistic and don’t really do any good, and maybe convince them we could eliminate the funds, give the money back to the Treasury, or do something else with them.	62.0	81.0
201604	1238	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	81.0
201604	1239	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Just to support President Lacker’s point a little bit, if we used the whole portfolio tomorrow, it would be less than 2 percent of the daily flow in euro and yen with the dollar cross.	62.0	999.0
201604	1240	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	So there’s some evidence to support what you said.	62.0	999.0
201604	1241	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Mr Manager.	62.0	81.0
201604	1242	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	62.0	81.0
201604	1243	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Fair enough.	62.0	65.0
201604	1244	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	But it’s also been little used.	62.0	65.0
201604	1245	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	And my sense is that when it has been used—and, if I’m not mistaken, the last time we intervened was following the Japanese earthquake.	62.0	65.0
201604	1246	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	And it was a coordinated, small intervention by the G-7.	62.0	65.0
201604	1247	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Our participation was centrally symbolic to support the Japanese.	62.0	65.0
201604	1248	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	And these do seem like symbolic amounts to me.	62.0	65.0
201604	1249	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	In that sense, I take your point.	62.0	65.0
201604	1250	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	But sometimes symbolism and coordination do make a difference.	62.0	65.0
201604	1251	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	And we’re not forced to follow the Treasury.	62.0	65.0
201604	1252	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	We typically have gone along with them.	62.0	65.0
201604	1253	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	But, aside from that, has there been any intervention at all over the past 20 years?	62.0	65.0
201604	1254	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	The last intervention before that was September 2000, when we purchased euros in conjunction with other central banks and the US Treasury.	62.0	999.0
201604	1255	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	That was a time when there were some doubts about the euro.	62.0	999.0
201604	1256	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Its exchange-rate value was down in the mid-80s, and we got together and tried to convince people with a signal—not about future monetary policy, but I think that we were happy to acquire euros.	62.0	999.0
201604	1257	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	So those are the two most recent interventions.	62.0	999.0
201604	1258	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	If you go back to the 1980s, they’re much larger.	62.0	999.0
201604	1259	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	I have an example of the equivalent of $80 billion over a few days when it was announced that Chairman Volcker would not be reappointed, I believe.	62.0	999.0
201604	1260	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	“Symbolic” is a good word for it.	62.0	81.0
201604	1261	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there other comments or questions on anything that Simon and Lorie covered?	62.0	65.0
201604	1262	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62.0	65.0
201604	1263	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201604	1264	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing nothing, I am going to ask for separate votes on the NAFA arrangement and the liquidity swap agreements.	63.0	65.0
201604	1265	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s start with the NAFA arrangement, our standing swap lines with Canada and Mexico.	63.0	65.0
201604	1266	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Do I have a motion to approve?	63.0	65.0
201604	1267	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So moved.	63.0	96.0
201604	1268	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	63.0	65.0
201604	1269	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any comments on those?	63.0	65.0
201604	1270	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	63.0	65.0
201604	1271	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, then I’m going to ask for a vote.	63.0	65.0
201604	1272	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	This is only for voters.	63.0	65.0
201604	1273	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	All in favor?	63.0	65.0
201604	1274	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	[Chorus of ayes]	63.0	65.0
201604	1275	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Any opposed?	63.0	65.0
201604	1276	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	63.0	65.0
201604	1277	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63.0	65.0
201604	1278	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	So the NAFA arrangement is approved.	63.0	65.0
201604	1279	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s move along to the liquidity swap agreements.	63.0	65.0
201604	1280	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Do I have a motion to approve?	63.0	65.0
201604	1281	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So moved.	63.0	96.0
201604	1282	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	63.0	65.0
201604	1283	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	And then again, any comments on these?	63.0	65.0
201604	1284	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	63.0	65.0
201604	1285	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	All in favor?	63.0	65.0
201604	1286	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	[Chorus of ayes]	63.0	65.0
201604	1287	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Any opposed?	63.0	65.0
201604	1288	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	63.0	65.0
201604	1289	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, great.	63.0	65.0
201604	1290	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	And, finally, I need a vote to ratify domestic market operations.	63.0	65.0
201604	1291	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Do I have a motion?	63.0	65.0
201604	1292	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So moved.	63.0	96.0
201604	1293	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	All in favor?	63.0	65.0
201604	1294	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	[Chorus of ayes]	63.0	65.0
201604	1295	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, great.	63.0	65.0
201604	1296	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	So then we’re going to move now into our go-round on the economic and financial situation.	11.0	65.0
201604	1297	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to call on Bill Wascher to begin the briefing.	11.0	65.0
201604	1298	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11.0	999.0
201604	1299	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	I’ll be referring to the set of materials with the cover page that is titled “The US Outlook.”	11.0	999.0
201604	1300	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	This is now the third year in a row that I’ve presented the staff economic forecast at the April FOMC meeting.	11.0	999.0
201604	1301	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	And it’s the third year in a row that I’ve had to warn you that real GDP growth in the first quarter will be close to zero—or possibly even negative.	11.0	999.0
201604	1302	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	For all our sakes, I might ask David Wilcox to get somebody else to do this briefing next April.	11.0	999.0
201604	1303	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	[Laughter]	11.0	999.0
201604	1304	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	In any event, the incoming data on spending and production for the first quarter have once again surprised us to the downside.	11.0	999.0
201604	1305	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	Panel 1 of your forecast summary exhibit shows how various nowcasts of first-quarter real GDP growth have evolved since the time of the March Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201604	1306	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	These nowcasts include the Board staff’s weekly judgmental forecast as well as various model-based estimates produced at the Board and elsewhere in the System.	11.0	999.0
201604	1307	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	As you can see from the black line, we have reduced our judgmental estimate of first-quarter real GDP growth to an annual rate of just ½ percent, down from about 2 percent in the March Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201604	1308	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	Nowcasts generated using our dynamic factor model—the red line—have also drifted lower on net, and the model’s point estimate is not very different from our Tealbook forecast.	11.0	999.0
201604	1309	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	There is, of course, still a considerable amount of uncertainty about what actually happened last quarter—a fact that is apparent both from the range of nowcasts implied by other System models (the blue dashed lines) as well as from the gray shaded region, which gives the 70 percent confidence interval surrounding the Board staff’s factor model estimate.	11.0	999.0
201604	1310	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	The BEA will publish its advance estimate of first- quarter GDP growth on Thursday.	11.0	999.0
201604	1311	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	As we did in the previous two years, we have treated the weakness in first-quarter GDP growth as largely temporary.	11.0	999.0
201604	1312	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	As you can see from the black line in panel 2, we expect real GDP to rise at an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the second quarter, a pace that is little different from our March forecast.	11.0	999.0
201604	1313	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	In coming to this assessment, we have taken a strong signal from last month’s employment report, which indicates that the labor market continued to improve at a pace that was closely in line with our expectation from the March Tealbook and suggests to us that the economy’s fundamentals remain basically sound.	11.0	999.0
201604	1314	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	Our second-quarter GDP growth forecast doesn’t appear to be wildly at odds with the estimates from the staff’s factor model or the available estimates from the System models, although the size of the confidence interval surrounding our factor model forecast gives a good idea of how little hard evidence on current-quarter spending and production we—or the models—have to go on at this point.	11.0	999.0
201604	1315	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	This morning we received the March advance report on capital goods orders and shipments, which looked to be a little weaker than we were expecting.	11.0	999.0
201604	1316	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	Our preliminary analysis suggests that these data would not affect our first-quarter GDP estimate but would subtract one-tenth or two from our projection of second-quarter growth.	11.0	999.0
201604	1317	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	Although our forecast of near-term real GDP growth after the first quarter is not very different from our previous projection, the level of real GDP is somewhat lower.	11.0	999.0
201604	1318	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	However, as we have often done on previous occasions when the labor market and spending data have sent conflicting signals about the state of the economy, we have attributed some of the first-quarter weakness in real GDP to statistical noise and made a downward adjustment to potential output that, in turn, yields a correspondingly smaller revision to our estimate of the output gap.	11.0	999.0
201604	1319	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	As a result, our judgmental estimate of the economy’s current cyclical position is only a little weaker than what we had written down in March.	11.0	999.0
201604	1320	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	Over the remainder of the medium term, our outlook for real GDP growth— panel 3—is slightly higher than in our March projection.	11.0	999.0
201604	1321	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	Current and expected financial conditions—including the lower assumed exchange value of the dollar, a lower path of long-term interest rates, and a higher level of equity prices over the medium term—are now a little more supportive of economic growth than they were in our previous forecast.	11.0	999.0
201604	1322	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	Hence, our unemployment rate forecast—panel 4—is a touch lower than in March.	11.0	999.0
201604	1323	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	The bottom two panels of this exhibit provide a small window into the question of how widely shared the economic recovery has been by comparing the extent to which different racial and ethnic groups have experienced a narrowing in two measures of labor market slack that we often highlight.	11.0	999.0
201604	1324	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	I’ll start with panel 5, which plots the unemployment rate for blacks or African Americans (the blue line), Hispanics or Latinos (the red line), and whites (the green line).	11.0	999.0
201604	1325	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	Note that these groups are not mutually exclusive, in that both the black and white categories include some Hispanics.	11.0	999.0
201604	1326	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	As is typical in a recession, unemployment rates for the two minority groups rose more sharply than for whites in 2008 and 2009, peaking at nearly 17 percent for blacks and at almost 13 percent for Hispanics.	11.0	999.0
201604	1327	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	The unemployment rates for those groups then fell more quickly over the recovery, eventually bringing the differentials in the jobless rates essentially back down to where they were before the recession.	11.0	999.0
201604	1328	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	While that’s obviously good news, the fact that the black–white unemployment rate differential is no smaller than it was 15 years ago is more discouraging.	11.0	999.0
201604	1329	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	Panel 6 provides a similar set of comparisons for those who are working part time and would like a full-time job but can’t find one.	11.0	999.0
201604	1330	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	As for unemployment, the percentages of employed blacks and Hispanics who are working part time for economic reasons rose more than for whites following the 2007 business cycle peak, with the run-up particularly steep for Hispanics.	11.0	999.0
201604	1331	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	The shares for all three groups have come down during the expansion.	11.0	999.0
201604	1332	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	However, for both blacks and Hispanics, the gap relative to whites remains higher than it was in the years preceding the Great Recession.	11.0	999.0
201604	1333	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	The panels on the next page summarize the inflation outlook.	11.0	999.0
201604	1334	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	Our projections regarding both total PCE inflation—panel 7—and core PCE price inflation— panel 8—are little changed from March.	11.0	999.0
201604	1335	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	The recent data on core prices, which include the BEA’s estimates through February and our translation of the March CPI and PPI, have come in consistent with our expectations, and we continue to project core PCE inflation to step down modestly over the course of this year.	11.0	999.0
201604	1336	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	This pattern is, in our view, partly attributable to the presence of residual seasonality in these data, which causes core inflation in the first part of the year to come in higher than average, followed by below-average readings later in the year.	11.0	999.0
201604	1337	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	Additionally—and in line with our interpretation at the time of the March Tealbook—we think that core inflation was temporarily boosted in the first quarter by several erratic components of the price indexes.	11.0	999.0
201604	1338	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	This view seems consistent with the dropback in these components in the March CPI data.	11.0	999.0
201604	1339	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	Beyond this year, inflation is projected to move up to 1.8 percent by 2018, as the restraint from energy and import prices wanes and as resource utilization tightens further in an environment of reasonably stable long-run inflation expectations.	11.0	999.0
201604	1340	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	The next two panels reproduce the April Tealbook’s inflation monitor exhibits, which show the sources of the revisions that we have made since December to the outlook for total and core PCE inflation.	11.0	999.0
201604	1341	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	As indicated by the black lines in the panels, our total and core inflation projections are, so far, not very different from our December Tealbook forecasts.	11.0	999.0
201604	1342	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	In addition, with the exception of a small upward revision to the contribution that we expect import prices to make to this year’s core inflation rate—the blue portion of the second stacked bar in panel 10—these panels don’t look too different from the corresponding charts that David Wilcox showed you at the March meeting.	11.0	999.0
201604	1343	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	As you may recall, in our previous projection we made a downward revision of 5 basis points to our estimate of underlying inflation—the gray portion of the stacked bars in panel 10—in response to the recent low readings from some market- and survey-based indicators of longer-term expected inflation.	11.0	999.0
201604	1344	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	As you can see from the solid black line in panel 11, the preliminary estimate of median longer-term expected inflation from the Michigan survey moved down 0.2 percentage point in April, returning this series to the very low level that prevailed at the time of the March Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201604	1345	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	Finally, the next page resurrects the so-called Lockhart dashboard that provides a high-level summary of some of the key pieces of information that will be available to you at the next two FOMC meetings.	11.0	999.0
201604	1346	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	Specifically, the data that will first be available at the June meeting are in the gold-shaded region of the table, and the additional observations that will become available in time for the July meeting are shaded in red.	11.0	999.0
201604	1347	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	The data that are newly available for today’s meeting are shaded in blue.	11.0	999.0
201604	1348	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	The April Tealbook projections of these variables are shown in regular font, and the corresponding projections from the March Tealbook are shown in italics.	11.0	999.0
201604	1349	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	On a 3-month-change basis, we anticipate that headline PCE inflation will pick up over the near term as energy prices stop declining.	11.0	999.0
201604	1350	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	As I noted earlier, however, core inflation is expected to step down.	11.0	999.0
201604	1351	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	On a 12-month-change basis, we expect total inflation to run at or below 1 percent and core inflation to edge down to 1½ percent.	11.0	999.0
201604	1352	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	On the real side, we expect that job gains will continue at a solid pace and that the unemployment rate will remain around 5 percent.	11.0	999.0
201604	1353	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	Although revised estimates of Q1 GDP growth will be available at each of the next two FOMC meetings, the BEA’s initial estimate of second-quarter growth will not be published until just after the July FOMC meeting.	11.0	999.0
201604	1354	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	However, if our forecast of a second-quarter pickup turns out to be broadly correct, we might expect to see some evidence for it in the higher-frequency spending data that we will receive between now and the June meeting.	11.0	999.0
201604	1355	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	Steve will now continue the briefing.	11.0	999.0
201604	1356	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Thank you, Bill.	11.0	999.0
201604	1357	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	I’ll be referring to the materials titled “The International Outlook.”	11.0	999.0
201604	1358	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Your first panel of that exhibit shows the results of a word search of FOMC minutes over the past 1½ years and indicates the number of times that the words “dollar,”	11.0	999.0
201604	1359	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	“China,” or “global” appeared in the summary of your discussions.	11.0	999.0
201604	1360	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Although we in the International Finance Division welcome the increasing attention you’ve been giving international matters of late, we realize that this attention reflects concern and not satisfaction with the global situation, and we have been asking what it would take for the word count to go down in future meetings.	11.0	999.0
201604	1361	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, we’ve developed the handy checklist shown in panel 2 to help monitor foreign developments and assess whether the headwinds to the US economy coming from abroad might be abating.	11.0	999.0
201604	1362	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Feel free to check the boxes as I go along, but don’t worry—we are not adding this to the SEP.	11.0	999.0
201604	1363	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	[Laughter]	11.0	999.0
201604	1364	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	For us to have some assurance that the drag arising from the foreign sector is easing, we first need to see some abatement in the dollar’s rise and some pickup in the pace of foreign GDP growth.	11.0	999.0
201604	1365	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Here we can check the “Yes” box.	11.0	999.0
201604	1366	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	As you are well aware, the dollar has been declining since late January; I’ll be discussing its future trajectory shortly.	11.0	999.0
201604	1367	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	And as shown in panel 3, after growing at a very subdued 1¾ percent pace in 2015, foreign economic growth is estimated to have picked up to a 2¼ percent rate in the first quarter.	11.0	999.0
201604	1368	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Much of that increase was concentrated in Canada, which is starting to shake off some of its oil-induced woes and which has a very large weight in our trade-weighted foreign GDP aggregate.	11.0	999.0
201604	1369	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	But economic growth appears to have picked up in other economies, too, including in the euro area and emerging Asia excluding China, and indications are that output at least stopped falling in Japan.	11.0	999.0
201604	1370	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	To be sure, Chinese economic growth fell, by our estimates, from 7 percent at an annual rate through most of last year to 5½ percent in the first quarter, but we and everyone else had largely anticipated that slowing.	11.0	999.0
201604	1371	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	And with indicators for March coming in reasonably strong, we’re not taking a very strong negative signal from the first-quarter slowing.	11.0	999.0
201604	1372	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Our second condition for an easing of foreign headwinds is some greater confidence that, barring significant new shocks, global growth will firm further, as predicted in our baseline projection.	11.0	999.0
201604	1373	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Here, too, we are checking the “Yes” box, although this is by no means a slam dunk.	11.0	999.0
201604	1374	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	To begin with, after progressively revising down the forecast of foreign economic growth in recent Tealbooks, this round we’re actually revising up our Q1 estimate, and our projection further out is little changed.	11.0	999.0
201604	1375	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	So, all told, that’s positive relative to earlier experiences.	11.0	999.0
201604	1376	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Additionally, as Simon has described, throughout global financial markets, investor sentiment has continued to improve, equity prices are up, and credit spreads are down, all of which should support growth.	11.0	999.0
201604	1377	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	As a related matter, oil prices, shown in panel 4, extended their previous gains over the intermeeting period.	11.0	999.0
201604	1378	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Ordinarily, we view rising oil prices as a negative for global spending and economic growth; however, at very low levels, declines in oil prices may raise financial stability concerns and induce rapid belt- tightening in oil-reliant economies.	11.0	999.0
201604	1379	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Thus, the recent increase in prices may be a positive for the global economy.	11.0	999.0
201604	1380	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Finally, our improved confidence in the economic growth outlook is bolstered by the results of our statistical model of the probability of foreign recessions.	11.0	999.0
201604	1381	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	As indicated in panel 6, reflecting stronger incoming data and financial market settings, we estimate that the probability of a generalized recession abroad occurring over the next 12 months fell from its February peak to near its unconditional mean over the past four decades.	11.0	999.0
201604	1382	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	We recognize, however, that all of these positive indications could turn on a dime if investor sentiment turns south again.	11.0	999.0
201604	1383	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, our third condition for an easing of global headwinds is some confidence that global financial markets have become more resilient, if not to substantial international shocks, at least to the kinds of minor disturbances that the world economy generates as a matter of course.	11.0	999.0
201604	1384	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Here we can at best check the box labeled “Maybe.”	11.0	999.0
201604	1385	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	The red line in panel 7—that’s on your next exhibit—shows a measure of financial stress we developed for global financial markets on the basis of a range of indicators, including money market rates, bond spreads, stock market volatility, and credit default swaps.	11.0	999.0
201604	1386	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	The upswing in stresses evident earlier this year reflected the market’s response to a relatively modest depreciation in the RMB and some weak incoming macrodata from around the world.	11.0	999.0
201604	1387	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Even at the time, it seemed that the market had overreacted to these developments.	11.0	999.0
201604	1388	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	The subsequent upswing reflected some correction of this excessive pessimism along with reduced downward pressure on the RMB, which was aided by the broad decline in the dollar; some better macrodata; and revised expectations of FOMC policy, of which I’ll say more shortly.	11.0	999.0
201604	1389	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	More recently, markets have largely shrugged off such concerns as Brexit and the failure of the OPEC production talks.	11.0	999.0
201604	1390	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	All told, investor sentiment is showing a few glimmers of increased resilience, but hardly enough for us to rule out a future resurgence in stresses.	11.0	999.0
201604	1391	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	In particular, we are cognizant of the possibility that, with declines in expected US policy rates and the recent broad depreciation of the dollar having helped calm markets earlier this year, a return to policy tightening could trigger a return to turbulent market conditions.	11.0	999.0
201604	1392	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	While we view this as a prominent downside risk, however, we have not built it into the baseline.	11.0	999.0
201604	1393	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	As shown by the blue line in panel 7, which measures the expected 24-month-ahead federal funds rate, anticipations of tighter monetary policy do not always depress global markets.	11.0	999.0
201604	1394	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	The heightened expectation of monetary policy tightening in mid-2013, highlighted by the first shaded region in the panel, did indeed trigger the taper tantrum, as many investors who’d been asleep at the wheel were apparently jolted awake by Chairman Bernanke’s statements.	11.0	999.0
201604	1395	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	However, once awakened, investors took the rise in expected policy rates in the first half of 2014—highlighted in the second shaded region—with greater equanimity, and financial stresses actually subsided during this period.	11.0	999.0
201604	1396	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	By the same token, according to many observers, the downshift in the March SEP’s dot plot was so calming because it convinced market participants that the FOMC was not on a preset tightening course but would be responsive to global economic and financial developments.	11.0	999.0
201604	1397	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, it seems reasonable that gradual future policy tightening would be accepted without undue distress by markets as long as the tightening appeared to be merited by firming economic conditions.	11.0	999.0
201604	1398	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Of course, even if FOMC policy tightening does not trigger market turbulence, it could still boost the dollar.	11.0	999.0
201604	1399	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Our forecast, panel 8, is premised on the federal funds rate rising 3 percentage points by end-2018, while market expectations are generally for a smaller rise.	11.0	999.0
201604	1400	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	We assume that as market participants become surprised by the pace of FOMC tightening, the dollar will rise about 4 percent in real terms against the currencies of other advanced economies, or AFEs.	11.0	999.0
201604	1401	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	This projection is based on a regression of changes in the dollar on changes in the federal funds rate around FOMC announcements, with a 100 basis point surprise to the federal funds rate estimated to cause a 1.5 percent rise in the dollar.	11.0	999.0
201604	1402	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	The tightening of FOMC policy is also expected to buoy the dollar against EME currencies, but this effect is offset by our anticipation, shown in panel 9, that China will hold the RMB nearly flat against the dollar for the next year or so before allowing it to appreciate as capital inflows return.	11.0	999.0
201604	1403	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	All this said, we certainly recognize the possibility that the dollar could rise much faster than we are projecting either because the dollar responds more sharply to expectations for tightening monetary policy than our econometric estimates would suggest, because FOMC tightening does indeed trigger market turmoil, because downward pressures on China’s RMB reassert themselves, or because downside risks to the foreign economy materialize.	11.0	999.0
201604	1404	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	This brings us to our last condition for improved confidence in the foreign outlook:  Have the fundamental risks to the global economy that so worried us earlier this year substantially abated?	11.0	999.0
201604	1405	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Here we must certainly check the “No” box.	11.0	999.0
201604	1406	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	To begin with, we have a relatively new risk to add to our list:  Brexit, which may yet disrupt markets as the June 23 referendum draws near, especially if it starts looking more likely the vote will be for the United Kingdom to leave the EU.	11.0	999.0
201604	1407	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Even more saddening is the return of that old chestnut, Grexit, as the IMF, EU, and Greece square off over whether Greece will be granted debt relief, posing further challenges to European unity.	11.0	999.0
201604	1408	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Much more consequential for the global economy would be “Chexit”—that is, an exit of China from its path of gradual deceleration into a steeper decline as mounting corporate debts and an overexposed banking system lead to financial crisis.	11.0	999.0
201604	1409	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	And all of these downside risks become more worrisome in an environment in which many central banks are already providing extraordinary stimulus and most governments see little capacity or inclination to provide fiscal support.	11.0	999.0
201604	1410	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	We anticipate that the BOJ will announce further policy accommodation at its next meeting, and the ECB could add to its stimulus through more asset purchases or cutting interest rates further into negative territory.	11.0	999.0
201604	1411	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	However, it’s doubtful that such measures would be up to the task of stabilizing their economies in the face of significant new shocks.	11.0	999.0
201604	1412	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	So, to sum up, in terms of our conditions for a reduction of the time you spend discussing foreign developments and risks, we’ve got a strong “Yes,” a weak “Yes,” a “Maybe,” and a “No.”	11.0	999.0
201604	1413	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	All told, we’re making progress toward an abatement of foreign headwinds, but I think we have a ways to go.	11.0	999.0
201604	1414	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	And now Nellie will continue our presentation.	11.0	999.0
201604	1415	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	Thank you, Steve.	11.0	999.0
201604	1416	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	I’ll be referring to materials titled “Financial Stability Developments.”	11.0	999.0
201604	1417	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	In our current assessment, we view that leverage and maturity transformation in the financial sector are subdued relative to historical levels, and aggregate private nonfinancial sector credit is modest.	11.0	999.0
201604	1418	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	These indicators suggest a financial system that is pretty resilient, consistent with not having observed significant funding stresses or margin calls earlier this year when risky asset prices fell and volatility rose sharply.	11.0	999.0
201604	1419	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	Since then, prices of risky assets have rebounded notably, valuation pressures have risen somewhat, and term premiums remain very low, though higher than in early 2013.	11.0	999.0
201604	1420	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	And, in terms of risks to financial stability that reflect both vulnerabilities and shocks, the underlying sources for many of the recent shocks have not changed materially, as discussed by Steve and Simon earlier, which suggests volatility could flare up again.	11.0	999.0
201604	1421	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	Starting with your first exhibit and now considering asset valuations, the forward P/E ratio for the S&P 500 in the top-left panel has moved back up, as stock prices have risen sharply since mid-February while earnings have been marked down notably.	11.0	999.0
201604	1422	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	The forward P/E for stocks is at about the 80th percentile, suggesting somewhat stretched valuations, and the VIX, the implied volatility, not shown, has dropped to multiyear lows.	11.0	999.0
201604	1423	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	As shown to the right, the high-yield bond spread has narrowed but remains on the wide side for a nonrecessionary period, reflecting concerns that corporate credit quality has shown signs of some deterioration, even outside the energy sector.	11.0	999.0
201604	1424	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	The level also reflects somewhat wide risk premiums, as measured by the far-term forward spread, the green line.	11.0	999.0
201604	1425	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	In commercial real estate, capitalization rates for all property types are at or near their historic lows.	11.0	999.0
201604	1426	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	As detailed in a staff memo on the CRE market, valuation pressures are notable, but credit levels remain moderate, and recent robust growth may slow, as terms and standards have tightened.	11.0	999.0
201604	1427	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	Under a stress scenario with a sharp decline in prices, we expect losses to be felt most keenly at smaller community banks, as larger banks are more diversified and have been stressed for such a scenario, and the financing of CMBS currently does not appear to be highly levered.	11.0	999.0
201604	1428	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	Overall, our assessment is that this market does not currently raise broad financial stability concerns, but downside risks would become more substantial if credit growth or leveraged CMBS positions were to pick up.	11.0	999.0
201604	1429	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	Moving to the right, the black line is a summary quantitative measure of risk appetite back to 1975 that is in the spirit of the quantitative indicators we started showing last year.	11.0	999.0
201604	1430	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	This measure reflects risk premiums and lending standards across four asset classes:  residential mortgages, business credit, commercial real estate, and equity markets.	11.0	999.0
201604	1431	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	Because it was designed to provide consistent metrics over a reasonably long period, it does not fully capture trends for some financial innovations, such as the junk bond market and securitization.	11.0	999.0
201604	1432	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	It is shown as a percentile, with a reading of 100 corresponding to the maximum, 0 for the minimum, and 50 for the median.	11.0	999.0
201604	1433	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	The Q1 estimate is near the median, down a bit from last fall, consistent with our assessment that valuation pressures have eased.	11.0	999.0
201604	1434	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	The blue dashed line in the chart plots the number of asset classes whose valuation metric is ½ standard deviation above its historical mean since 1975.	11.0	999.0
201604	1435	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	It varies between 0, when none of the four components are elevated, and 4, when all four are elevated.	11.0	999.0
201604	1436	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	The Q1 estimate shows that only one of the four categories, the commercial real estate market, is notably high.	11.0	999.0
201604	1437	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	If we assumed the current stock price and volatility measures held through Q2, all else being equal, the equity market would also be elevated.	11.0	999.0
201604	1438	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	Looking back, it is not unusual for risk appetite to be high in one or two asset classes, but it is unusual for three or four to be high at the same time.	11.0	999.0
201604	1439	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	This configuration occurred consistently between 2005 and early 2007, when the risk appetite measure was close to its maximum of 100.	11.0	999.0
201604	1440	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	The insight is that when this measure peaked, it was because risk premiums and lending standards were unusually accommodative across all four asset classes, not just because house prices were high.	11.0	999.0
201604	1441	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	This measure might be useful for gauging systemic concerns, as it reflects both the level and the correlation of high risk appetite across different asset classes.	11.0	999.0
201604	1442	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	In ongoing research, positive impulses to this measure in a vector autoregression framework are, not surprisingly, expansionary for the economy in the near term, as higher values reflect more favorable conditions.	11.0	999.0
201604	1443	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	However, we find a similar impetus also leads to a rise in the private nonfinancial credit-to-GDP gap over a longer horizon, starting with about a four-quarter lag, suggesting a buildup in vulnerability if the gap is already high.	11.0	999.0
201604	1444	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	High credit-to-GDP gaps, measured relative to a long-term trend, have been found in cross-country studies to be a robust indicator of recessions, and this measure has been supported by Basel for setting the level of the countercyclical capital buffer.	11.0	999.0
201604	1445	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	The relationship between risk appetite and future credit gaps provides a reason for keeping an eye on asset valuations.	11.0	999.0
201604	1446	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	As shown in the bottom left, the private nonfinancial credit-to-GDP gap at the end of 2015 is still below its estimated longer-term trend, though there is uncertainty about what is an appropriate trend line.	11.0	999.0
201604	1447	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	As shown to the right, the gap differs notably for corporate businesses, the red line, and households, the blue.	11.0	999.0
201604	1448	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	The very large negative gap for households raises the question of whether all of the current gap is cyclical.	11.0	999.0
201604	1449	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	With regard to the financial sector, considered in exhibit 2, leverage appears modest, and risk transformations of various types, as best we can tell, appear low relative to recent history amid ongoing structural reforms.	11.0	999.0
201604	1450	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	As shown in the top left, stock prices of the large domestic LISCC firms fell especially sharply in January and February on negative earnings news related to concerns about falling oil prices, risks to economic growth and negative interest rates, and the health of some foreign banks.	11.0	999.0
201604	1451	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	CDS for these firms, the black line, rose but have since fallen back to fairly low levels.	11.0	999.0
201604	1452	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	Price-to-book ratios, shown to the right, the orange bar, currently are lower than at the end of 2015, the blue bar, and 2014, the red.	11.0	999.0
201604	1453	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	We interpret the price-to- book ratios that have persisted below 1 for a few firms for a while as reflecting concerns for earnings prospects and longer-term shareholder returns, rather than immediate solvency concerns.	11.0	999.0
201604	1454	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	The middle-left panel provides a high-level overview of credit provision by domestic financial intermediaries, as measured by their holdings of loans and bonds to the nonfinancial sector.	11.0	999.0
201604	1455	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	While the credit market debt-to-GDP ratio has risen substantially in recent decades, bank credit, the dark blue, has been roughly steady.	11.0	999.0
201604	1456	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	Of course, banks are more important to the financial system than suggested by this share, as they provide backup lines, originate and warehouse loans for securitization, provide financing in various forms to investors, or enable hedging as derivative counterparties.	11.0	999.0
201604	1457	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	Still, the chart emphasizes that there’s much to pay attention to outside the banking sector to assess resilience.	11.0	999.0
201604	1458	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	Looking back, the strongest growth in credit provision by other intermediaries leading up to the financial crisis was at the GSEs, the light blue, and at ABS issuers, the red shaded area.	11.0	999.0
201604	1459	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	Recently, ABS issuance has been fairly modest.	11.0	999.0
201604	1460	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	As noted to the right, new rules have been adopted that require risk retention and greater disclosure, which should improve the stability of these structures.	11.0	999.0
201604	1461	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	Looking back at the chart, as shown by the orange, long-term mutual funds have about doubled since the crisis.	11.0	999.0
201604	1462	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	This growth could be stability enhancing as more credit is provided by less-leveraged entities, although in recent years there’s been rapid growth of some mutual funds that use derivatives heavily and of bond and loan funds that hold less-liquid assets while offering daily redemptions.	11.0	999.0
201604	1463	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	The Financial Stability Oversight Council issued a statement last week, and as noted to the right, for money fund leverage, they supported recent SEC proposals for more data reporting and disclosure, more robust risk-management practices, and limits on leverage through derivatives.	11.0	999.0
201604	1464	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	In addition, to reduce liquidity and redemption risk, the council indicated steps should be considered to strengthen funds’ risk-management practices to account for broad market stress, increase clarity about the limits for permissible less-liquid asset holdings, and facilitate the use of tools to reduce first-mover advantages.	11.0	999.0
201604	1465	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	The recent growth of bond mutual funds holding less-liquid assets raises concerns about the resilience of market liquidity if widespread redemptions were to force sales.	11.0	999.0
201604	1466	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	We recently looked at bonds of oil companies, as an example, of bonds under stress, and our assessment is that trading in the secondary corporate bond market functioned pretty well in recent months.	11.0	999.0
201604	1467	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	As shown in the bottom left, trading volumes for oil bonds have trended up since 2014 and did not dry up in recent months.	11.0	999.0
201604	1468	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	Bid-asked spreads for oil bonds, the red line in the right panel, also rose by more than for non- oil bonds, the blue line, but increases in bid-asks are not unexpected, as dealers require higher compensation for more volatile prices.	11.0	999.0
201604	1469	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	We also didn’t hear from market participants of serious increased difficulties in executing transactions.	11.0	999.0
201604	1470	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	Even so, as we do not capture trades that do not get completed and adjustments to market- making models continue, we will want to stay attentive to whether market liquidity is sufficiently resilient to stress.	11.0	999.0
201604	1471	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201604	1472	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	That concludes our prepared remarks.	11.0	999.0
201604	1473	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	We’d be happy to respond to your questions.	11.0	999.0
201604	1474	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for any of the briefers?	12.0	65.0
201604	1475	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	12.0	65.0
201604	1476	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	97.0
201604	1477	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Steve referred to markets as largely having shrugged off Brexit risks.	12.0	97.0
201604	1478	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	This is consonant with what I’ve heard directly from some market actors.	12.0	97.0
201604	1479	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	But Simon, in his presentation, noted a fairly significant increase in demand for protection against pound depreciation against the dollar, apparently with an eye toward the upcoming referendum.	12.0	97.0
201604	1480	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	How do I reconcile those two observations?	12.0	97.0
201604	1481	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Right.	12.0	999.0
201604	1482	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	I will say that I pondered whether I should use that phrase, and I received support from my colleagues to do so, with one exception, which is in FX markets.	12.0	999.0
201604	1483	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Okay.	12.0	97.0
201604	1484	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	In FX markets, they expect that the bad vote—that is, to leave—would indeed push down the pound.	12.0	999.0
201604	1485	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	But it might be the right thing to happen.	12.0	999.0
201604	1486	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	If they leave, maybe the pound has to depreciate because that’s the right pricing response.	12.0	999.0
201604	1487	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	So that’s what I was going to ask—whether that suggested markets were thinking that the medium-term economic prospects of the United Kingdom don’t look so great with Brexit.	12.0	97.0
201604	1488	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	But there aren’t as many immediate financial-stability-type concerns—that is, funding of the banks and things like that.	12.0	97.0
201604	1489	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Possibly, but there’s a wide bid-ask on where the sterling might end up on June 24.	12.0	999.0
201604	1490	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	The event risk is big.	12.0	999.0
201604	1491	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Hasn’t there been a substantial depreciation of the pound sterling?	12.0	108.0
201604	1492	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	There has been a substantial depreciation leading into this.	12.0	999.0
201604	1493	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Well, in recent months, it’s more that it has not risen against the dollar as much as other currencies.	12.0	999.0
201604	1494	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, it’s pricing in some probability of Brexit.	12.0	96.0
201604	1495	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201604	1496	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Exactly.	12.0	999.0
201604	1497	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	It got down to about 140.	12.0	999.0
201604	1498	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And so it’s declined, and if the vote is to stay, the pound will likely rally.	12.0	96.0
201604	1499	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And if the vote is to leave, the pound will probably slough a lot.	12.0	96.0
201604	1500	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And, currently, it reflects some weighted average of those two outcomes.	12.0	96.0
201604	1501	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	But I’ve heard no comments to the effect of, well, it might lower the pound, but it would not have other adverse effects.	12.0	999.0
201604	1502	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	I think a lot of market observers expect that if there was a leave vote, it could create disruptive ramifications.	12.0	999.0
201604	1503	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	And it’s a bit of a mystery as to why it has not affected other markets much.	12.0	999.0
201604	1504	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Yes.	12.0	97.0
201604	1505	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I guess that was the question I was asking.	12.0	97.0
201604	1506	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It doesn’t seem to be priced into other European markets, in which people think that there could be some ramifications.	12.0	96.0
201604	1507	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	So the cost of protecting in other markets against it has not risen as much.	12.0	999.0
201604	1508	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	That could be because there’s no spillover, or it could be mispriced.	12.0	999.0
201604	1509	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	We don’t know.	12.0	999.0
201604	1510	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	But even if you hypothesize, Simon, that the overnight change in the pound would be much bigger than is anticipated by the hedging that has taken place to date, and, therefore, there could be some effects on, for example, British financial institutions, shouldn’t that be reflected in at least some increase in funding costs for those institutions now?	12.0	97.0
201604	1511	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Right, if it were considered material.	12.0	999.0
201604	1512	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	In fact, funding spreads in Britain have gone up about 5 basis points, so not very much.	12.0	999.0
201604	1513	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	So they believe the polls right now, basically.	12.0	97.0
201604	1514	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	But you have to be a little bit careful.	12.0	999.0
201604	1515	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	The Bank of England has said that it will supply liquidity and it will put in extra auctions, so we don’t know whether that is reducing the affect.	12.0	999.0
201604	1516	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	I think CDS for large UK banks might have moved up a little bit since last year.	12.0	999.0
201604	1517	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	They have moved up, but not very much.	12.0	999.0
201604	1518	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Yes.	12.0	97.0
201604	1519	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	12.0	65.0
201604	1520	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	94.0
201604	1521	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Just to follow up on this, I thought that even if they voted to get out, this would trigger a round of negotiations.	12.0	94.0
201604	1522	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Even for financial institutions, at least immediately, their situations would not change for up to two years.	12.0	94.0
201604	1523	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	And beyond that, it’s not that clear exactly what their situation would be.	12.0	94.0
201604	1524	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	So the market might price in only a small change for Brexit.	12.0	94.0
201604	1525	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But it wouldn’t be a good outcome for the UK economy, because there would be tremendous uncertainty over that period.	12.0	96.0
201604	1526	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	All true.	12.0	94.0
201604	1527	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	But this is just a reason why markets might say, “Well, I’m not sure how to price Barclays.”	12.0	94.0
201604	1528	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	I think the thinking underlying the adverse ramifications for a leave vote would be that, after the vote to leave, they’d then start a negotiation period that could be two years or longer, and that the uncertainty over the model of UK linkage to the European economy that would result from that would be sufficient to put a lot of downdrafts both in markets and in real-side spending and confidence.	12.0	999.0
201604	1529	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Certainly true.	12.0	94.0
201604	1530	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	But my only point would be that’s a very slow-moving process.	12.0	94.0
201604	1531	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	We’ve got negotiations going on all over the world all the time.	12.0	94.0
201604	1532	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	But there are capital inflows the United Kingdom relies on, and Governor Carney in particular has pointed that out as a potential strain.	12.0	999.0
201604	1533	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Absolutely.	12.0	94.0
201604	1534	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions?	12.0	65.0
201604	1535	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	12.0	65.0
201604	1536	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So this is for Bill Wascher.	12.0	102.0
201604	1537	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Ready?	12.0	102.0
201604	1538	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay.	12.0	102.0
201604	1539	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	12.0	102.0
201604	1540	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s no surprise I’m going to revisit a topic.	12.0	102.0
201604	1541	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	As Governor Powell and I noted at our March meeting, productivity growth has been surprisingly bad for the past five years, averaging about ½ percent.	12.0	102.0
201604	1542	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Tealbook puts it at minus 2.2 percent in the first quarter.	12.0	102.0
201604	1543	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s a huge negative.	12.0	102.0
201604	1544	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yet in the Tealbook forecast, productivity growth pops back up to 2 percent in the current quarter and stays strong for the rest of the year.	12.0	102.0
201604	1545	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So my question, as it was in March:  What makes you continue to expect that we are on the verge of this extraordinary reversal in productivity growth?	12.0	102.0
201604	1546	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m usually accused of being optimistic.	12.0	102.0
201604	1547	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	Some of the pickup reflects a technical issue with hours.	12.0	999.0
201604	1548	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	I hate to bring this up, but we’ve been surprised on the upside by the strength in the component of hours that isn’t captured by the payroll survey, and that’s been holding productivity down.	12.0	999.0
201604	1549	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	We don’t project it being wound back, but we aren’t expecting it to continue, and we get a pickup in productivity growth on that technical reason.	12.0	999.0
201604	1550	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	More broadly, our view is that as the economy improves and investment picks up, we’ll start to see some gradual improvement in productivity—only to, maybe, 1¼ percent, so it’s certainly not high relative to the post-2005 era.	12.0	999.0
201604	1551	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	In fact, I think the average over that 10-year period is about 1¼ percent.	12.0	999.0
201604	1552	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	So we’re not expecting a huge pickup in productivity.	12.0	999.0
201604	1553	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	I guess the other thing I would say is that we’re also nervous about it, and we see downside risks.	12.0	999.0
201604	1554	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	There was an alternative view box in the Tealbook that I thought made a strong case that we might not see a pickup like we have in the forecast.	12.0	999.0
201604	1555	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	And along with that alternative view box, we included a couple of alternative simulations that illustrate how the economy might respond to a weaker productivity path.	12.0	999.0
201604	1556	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	So in the baseline forecast, we have retained our assumption that productivity will move back up to a modest 1¼ percent pace, but I certainly agree that there are downside risks to that, in light of what we’ve seen over the past five years.	12.0	999.0
201604	1557	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay.	12.0	102.0
201604	1558	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you very much.	12.0	102.0
201604	1559	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	12.0	65.0
201604	1560	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I have a question for Nellie.	12.0	96.0
201604	1561	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	On your exhibit 1, the chart on the lower right, the corporate business sector looks like it might be overextended.	12.0	96.0
201604	1562	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Does it matter if the corporate business credit-to-GDP is going up because they’re voluntarily changing their capital structure by buying back shares, as opposed to going off on some sort of investment spending binge?	12.0	96.0
201604	1563	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t know the answer myself.	12.0	96.0
201604	1564	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m just wondering what your thoughts are on that, because it seems that what’s happening in the corporate sector is, people have looked at the cost of credit, they’ve decided the optimal capital structure is different from what it was before, and they’ve moved to that different capital structure.	12.0	96.0
201604	1565	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	What we can try to look at is, what underwriting standards look like, as opposed to how well they’re using the funds they raise.	12.0	999.0
201604	1566	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	This chart reflects the concern we have raised since 2013:  the rise in debt in the high-yield bond market and the leveraged loans, in which we had been starting to see very loose underwriting standards.	12.0	999.0
201604	1567	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	I think at this point, with oil prices having fallen and credit growth in the sector having really started to slow, though there are a few defaults, there’s some easing of imbalances.	12.0	999.0
201604	1568	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	Our sense is, this debt ratio won’t continue to rise.	12.0	999.0
201604	1569	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	But it has risen, and at this point is that the divergence with household is quite unusual.	12.0	999.0
201604	1570	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Because profits are actually pretty high relative to their past levels.	12.0	96.0
201604	1571	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	The earnings per share growth estimates are coming down.	12.0	999.0
201604	1572	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Okay.	12.0	96.0
201604	1573	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	12.0	96.0
201604	1574	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	12.0	65.0
201604	1575	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	94.0
201604	1576	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I have a question for Bill Wascher.	12.0	94.0
201604	1577	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Looking at the forecast summary, chart 3, real GDP, how should I interpret the confidence bounds there?	12.0	94.0
201604	1578	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	You’ve got a confidence interval that is a 70 percent confidence interval and the March Tealbook looks like it was outside the confidence interval for first-quarter GDP.	12.0	94.0
201604	1579	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Is that how I should interpret this?	12.0	94.0
201604	1580	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	That sounds like we got extraordinarily bad news during the interim, which couldn’t have happened on the basis of historical forecast errors.	12.0	94.0
201604	1581	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	That’s how I would interpret this figure.	12.0	94.0
201604	1582	2016-04-27	meeting	RUDD	So, President Bullard, if I may—	12.0	999.0
201604	1583	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Yes.	12.0	94.0
201604	1584	2016-04-27	meeting	RUDD	We would have started the confidence interval earlier last round because we would have put it around our forecast, so when the confidence interval would have expanded last round, it would have been maybe two quarters earlier.	12.0	999.0
201604	1585	2016-04-27	meeting	RUDD	So the March forecast wasn’t outside the March confidence interval.	12.0	999.0
201604	1586	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Yes.	12.0	94.0
201604	1587	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	But nonetheless, Q1 was surprisingly weak.	12.0	999.0
201604	1588	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	I don’t know how it would have compared to the confidence interval in March because we don’t have that, but it was a pretty big downward revision to our estimate.	12.0	999.0
201604	1589	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I see.	12.0	94.0
201604	1590	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	So if I put the two-step-ahead confidence bound mentally around the red line, I would get inside the black line.	12.0	94.0
201604	1591	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	Yes, maybe that would give you a better sense.	12.0	999.0
201604	1592	2016-04-27	meeting	RUDD	So even if you look closely, I think that you might be slightly outside it and that the Q1 confidence interval last round was probably ¾ percent on the low end.	12.0	999.0
201604	1593	2016-04-27	meeting	RUDD	As Bill said, it’s something we weren’t expecting, and it was unexpectedly large.	12.0	999.0
201604	1594	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	You know, it would be interesting to me if you could provide in future meetings a kind of index of how surprising the news was in between meetings from the perspective of real GDP.	12.0	94.0
201604	1595	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Maybe you do that in other places.	12.0	94.0
201604	1596	2016-04-27	meeting	POTTER	Didn’t you have a box in the Tealbook?	12.0	999.0
201604	1597	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	That’s just a retrospective of forecasters going back, but that’s not about a particular quarter.	12.0	999.0
201604	1598	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Because it’s kind of informative to say, “Well, the news was pretty bad” or “kind of bad” or “about what we expected.”	12.0	94.0
201604	1599	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	Okay.	12.0	999.0
201604	1600	2016-04-27	meeting	WILCOX	Isn’t that what this confidence interval does?	12.0	999.0
201604	1601	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Well, evidently, not quite, because the interval around the red line would be actually bigger if you put that on this chart.	12.0	94.0
201604	1602	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	12.0	65.0
201604	1603	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Any other questions?	12.0	65.0
201604	1604	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	12.0	65.0
201604	1605	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Then we have an opportunity now to comment on financial stability, and I have four people who have indicated a desire to do so.	94.0	65.0
201604	1606	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me start with President Rosengren.	94.0	65.0
201604	1607	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	90.0
201604	1608	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I appreciate the staff’s report and the comprehensive discussion of emerging risks in commercial real estate, including possible actions that could be taken.	94.0	90.0
201604	1609	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In fact, this discussion is not unlike the discussion of emerging risks in the COP financial-stability tabletop exercise that was prepared roughly a year ago.	94.0	90.0
201604	1610	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Unfortunately, one of the most serious concerns in that tabletop exercise was a continued rise in commercial real estate prices and a relatively low interest rate environment.	94.0	90.0
201604	1611	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Since the tabletop, commercial real estate prices over the past year have tracked the simulation quite closely.	94.0	90.0
201604	1612	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Over the past seven years, multifamily commercial real estate prices have roughly doubled, with the prices of other categories of real estate also rising quite rapidly, as was shown in the QS report.	94.0	90.0
201604	1613	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Commercial real estate is a significant asset class for many leveraged intermediaries, and thus a quick price reversal could have serious repercussions.	94.0	90.0
201604	1614	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I personally witnessed this in New England when a significant percentage of banks failed or were deeply troubled as a result of falling commercial real estate prices in the late 1980s, with significant spillovers to the broader economy.	94.0	90.0
201604	1615	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Starting with this morning’s conversation, many people have suggested that if confronted with a buildup in financial stability risks, we should use supervisory and macroprudential tools as our first line of defense.	94.0	90.0
201604	1616	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I agree.	94.0	90.0
201604	1617	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The challenge is finding the appropriate tool and calibration of that tool for such a response.	94.0	90.0
201604	1618	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The commercial real estate presentation illustrates the challenge quite well.	94.0	90.0
201604	1619	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Many of the high-price commercial real estate properties in Boston are supported by financing from a mix of large banks, many of which are foreign banks, foreign investors, and large nonbank intermediaries.	94.0	90.0
201604	1620	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, large domestic banks still maintain a relatively modest overall exposure to commercial real estate.	94.0	90.0
201604	1621	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Smaller domestic banks with assets in the $1 billion to $10 billion range have significant exposure to commercial real estate in small multifamily and strip mall projects, but these are banking organizations with respect to which we traditionally have a relatively light supervisory touch, unless the banks are state member banks.	94.0	90.0
201604	1622	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we believe that exuberance in commercial real estate risks a more significant reversal of price and thus raises safety and soundness concerns for these medium-sized banks, we can address these concerns with traditional tools.	94.0	90.0
201604	1623	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In particular, the 2006 real estate guidance, which was greatly watered down from its original formulation, could be strengthened.	94.0	90.0
201604	1624	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	That guidance could revisit the multifamily concentrations and consider more-binding thresholds of a kind similar to what had been done with leveraged lending.	94.0	90.0
201604	1625	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In addition, we could announce increased frequency of exams and more-thorough holding company exams for those banks and holding companies already outside the parameters of the current guidance.	94.0	90.0
201604	1626	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Although strengthening the guidance will likely require perhaps torturous interactions with our fellow supervisors, the likely long delays in this process suggest that we should start the process relatively soon.	94.0	90.0
201604	1627	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Increasing the depth and frequency of holding company exams would send a strong signal of our concern.	94.0	90.0
201604	1628	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	More-aggressive examinations would also have costs, as they would require significantly more resources than we have budgeted and would likely be viewed unfavorably by other regulators unless the primary regulator was also involved.	94.0	90.0
201604	1629	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Nevertheless, I think we should be considering these measures.	94.0	90.0
201604	1630	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In the case of the larger banks, the concern is less a supervisory one, as the overall exposures are relatively low, than a financial-stability one.	94.0	90.0
201604	1631	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In this case, the emphasis is on both signaling our concern and increasing the resiliency of the banking system to withstand a widespread price decline that causes collateral damage beyond that of the direct commercial real estate exposure.	94.0	90.0
201604	1632	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	One way to signal our concern and perhaps increase resiliency via additional capital buffering is to increase a more severe stress scenario in the CCAR exercise.	94.0	90.0
201604	1633	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This in effect raises the cost of capital for large banks making commercial real estate loans, which has the benefit of providing large banks an incentive to reduce the risk through their direct exposure.	94.0	90.0
201604	1634	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think we should consider this for the next CCAR.	94.0	90.0
201604	1635	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In addition, I view the rapid increase in commercial real estate prices as a sign of increased risk tolerance and possibly “reaching-for- yield” behavior.	94.0	90.0
201604	1636	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Although the countercyclical capital buffer is a blunt instrument, it has the virtue of building more resilience into banks should a CRE crash occur.	94.0	90.0
201604	1637	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would consider increasing the buffer, which is currently at zero, to reflect the increased risk to financial stability, with commercial real estate highlighted as key evidence of that risk.	94.0	90.0
201604	1638	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	What happens if nothing on the supervisory or macroprudential side is done?	94.0	90.0
201604	1639	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I hope that’s not the case, and that regulatory agencies begin to take increasing actions in response to this risk.	94.0	90.0
201604	1640	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The policy tools are vested in a variety of regulatory agencies, including the FSOC, the Board of Governors, and the other regulatory agencies, but not the FOMC.	94.0	90.0
201604	1641	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Due to the cumbersome governance in the United States, many of these changes would require long lags in implementation.	94.0	90.0
201604	1642	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In that case, were the risk to increase and no actions taken, I would be inclined to consider monetary policy tools, including more quickly shrinking our balance sheet or raising interest rates more quickly than we otherwise would, and highlighting through our formal communications that this, in part, reflects some of our financial stability concerns.	94.0	90.0
201604	1643	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	90.0
201604	1644	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201604	1645	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	94.0	65.0
201604	1646	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	107.0
201604	1647	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I think this QS presentation that Nellie made is a good opportunity to make the connection back to this morning’s conversation.	94.0	107.0
201604	1648	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Looking at the volatile market conditions at the outset of the year, they provided a bit of a stress test that helped inform the QS assessment this quarter.	94.0	107.0
201604	1649	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It was notable that US financial firms and markets came through the elevated volatility in January and early February looking relatively resilient.	94.0	107.0
201604	1650	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	This highlights the critical importance of the buffers that have been built since the crisis in the banking system in response to the substantially tougher regulatory framework and heightened supervisory expectations.	94.0	107.0
201604	1651	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, I thought it was interesting that the relatively smooth functioning of the corporate bond market in the face of very sharp increases in spreads was a particular focus, in light of ongoing concerns about liquidity transformation in mutual funds concentrated in the relatively illiquid assets in this sector, which have been highlighted by the FSOC.	94.0	107.0
201604	1652	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The volatility underscores the importance of the reforms the SEC is proposing to ensure proper stress testing and that liquidity is well managed and available in anticipation of redemption surges as well as limits on leverage through derivatives.	94.0	107.0
201604	1653	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The other dimension that I thought deserved particular attention, as President Rosengren had mentioned, is the particular focus on valuation pressures in commercial real estate, in which there’s been rapid growth in lending, particularly in the multifamily segment and in which underwriting standards have been weakening and capitalization rates have been falling.	94.0	107.0
201604	1654	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I think the discussions that we’ve had at the Board have very much emphasized the importance of ensuring that banks are vigilant to the risks associated with possible price declines in this segment of lending as well as interest rate increases.	94.0	107.0
201604	1655	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The Board is undertaking or assessing a variety of actions in this arena, including the incorporation of these risks into CCAR scenarios and reinforcement of the guidance on CRE concentrations.	94.0	107.0
201604	1656	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	One of the conclusions that was important in the work that was done by the QS staff is that a lot of the concentration sits in small banks, though they view it more as a microprudential than a macroprudential risk.	94.0	107.0
201604	1657	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	One of the interesting analyses that they shared was the potential value to top-down stress testing to help identify vulnerabilities in small banks and potentially help supervisory guidance, particularly when those vulnerabilities don’t correspond to higher CRE concentrations and thus would not have been caught necessarily by the concentration guidance.	94.0	107.0
201604	1658	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The conclusion I draw is simply that this framework and this QS is working, I think, the way that we would want it to work, and that insofar as the QS assessment called out risks to financial stability more generally that they believed would be best addressed by monetary policy, this would be precisely the kind of presentation that would help us move in that direction on the basis of the kind of framework that we talked about this morning.	94.0	107.0
201604	1659	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	107.0
201604	1660	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201604	1661	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	94.0	65.0
201604	1662	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Nellie, I wanted to try to draw out an example in which we moved from assessment to actually doing something, which is leveraged lending.	94.0	108.0
201604	1663	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	What was it that went from recognizing the problem to getting out warnings out about it, actually warnings that seem to have been heeded?	94.0	108.0
201604	1664	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	How did that all work?	94.0	108.0
201604	1665	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	So this was, I would say, probably in 2013.	94.0	999.0
201604	1666	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	No, it was after 2013, because I remember it.	94.0	108.0
201604	1667	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	Yes, well, it was 2011 when we started.	94.0	999.0
201604	1668	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	High-yield bond spreads were reaching near-historical lows, and we were seeing a weakening of underwriting standards in that sector.	94.0	999.0
201604	1669	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	Many of these transactions, like M&A transactions, require some combination of leveraged loans and high-yield bonds.	94.0	999.0
201604	1670	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	In the leveraged loan sector, we were seeing debt multiples rise pretty quickly, above six times—which is pretty high by historical standards, in terms of what is going to be repaid at some point.	94.0	999.0
201604	1671	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	So we were looking at both prices and standards and then debt growth for these loans that was starting to rise at an annual rate of somewhere between 10 to 15 percent a year.	94.0	999.0
201604	1672	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	At that point, there was some discussion of whether the banks were doing the underwriting of the leveraged loans and were they holding them.	94.0	999.0
201604	1673	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	That was the first discussion.	94.0	999.0
201604	1674	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	Would they be bearing future losses?	94.0	999.0
201604	1675	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	And, for the most part, while they were originating them, they were not holding them.	94.0	999.0
201604	1676	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	So there was just a lot of communication about this issue in the beginning.	94.0	999.0
201604	1677	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	I think there’s a little history on the leveraged loans.	94.0	999.0
201604	1678	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	We actually wanted to start an update of the guidance in 2008, but by then the crisis had sort of started, so it was a little too late to get this guidance out.	94.0	999.0
201604	1679	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	And so it had kind of started on its own, and this was a timely way to get it out.	94.0	999.0
201604	1680	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	So, I think, just by the metrics we look at, we’re seeing that the debt of the underlying firms that were issuing the high-yield bonds and the leveraged loans also was rising quickly.	94.0	999.0
201604	1681	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	That combination suggested starting with communications.	94.0	999.0
201604	1682	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	And was there interaction with the supervisors as well?	94.0	108.0
201604	1683	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	Oh, absolutely.	94.0	999.0
201604	1684	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	94.0	108.0
201604	1685	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	And Eric has talked about the commercial real estate capitalization rates.	94.0	108.0
201604	1686	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	On that or on anything else that’s in here, are there things we should be worrying about and beginning to focus on?	94.0	108.0
201604	1687	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	I think other than commercial real estate—and there we have done the assessments—we do not think at this point that it’s a broad financial stability concern.	94.0	999.0
201604	1688	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	The debt growth is not as sharp as it was in the high-yield sector or the corporate sector, but in view of these prices and incentives, absent shocks and the economy recovers, this is probably a place in which people will start to try to get credit, commercial real estate exposure.	94.0	999.0
201604	1689	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	So we would want to be paying attention to that.	94.0	999.0
201604	1690	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	Right now, as we said, it’s a small-bank issue.	94.0	999.0
201604	1691	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	The large banks have been stressed with pretty severe commercial real estate price declines on the order of 30 percent.	94.0	999.0
201604	1692	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	That’s in this year’s test too, right?	94.0	97.0
201604	1693	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	That is also in this year’s.	94.0	999.0
201604	1694	2016-04-27	meeting	LIANG	It was in last year’s test, and it is a similar sharp decline this year.	94.0	999.0
201604	1695	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	94.0	108.0
201604	1696	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	94.0	108.0
201604	1697	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	94.0	65.0
201604	1698	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	96.0
201604	1699	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	First of all, I really do appreciate all the work that’s gone into this QS assessment.	94.0	96.0
201604	1700	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I do like the fact that you’re doing this topical deep dive into commercial real estate.	94.0	96.0
201604	1701	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that doing a “deeper dive” on emerging issues should be part of the exercise on an ongoing basis.	94.0	96.0
201604	1702	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I would also encourage the staff to consider exploring other areas in which shocks could potentially emerge.	94.0	96.0
201604	1703	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me that there should be two broad considerations shaping the QS work—one, the likelihood of a large shock, and, two, the potential vulnerabilities of the financial system asset prices should that shock occur.	94.0	96.0
201604	1704	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Up to now, it seems like the QS had been more focused on the latter than the former, and I feel, as the process continues to mature, I would very much welcome a more forward-looking examination of the likelihood of large shocks emerging from various sectors of the economy.	94.0	96.0
201604	1705	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I have to say, when we’re talking about commercial real estate, I guess I’m a little bit less concerned about that, because it seems to me that this is really not about commercial real estate being dramatically overvalued—it’s really about the US Treasury market being really overvalued.	94.0	96.0
201604	1706	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And then, if you look at the spread of the cap rates relative to US Treasury securities, it doesn’t look that outlandish.	94.0	96.0
201604	1707	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s similar to the US equity market.	94.0	96.0
201604	1708	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The forward P/E ratio of the equity market looks elevated, but why is that?	94.0	96.0
201604	1709	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s because the Treasury market is at such a low-level yield.	94.0	96.0
201604	1710	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If you look at the equity risk premium, it doesn’t look particularly out of whack.	94.0	96.0
201604	1711	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So it seems to me, when I follow the threads, it all comes back to the US Treasury market, and that all comes back to us, because we deliberately pursued QE, which depressed term risk premiums.	94.0	96.0
201604	1712	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So, you know, to quote Pogo—“the enemy is us,” in some sense.	94.0	96.0
201604	1713	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it’s really important that we not lose sight of the fact that the Treasury bond market is really an area of significant risk and, I would argue, not so much in the United States, but more so in Japan and Europe.	94.0	96.0
201604	1714	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I keep thinking about, if the Japanese actually succeed in their aim to push inflation back to their objective, that implies a very, very large adjustment in JGB yields, and the same thing would be true in Europe as well.	94.0	96.0
201604	1715	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think we should just keep that in mind.	94.0	96.0
201604	1716	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I briefly want to touch on three other issues:  Puerto Rico, an old favorite; Brexit; and the potential consequences of the view that some countries may be reaching their limits of monetary policy.	94.0	96.0
201604	1717	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to Puerto Rico, the situation continues to go downhill.	94.0	96.0
201604	1718	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We still have a race going on between a hard, disorderly default due to lack of a good bankruptcy mechanism and congressional legislation that might provide such a regime, which could facilitate an orderly restructuring of the island’s debt burden.	94.0	96.0
201604	1719	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In recent weeks, the government has placed restrictions on the use of government development bank deposits.	94.0	96.0
201604	1720	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In response, we at the New York Federal Reserve have closed our account with the GDB.	94.0	96.0
201604	1721	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The good news is that this was anticipated.	94.0	96.0
201604	1722	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We told them we were going to have to do this, and the bulk of the payment accounts were transferred from us to banks on the island, so there’s been very minimal disruption to payment activity.	94.0	96.0
201604	1723	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The other piece of good news is that our closure of the GDB account has not gotten much attention in the press, nor has it appeared to provoke greater instability.	94.0	96.0
201604	1724	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So that’s the good news.	94.0	96.0
201604	1725	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The bad news is that, on May 1, the GDB faces a large debt obligation that it’s highly unlikely to have the funds to meet, and on July 1, the government will be in the same situation with respect to sovereign debt.	94.0	96.0
201604	1726	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So unless viable congressional legislation arrives relatively quickly, this situation could go downhill very, very fast.	94.0	96.0
201604	1727	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	One area of particular vulnerability is that of the “cooperativas.”	94.0	96.0
201604	1728	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The cooperativas are credit unions on the island that provide a significant amount of banking and deposit services to island residents.	94.0	96.0
201604	1729	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	This is not a great situation.	94.0	96.0
201604	1730	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	They don’t have much capital.	94.0	96.0
201604	1731	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	They have significant Puerto Rican sovereign debt exposure.	94.0	96.0
201604	1732	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The entity that ensures their deposits has very little in the way of resources, and the government lacks the fiscal capacity to backstop this sector.	94.0	96.0
201604	1733	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So the risk of a deposit run on the cooperativas is very real.	94.0	96.0
201604	1734	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re monitoring the situation very carefully.	94.0	96.0
201604	1735	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We don’t see anything yet, which is the good news, but, you know, you ask yourself in this situation, when do you get deposit runs?	94.0	96.0
201604	1736	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	This is probably pretty high up on your list.	94.0	96.0
201604	1737	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the Congress and the Administration, I think the issue is, are they going to get to legislation?	94.0	96.0
201604	1738	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And is the legislation actually going to be workable, in terms of providing for an orderly bankruptcy?	94.0	96.0
201604	1739	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	As I’ve said many times before, the Puerto Rico situation is absolutely horrible for the people of Puerto Rico.	94.0	96.0
201604	1740	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	People are leaving the island.	94.0	96.0
201604	1741	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The economy is contracting.	94.0	96.0
201604	1742	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But the contagion risk back to the US mainland seems to be very, very limited, and that hasn’t changed.	94.0	96.0
201604	1743	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	On Brexit, we talked a bit about the issue for the British, if they were to vote to exit.	94.0	96.0
201604	1744	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I do think, though, that that is priced into markets, as Simon noted.	94.0	96.0
201604	1745	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But there are two other issues.	94.0	96.0
201604	1746	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If Britain were to vote to leave, I think there really would be a risk of contagion to Europe, because I think Brexit could be conceivably viewed as another shoe to drop on the road to European Union disintegration, and that’s not priced into markets.	94.0	96.0
201604	1747	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the degree of contagion that might occur there is highly uncertain.	94.0	96.0
201604	1748	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think that if there was a Brexit vote to exit—I think that PredictIt.org yesterday had it as 29 percent probability—it could lead to a generalized risk- off sentiment.	94.0	96.0
201604	1749	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	You know, we’ve gone from risk-on to risk-off to risk-on.	94.0	96.0
201604	1750	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We could go back to risk-off very, very quickly.	94.0	96.0
201604	1751	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And if we saw that, I think we’d see quite a bit of turbulence in the foreign exchange markets and tighter global financial market conditions.	94.0	96.0
201604	1752	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	One key issue here is, what would happen to the Japanese yen?	94.0	96.0
201604	1753	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If there really was a wholesale movement to the Japanese yen, how would the Japanese authorities react, and what would the tolerance of the rest of the G-20 be for Japanese foreign exchange intervention?	94.0	96.0
201604	1754	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So that’s another important wildcard to consider.	94.0	96.0
201604	1755	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	This could all go downhill very, very quickly, depending on how this unfolds.	94.0	96.0
201604	1756	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The third issue I want to mention briefly is the risk we could go back—and this is going to be channeling Steve a little bit—to the darker days of January and early February should the global economic outlook disappoint.	94.0	96.0
201604	1757	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I generally agree with how you summed it up in terms of “Yes,”	94.0	96.0
201604	1758	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	“Yes,”	94.0	96.0
201604	1759	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	“Maybe,” and “No.”	94.0	96.0
201604	1760	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But it seems to me that one important support for the global economic outlook is this notion that countries have the monetary policy and fiscal capacity to respond if they’re hit with adverse shocks.	94.0	96.0
201604	1761	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think that the rather unhappy experience with negative interest rates is a cause for concern, at least for me, because I think households and businesses judge the capacity for an effective response as having diminished.	94.0	96.0
201604	1762	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If you were hit with a shock, sentiment could turn much more sharply in a negative direction very, very quickly.	94.0	96.0
201604	1763	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So you could end up in this feedback loop of deteriorating confidence and deteriorating financial conditions with the central banks not having a lot of credible ammunition to use to offset this.	94.0	96.0
201604	1764	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think it’s good that financial conditions have recovered nicely over the past few months, but I still feel there’s some underlying fragility there that, at least for me, suggests that the risks still remain skewed somewhat to the downside.	94.0	96.0
201604	1765	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	96.0
201604	1766	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	94.0	65.0
201604	1767	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Bill, how sure are you that this is anything but a banker’s attempt to prevent negative real interest rates?	94.0	108.0
201604	1768	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	And you said the loss of confidence.	94.0	108.0
201604	1769	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Where is the loss of confidence coming from?	94.0	108.0
201604	1770	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	From the guys who don’t want this?	94.0	108.0
201604	1771	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	No.	94.0	96.0
201604	1772	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not so much focused on the bankers not liking negative interest rates because of the pressure on their net interest margins.	94.0	96.0
201604	1773	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m more focused on the fact that I think households in particular view this as sort of a scary regime.	94.0	96.0
201604	1774	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	My own personal opinion is that there’s a subtle confidence channel here, that an environment in which you have to pay to hold cash in a bank is sort of unnerving.	94.0	96.0
201604	1775	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I can’t prove that there’s that channel, but it certainly seems to me that the general reaction to negative interest rates in Europe and Japan has been more negative than what people anticipated.	94.0	96.0
201604	1776	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, but if you look at it more closely, you’ll see that the reaction came largely from Germany and from whatever is going on in Japan, which I don’t understand.	94.0	108.0
201604	1777	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	The ECB has sort of turned back a little bit from its statement that this won’t work if we have to go further.	94.0	108.0
201604	1778	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	The Swedes, to whom we listened at great length during the IMF meeting, are very happy with what they’ve got and believe they can do more.	94.0	108.0
201604	1779	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	So I don’t think we’re at the end of negative rates.	94.0	108.0
201604	1780	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We may not be at the end, but I’m talking about people’s perception that there’s a diminishing margin of monetary policy in the toolkit, that’s all.	94.0	96.0
201604	1781	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Because you saw in January and early February that the swing in sentiment was really powerfully negative, and I think that was part of what was driving it.	94.0	96.0
201604	1782	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s just my personal opinion.	94.0	96.0
201604	1783	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I hope I’m totally wrong.	94.0	96.0
201604	1784	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	94.0	65.0
201604	1785	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest we take a 15-minute break.	52.0	65.0
201604	1786	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll will get some coffee, and then we’ll start our economic go-round.	52.0	65.0
201604	1788	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, folks, let’s resume.	52.0	65.0
201604	1789	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think we can now begin our economic go-round.	13.0	65.0
201604	1790	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	And our first speaker is President Williams.	13.0	65.0
201604	1791	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	102.0
201604	1792	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	My positive outlook for the economy remains essentially unchanged since our previous meeting.	13.0	102.0
201604	1793	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Better financial conditions and robust job growth have offset some disappointing spending data.	13.0	102.0
201604	1794	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Overall, I expect 2016 to look a lot like 2015, with about 2 percent real GDP growth, sizable job gains, and a gradual decline in the unemployment rate.	13.0	102.0
201604	1795	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I expect underlying measures of inflation to make the final few steps to our 2 percent goal over the next few years.	13.0	102.0
201604	1796	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	As we discussed already today, I see the risks to the outlook as having come down a bit.	13.0	102.0
201604	1797	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’ll mention one in particular.	13.0	102.0
201604	1798	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I was concerned about the high degree of uncertainty that was holding back, potentially, employment and investment regarding “Deflategate” and how that would be resolved.	13.0	102.0
201604	1799	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13.0	102.0
201604	1800	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But now that the courts have finally resolved that issue to everyone’s satisfaction, I think that uncertainty has also stepped down.	13.0	102.0
201604	1801	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, overall, I see the risks to the outlook as roughly in balance.	13.0	102.0
201604	1802	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, it’s that time of year when we all get together to discuss residual seasonality.	13.0	102.0
201604	1803	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13.0	102.0
201604	1804	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	First-quarter dips in real GDP growth have become the norm.	13.0	102.0
201604	1805	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the past, these weak first quarters have been followed by systematically stronger GDP growth later in the year, and so they provided little signal about the underlying momentum of the economy.	13.0	102.0
201604	1806	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	One underlying problem is that the BEA uses a bottom-up methodology, which seasonally adjusts the individual subcomponents of GDP instead of the aggregate number directly, and this approach allows small amounts of seasonal variation at a granular level when aggregated to affect the top-line numbers.	13.0	102.0
201604	1807	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, to correct this problem, my trusty staff took a top-down approach and applied a second round of seasonal adjustment to the published aggregates, and they estimate that real GDP after this second round of seasonal adjustment increased at a rate of more than 2 percent in the first quarter.	13.0	102.0
201604	1808	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The higher number is better aligned with the strong labor market readings and is more consistent with my business contacts who report no recent drop-off in activity.	13.0	102.0
201604	1809	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The residual seasonality also reflects the PCE inflation data but to a much lesser extent, and it can be sidestepped by focusing on year-over-year comparisons.	13.0	102.0
201604	1810	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The Tealbook indicates that core PCE inflation rose 1.6 percent from the first quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year, and that’s a jump of 0.3 percentage point from where it was a year ago.	13.0	102.0
201604	1811	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	A big part of this step-up reflects the dissipation of transitory factors that were holding core inflation down.	13.0	102.0
201604	1812	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	One notable example is the acceleration of prices for health-care services.	13.0	102.0
201604	1813	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Medicaid physician payments were cut on a one-off basis in January 2015, something I mentioned last year, and that lowered health-care inflation and held down year-over-year aggregate core PCE inflation by a couple of tenths throughout last year.	13.0	102.0
201604	1814	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now that we’ve moved out of that 12-month window, price inflation for health-care services has been resuscitated, if you will, and it is again adding to core PCE inflation.	13.0	102.0
201604	1815	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Unlike the Tealbook, I assume the increases in year-over-year inflation will not be unwound and continue to expect inflation to steadily move back toward our target of 2 percent over the next few years.	13.0	102.0
201604	1816	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the labor market, there’s little doubt that things are good.	13.0	102.0
201604	1817	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	A wide range of labor market indicators, such as initial claims for unemployment insurance, job openings, quits rates, and perceptions of job availability and hiring difficulties, all point to a labor market at full employment.	13.0	102.0
201604	1818	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even labor force participation has rebounded, driven by inflow of workers ages 25 to 54 who are taking advantage of the strong job market.	13.0	102.0
201604	1819	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	One discordant note in the otherwise strong labor market is the elevated number of long- term unemployed—that is, those who have been looking for a job for at least six months.	13.0	102.0
201604	1820	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	A number of studies have raised the possibility that this increase in long-term unemployment reflects particular characteristics of the long-term unemployed, such as outmoded or depreciated skills, and that these challenges may have persisted well into the recovery.	13.0	102.0
201604	1821	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	To investigate this hypothesis, my staff examined the underlying microdata to see why so many long-term unemployed have failed to escape either by finding a job or exiting the labor force.	13.0	102.0
201604	1822	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	This investigation finds that during the recession, job-finding rates declined uniformly for all types of unemployed individuals, suggesting, at least on that basis, that the long-term unemployed aren’t unique in that regard.	13.0	102.0
201604	1823	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	At the same time, the composition of unemployment also shifted toward individuals with a relatively low propensity to leave the labor force—for example, older workers who permanently lost their long-standing jobs.	13.0	102.0
201604	1824	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	These two patterns in combination boosted the share of workers who moved into long-term unemployment.	13.0	102.0
201604	1825	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	That is, the growing pool of long- term unemployed are primarily job seekers who are dedicated to staying in the labor force and are actively looking for jobs but are finding it difficult to land one.	13.0	102.0
201604	1826	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	They don’t appear to be individuals who have mismatched skills or other unfavorable characteristics.	13.0	102.0
201604	1827	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In other words, from the perspective of our maximum-employment mandate, the long-term unemployed should be counted equally with the rest of the unemployed, and the overall unemployment rate remains a good summary measure of the health of the labor market.	13.0	102.0
201604	1828	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So what should we expect regarding the long-term unemployment rate?	13.0	102.0
201604	1829	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	My staff constructed a simulation of unemployment dynamics that incorporates unemployment escape rates for the various groups of the short- and long-term unemployed.	13.0	102.0
201604	1830	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Their analysis suggests that the current elevated long-term unemployment rate reflects longer-term trends in the composition of the labor force and is not a sign of anything unusual in the labor market at this time.	13.0	102.0
201604	1831	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	These trends include demographic factors such as the aging workforce and the high labor force attachment of women—that is, the higher share of long-term unemployed is just part of the “new normal.”	13.0	102.0
201604	1832	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Finally, I appreciated the Tealbook alternative view box on the outlook for productivity growth.	13.0	102.0
201604	1833	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ve been repeatedly surprised by weak productivity growth for the past five years, and if productivity growth doesn’t rebound sharply this year as assumed in the Tealbook, then the alternative scenario—consisting of weaker labor productivity and a stronger labor market— becomes a more likely outcome.	13.0	102.0
201604	1834	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In that scenario, unemployment falls below 4 percent, and we overshoot our inflation goal.	13.0	102.0
201604	1835	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	As I mentioned last time, this is one of the prominent upside risks to the achievement of our goals that I see as balancing the downside risk arising from abroad.	13.0	102.0
201604	1836	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thanks.	13.0	102.0
201604	1837	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201604	1838	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13.0	65.0
201604	1839	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	81.0
201604	1840	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Economic conditions in the Fifth District have strengthened in recent weeks.	13.0	81.0
201604	1841	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	We’re hearing uniformly positive reports from our District contacts, with the exception of those in the coal country of southern West Virginia, and our survey results have been strong as well.	13.0	81.0
201604	1842	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Our manufacturing index popped up to 22 in March after a long stretch of neutral readings.	13.0	81.0
201604	1843	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	The April results, which were released this morning, remained strong.	13.0	81.0
201604	1844	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	The composite index was 14, and the new orders index was 18.	13.0	81.0
201604	1845	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Our services survey, which also rose in March, strengthened further to 15 in April.	13.0	81.0
201604	1846	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	The retail component remained exceptionally strong at 37, with sharper traffic in big-ticket sales registering large gains.	13.0	81.0
201604	1847	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	The wage indexes remained solidly positive in all our survey sectors.	13.0	81.0
201604	1848	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	For the national economy, the incoming data did not change my assessment since our previous meeting or, for that matter, since December.	13.0	81.0
201604	1849	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Financial market turbulence has subsided, and downside risks to US economic growth look to me to have returned to about where they were four months ago.	13.0	81.0
201604	1850	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	I continue to expect real GDP growth of about 2 percent for the next year or two.	13.0	81.0
201604	1851	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	I agree with the Tealbook that there’s no slack left in labor markets, and measures of unemployment and labor force participation indicate essentially full utilization of labor resources.	13.0	81.0
201604	1852	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	So we are as close to our maximum-employment objective as one could hope for.	13.0	81.0
201604	1853	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	In the near term, I expect employment growth to continue to outpace growth in the working-age population.	13.0	81.0
201604	1854	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	In other words, I think we’re going to reach a state of “overutilization of labor market resources,” a phrase I hope to see us use with as much diligence as we used the phrase “underutilization of labor market resources.”	13.0	81.0
201604	1855	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	In the past, some have argued that labor market resources are underutilized because otherwise we would be seeing increasing nominal wage growth, but I think it is now clearly visible in the data.	13.0	81.0
201604	1856	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	While some wage measures, such as average hourly earnings or median earnings growth, have firmed somewhat, other measures from the household survey that filter out composition effects, such as those in the Atlanta Wage Growth Tracker, have accelerated noticeably and are running at a rate of 2½ percent or 3 percent or higher.	13.0	81.0
201604	1857	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	That might not sound like a lot of growth in nominal wages.	13.0	81.0
201604	1858	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	But in an environment with low labor productivity growth and low price inflation, it implies meaningful growth in real wages.	13.0	81.0
201604	1859	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	In fact, over the past three years, real wage growth has outpaced labor productivity growth, and, thus, real unit labor costs and the wage income share have been increasing, which is something we usually observe when labor markets are relatively tight.	13.0	81.0
201604	1860	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	There’s no question the first-quarter data have come in on the weak side.	13.0	81.0
201604	1861	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	At this point, though, Q1 looks just like a blip.	13.0	81.0
201604	1862	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	I agree with President Williams, and I’m impressed by his analysis of the seasonal adjustment problems.	13.0	81.0
201604	1863	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	In light of the strong labor market and solid readings on consumer sentiment, the dip in consumption growth looks temporary, and I expect healthy consumer spending growth to resume.	13.0	81.0
201604	1864	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Residential investment also appears to be on track for strong growth this year.	13.0	81.0
201604	1865	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	In fact, our local reports suggest that rising construction costs and a shortage of buildable lots are increasingly prevalent.	13.0	81.0
201604	1866	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	One of our contacts, the CEO of the nation’s largest supplier of drywall, reports exceptional year-over-year growth in shipments and describes his firm as positively giddy about its 2016 prospects.	13.0	81.0
201604	1867	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Business fixed investment certainly has been soft even before the first quarter, reflecting the effects of the strong dollar, global growth concerns, and a contraction in oil and gas drilling.	13.0	81.0
201604	1868	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Looking forward, though, the dollar seems to have peaked, oil prices have stabilized, and the lion’s share of cutbacks in oil and gas investment are behind us now.	13.0	81.0
201604	1869	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	So I agree with the Tealbook’s outlook for moderate gains in business fixed investment in the coming quarters.	13.0	81.0
201604	1870	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	I’d like to say a word or two about productivity.	13.0	81.0
201604	1871	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	As the Tealbook points out in its alternative view box and as was discussed today, labor productivity growth has averaged less than ½ percent per year over the past six years, clearly a subpar outcome compared with the period prior to the Great Recession.	13.0	81.0
201604	1872	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	The staff has been projecting an imminent return to a rate above 1¼ percent for some time—a return that has not materialized—and the Tealbook is quite candid about its forecasting record.	13.0	81.0
201604	1873	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	In their defense, though, there’s a compelling case for expecting a return to more typical productivity growth rates in general, reversion to the mean and all.	13.0	81.0
201604	1874	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Nonetheless, as more time elapses with persistently low productivity growth in this expansion, it’s natural to place more weight on the possibility that it’s going to be depressed for some time to come.	13.0	81.0
201604	1875	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Reasonable people can differ on how much more weight, but for me, the past six years have been pretty convincing.	13.0	81.0
201604	1876	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	So for the near term, I’m inclined to expect a continuation of about the same rate of productivity growth we’ve seen since 2011.	13.0	81.0
201604	1877	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Together with the fact that the working-age population is expected to grow at about ½ percent per year over the next few years, this suggests we should expect to transition to a new trend growth rate for real GDP of less than 1½ percent.	13.0	81.0
201604	1878	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	It is true that lower productivity growth is generally associated with lower real interest rates, but I don’t think the real economic growth we’ve been seeing comes anywhere close to justifying the level of real rates we currently have.	13.0	81.0
201604	1879	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Furthermore, there’s a consensus that labor market slack is gone, and in my view, real GDP and employment growth will exceed trend growth in the near term.	13.0	81.0
201604	1880	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Under current settings of our monetary policy instruments, the outlook for labor markets and output leaves me increasingly confident that inflation will rise this year.	13.0	81.0
201604	1881	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Indeed, in recent months we’ve seen various measures of core inflation rise toward 2 percent, and a broad firming trend now seems evident, notwithstanding the March CPI.	13.0	81.0
201604	1882	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	This is not to say that inflation is about to break out immediately and surge above our target, but it does suggest that there are growing risks to the upside that deserve consideration.	13.0	81.0
201604	1883	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	81.0
201604	1884	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201604	1885	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13.0	65.0
201604	1886	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201604	1887	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	We find ourselves and the economy once more in an almost familiar place.	13.0	108.0
201604	1888	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	In March, we decided to wait on further developments because we were not sure whether it was the first six weeks of this year or the following four weeks that most closely represented the likely state of the economy in the weeks to come.	13.0	108.0
201604	1889	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	At this stage, we appear to have returned approximately to the reality to which we have become accustomed for more than a year.	13.0	108.0
201604	1890	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	The labor market remains strong, perhaps a bit stronger than we had expected, as the labor force participation rate has increased for six months in a row.	13.0	108.0
201604	1891	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	But GDP growth remains woeful.	13.0	108.0
201604	1892	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	We can reconcile the behavior of the labor market and that of output by saying that productivity growth is very weak, which it is.	13.0	108.0
201604	1893	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	But it would be good if we understood why.	13.0	108.0
201604	1894	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Those three points are more or less the position to which we were beginning to accustom ourselves at the end of 2015, but now there is an extra factor.	13.0	108.0
201604	1895	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Aggregate demand growth seems to have weakened in the first few months of this year.	13.0	108.0
201604	1896	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	That can be accounted for in a variety of ways by saying there’s been a decline in productivity, by noting the decline in the volume of investment, which is both a decline in aggregate demand and a factor reducing productivity growth.	13.0	108.0
201604	1897	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Where are we now before we get into the details of how tough everything is?	13.0	108.0
201604	1898	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, first, we’re very close to full employment.	13.0	108.0
201604	1899	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Second, now that oil prices appear to have stabilized and the dollar has stopped depreciating—at least temporarily, perhaps—inflation is higher than it was most of last year, though lower than it was in January.	13.0	108.0
201604	1900	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Core inflation is about 1.5 percent, which I regard as being in hailing distance of our target.	13.0	108.0
201604	1901	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	The staff has begun to analyze the challenges posed by the slowing of growth.	13.0	108.0
201604	1902	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	There is, first, the fact that some of what we are seeing may simply be a result of the first-quarter blues, a disease that presents itself for what appears to be a severe slowdown in the first quarter.	13.0	108.0
201604	1903	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Data revisions, at least over the past two years, then appear to reduce the reported first-quarter slowdown in the following months but to not totally dispose of it.	13.0	108.0
201604	1904	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Second, in the alternative view box, productivity acceleration will be more gradual, which President Williams just referred to.	13.0	108.0
201604	1905	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	On pages 22 and 23 of Tealbook A, Tomaz Cajner analyzes the consequence of the possibility that falling job reallocation associated with declining business dynamism appears to be pushing down productivity growth as it had after the year 2000.	13.0	108.0
201604	1906	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	The concluding paragraph of that box considered what would happen if productivity growth remains historically low for a long time.	13.0	108.0
201604	1907	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	I quote again:  “A protracted productivity slowdown would have much more serious macroeconomic consequences, including continued downward pressure on the equilibrium real interest rate, reduced incentives for labor force participation, rising fiscal imbalances, and slower improvements in living standards.”	13.0	108.0
201604	1908	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	One reaction would be to say, “Well, we know all of that.”	13.0	108.0
201604	1909	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	But knowing all of that doesn’t make it any better.	13.0	108.0
201604	1910	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Another reaction would be to say that it would be useful to focus on discovering and arguing for productivity-enhancing policies more intensively than we have so far.	13.0	108.0
201604	1911	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	One doesn’t sense—at least I don’t sense—that there is a very active debate going on about what we need to do to get productivity to grow more rapidly.	13.0	108.0
201604	1912	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, not all that has happened since the beginning of the year is bad.	13.0	108.0
201604	1913	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Foreign growth, especially in Canada but also in the euro zone, will probably be higher than it was last year.	13.0	108.0
201604	1914	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	The Chinese government has decided to try to maintain economic growth near 7 percent, albeit with the same debt-creating policies whose long-run sustainability is doubtful.	13.0	108.0
201604	1915	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	And it seems to have decided that it does not want a serious devaluation at this stage, which has calmed the unease about China’s policies that was part of the uncertainty in the first quarter of this year.	13.0	108.0
201604	1916	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	The dollar has weakened.	13.0	108.0
201604	1917	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	All those things are helpful for our growth, but the uncertainties of potential Brexit remain.	13.0	108.0
201604	1918	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	So, what’s next?	13.0	108.0
201604	1919	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, what’s next is we wait until tomorrow to decide on the policy recommendations that follow from the present conjuncture.	13.0	108.0
201604	1920	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	13.0	108.0
201604	1921	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201604	1922	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	13.0	65.0
201604	1923	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201604	1924	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It was a puzzling dichotomy between the spending and employment data in the first quarter.	13.0	90.0
201604	1925	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The spending data were a disappointment.	13.0	90.0
201604	1926	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The Tealbook expects the first-quarter real GDP growth rate to be only ½ percent, which is slow even with diminished assumptions about potential real GDP growth.	13.0	90.0
201604	1927	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, like the Tealbook, I am expecting the first quarter to be a lull rather than a trend, and one major reason is the continued strength evident in the labor market.	13.0	90.0
201604	1928	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	We all know the aggregate employment numbers have continued to expand rapidly.	13.0	90.0
201604	1929	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Less-formal information reinforces those numbers.	13.0	90.0
201604	1930	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	When talking to officials at colleges around New England, they are reporting robust results for their seniors about to graduate and an increase in recruiting activities on college campuses.	13.0	90.0
201604	1931	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, it is not just those with high educational attainment that are enjoying the results of the tighter labor market.	13.0	90.0
201604	1932	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The strong growth in the participation rate since September highlights that as the labor market has tightened, more people are moving from out of the labor force to being employed.	13.0	90.0
201604	1933	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This also includes sectors of the labor market in which unemployment is elevated, such as minorities and those who have limited educational attainment.	13.0	90.0
201604	1934	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’m fairly confident that spending will rebound.	13.0	90.0
201604	1935	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Certainly, an important reason for the first-quarter weakness was low consumption growth.	13.0	90.0
201604	1936	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Like the Tealbook, I expect consumption to rebound in the remainder of the year due to favorable trends in the stock market, housing prices, and income.	13.0	90.0
201604	1937	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I also expect the recent weakness in business investment to abate.	13.0	90.0
201604	1938	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Those factors alone could push spending growth above potential.	13.0	90.0
201604	1939	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	As it is unlikely that firms would continue to hire if they were expecting sales to weaken, I am placing more weight on the positive labor market data than on the first-quarter GDP lull.	13.0	90.0
201604	1940	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Nor am I particularly worried that with proper monetary policy the labor market will get too tight.	13.0	90.0
201604	1941	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	My forecast calls for some further tightening of the labor market.	13.0	90.0
201604	1942	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	There are certainly advantages to allowing the labor market to tighten somewhat further.	13.0	90.0
201604	1943	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Probing how low the natural rate of unemployment is currently will likely encourage more people to reenter the labor force, benefiting themselves and the overall economy.	13.0	90.0
201604	1944	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In terms of prices, I am now a bit more confident that we’re moving toward our 2 percent inflation target.	13.0	90.0
201604	1945	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	At the time of our December FOMC meeting, core PCE inflation had not yet shown a clear positive trend and had been fluctuating somewhat below 1½ percent over much of the year.	13.0	90.0
201604	1946	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, with core PCE inflation currently at 1.7 percent, there is more evidence of a positive trend.	13.0	90.0
201604	1947	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This casual observation is confirmed by work by my staff that has used a monthly error correction model that includes the gap between core CPI and core PCE inflation, along with lagged changes in inflation rates, the unemployment gap, and the relative prices of oil and non- oil imports.	13.0	90.0
201604	1948	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Using this model to conduct a dynamic simulation of the likely path of core PCE, they concluded that we are quite likely to see more progress in core PCE approaching our target.	13.0	90.0
201604	1949	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Private-sector forecasters seem to be drawing a similar conclusion.	13.0	90.0
201604	1950	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The Survey of Professional Forecasters, which provides forecasters’ probabilities of different core PCE inflation outcomes, is similarly showing forecasters placing modestly more weight on the FOMC moving closer to its target over the next two years.	13.0	90.0
201604	1951	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would also note that the concerns about significant downside risk, as reflected in the financial market turbulence over the first several months of this year, have subsided.	13.0	90.0
201604	1952	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Stock prices are higher.	13.0	90.0
201604	1953	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Stock volatility is down.	13.0	90.0
201604	1954	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Many interest rate spreads have narrowed, and many global financial markets have improved.	13.0	90.0
201604	1955	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This is consistent not only with my baseline forecast but also with surveys that assess tail risk.	13.0	90.0
201604	1956	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Neither the primary dealers nor participants in the Survey of Professional Forecasters see a particularly elevated risk of much higher unemployment rates in the next year and a half.	13.0	90.0
201604	1957	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I must admit that with modal private-sector forecasts expecting economic growth above its potential rate and, consequently, further tightening of labor markets, as well as surveys not indicating a particularly elevated tail risk, I find the pricing in the federal funds futures somewhat puzzling.	13.0	90.0
201604	1958	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	A divergence between our own views of the likely path of interest rates as reported in the March SEP and the market’s pricing of very few federal funds increases over the next two years or more raises the risk of a taper tantrum reaction when we do raise rates.	13.0	90.0
201604	1959	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I will discuss how we should react to this risk in the policy discussion tomorrow.	13.0	90.0
201604	1960	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201604	1961	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201604	1962	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13.0	65.0
201604	1963	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	107.0
201604	1964	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Since we last met, the most notable improvement has been a significant easing in global financial conditions, which reflects in no small part a change in expectations surrounding the path of US monetary policy.	13.0	107.0
201604	1965	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, the labor market has remained strong, while the data on inflation and aggregate spending have disappointed.	13.0	107.0
201604	1966	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Job growth, at 215,000 last month, remains strong, and the participation rate rose again.	13.0	107.0
201604	1967	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Since September of last year, while the unemployment rate has remained essentially flat, participation has increased 0.6 percentage point.	13.0	107.0
201604	1968	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	This is very welcome, and it suggests that participation may be more responsive to improvement in labor market conditions than seemed to be the case for much of the recovery.	13.0	107.0
201604	1969	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	If it continues, the prospects for growth in potential output would be somewhat more optimistic.	13.0	107.0
201604	1970	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Most of the increase in participation since September has been among prime-age individuals whose declining participation over the earlier part of the recovery had been puzzling.	13.0	107.0
201604	1971	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	While recent increases have raised the prime-age employment-to- population ratio 1¾ percentage points above its trough in mid-2011, the prime-age EPOP ratio still remains 1½ percentage points below the average level before the crisis.	13.0	107.0
201604	1972	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	This suggests some slack remains, which is reinforced by the relatively elevated share of employees working part time who want full-time work and the still-subdued pace of wage growth.	13.0	107.0
201604	1973	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	As Bill Wascher pointed out earlier, the labor force participation rate for adult African Americans is about 3 percentage points below its pre-crisis level, similar to the gap for whites, and the gap is a little over 2 percentage points for Hispanics.	13.0	107.0
201604	1974	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	While the overall unemployment rate is down near pre- crisis levels for whites and Hispanics, unemployment among African Americans remains above its pre-crisis level.	13.0	107.0
201604	1975	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, while the participation rate of African Americans is roughly equal to that of whites, their unemployment rate is twice as high, suggesting scope for further gains.	13.0	107.0
201604	1976	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	On inflation, the most recent data, the February PCE and the March CPI reports, suggest that progress toward our inflation target is likely to remain quite gradual.	13.0	107.0
201604	1977	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It now appears likely that the stronger readings at the start of the year reflected, in part, the residual seasonality, which has tended to produce higher PCE inflation readings in the beginning of the year and lower readings toward the end.	13.0	107.0
201604	1978	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Although the fall in the dollar since the beginning of the year should help boost inflation this year, it may not persist.	13.0	107.0
201604	1979	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Indeed, the dollar has moved a bit higher in recent days, and in view of the global outlook, the risk of a higher dollar appears somewhat greater than the reverse.	13.0	107.0
201604	1980	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The subdued price pressures evident in the March CPI look likely to continue.	13.0	107.0
201604	1981	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	If so, the 12-month change in core PCE prices should move down from the 1.7 percent readings reached in January and February to about 1.5 percent this quarter.	13.0	107.0
201604	1982	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I remain concerned by the risk that continued low inflation will put downward pressure on inflation expectations.	13.0	107.0
201604	1983	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Market-based measures of five-year inflation compensation five years ahead have edged up since March, but they remain extremely low.	13.0	107.0
201604	1984	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Household survey-based measures of inflation expectations also remain low, as we saw in the preliminary April Michigan survey, which showed the median 10-year inflation expectation moving back down to 2.5 percent, significantly below the longer-run average.	13.0	107.0
201604	1985	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The spending data in hand for the first quarter of this year are also disappointing.	13.0	107.0
201604	1986	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	This first-quarter weakness, as others have noted, appears similar to a pattern we’ve seen in the preceding two years.	13.0	107.0
201604	1987	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	However, it is worth noting that the apparent weakness in first-quarter GDP and PCE growth this year comes on the heels of relatively weak fourth-quarter GDP and PCE growth, which is in contrast to 2014 and 2015, when the preceding fourth quarters had seen more robust growth.	13.0	107.0
201604	1988	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, the downbeat data on economic activity contrast with the continued steady improvement in the labor market, which provides reasons to hope that the first- quarter spending data are once again understating the underlying pace of activity.	13.0	107.0
201604	1989	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The current data suggest consumption growth of a little less than 2 percent last quarter, but the fundamentals, including continued solid job and real income growth, buoyant sentiment, and rising wealth, all point to faster growth.	13.0	107.0
201604	1990	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In contrast, the weakness in business investment, lower corporate profits, and still- elevated bond spreads may presage some slowing in labor demand.	13.0	107.0
201604	1991	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Orders and shipments of capital equipment have been trending lower for several months, and investment in intangible capital also seems to have softened, with investment in this category edging down over the second half of last year.	13.0	107.0
201604	1992	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	When combined with continued sharp declines in energy-related structures, these data suggest a significant decline in business fixed investment last quarter.	13.0	107.0
201604	1993	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Although weakness in the energy sector is in part responsible for these developments, a persistently gloomy foreign outlook is likely also weighing on firms’ expansion plans.	13.0	107.0
201604	1994	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Even factoring in recent welcome improvements in Canada, recent data on the overall foreign outlook continue to suggest weak demand and downside risks.	13.0	107.0
201604	1995	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In Japan, even before the Kumamoto earthquake, activity had stagnated.	13.0	107.0
201604	1996	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The outcome of recent wage negotiations was quite disappointing, and despite extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy, it has been very difficult to raise inflation expectations, and inflation remains distant from the target.	13.0	107.0
201604	1997	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In Europe, economic activity continued its gradual recovery in the first quarter, but inflation and market- based measures of inflation compensation remain very low.	13.0	107.0
201604	1998	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	With monetary policy extremely accommodative and no help from fiscal policy, progress on inflation remains vulnerable to shocks.	13.0	107.0
201604	1999	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Most immediately, of course, on June 23 voters in the United Kingdom will decide whether to remain in the European Union.	13.0	107.0
201604	2000	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	A “no” vote could be highly disruptive.	13.0	107.0
201604	2001	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, following February’s very volatile market conditions, we’ve seen a substantial easing of financial conditions, which appears to coincide with a shift in expectations about the monetary policy path in the United States and of the dollar.	13.0	107.0
201604	2002	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Equity prices have rebounded.	13.0	107.0
201604	2003	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Oil and other commodity prices have stabilized or increased, and corporate bond spreads have come down, although they remain elevated.	13.0	107.0
201604	2004	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Emerging markets have benefited as financing conditions have eased.	13.0	107.0
201604	2005	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	These developments have coincided with a stabilization of the Chinese RMB against the dollar even as the dollar has declined.	13.0	107.0
201604	2006	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The combination of dollar easing and additional capital controls led to a stabilization of China’s foreign exchange reserves in March, along with a notable reduction in concerns about a sharp devaluation.	13.0	107.0
201604	2007	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Although Chinese GDP increased at an annual rate of only 5.4 percent in the first quarter, the most recent monthly data on industrial production and credit growth signal a step-up in GDP growth this quarter.	13.0	107.0
201604	2008	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	But as was stated earlier, boosting near-term GDP growth through credit-fueled infrastructure investment does little to solve China’s excess capacity or elevated corporate debt problems.	13.0	107.0
201604	2009	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thus, while the threats to near-term economic growth have likely diminished, with overall debt-to-GDP on the order of 240 percent and credit growth reaching 15 percent this year, the risks to medium-term growth remain and may even be increasing.	13.0	107.0
201604	2010	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	More broadly, while conditions have eased, global financial markets remain fragile.	13.0	107.0
201604	2011	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Developments in the first three months of the year serve to highlight the significant feedback loop that connects US policy expectations and exchange rate movements to China’s currency management and economic growth challenges, which is then amplified through emerging market prospects and commodity market developments.	13.0	107.0
201604	2012	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Despite recent steps, China still lacks a predictable, transparent framework for monetary policy and exchange rate management.	13.0	107.0
201604	2013	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thus, unexpected moves in the RMB or declines in foreign exchange reserves still have the potential to spark further bouts of financial turbulence that could reverberate more broadly.	13.0	107.0
201604	2014	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	On net, the balance of risks to the outlook appear to have improved somewhat since March.	13.0	107.0
201604	2015	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The general improvement in financial conditions due at least in part to expectations of a more gradual path of policy firming in the United States has strengthened the medium-term outlook in the United States and helped boost commodity prices, diminishing worries about global disinflation, helping to ease the transitions faced by emerging market economies.	13.0	107.0
201604	2016	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	But while the easing in financial conditions has improved the balance of risk in the near term, the current global environment contains deeply embedded risks.	13.0	107.0
201604	2017	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	These, together with persistent sub-2 percent inflation readings, the evidence that inflation expectations are low, and the asymmetry of policy, continue to skew the risks to inflation to the downside.	13.0	107.0
201604	2018	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	For these reasons, I would not want to rush to judgment about the outcome of our policy deliberations in June but rather continue to monitor the evolution of the data closely in the weeks ahead.	13.0	107.0
201604	2019	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	107.0
201604	2020	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201604	2021	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13.0	65.0
201604	2022	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201604	2023	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	My remarks on the economy today will focus on two features of the current constellation of data that give me pause about the Committee’s normalization strategy.	13.0	94.0
201604	2024	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The first one is slower real output growth than I expected, and the second one is low market-based inflation expectations.	13.0	94.0
201604	2025	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The core prediction from standard models that inform the discussion on this Committee is that promises to keep the policy rate at very low levels would induce a boom in consumption and a rise in inflation expectations.	13.0	94.0
201604	2026	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	In my judgment, these effects have not materialized in any quantitatively meaningful sense.	13.0	94.0
201604	2027	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	This has left us with low nominal interest rates, which may not be pulling consumption forward and may not be putting upward pressure on inflation.	13.0	94.0
201604	2028	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think this is putting our normalization strategy at risk.	13.0	94.0
201604	2029	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	We are now 16 months past the end of quantitative easing in the United States.	13.0	94.0
201604	2030	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	We have raised the policy rate just once, markets place low probability on a move by this Committee in June, and we have no immediate plans to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet.	13.0	94.0
201604	2031	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	This seems like a normalization process that is grinding to a halt.	13.0	94.0
201604	2032	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	In my view, this may be appropriate.	13.0	94.0
201604	2033	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	But it should be described somewhat differently if this is, indeed, what is happening.	13.0	94.0
201604	2034	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’ll have some suggestions for this in a moment, and I will also discuss this in the policy go-round tomorrow.	13.0	94.0
201604	2035	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Let me turn to low inflation expectations.	13.0	94.0
201604	2036	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Current market-based inflation compensation has recovered partially from the levels earlier this year, but not all the way to the levels at the time of liftoff last December.	13.0	94.0
201604	2037	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The 10-year TIPS breakeven rate, for instance, traded last Friday at around 1.65 percent.	13.0	94.0
201604	2038	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	This number is too low on its face, but, in addition, it is CPI based.	13.0	94.0
201604	2039	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	If we subtract 30 basis points to get to a rough calculation for PCE inflation expectations, we arrive at just 1.35 percent.	13.0	94.0
201604	2040	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	One could arguably subtract risk and liquidity premiums from there to arrive at an even lower number.	13.0	94.0
201604	2041	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is a 10-year expectation that should not be meaningfully different from 2 percent.	13.0	94.0
201604	2042	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I take this seriously as signaling a possible erosion of FOMC credibility with respect to our inflation target.	13.0	94.0
201604	2043	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think it is very difficult to interpret the TIPS numbers favorably at this juncture.	13.0	94.0
201604	2044	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Let me now turn to slow output growth.	13.0	94.0
201604	2045	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The annualized growth rates of real GDP have been 2015:Q3, 2.0; 2015:Q4, 1.4; 2016:Q1, according to the Tealbook, 0.4; 2016:Q2, according to the Tealbook, 2.2.	13.0	94.0
201604	2046	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	So as Governor Brainard stressed, it’s not really just the first quarter—all of the surrounding quarters are pretty low.	13.0	94.0
201604	2047	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The average of these four numbers is 1.5 percent.	13.0	94.0
201604	2048	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	That’s below my estimate of longer-term trend growth for the US economy.	13.0	94.0
201604	2049	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Many of the policy projections I have made over the past two years envisioned a 3 percent growth rate during this same four-quarter period.	13.0	94.0
201604	2050	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	So these numbers are quite disappointing.	13.0	94.0
201604	2051	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think it’s hard to reconcile plans to normalize rates in an environment of below-trend real GDP growth.	13.0	94.0
201604	2052	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I recognize that labor markets have been strong and are likely to remain so.	13.0	94.0
201604	2053	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I continue to agree with the Tealbook that the unemployment rate is likely to fall into the mid-4 percent range over the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201604	2054	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	However, I expected stronger output growth at some point, which would have been more reflective of recent labor market outcomes.	13.0	94.0
201604	2055	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	In addition, I see effects on inflation through a labor market channel as likely to be subdued.	13.0	94.0
201604	2056	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Eighth District contacts seem to concur that very slow growth is the order of the day.	13.0	94.0
201604	2057	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	They tend to expect a subdued pace of expansion during 2016, tight labor markets notwithstanding.	13.0	94.0
201604	2058	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	What is the core problem?	13.0	94.0
201604	2059	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	It is slow growth in productivity.	13.0	94.0
201604	2060	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I appreciated the staff’s discussion of an alternative view, that productivity acceleration would be more gradual, on pages 22 and 23 of Tealbook A.	13.0	94.0
201604	2061	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I especially noted figure 1, which shows how prognostications of productivity increases have continually disappointed over the past six years.	13.0	94.0
201604	2062	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	On this topic, I agree with comments by Presidents Lacker and Williams and Governor Fischer.	13.0	94.0
201604	2063	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	In light of that evidence from figure 1 in Tealbook A in the alternative productivity projection, I think that the baseline should no longer be for an acceleration of productivity growth.	13.0	94.0
201604	2064	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Instead, we should accept that we are likely in a low-productivity growth regime that probably began in 2005 and that has probably worsened in the past five or six years, and we should make the baseline projection on the idea that we are unlikely to leave the low-productivity growth regime any time soon.	13.0	94.0
201604	2065	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Accelerating productivity growth would then become an alternative to the benchmark and not the benchmark itself.	13.0	94.0
201604	2066	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	It may be that our normalization strategy is incompatible with the slow-growth environment in which we find ourselves and in which the Committee often sees important downside risks.	13.0	94.0
201604	2067	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	As many of you know, I have become more concerned about our normalization messaging in this environment.	13.0	94.0
201604	2068	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Our messaging is through the dot plot, which suggests imminent increases in rates.	13.0	94.0
201604	2069	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	In essence, we are always warning about rate increases.	13.0	94.0
201604	2070	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I want to suggest an alternative messaging that I think will leave us in a position to accomplish the same goals but will put us more in sync with financial markets.	13.0	94.0
201604	2071	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The elements of this approach are as follows.	13.0	94.0
201604	2072	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	But first a preamble is to recognize that we’re now off the lower bound; therefore, rates in principle could go in either direction.	13.0	94.0
201604	2073	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	So then number one would be the Committee would emphasize that, in view of everything that we know today, we think that the policy rate is at the correct level.	13.0	94.0
201604	2074	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is the way we would have approached monetary policy in the ’90s and 2000s.	13.0	94.0
201604	2075	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Number two, the Committee would emphasize that, in light of everything we know, risks are balanced at this juncture.	13.0	94.0
201604	2076	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	That would signal to markets that rates could go up or down depending on how the data come in.	13.0	94.0
201604	2077	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The reason we’re at the rate we are at today is because we think that’s the right rate in light of all the things that we know about the economy.	13.0	94.0
201604	2078	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think the balance of risks in the past, as President Lacker has emphasized, has been a subtle signal about which way you think rates are going.	13.0	94.0
201604	2079	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	If we cite downside risks in an environment in which the dot plot says we’re going up, that’s a conflict and a confusing thing to markets in light of how this Committee has behaved in the past.	13.0	94.0
201604	2080	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	So what we should do is say we like where the rate is today in light of everything we know.	13.0	94.0
201604	2081	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Given everything we know, we say the risks are balanced, which means we could go in either direction depending on how the data evolve.	13.0	94.0
201604	2082	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Number three, we should also stress appropriately that if inflation develops, we will raise rates commensurately in that case.	13.0	94.0
201604	2083	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	And, number four, we are not giving any forward guidance on rates.	13.0	94.0
201604	2084	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	We’re at the correct level today, and future adjustments up or down will depend on macroeconomic events.	13.0	94.0
201604	2085	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201604	2086	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I will discuss this approach further in the policy round tomorrow.	13.0	94.0
201604	2087	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201604	2088	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13.0	65.0
201604	2089	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201604	2090	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Incoming data since the previous meeting provide mixed signals on the strength of the economy.	13.0	104.0
201604	2091	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	As has frequently occurred over the past several years, labor market data suggest greater strength than do spending data.	13.0	104.0
201604	2092	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Fortunately, labor data have tended to give a more accurate picture of the underlying strength of the economy.	13.0	104.0
201604	2093	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Moreover, with ongoing job gains of 200,000 per month, income gains should be strong enough to maintain solid growth in consumption, and business investment should rebound to help meet rising demand.	13.0	104.0
201604	2094	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Thus, I have some confidence that spending indicators will strengthen in coming months.	13.0	104.0
201604	2095	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	That said, recent spending data are indeed weak.	13.0	104.0
201604	2096	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	The Board’s staff now estimates that real GDP increased at just a ½ percent rate in the first quarter after growing at only a 1.4 percent rate in Q4.	13.0	104.0
201604	2097	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Taken at face value, this could cause concern about prospects for economic growth, particularly because much of the weakness is in consumption and investment, the two main engines for growth.	13.0	104.0
201604	2098	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	However, some of the low reading for Q1 may reflect residual seasonality.	13.0	104.0
201604	2099	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Indeed, analysts at the Board think residual seasonality may account for ½ percentage point of the slowdown.	13.0	104.0
201604	2100	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Other analysts estimate that it could be 1½ percent, which would put GDP growth in the range of 1 to 2 percent, a bit less worrisome.	13.0	104.0
201604	2101	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Looking through these volatile and uncertain quarterly estimates as well as seasonality, the four-quarter change in real GDP shows GDP growth running at about 2 percent through Q1, and my reading of the fundamentals suggests that 2 percent is a pretty good estimate of the momentum of the economy and as good a guess as any for the future pace of GDP growth.	13.0	104.0
201604	2102	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	The key factors driving demand over the past year remain in place:  the high level of household wealth and solid job gains propelling consumption, and low long-term interest rates and relatively easy access to credit supporting business investment.	13.0	104.0
201604	2103	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	In addition, the recent drop in the dollar should reverse some of the drag due to past appreciation, and the stabilization of financial markets and the news from overseas suggest that the downside risks arising from these sources are still receding from their elevated February levels.	13.0	104.0
201604	2104	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	In contrast to the spending data, the labor market continues to show solid improvement, with businesses relentlessly adding 200,000 jobs per month.	13.0	104.0
201604	2105	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	These increases and the optimism displayed in business surveys support the notion that firms not in manufacturing still judge that demand is rising at a moderate pace.	13.0	104.0
201604	2106	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Normally, job increases of this magnitude would be accompanied by a noticeable drop in the unemployment rate, but labor force participation has rebounded sharply over the past six months—another healthy development—and, consequently, the unemployment rate has flattened out.	13.0	104.0
201604	2107	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Although some of that recent bounce in participation may turn out to be statistical, I hope and expect that some important part of it is the result of a tightening in the labor market as individuals recognize that jobs are now easier to get and thus enter or return to the labor force.	13.0	104.0
201604	2108	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	This rise in participation is a welcome event, as it increases the productive capacity of the economy, suggests that the maximum level of employment may be higher than we thought, and, most importantly, improves the lives of many families.	13.0	104.0
201604	2109	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	However, as many have noted, productivity growth remains terrible, and these job gains have not been accompanied by the expected increase in output.	13.0	104.0
201604	2110	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	This has been a persistent feature of the expansion in the United States and globally, as noted in the Tealbook box that’s been referenced here today.	13.0	104.0
201604	2111	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	I agree with the sentiments offered in the box, and I’m hard-pressed to see why we should expect productivity to rebound sharply in 2016.	13.0	104.0
201604	2112	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	In fact, I found the two alternative simulations showing a slower return of productivity to the trend to be closer to my thinking—one simply a supply-side shock and the other adding in continued strong payroll growth.	13.0	104.0
201604	2113	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	The stronger economic growth is really the continuation of more of the same.	13.0	104.0
201604	2114	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	It’s 2 percent economic growth, and it’s 200,000 jobs a month.	13.0	104.0
201604	2115	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	And it’s a slower return in productivity that gets you to a 3.9 percent unemployment rate at the end of 2018.	13.0	104.0
201604	2116	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	In fact, my baseline would be located somewhere between the two, probably closer to the “Weaker Labor Productivity, Stronger Labor Market” scenario.	13.0	104.0
201604	2117	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Accordingly, I continue to expect 2 percent GDP growth will be accompanied by ½ percent increase in productivity this year and 200,000 jobs per month.	13.0	104.0
201604	2118	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	If participation remains at 63 percent, that would imply a three-tenths decline in the unemployment rate by the end of the year or a steeper decline if the participation rate begins to fall again.	13.0	104.0
201604	2119	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	This ongoing tightening in resource utilization should put some additional upward pressure on wages and prices, and I remain confident that inflation will rise, particularly as the effects of declines in oil and import prices fade over time.	13.0	104.0
201604	2120	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	With core inflation now running at 1½ percent, the underlying core inflation rate that looks through effects of the temporary swings in the dollar and energy prices is actually much closer to 2 percent.	13.0	104.0
201604	2121	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	With the dollar and oil prices apparently having stabilized, the fading of their influence should move core and total inflation up to 2 percent over the medium term.	13.0	104.0
201604	2122	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Now, the Tealbook says that we are at full employment, but I’m not at all certain that there aren’t remaining elements of slack, and it gets harder to argue that with participation having increased.	13.0	104.0
201604	2123	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	In any case, I’m open to the idea that there may be remaining margins of slack.	13.0	104.0
201604	2124	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Inflation is below target and real long-term interest rates are low, and this combination indicates either that there is remaining slack or that the economy is still experiencing significant headwinds and requires accommodative policy.	13.0	104.0
201604	2125	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	While I expect these headwinds to diminish over the next couple of years, I doubt that they will fully dissipate during this cycle, which would mean that the federal funds rate and longer-term rates will still be relatively low over the medium term.	13.0	104.0
201604	2126	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	The Committee’s rate forecasts, including my own, have consistently erred to the upside to an extent that is not fully explained by unexpected economic weakness, and my view is that rates will need to remain lower for longer than the Tealbook forecast in order to achieve the baseline.	13.0	104.0
201604	2127	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	One reason for this view is that investors have had a heightened focus on the differences between US monetary policy and that of foreign central banks.	13.0	104.0
201604	2128	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	The Tealbook rate forecast would deliver a very large surprise to markets, and yet the dollar would appreciate only gradually.	13.0	104.0
201604	2129	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	As the Board’s staff pointed out in a useful presentation on Monday and as Steve emphasized in his presentation, there’s a real risk that the dollar would appreciate much more than the forecast.	13.0	104.0
201604	2130	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	The baseline forecast is based on longer-term relationships between interest rate surprises and the dollar.	13.0	104.0
201604	2131	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	The dollar has been many times more responsive since mid-2014, when the dollar began its appreciation, and that’s also true for the almost 3 percent decline since the March meeting, which is far larger than the adjustment in interest rates would have been implied using historical relationships.	13.0	104.0
201604	2132	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	I would add that when these relationships seem to change, the staff is always in the position of having to decide whether to go with the old relationships or take new data onboard, and it’s the same question with productivity.	13.0	104.0
201604	2133	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	I am not sure it really matters as long as the risk of being wrong is exposed, as has clearly been done in both of those cases.	13.0	104.0
201604	2134	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	So on this question, the reaction has been appropriate, and the risk that’s been identified is another reason to proceed cautiously with rate increases.	13.0	104.0
201604	2135	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	More on that tomorrow.	13.0	104.0
201604	2136	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201604	2137	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201604	2138	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	13.0	65.0
201604	2139	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201604	2140	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’ll start with energy.	13.0	110.0
201604	2141	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The production freeze negotiation among OPEC members in Doha ended with no agreement.	13.0	110.0
201604	2142	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We’d expected that these negotiations would not have any supply–demand effect primarily because Iran has consistently said that it is intent on increasing its production to pre-sanction levels.	13.0	110.0
201604	2143	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Although there was much made of these Doha discussions, most of our contacts in the industry had expected nothing to come out of these meetings, and the meetings lived up to expectations.	13.0	110.0
201604	2144	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Therefore, the breakup of these talks really did not materially affect our outlook for the energy sector, and we think that’s one reason why you didn’t really see much of a price effect.	13.0	110.0
201604	2145	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Our latest estimate is that global energy supply today still exceeds demand by more than 1 million barrels.	13.0	110.0
201604	2146	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We believe that supply and demand will reach rough balance by the first quarter of 2017, and we think it is this expectation that is the fundamental force driving the firming of prices.	13.0	110.0
201604	2147	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This forecast assumes that global demand will grow by 1.2 million barrels a day in 2016.	13.0	110.0
201604	2148	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It also assumes that there will be a substantial decline in non-OPEC production, primarily in the United States in the second half of this year, as the effects of cuts made over the past two years finally lead to production declines as wells run down and are not replaced by new wells.	13.0	110.0
201604	2149	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We believe excess inventory in the OECD countries now stands at 440 million barrels, which is a record.	13.0	110.0
201604	2150	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We also assume in this forecast that, although there have been supply outages in Nigeria, Iraq, Libya, and, most recently, Kuwait, all of those outages either have been resolved or will be resolved and production will be restored.	13.0	110.0
201604	2151	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	More important, looking ahead and on the basis of discussions we have had with our contacts as well as a new energy survey that we’ve just started and that will be published in June—this will be a quarterly energy survey with more than 165 participants—it is our judgment that the breakeven price for most shale projects in the United States ranges between $35 and $50 a barrel, depending on the field.	13.0	110.0
201604	2152	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So, for example, at $40 to $45 oil, in our judgment it is simply not economic to invest in new wells in much of the Eagle Ford or the Permian Basin, which are the two biggest fields in this country.	13.0	110.0
201604	2153	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This tells us that in the $40s, very few new wells will be drilled in shale, and very few jobs will come back to the oil industry.	13.0	110.0
201604	2154	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In the range of $50 to $60, however, some rigs will begin to be added, you’ll see supply begin to increase, and jobs will start to come back.	13.0	110.0
201604	2155	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In addition, we’ve learned that one of the big effects of the declines over the past two years has been that a substantial number of the long-lead-time conventional projects have been scrapped.	13.0	110.0
201604	2156	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The very big cuts in cap-ex have come from those very long-lived projects that take as long as 7 to 10 years to complete and have decline curves exceeding well over 20 years.	13.0	110.0
201604	2157	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	These projects fundamentally increase global oil supply.	13.0	110.0
201604	2158	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Shale projects, on the other hand, can be developed very quickly and are relatively bite-size in terms of cost, but they have decline curves of only 2 to 3 years.	13.0	110.0
201604	2159	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Those are useful in providing incremental supply.	13.0	110.0
201604	2160	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	When you combine all of these facts—and recognizing that OPEC is currently operating at a historically high level of capacity utilization—it is our view that as global demand continues to grow over the next few years, we could likely find ourselves in a global undersupply situation within three to four years and vulnerable to a price shock on the upside.	13.0	110.0
201604	2161	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I know that’ll be a big change in perspective, but we think that is more likely than not as we work through increasing shale supply and don’t have these long-lived projects to call on.	13.0	110.0
201604	2162	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But maybe that’s wishful thinking for people in the industry and it’s going to take a few years.	13.0	110.0
201604	2163	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In terms of the 11th District, we now expect job growth in Texas to range between ½ and 1 percent in 2016, down from 3.7 percent growth in 2014.	13.0	110.0
201604	2164	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The change reflects job losses in Houston while jobs continue to increase in Dallas, San Antonio, and Austin.	13.0	110.0
201604	2165	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The service sector in Texas continues to grow, while the manufacturing sector continues to be weak, although our recent survey indicated that it is showing some signs of stabilizing.	13.0	110.0
201604	2166	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Texas continues to benefit from migration of people and firms to the state, and this  helps further drive the diversification of the Texas economy.	13.0	110.0
201604	2167	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Energy is now only 2 percent of employment and 9 percent of GDP in the state of Texas, versus 14 percent of GDP in 2014.	13.0	110.0
201604	2168	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	One last comment on the 11th District:  It is clear to us that job growth in Texas as well as in our District generally has benefited from the increasing number of trade and production partnerships with Mexico.	13.0	110.0
201604	2169	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Texas imports from Mexico, for example, have 40 percent US manufacturing content on average.	13.0	110.0
201604	2170	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	These partnerships, in our judgment, have helped to keep jobs in North America as well as to stimulate spending in the United States by Mexican shoppers who regularly come across the border to buy goods and services.	13.0	110.0
201604	2171	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It is an element, we believe, in allowing US companies to avoid relocation of even more manufacturing jobs to Asia.	13.0	110.0
201604	2172	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And we will continue to watch this dynamic closely because it’s been a key strength, in our view, for Texas as well as to the United States, and is probably—perhaps an understatement here— misunderstood.	13.0	110.0
201604	2173	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In terms of the US economy, our economists expect the US consumer to remain strong in 2016, and, as a result, we expect GDP growth to rebound in coming quarters.	13.0	110.0
201604	2174	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Like others around the table, we are forecasting GDP growth of about 2 percent in 2016.	13.0	110.0
201604	2175	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We believe there is some—but increasingly limited—remaining slack in the US labor market, and we expect the headline unemployment rate to continue to decline below 5 percent this year.	13.0	110.0
201604	2176	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Regarding inflation, through last month, the Dallas trimmed mean has now been running between 1.8 and 1.9 percent, although there is some seasonality in this measure, and we would expect it to back off to some degree.	13.0	110.0
201604	2177	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Nonetheless, that gives us some increased confidence that headline inflation will gradually rise to 2 percent over the medium term.	13.0	110.0
201604	2178	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	When you take all of those facts together, they cause me to be increasingly constructive about the June meeting, a subject we’ll pick up tomorrow.	13.0	110.0
201604	2179	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	One caution, which surprised me a little bit in getting prepared for this meeting, came out of our round of 25 or 30 calls.	13.0	110.0
201604	2180	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In previous calls, our corporate contacts described business as stronger than they do now.	13.0	110.0
201604	2181	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This time around, most of them now describe their business in the United States as flat to down.	13.0	110.0
201604	2182	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The contact group includes a number in the services sector, and the responses were really across industries.	13.0	110.0
201604	2183	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Several mentioned the “CNN effect:”	13.0	110.0
201604	2184	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	They believe that the consumer should be getting stronger, but households are hesitating to spend because of political uncertainty as well as potentially because of some psychological holdover from the financial turmoil during the first two months of the year.	13.0	110.0
201604	2185	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In the meantime, these companies are focused more on cost-cutting, see relatively little wage pressure except in skilled trades and IT, and are holding off on major capital spending and other new projects.	13.0	110.0
201604	2186	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Time will tell whether this sluggishness is temporary.	13.0	110.0
201604	2187	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201604	2188	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201604	2189	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	13.0	65.0
201604	2190	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Just a quick question.	13.0	999.0
201604	2191	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	What do your economists think will be the effect, if any, of the Saudi sale of Aramco?	13.0	999.0
201604	2192	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We don’t think that alone is going to have a significant effect.	13.0	110.0
201604	2193	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The thing we are watching more closely—although we don’t believe it’s going to happen— is whether Saudi Arabia and Russia are, as they have hinted, actually going to increase supply.	13.0	110.0
201604	2194	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The privatization is part of an overall strategy for the Saudis to diversify away from oil.	13.0	110.0
201604	2195	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It is one of many steps they’re going to take to try to redirect resources to other parts of their economy and be less dependent on oil.	13.0	110.0
201604	2196	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So the sale is a natural evolution of that.	13.0	110.0
201604	2197	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201604	2198	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13.0	65.0
201604	2199	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201604	2200	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	The reports on economic activity from my business contacts were a bit more upbeat than in March.	13.0	91.0
201604	2201	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Notably, no one expressed much concern that the first-quarter weakness in GDP would prove to be more than a transitory soft patch.	13.0	91.0
201604	2202	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	In my District, there continues to be a large contrast between conditions in industrial versus consumer-facing businesses.	13.0	91.0
201604	2203	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Those producing industrial capital goods who have heavy international trade exposure are seeing weak demand.	13.0	91.0
201604	2204	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Those facing the US consumer are more positive.	13.0	91.0
201604	2205	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Some of the weakness in cap-ex is easy to explain by the strong dollar and low energy prices.	13.0	91.0
201604	2206	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Other anecdotal reports are more challenging to square.	13.0	91.0
201604	2207	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	A couple of my directors and other contacts say that even with low interest rates and plenty of cash on hand, firms are choosing not to invest, and we heard that just a minute ago.	13.0	91.0
201604	2208	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	These firms clearly say that they are right-sized for the current level of demand, their outlook for continued slow growth, and the potential downside risks.	13.0	91.0
201604	2209	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	So it seems there’s another factor beyond the dollar and low commodity prices weighing on capital spending—namely, business caution.	13.0	91.0
201604	2210	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Firms’ baseline sales expectations are modest, and they’re very attentive to what could go wrong.	13.0	91.0
201604	2211	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	With regard to the economic picture, the first quarter obviously was quite weak.	13.0	91.0
201604	2212	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	My staff’s outlook is that economic growth will recover to average around 2½ percent over the rest of the year.	13.0	91.0
201604	2213	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	I can’t say that forecast is wrong.	13.0	91.0
201604	2214	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	I am not optimistic myself.	13.0	91.0
201604	2215	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	But if residual seasonality remains anywhere, it would seem to be in our collective early-year optimism, which is then followed by downward revisions to the outlook in the middle of the year.	13.0	91.0
201604	2216	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	I guess that’s seasonality too, isn’t it?	13.0	91.0
201604	2217	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	And I could see the same happening with this forecast, as realistically the risks are probably to the downside.	13.0	91.0
201604	2218	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	With regard to inflation, the incoming data were consistent with our forecast of core PCE at 1.6 percent for the year, although we continue to see some downside risk associated with a potential decline in inflation expectations.	13.0	91.0
201604	2219	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	In any event, our Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago forecasts of economic growth and inflation are very similar to the Tealbook’s.	13.0	91.0
201604	2220	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	However, we do have a somewhat different view of labor market slack.	13.0	91.0
201604	2221	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	We think the labor force participation rate is still somewhat below trend, and this translates into a little more overall slack in labor markets than in the Tealbook.	13.0	91.0
201604	2222	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	An important factor supporting our forecast is the continuation of the improvement in credit conditions that started in mid-February.	13.0	91.0
201604	2223	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	This improvement was a major theme among our financial market contacts this round.	13.0	91.0
201604	2224	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Our contact who tracks small business lending reported a pickup in demand for credit in February after markedly negative reports in three of the previous five months.	13.0	91.0
201604	2225	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Consistent with our real-side anecdotes, small business lending is strongest among consumer-facing firms and firms providing nontradable goods and services.	13.0	91.0
201604	2226	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Our contacts at Ford noted that they received a lot of interest from banks in the renewal of their credit line syndicate, and that the spreads on their commercial paper and other debt were the narrowest in about a year.	13.0	91.0
201604	2227	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Finally, in line with Simon’s report from the dealer survey, a number of financial contacts said that FOMC communication about risk management was a critical factor supporting the recent improvement in financial conditions.	13.0	91.0
201604	2228	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	In their opinion, the Fed’s willingness to lean against adverse tail risk has been an important stabilizing force.	13.0	91.0
201604	2229	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	To sum up, on balance, the domestic fundamentals continue to be good.	13.0	91.0
201604	2230	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	My baseline scenario has economic growth recovering from its first-quarter soft patch and the recent improvements of inflation being maintained.	13.0	91.0
201604	2231	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	But downside risks remain, and our risk- management approach to guard against those risks continues to be a salient feature of appropriate policy.	13.0	91.0
201604	2232	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201604	2233	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201604	2234	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13.0	65.0
201604	2235	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201604	2236	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In preparing for the policy decision at this meeting, I spent a lot of time considering the divergence between the data on economic growth in the first quarter and my forecast.	13.0	88.0
201604	2237	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The latest update of our GDP nowtracking estimate puts first-quarter growth at 0.4 percent, the same as the current Tealbook estimate.	13.0	88.0
201604	2238	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Our first- quarter nowcast began to deteriorate in mid-March with the arrival of February data on retail sales, durable goods, personal consumption, and international trade.	13.0	88.0
201604	2239	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We will know on Thursday how accurate the estimate of 0.4 percent turns out to be.	13.0	88.0
201604	2240	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	But there is broad consensus among available tracking estimates that first-quarter GDP growth is likely to come in below 1.0 percent.	13.0	88.0
201604	2241	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	A slow first quarter was not my expectation at the time of the previous SEP submission.	13.0	88.0
201604	2242	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I had marked in a first quarter that was close to my assumed run rate for the economy, between 2 and 2½ percent.	13.0	88.0
201604	2243	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The facts in hand regarding spending growth present the problem of whether to take the first-quarter data weakness as signaling a deceleration or to look through the apparent weakness and treat it as anomalous in some respects.	13.0	88.0
201604	2244	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	So this could be a déjà vu moment all over again.	13.0	88.0
201604	2245	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In recent years, first-quarter real-time readings of the economy have tended to be deceptively soft.	13.0	88.0
201604	2246	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Now, I am not picking up softness in reports from my District contacts.	13.0	88.0
201604	2247	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Recent soundings present a more upbeat picture than the data on spending.	13.0	88.0
201604	2248	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Sentiment among our directors and contacts remains positive and showed some improvement since the previous cycle leading up to the March meeting.	13.0	88.0
201604	2249	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Consumer spending activity overall was characterized as stable and is not decelerating.	13.0	88.0
201604	2250	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Business investment activity seems to be steadily growing at a moderate pace, and we sensed no cautionary signals in the mix of investment.	13.0	88.0
201604	2251	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	A reasonable amount of business fixed investment is being depicted as growth oriented.	13.0	88.0
201604	2252	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Real estate activity across the Sixth District remains solid.	13.0	88.0
201604	2253	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Commercial real estate fundamentals remain within a range that sounds no alarms.	13.0	88.0
201604	2254	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Residential starts and sales activity continue to increase at a slow but steady pace in most parts of the District.	13.0	88.0
201604	2255	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	One of the more interesting and generally upbeat contact interviews was with the CEO of one of the nation’s largest credit reporting firms.	13.0	88.0
201604	2256	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Its credit dashboard through February had household debt rising 3.2 percent year over year, so the positive household credit trends evident in the flow of funds accounts last year are apparently continuing.	13.0	88.0
201604	2257	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Auto credit led the advance, but bankcard extensions were also strong.	13.0	88.0
201604	2258	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	And the growth in first-quarter mortgages has been solid.	13.0	88.0
201604	2259	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Delinquencies and write-offs are holding at modest levels.	13.0	88.0
201604	2260	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	So this contact characterized the mix, growth, and performance of household credit as healthy and supportive of a good pace of spending.	13.0	88.0
201604	2261	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We did pick up some cautionary vibes from auto industry contacts, particularly our director who is CEO of the country’s largest car retailer.	13.0	88.0
201604	2262	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	His industry-wide perspective depicted the recent softening in auto sales as likely materially worse but for incentives that are nearing 10 percent of the sales price.	13.0	88.0
201604	2263	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Inventories remain elevated, and our contact expects production schedule cuts soon to restore balance.	13.0	88.0
201604	2264	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Sales numbers have been juiced by expanding fleet sales, and there has been a surge in leasing at discounted valuations.	13.0	88.0
201604	2265	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The implication is that auto asset value contraction may ripple through the national fleet in future years, affecting trade-in values and new auto pricing.	13.0	88.0
201604	2266	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Overall, we came away from conversations with our auto contacts concluding that the auto spending tailwind will likely be a headwind over the near to medium horizon.	13.0	88.0
201604	2267	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	That said, the pockets of softness we detected in our conversations with District contacts do not appear to suggest a broad-based deceleration.	13.0	88.0
201604	2268	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	At the moment, there seems to be a disconnect between anecdote and data.	13.0	88.0
201604	2269	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Something of a disconnect is also evident, of course, comparing employment data with weaker signals on GDP growth.	13.0	88.0
201604	2270	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Reports of our contacts on the employment situation were in line with the official data prints.	13.0	88.0
201604	2271	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Stories about difficult-to-fill jobs persist in categories like IT, construction, trucking, health care, and other technical jobs.	13.0	88.0
201604	2272	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Layoffs continued in recent weeks in the oil and gas and gas-dependent industries.	13.0	88.0
201604	2273	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	These reports overall were consistent with earlier cycles.	13.0	88.0
201604	2274	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We did hear more reports than previously that we interpret as indications of labor market tightening.	13.0	88.0
201604	2275	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	For example, we heard that part-time workers are being converted to full-time employment, and that concerns about retaining talent are causing some companies to develop catch-up plans.	13.0	88.0
201604	2276	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard the expression “war for talent” for the first time in a long time in more than one interview.	13.0	88.0
201604	2277	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The strong market performance, the fundamentals that should support stronger consumer spending, our contacts’ general optimism, and some firming of the inflation trend have persuaded me to leave my outlook essentially unchanged from our previous meeting.	13.0	88.0
201604	2278	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	However, the prospects for a weak first-quarter GDP print driven by both weak consumer and business investment spending and the general ambiguity of the current circumstances give me pause.	13.0	88.0
201604	2279	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	For that reason, as I’ll explain in the policy round, I’m looking past this meeting regarding the rate move.	13.0	88.0
201604	2280	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201604	2281	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201604	2282	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	13.0	65.0
201604	2283	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201604	2284	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Economic activity in the Third District continues to improve, and our manufacturers may be over the worst of the recent downturn in that sector.	13.0	999.0
201604	2285	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Despite some backtracking in our Business Outlook Survey, there has been a significant increase in optimism among our manufacturing contacts.	13.0	999.0
201604	2286	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Employment growth is strong, consumer spending is growing moderately, and commercial construction continues to grow at a slow but steady pace.	13.0	999.0
201604	2287	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	There is some evidence of increasing overall price pressures in the region.	13.0	999.0
201604	2288	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	But with regard to real estate, and with the exception of the Philadelphia metro area, house price appreciation still appears to be restrained.	13.0	999.0
201604	2289	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Our Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey edged back into negative territory with the April general activity index reported at minus 1.6.	13.0	999.0
201604	2290	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Shipments significantly weakened, as did the employment subindex.	13.0	999.0
201604	2291	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	However, unlike previous reports, respondents are seeing price pressures developing for both prices paid and prices received.	13.0	999.0
201604	2292	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	In direct contrast to readings on current activity, manufacturers in the region have grown increasingly optimistic.	13.0	999.0
201604	2293	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	The diffusion index for future general activity has jumped 13.4 points to 42.2.	13.0	999.0
201604	2294	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	All the future subindexes reflect a rebound in optimism as well.	13.0	999.0
201604	2295	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	In contrast, a diversified manufacturing contact in the region indicated that 10 of his 12 business lines will report negative profits this quarter.	13.0	999.0
201604	2296	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	January was an exceptionally weak month, and although succeeding months are showing some improvement, that improvement has not been substantial.	13.0	999.0
201604	2297	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	For the year as a whole, most business lines are forecasting profitability, but his outlook is not overly optimistic.	13.0	999.0
201604	2298	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	So it is with a bit of cautious optimism that, all told, my take is that the area manufacturers have seen the worst of the slowdown.	13.0	999.0
201604	2299	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	In a set of special questions directed at expenditures for both data and network security, physical security, and expenditures incurred for meeting regulatory burdens, we found that a significant majority of firms were increasing outlays on data and network protection as well as regulatory compliance, but that most were not facing increasing costs of providing for physical safety at the workplace.	13.0	999.0
201604	2300	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	One fairly frank respondent indicated that his firm didn’t mind the increased regulatory burden, as it acted as a barrier to entry and thwarted competition.	13.0	999.0
201604	2301	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Nonmanufacturing activity in the District continues to grow modestly as reflected in our Nonmanufacturing Business Outlook Survey.	13.0	999.0
201604	2302	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	The headline activity index of 17.8 in March, while expansionary, is below its nonrecessionary average.	13.0	999.0
201604	2303	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Like our manufacturers, area service providers remained relatively optimistic, with expectations of future activity fairly optimistic.	13.0	999.0
201604	2304	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Some 68.5 percent of respondents reported increased expenditures on data and network security, 50 percent showed increases to enhanced physical security, and slightly more than half have increased spending in order to satisfy regulatory compliance.	13.0	999.0
201604	2305	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	In light of the responses in these categories, a reasonable conjecture might be that some of the productivity slowdown may be due to expenditures that, one could argue, produce little in the way of productive output.	13.0	999.0
201604	2306	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	They simply just protect what you have as opposed to growing output.	13.0	999.0
201604	2307	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Our Beige Book contacts reported a slight to modest improvement in economic conditions.	13.0	999.0
201604	2308	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Homebuilders have reported an improvement in traffic, and a large builder reported an appreciable increase in backlogs.	13.0	999.0
201604	2309	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Overall, construction activity continues at a slow but steady pace.	13.0	999.0
201604	2310	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	With the exception of the Philadelphia metro area, house prices, as I said, have not risen appreciably.	13.0	999.0
201604	2311	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Now, for the nation as a whole, economic activity appears to have softened significantly, although I agree with President Williams’s analysis of Q1 GDP.	13.0	999.0
201604	2312	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	We may be looking at two consecutive quarters of economic growth averaging in the neighborhood of 1 percent, but time will tell.	13.0	999.0
201604	2313	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Labor markets, however, remain robust, but consumption appears to be more restrained.	13.0	999.0
201604	2314	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	And although I believe manufacturing is bottoming out, I do not anticipate a significant bounceback.	13.0	999.0
201604	2315	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	My overall view and forecast of real economic activity are fairly consistent with that presented by the staff in the Tealbook.	13.0	999.0
201604	2316	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	However, my view on inflation is that we will see a path that returns to target somewhat faster than the glacial pace presented in the Tealbook, perhaps by the end of next year.	13.0	999.0
201604	2317	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	With unemployment falling below its natural rate and the significant price pressures resulting from various forms of legislation, I don’t believe price increases will be delayed for much longer.	13.0	999.0
201604	2318	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Recent data on inflation as portrayed by core measures and various trimmed means reported by my colleagues, as well as the behavior of the dollar and oil prices, make me more assured that inflation will return to target.	13.0	999.0
201604	2319	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	And I see little evidence that inflation expectations have become unanchored.	13.0	999.0
201604	2320	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	That viewpoint drives me to favor statement language that would in no way preclude June from being a live meeting, but more on this tomorrow.	13.0	999.0
201604	2321	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201604	2322	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	13.0	65.0
201604	2323	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201604	2324	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Overall economic activity and sentiment in the Fourth District remain consistent with continued moderate economic growth.	13.0	999.0
201604	2325	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	The Bank’s diffusion index for business contacts reporting better versus worse conditions moved up to plus 16 from the plus 14 I reported at our previous meeting, which had been the highest reading in more than six months.	13.0	999.0
201604	2326	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Manufacturing and the energy sector continue to be challenged, but one of our directors reports that we may be seeing some bottoming out in the energy and primary metal sectors.	13.0	999.0
201604	2327	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Reports from auto and related manufacturing industries indicate that activity levels remain stable.	13.0	999.0
201604	2328	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	In contrast to President Lockhart’s contact, auto contacts in the Fourth District remain quite upbeat despite the decline in vehicle sales in March and a two-week shutdown of the GM auto plant in Lordstown, Ohio, due to supply disruptions caused by the recent earthquake in Japan.	13.0	999.0
201604	2329	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	A director from one auto producer noted that his company is expecting motor vehicle production to remain stable at high levels, with sales for the year matching last year’s pace of nearly 17½ million.	13.0	999.0
201604	2330	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	The strength in autos led to more positive reports from freight transportation contacts who saw the volume of shipments increase.	13.0	999.0
201604	2331	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	District labor markets continue to show solid progress.	13.0	999.0
201604	2332	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland staff estimates that District employment grew 1½ percent over the year ending in March; the District’s unemployment rate has remained low and stable, estimated to be 5.1 percent in March.	13.0	999.0
201604	2333	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	A variety of business contacts continue to report tighter conditions in labor markets, including rising wage pressures for unskilled occupations in the retail sector and difficulty in finding skilled workers in construction, high-quality manufacturing, and quantitative occupations.	13.0	999.0
201604	2334	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	The regional director of a significant national federation of labor unions who sits on our Cincinnati branch board indicated that, to alleviate some of the mismatch between jobs and skills, they have established an apprenticeship program in industrial trades similar to the one they have for the construction trades.	13.0	999.0
201604	2335	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	After a successful pilot in Wisconsin, they have secured funding to expand the program into six other states.	13.0	999.0
201604	2336	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Those types of programs hold the promise of partially alleviating some of the country’s longer-run workforce development issues, which remain significant but are not solved by monetary policy.	13.0	999.0
201604	2337	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Overall, my view of the national economy has changed little from our previous meeting, although we didn’t get the pickup in first-quarter growth I was hoping for.	13.0	999.0
201604	2338	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Instead, growth remained sluggish.	13.0	999.0
201604	2339	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	I am feeling a sense of déjà vu that I hope will continue, because in 2014 and 2015, weak first quarters were followed by strong second-quarter rebounds.	13.0	999.0
201604	2340	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Anecdotal evidence suggests that activity may have picked up toward the end of the first quarter, which is consistent with the sharp rebound in financial conditions since our previous meeting.	13.0	999.0
201604	2341	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	The disparity between modest and moderate output growth and the solid performance of the labor market continues.	13.0	999.0
201604	2342	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Payroll growth has averaged nearly 250,000 jobs per month over the past six months.	13.0	999.0
201604	2343	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	The labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio each have risen 60 basis points since last fall.	13.0	999.0
201604	2344	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Both are above their trend estimates.	13.0	999.0
201604	2345	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	In my view, the economy is at maximum employment from the perspective of what monetary policy can do.	13.0	999.0
201604	2346	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	I note that the Tealbook now assesses there is essentially no slack left in the labor market.	13.0	999.0
201604	2347	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	The strength in the job market and, with it, the rise in personal income, is an important fundamental that will support consumer spending.	13.0	999.0
201604	2348	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	I found the Tealbook’s analysis of the effect of energy prices on consumer spending quite useful.	13.0	999.0
201604	2349	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	First, it validates that consumers have been spending at least part of the gain from lower oil prices, although less than the FRB/US model predicted.	13.0	999.0
201604	2350	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	It appears that many have been saving at least some portion of the gain.	13.0	999.0
201604	2351	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	The marginal propensity to consume the windfall will vary by income level, and that may be reflected in the stronger spending effect that’s picked up in studies that utilize microspending data.	13.0	999.0
201604	2352	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	The Board staff suggests that most of the spending gained from falling energy prices may have already been realized.	13.0	999.0
201604	2353	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	But an alternative view is that consumers have just shifted the spending to a later time when they might have more confidence in the health of the economy.	13.0	999.0
201604	2354	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	In any case, the increased savings will help support future consumption.	13.0	999.0
201604	2355	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	We will need to watch for signs of whether some fundamental shift in consumer spending is occurring, but so far nothing points to a sustained pullback in the consumer sector.	13.0	999.0
201604	2356	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Business investment remained weak in the first quarter.	13.0	999.0
201604	2357	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	I have some concerns about the implications of this for capital deepening and, therefore, for longer-run structural productivity growth.	13.0	999.0
201604	2358	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	But in the short run, some of the forward-looking indicators from the national ISM and some of the regional manufacturing surveys suggest a future pickup in new orders may be coming.	13.0	999.0
201604	2359	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Housing continues to grow at a moderate pace.	13.0	999.0
201604	2360	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Inflation is rising gradually.	13.0	999.0
201604	2361	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	You can see this across a broad array of measures.	13.0	999.0
201604	2362	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Inflation is behaving like the Committee expected:  As oil prices and the dollar have shown some stability, the economy has continued to expand, and inflation expectations have remained reasonably well anchored.	13.0	999.0
201604	2363	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Rates of both core and headline inflation have increased over the past year and over the past six months.	13.0	999.0
201604	2364	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland staff nowcast for April put PCE inflation at 1 percent and core PCE inflation at 1½ percent.	13.0	999.0
201604	2365	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	The PCE measure is up 80 basis points and the core PCE measure is up 20 basis points, compared with a year ago and compared with six months ago.	13.0	999.0
201604	2366	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Core CPI inflation, which helps to predict headline, has been running above 2 percent this year.	13.0	999.0
201604	2367	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland Federal Reserve’s median CPI measure has also been rising gradually over the past year and now stands at 2.4 percent.	13.0	999.0
201604	2368	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	At this point, I continue to forecast economic growth slightly above trend for the year as a whole, some further improvement in labor markets, and inflation continuing to move up gradually to our 2 percent goal.	13.0	999.0
201604	2369	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	The economy will be supported by monetary policy that will remain very accommodative, even as we bring rates up gradually, which I view as appropriate conditional on the outlook.	13.0	999.0
201604	2370	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	I note that my outlook takes into account the expected divergent paths of monetary policy here and abroad.	13.0	999.0
201604	2371	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Of course, risks remain to the outlook.	13.0	999.0
201604	2372	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	The risks are centered on global economic developments, including the possibility of sustained financial market disruptions caused by the United Kingdom’s upcoming decision of whether to stay in the EU.	13.0	999.0
201604	2373	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	At this point, I assess the possibility of a sustained disruption as remote, and, in my view, global risks have decreased since earlier in the year.	13.0	999.0
201604	2374	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	This is reflected in the easing in financial conditions and a return to more normal volatility compared with earlier in the year.	13.0	999.0
201604	2375	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	On the basis of the solid performance of the labor market, there are some upside risks to the forecast as well.	13.0	999.0
201604	2376	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Overall, I see the risks to the outlook as being roughly balanced.	13.0	999.0
201604	2377	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	I am increasingly hearing from contacts in my District that our policy communications are somewhat muddled.	13.0	999.0
201604	2378	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	This concerns me.	13.0	999.0
201604	2379	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	It’s an indication we have not clearly articulated our policy rationale.	13.0	999.0
201604	2380	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	I see this as a potential risk to our ability to implement effective policy, a risk that we shouldn’t ignore.	13.0	999.0
201604	2381	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	The Committee has continued to indicate that we view a gradual upward path of rates as appropriate and consistent with our outlook.	13.0	999.0
201604	2382	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	With our employment goal now largely met, with inflation gradually moving up to our target as anticipated, and with downside risks subsiding somewhat, the question should no longer be, “Is it appropriate to take the next step on the normalization path?”	13.0	999.0
201604	2383	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	But, rather, the question should be, “Is it really appropriate not to take the next step?”	13.0	999.0
201604	2384	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201604	2385	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201604	2386	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13.0	65.0
201604	2387	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	103.0
201604	2388	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	District economic growth continues to lag the nation as low agricultural and energy prices persist and financing conditions continue to tighten.	13.0	103.0
201604	2389	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	In the ag sector, not much has changed since our previous meeting, and agricultural sector bankers are buckling in for a bumpy year of unprofitable farm operations while they extend more credit secured by land.	13.0	103.0
201604	2390	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	In energy, the rig count is at its lowest level since at least 1949, and oil inventories are at their highest level since 1930.	13.0	103.0
201604	2391	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Stockpiles are expected to begin easing in 2016 as oil production declines intensify, which may provide a modest boost to prices.	13.0	103.0
201604	2392	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	But according to various Federal Reserve energy surveys, the average price needed for firms to remain profitable is $53 per barrel, down from $59 last fall, as firms focus on the best plays.	13.0	103.0
201604	2393	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Still, firms, on average, do not expect this price to be reached until 2017.	13.0	103.0
201604	2394	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Even when prices do rise, our contacts note they will not be able to ramp up activity in any meaningful way for several years because of the huge loss of skilled workers, depreciation of equipment, and tighter financing.	13.0	103.0
201604	2395	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, natural gas prices remain unprofitable, and, thus, bankruptcies are rising for oil and gas companies in the region.	13.0	103.0
201604	2396	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Some are relatively smooth Chapter 11s, but others, mostly small companies, are taking the Chapter 7 route.	13.0	103.0
201604	2397	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	As I watch the energy sector in my region, I think of a line of Hemingway in which one character says, “How did you go bankrupt?”	13.0	103.0
201604	2398	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	The other says, “Two ways.	13.0	103.0
201604	2399	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Gradually, then suddenly.”	13.0	103.0
201604	2400	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Coal producers have been particularly hard hit.	13.0	103.0
201604	2401	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Three of the four large coal companies that operate in Wyoming, where 44 percent of US coal is produced, have filed for bankruptcy.	13.0	103.0
201604	2402	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Drastically reduced coal production is also negatively affecting the region’s rail industry.	13.0	103.0
201604	2403	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	However, beyond these commodity-based businesses, our business contacts remain relatively upbeat.	13.0	103.0
201604	2404	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	For the national economy, my outlook is little changed despite a weaker-than-expected first quarter in which consumers held back and investment cuts intensified.	13.0	103.0
201604	2405	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of the consumer, the slowdown looks to be limited to goods purchases, which I view as somewhat reassuring because a more broad-based slowing, including services, might have pointed to more fundamental weakness.	13.0	103.0
201604	2406	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Despite the decelerating spending growth, the pace of job gains has remained robust, still averaging more than 200,000 per month this year.	13.0	103.0
201604	2407	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Financial conditions have also eased since March.	13.0	103.0
201604	2408	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	And, provided job growth and financial conditions remain stable, I expect consumer spending growth will come back.	13.0	103.0
201604	2409	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	One of our contacts in the apparel industry noted that, although profits were up and sales declined in the first quarter, she projected positive sales growth for the rest of the year.	13.0	103.0
201604	2410	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	That’s reassuring, as clothing and footwear was one of the weak categories of real PCE in February.	13.0	103.0
201604	2411	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Regarding housing, the moderate recovery appears to remain on track, though low inventories and rising prices suggest that construction of single-family homes has been a bit slow to respond to rising demand.	13.0	103.0
201604	2412	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Looking ahead, I expect residential investment will continue to contribute to economic growth, though I see some risk to the outlook for multifamily construction.	13.0	103.0
201604	2413	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Our directors report jitters as a large number of units are coming online across the region.	13.0	103.0
201604	2414	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Longer term, the demographics remain favorable for multifamily construction, but right now we are seeing a rise in vacancies in some markets.	13.0	103.0
201604	2415	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	An important aspect of the outlook is how the economy will continue to manage through the pivot away from manufacturing and energy activity to services.	13.0	103.0
201604	2416	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	One implication of this shift is for productivity growth.	13.0	103.0
201604	2417	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	My staff estimates that the relative decline in manufacturing and energy, which are significantly more productive than services industries, has cut overall productivity growth by about ¾ percentage point over the past year.	13.0	103.0
201604	2418	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Although this offers an explanation for soft productivity growth the past few years, it doesn’t explain the longer downward trend in productivity growth.	13.0	103.0
201604	2419	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Indeed, some portion of the recent weakness in productivity seems structural, and I don’t believe monetary policy can do much to change that.	13.0	103.0
201604	2420	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	This raises concerns similar to those highlighted in the Tealbook box offering an alternative view on the outlook for productivity.	13.0	103.0
201604	2421	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, my outlook for inflation is little changed and has inflation near mandate- consistent levels throughout the forecast horizon.	13.0	103.0
201604	2422	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	The effects of the past dollar appreciation and oil price declines should diminish, particularly with the recent reversals in the dollar and oil prices.	13.0	103.0
201604	2423	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	The realized gains in inflation increase my confidence that, with continued improvement in economic activity, inflation will continue moving toward 2 percent over the forecast horizon.	13.0	103.0
201604	2424	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	13.0	103.0
201604	2425	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201604	2426	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13.0	65.0
201604	2427	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201604	2428	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I was tempted to ask the question of what it means to say that there’s no slack in the labor market or that we’re at maximum or full employment in the absence of significant nominal wage growth, but, as I spoke a good bit already today and this situation may be mooted somewhat over the course of time, I guess I won’t address it.	13.0	97.0
201604	2429	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	But if it’s still relevant in June, it may be something that would be worth many of us talking about.	13.0	97.0
201604	2430	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I’m going to confine myself to a few comments on risks.	13.0	97.0
201604	2431	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	At the March meeting, my baseline outlook was for economic growth of roughly 2 percent, or maybe a little bit more, this year, and I thought risks were weighted to the downside almost exclusively because of global risks.	13.0	97.0
201604	2432	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Today I think my baseline outlook is for economic growth just a tad lower than that because of the first quarter.	13.0	97.0
201604	2433	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I still find the risks weighted to the downside, but the reason for that has changed somewhat.	13.0	97.0
201604	2434	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I formerly thought that domestically, the risks were just about balanced, and that globally, they were pretty significantly to the downside.	13.0	97.0
201604	2435	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think, for reasons that many of you have said, the global risks are somewhat mitigated compared with March, but I now find a little bit more risk in the domestic outlook.	13.0	97.0
201604	2436	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	The reasons for that are essentially what the staff and a number of you have already commented on.	13.0	97.0
201604	2437	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	But I took some signal from the weak first quarter, and the reason I do take some signal from that and the reason why I’m a little bit confused by the invocation of residual seasonality as an explanation for why signals shouldn’t be taken from that is the following:  I would have thought that most of us, and particularly those of us inclined to see residual seasonality as relatively more important, would have by now adjusted our Q1 assumptions based on the apparent presence of that factor in four out of the past five years.	13.0	97.0
201604	2438	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	That is, you’ve already seen residual seasonality, and you now say, “Okay, that exists.	13.0	97.0
201604	2439	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	And so, therefore, as I do my Q1 or H1 assumptions, I’m going to take that into account.”	13.0	97.0
201604	2440	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Assuming that’s the case, then the numbers in Q1, judging by the March SEP, were still a downside surprise that needs to be explained.	13.0	97.0
201604	2441	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I looked, actually, at some of the public analysis by one of our Reserve Banks that I think is at the high end of assessments of residual seasonality, and I saw that their description of the outlook in December was for a rebound in Q1 growth with strong consumption performance.	13.0	97.0
201604	2442	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Then the same Reserve Bank toward the end of March said, “Well, we’re expecting flat growth, but that’s because of residual seasonality.”	13.0	97.0
201604	2443	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I’m having trouble putting those two things together, because why wouldn’t the residual seasonality have been apparent from the outset?	13.0	97.0
201604	2444	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	What are the explanations, then, for low Q1 economic growth?	13.0	97.0
201604	2445	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	One is that the slowdown reflected an increased gap between actual and potential output.	13.0	97.0
201604	2446	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	A second is that it’s just weird and anomalous, and it’ll disappear.	13.0	97.0
201604	2447	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Another, however, which is suggested by the continued robust growth in employment over that period, is that potential growth needs, once again, to be marked down.	13.0	97.0
201604	2448	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Now, this third explanation, when added to the previous markdowns in potential, has, I think, quite complicated implications for monetary policy because it simultaneously suggests, on the one hand, that input markets—including labor—may tighten sooner, but, on the other, it suggests that r* may be lower than even our revised estimates.	13.0	97.0
201604	2449	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I’m not sure what the implications for monetary policy decisions are, but if there is something to the first quarter other than residual seasonality—which I think there almost has to be—I think we are all forced to offer another explanation and almost to allocate how, among those three or others, would you weight the actual occurrence in the first quarter?	13.0	97.0
201604	2450	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think our staff roughly split the difference between my first and third, some of which is a markdown in what they expect for economic growth this year because of some continued underperformance, but some was a markdown in potential.	13.0	97.0
201604	2451	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	That’s probably as good a resolution as any, but I think it does matter.	13.0	97.0
201604	2452	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I would also note, I did go back and look at the Tealbooks for the past three Aprils when the first quarter has disappointed and then we sort of try to figure out, okay, what happens next, and it’s great.	13.0	97.0
201604	2453	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	One time we underestimated what the effect on the rest-of-the-year economic growth would be.	13.0	97.0
201604	2454	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	A second time we overestimated what it would be, and the third time we got it just about right.	13.0	97.0
201604	2455	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I guess my conclusion from that is, it’s a little hard to tell right now, and I hope that by June some of this will begin to be clarified.	13.0	97.0
201604	2456	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Globally, I agree with those of you who say that risks do seem to have, in general, with a big Brexit exception, diminished somewhat.	13.0	97.0
201604	2457	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think Governor Brainard, or someone else down at this end of the table, put it quite well already, so I won’t repeat all of that—on China, the euro zone, and a little bit of stabilization while Japan continues to struggle.	13.0	97.0
201604	2458	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Near term, I think risks are lower elsewhere.	13.0	97.0
201604	2459	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I’d have to say I was struck during the Bank–Fund meetings by the admirable straightforwardness in people from the euro zone saying, “You guys are going to raise rates, right?	13.0	97.0
201604	2460	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Because we need that downward pressure on the euro in order to increase our performance over time.”	13.0	97.0
201604	2461	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Again, I admire their forthrightness, but it did give one a little bit of pause.	13.0	97.0
201604	2462	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Brexit—I really don’t know how to assess Brexit, to tell you the truth.	13.0	97.0
201604	2463	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	This feels to me more like Knightian uncertainty than just risk assessment, because we don’t really have precedents for this sort of thing.	13.0	97.0
201604	2464	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	And so, I suppose, if the markets are right and if the polls are right and the United Kingdom votes to remain, we won’t have to worry about any of this.	13.0	97.0
201604	2465	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	But if there is a surprise or a shift, I genuinely don’t know how to make an ex ante assessment.	13.0	97.0
201604	2466	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	One thing I will say—following up on something Vice Chairman Dudley said, which I thought was important—is if there is a “yes” vote, then there will be some increasing uncertainty because of the prospect that other members might think about exiting.	13.0	97.0
201604	2467	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I believe that that would be the case, and I believe that in response, influential people in the euro zone are going to make it very hard for the United Kingdom to renegotiate, and that those renegotiations will be quite unpleasant.	13.0	97.0
201604	2468	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	And there may even be a little bit of self-damage by the euro zone, just because they are afraid that if the UK exit makes it look like this is something that you can manage okay, and you can get a free trade agreement right afterward, then they really do risk the dissolution of the EU.	13.0	97.0
201604	2469	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	If the United Kingdom votes to leave, although it’s a little hard for me to see it as a big financial stability event in the short term, I have to say I’m leaning toward thinking the macroeconomic effects of this might be pretty substantial over the course of the next year or so.	13.0	97.0
201604	2470	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	And when you add to that the fact that, as a couple of people have noted, China is kind of in a “let’s keep everything together now” mode by continuing to amass debt, and the euro zone is counting on us to increase rates so that the euro goes down, I’m not sure that—and this, I thought, was Steve’s point—in the medium term, the underlying forces that are creating risk have actually dissipated that much, even though in the short term they have.	13.0	97.0
201604	2471	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Putting all of this together, these changes strike me as about a wash in the overall balance of risks, which I still see as moderately to significantly to the downside, albeit somewhat differently composed than six weeks ago.	13.0	97.0
201604	2472	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201604	2473	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	A two-hander.	13.0	65.0
201604	2474	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13.0	65.0
201604	2475	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	You talked about our analysis.	13.0	102.0
201604	2476	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Yes, I’m talking about you all.	13.0	97.0
201604	2477	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes, let’s be transparent.	13.0	102.0
201604	2478	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13.0	102.0
201604	2479	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But can I respond?	13.0	102.0
201604	2480	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	But I wasn’t going to talk about the 49ers and their prospects this year.	13.0	97.0
201604	2481	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Oh, why did you even do that?	13.0	102.0
201604	2482	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Well, who started it?	13.0	97.0
201604	2483	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Throw me off my game.	13.0	102.0
201604	2484	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay.	13.0	102.0
201604	2485	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have an answer to the question.	13.0	102.0
201604	2486	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Okay.	13.0	97.0
201604	2487	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The question is a good one.	13.0	102.0
201604	2488	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The question was how our own thinking evolved.	13.0	102.0
201604	2489	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	First of all, in 2015 the BEA actually did a pretty thorough analysis of this residual seasonality and wrote a white paper on it.	13.0	102.0
201604	2490	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The BEA claimed that it had attacked most of the aspects of this, including PCE and QSS and other things.	13.0	102.0
201604	2491	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And so we took on board that we were probably going to be rid of most of the residual seasonality in GDP.	13.0	102.0
201604	2492	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But then Glenn Rudebusch and his colleagues redid the analysis and found, much to their surprise, that most of it was still there, at least in GDP.	13.0	102.0
201604	2493	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s where we came up with the numbers I mentioned today.	13.0	102.0
201604	2494	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So that was a bit of a surprise to us after the BEA had done this Manhattan Project, if you will, on this.	13.0	102.0
201604	2495	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	My other comment is, I tend to focus on four-quarter changes in GDP, just like I do on PCE prices and other things, because I know there’s noise in the data.	13.0	102.0
201604	2496	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In our view, GDP growth on a four-quarter basis hasn’t moved around very much.	13.0	102.0
201604	2497	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s 2 to 2¼ percent, and as I said, I’m at 2 percent now.	13.0	102.0
201604	2498	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think it’s probably the easier way to avoid some of these issues on a four- quarter basis.	13.0	102.0
201604	2499	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But the answer to your question is how our thinking evolved on that.	13.0	102.0
201604	2500	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We actually thought that was probably going to go away, or at least mostly go away, and were somewhat surprised that it hasn’t.	13.0	102.0
201604	2501	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201604	2502	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	13.0	65.0
201604	2503	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	111.0
201604	2504	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The Ninth District economy suffered a major shock last week with the death of Prince.	13.0	111.0
201604	2505	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The good news is that this was not a destabilizing shock, but it really unified people across the District and the Bank celebrating his life and his music.	13.0	111.0
201604	2506	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	In other economic news, the Ninth District continues to perform relatively well.	13.0	111.0
201604	2507	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	However, the global weakness in commodity prices is having a notable effect on oil, as we have heard, as well as on mining and agriculture.	13.0	111.0
201604	2508	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Oil production in North Dakota is now down about 10 percent below its peak in December 2014, and a large bank in our District has increased its expected losses on oil business lending.	13.0	111.0
201604	2509	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Other industries in the District are generally faring much better, and there are some emerging signs of labor tightening.	13.0	111.0
201604	2510	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	For example, a national retailer with a large local presence has just raised its minimum wage to $10 an hour, and anecdotal evidence suggests that other retailers are following suit.	13.0	111.0
201604	2511	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	At the national level, the risk of recession seems to have declined somewhat since earlier in the year.	13.0	111.0
201604	2512	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Although first-quarter economic growth has been very weak, as we have just discussed, a variety of leading indicators suggest a rebound ahead.	13.0	111.0
201604	2513	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	In particular, the stock market has risen, the VIX is low, and consumer confidence remains high.	13.0	111.0
201604	2514	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	In the labor market, the rapid pace of hiring has continued, as we have discussed at length.	13.0	111.0
201604	2515	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I personally think the continued rise in labor force participation is very welcome news and is very important, and I don’t have confidence that there is no more slack in the labor market.	13.0	111.0
201604	2516	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I think that, if anything, we’ve learned that there is a lot that we don’t understand about what’s happening in the labor market.	13.0	111.0
201604	2517	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And if we can continue to bring people into the labor market while the headline unemployment rate remains fixed, I personally think that we should allow that to continue.	13.0	111.0
201604	2518	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And, on the other hand, weak productivity growth is troubling for all of us.	13.0	111.0
201604	2519	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Inflation and the inflation outlook also remain weak.	13.0	111.0
201604	2520	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Oil and commodity prices are still low; the dollar remains strong.	13.0	111.0
201604	2521	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Although some large employers are raising pay, this has yet to show up in aggregate wage measures, and measures of inflation expectations remain at extremely low levels.	13.0	111.0
201604	2522	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Looking overseas, the IMF has again downgraded its forecast for global economic growth in 2016.	13.0	111.0
201604	2523	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	In addition, global inflation remains very low, and, as a result, there is very little prospect of imminent monetary policy tightening in any developed economies.	13.0	111.0
201604	2524	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	In summary, I am cautiously optimistic that moderate growth will continue in the US economy.	13.0	111.0
201604	2525	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I hope that continued improvement in the labor market will eventually bring inflation and inflation expectations back up to 2 percent.	13.0	111.0
201604	2526	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	But I have to admit that, as yet, I don’t see any concrete evidence that this is occurring.	13.0	111.0
201604	2527	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I continue to agree with the Tealbook that risks to the outlook appear to be tilted to the downside.	13.0	111.0
201604	2528	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	13.0	111.0
201604	2529	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201604	2530	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13.0	65.0
201604	2531	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201604	2532	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	My views don’t differ materially from what I’ve heard around the table.	13.0	96.0
201604	2533	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The economy appears to have slowed rather sharply in Q1, but most of the fundamentals remain supportive of economic growth.	13.0	96.0
201604	2534	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In particular, job gains remain sturdy, household real incomes have been rising at a decent clip, fiscal policy is stimulative, and financial conditions are now much easier compared with just a few months ago.	13.0	96.0
201604	2535	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So my baseline view is pretty much the same as everybody else, that growth will pick up in coming quarters and that real GDP will rise at about a 2 percent pace this year.	13.0	96.0
201604	2536	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	All that said, however, I am still somewhat concerned about the outlook.	13.0	96.0
201604	2537	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t fully understand the forces behind the first-quarter real GDP slowdown.	13.0	96.0
201604	2538	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And I very much have the same view as Governor Tarullo that we already knew that there was this residual seasonality issue in our forecast, and so most of us have been surprised by the first-quarter slowdown.	13.0	96.0
201604	2539	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t want to put it all on the residual seasonality.	13.0	96.0
201604	2540	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there is some risk that rather than GDP speeding up to meet payroll growth, we could see payroll growth slow down a little bit so that it rises at a pace more consistent with the modest growth rate in the economic activity.	13.0	96.0
201604	2541	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I also am somewhat concerned about the weakness in consumer spending growth.	13.0	96.0
201604	2542	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In some ways, I feel like that’s the bigger issue because the fundamental supports for consumption in Q1 were really very positive in terms of employment growth, declining gasoline prices, and a saving rate that looked rather elevated relative to disposable income.	13.0	96.0
201604	2543	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Yet we see this real weakness in consumption that I think is very hard to explain.	13.0	96.0
201604	2544	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	One potential explanation is that we’re just too optimistic about where we think the saving rate is supposed to go.	13.0	96.0
201604	2545	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I can think of a number of reasons why the saving rate might be higher than what we think it should be.	13.0	96.0
201604	2546	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	When we look at the bivariate/univariate comparisons of net worth to income and where the saving rate is, we are leaving out all sorts of other variables.	13.0	96.0
201604	2547	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Some of the things that might point to a higher desired household saving rate would be, one, scarring from the financial crisis:  People are saving more for precautionary reasons, or lenders are more unwilling to lend.	13.0	96.0
201604	2548	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Remember, this is a net savings rate, and so the lending side also weighs on that.	13.0	96.0
201604	2549	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The increasing skew in terms of income distribution would also point to a higher saving rate.	13.0	96.0
201604	2550	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The aging of the population would tend to point to a higher saving rate.	13.0	96.0
201604	2551	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The decline in real interest rates and how that affects expectations about future rates of return, how much savings people need to have a comfortable retirement, would also all point in the same direction.	13.0	96.0
201604	2552	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there is this notion in our mind that Q2 is going to be the inverse of Q1.	13.0	96.0
201604	2553	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Spending is going to rise faster than income, and the household saving rate is going to decline.	13.0	96.0
201604	2554	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I just think that is not necessarily obvious to me.	13.0	96.0
201604	2555	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of Governor Tarullo raising the issue of lower potential GDP growth, I think the implications for policy are frankly pretty straightforward.	13.0	96.0
201604	2556	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me that if you have lower potential growth, you’re going to run out of capacity sooner; you’re going to run out of slack in the economy sooner; and you’re going to be less tolerant of a rise in nominal wage growth because the rate of nominal wage growth consistent with your 2 percent inflation objective is going to be somewhat lower.	13.0	96.0
201604	2557	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me it points to going a little bit sooner, but then it also implies a lower terminal federal funds rate because, presumably, r* is lower.	13.0	96.0
201604	2558	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess I would say it’s sooner, but a lower terminal rate.	13.0	96.0
201604	2559	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Maybe that’s what the bond market is sensing, because 10-year Treasury bond yields seem pretty low.	13.0	96.0
201604	2560	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	On the inflation side, I continue to be of the very boring view that if we get the 2 percent real GDP growth, then we’ll get a gradually tighter labor market.	13.0	96.0
201604	2561	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If we get a gradually tighter labor market, we’ll see rising wages.	13.0	96.0
201604	2562	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And with that, we’ll eventually see an upturn in core inflation.	13.0	96.0
201604	2563	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I continue to take quite a bit of positive signal from the fact that the core inflation rate has been pretty steady over the past year on a year-over-year basis despite the stronger dollar, weaker energy prices, and the decline in some measures of inflation expectations.	13.0	96.0
201604	2564	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That is actually a pretty good performance when you factor all of those things into the equation.	13.0	96.0
201604	2565	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If second-quarter economic growth does rebound and labor market momentum remains broadly intact, then I think that points to another increase in our federal funds rate target.	13.0	96.0
201604	2566	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But there is this small problem of the timing of the Brexit vote, and I want to talk a little bit about that.	13.0	96.0
201604	2567	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the risk of a leave vote does raise the bar a little bit for June because we are not going to know the outcome of the Brexit vote, or the market response to the Brexit vote, at the time of the June meeting.	13.0	96.0
201604	2568	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	For me, it wouldn’t be that comfortable to vote for a rate hike on June 15, have Britain vote to leave the EU on June 23, and have that trigger a big selloff of financial markets and a significant tightening of financial conditions soon thereafter.	13.0	96.0
201604	2569	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The obvious question that such a decision would raise would be:  Well, if the FOMC knew that there was going to be this Brexit vote and they knew there were risks associated with this Brexit vote, why didn’t they just wait a little bit longer?	13.0	96.0
201604	2570	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Another way to think about this is that waiting for more information does have option value, and that option value should be weighed against the cost of waiting.	13.0	96.0
201604	2571	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, obviously, if the prospects of a leave vote at the time of the June meeting are very low, then the option value of waiting is also very low.	13.0	96.0
201604	2572	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In my mind, it is going to really depend on where we are at the June meeting, what that probability of exit looks like at that time.	13.0	96.0
201604	2573	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	What I think is going to happen is, if there are no real new events in Europe, the probability of the leave vote is likely going to fade gradually.	13.0	96.0
201604	2574	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The reason why I think it’s as high as 29 percent right now is there’s a good deal of time during which bad things can happen in Europe that could push the probability of leaving upward.	13.0	96.0
201604	2575	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And if nothing bad happens in the interim, I think what will happen is that probability will erode.	13.0	96.0
201604	2576	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I hope that when we get to the meeting, the probability of a leave vote will be very low, and then we can just not worry about that in terms of thinking about the June timing.	13.0	96.0
201604	2577	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But I am not really sure how to think about this and how much it should weigh on the rate decision in June, and I am very curious and would be very interested, in sidebars or tomorrow when we talk about monetary policy, just to hear what people think about how they’re factoring in Brexit in terms of how they think about the timing of June, one way or the other.	13.0	96.0
201604	2578	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, I have a couple of thoughts about why financial market conditions have improved.	13.0	96.0
201604	2579	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we need to think about that because it does have implications for monetary policy.	13.0	96.0
201604	2580	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I see a number of factors as having been at play:  recovering oil prices—I never knew that higher oil prices were good for financial conditions, but I guess it’s true at some point; stronger Chinese economic data; a weaker dollar, which has eased the pressure on the RMB and made Chinese currency policy a less pressing issue; and the shallower expected path of tightening with respect to US monetary policy.	13.0	96.0
201604	2581	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If you think that expectations about US monetary policy are an important factor behind the recovery in financial markets, and you view the improvement in financial market conditions as mostly desirable, then I think that does have implications for US monetary policy.	13.0	96.0
201604	2582	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I am still in the “two more rate hikes this year” camp.	13.0	96.0
201604	2583	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If we did this, it probably would result in somewhat tighter financial market conditions, as this would be somewhat more than what’s expected by market participants.	13.0	96.0
201604	2584	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But I currently expect that some tightening in financial conditions will be appropriate at some stage this year, in view of the tightening labor market and the likelihood that inflation will be somewhat higher over the medium term.	13.0	96.0
201604	2585	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But at the end of the day, how much we will need to do in the end will not just depend on how the forecast evolves, but also on how much our actions affect financial conditions, and I just don’t think we have a very good feel for that at this stage.	13.0	96.0
201604	2586	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201604	2587	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, and thanks to everyone for a very interesting round of comments on the economic outlook and the risks.	13.0	65.0
201604	2588	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	What I’d like to do is wrap up with a couple of observations of my own.	13.0	65.0
201604	2589	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Before I get started, though, let me say that our photographer is going to come in now and take a couple of pictures.	52.0	65.0
201604	2590	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	And before he does that, let me ask you, if you have any confidential material sitting in front of you, to cover it up.	52.0	65.0
201604	2592	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, let me start off.	13.0	65.0
201604	2593	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	As many of you have noted, the news from the labor market continues to be good.	13.0	65.0
201604	2594	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Monthly payroll gains averaged almost 210,000 over the past three months, just a little slower than the robust pace last year.	13.0	65.0
201604	2595	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	And labor force participation was up again in March, continuing the recent trend that’s allowed the unemployment rate to remain roughly flat since October even as the employment-to-population ratio has risen markedly.	13.0	65.0
201604	2596	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	The pool of potential workers—the unemployed plus those who would like a job but are not actively looking for work—has continued to shrink.	13.0	65.0
201604	2597	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	These developments show that labor utilization is continuing to rise.	13.0	65.0
201604	2598	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	That said, I still see some room for further improvement.	13.0	65.0
201604	2599	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Involuntary part-time employment has moved sideways since the fall and remains elevated relative to its pre-crisis level.	13.0	65.0
201604	2600	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Wage growth continues to be sluggish.	13.0	65.0
201604	2601	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	The unemployment rate is still ¼ percentage point above my estimate of its longer-run level.	13.0	65.0
201604	2602	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	And some undershooting would be highly desirable in order to return inflation to 2 percent more quickly.	13.0	65.0
201604	2603	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	This is a point illustrated by the alternative optimal policy simulations reported in the Tealbook.	13.0	65.0
201604	2604	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	These alternative simulations, unlike the usual ones, more sensibly assume that welfare losses occur only when the unemployment rate rises above the natural rate, not when it falls below.	13.0	65.0
201604	2605	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	As a result, it becomes optimal to push the unemployment rate to a very low level for a time, and this result holds even if the Phillips curve is much steeper than the staff estimates.	13.0	65.0
201604	2606	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Unfortunately, in contrast to the labor market data, spending and production indicators have been surprisingly weak.	13.0	65.0
201604	2607	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	The downward revisions in the staff’s real GDP forecast for Q1 are concentrated in private domestic final purchases, which are generally viewed as a more reliable indicator of underlying economic growth than GDP itself.	13.0	65.0
201604	2608	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Consumer spending, in particular, has slowed markedly from the robust pace seen last year despite solid income gains, a relatively high level of household wealth, and healthy readings on consumer sentiment.	13.0	65.0
201604	2609	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, drilling activity is still contracting, other types of business investment remain soft, and net exports continue to be a substantial drag on the overall economy.	13.0	65.0
201604	2610	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Taken together, these developments suggest that a persistent slowdown in aggregate spending may be under way, which could hinder further improvement in labor market conditions.	13.0	65.0
201604	2611	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	This recent spate of weak spending and production data represents a new source of downside risk to the forecast.	13.0	65.0
201604	2612	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	But like many of you, I have not significantly altered my baseline outlook.	13.0	65.0
201604	2613	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	I agree with the Tealbook’s assessment that the weakness we have seen in aggregate spending is likely to prove transitory.	13.0	65.0
201604	2614	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	That strikes me as pretty consistent with what I heard around the table.	13.0	65.0
201604	2615	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	A few of you did mention rather downbeat anecdotes from your contacts, but, by and large, outside the sectors that are most strongly affected by declining commodity prices, weak global economic growth, and the strong dollar, I did not hear many reports from your business contacts suggesting any obvious pronounced downturn in economic activity or any significant negative reassessment of future sales prospects.	13.0	65.0
201604	2616	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	As several of you noted, the Q1 slowdown may partly reflect measurement problems and other transitory factors, such as the financial market swoon in the first quarter that is now entirely reversed.	13.0	65.0
201604	2617	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, as the year progresses, both the contraction in drilling and the drag due to past dollar appreciation should fade.	13.0	65.0
201604	2618	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Although downside risks relating to domestic spending may have increased somewhat, I see the risks relating to global economic and financial conditions as having diminished.	13.0	65.0
201604	2619	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	One factor contributing to this improvement has been the downward shift in market expectations concerning the likely pace of our own policy tightening.	13.0	65.0
201604	2620	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Partly in response, financial conditions have significantly improved with the dollar down about 2½ percent, longer- term Treasury yields and mortgage rates down roughly 20 basis points, risk spreads on corporate bonds narrower, and equity prices up almost 5 percent.	13.0	65.0
201604	2621	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Overall, therefore, neither my baseline economic outlook nor my assessment of the balance of risks has changed appreciably, on net, since the previous meeting.	13.0	65.0
201604	2622	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	With regard to inflation, the data we have received since the March meeting suggest that the March Tealbook was correct in viewing the unexpectedly high readings on inflation in January as likely to be largely transitory.	13.0	65.0
201604	2623	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	The current Tealbook forecast that core PCE inflation will come in at about 1½ percent on a four-quarter basis this year, with headline inflation running closer to 1 percent, strikes me as entirely reasonable.	13.0	65.0
201604	2624	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Absent further shocks to oil prices and the dollar, I continue to expect that inflation will move up to 2 percent by late 2018 with some further improvement in labor market conditions.	13.0	65.0
201604	2625	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	I also continue to view the risk to this outlook as tilted slightly to the downside in light of the low readings on inflation compensation and the slippage over the past couple of years in some survey measures of expected longer-run inflation.	13.0	65.0
201604	2626	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Anticipating tomorrow’s discussion, let me say that in my view, incoming data create sufficient concern about the outlook that it makes sense to leave the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting.	13.0	65.0
201604	2627	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	But we definitely need to keep our options open for June, and I would see a strong case for raising the target range for the federal funds rate another 25 basis points at our next meeting if incoming data confirm that GDP growth is picking up about as expected, if the recent pace of improvement in the labor market continues, and barring other developments that we judge to appreciably alter the balance of risks.	13.0	65.0
201604	2628	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	And, of course, in that regard, I am concerned about the potential for significant financial market turbulence in the run-up to the Brexit vote.	13.0	65.0
201604	2629	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	It’s something we will have to watch very carefully and consider, as the odds evolve and we watch financial market reactions, what our appropriate response should be.	13.0	65.0
201604	2630	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Looking forward, if employment continues growing at anything close to its recent pace, our policy deliberations will need to grapple with the issue of how long that can continue without the economy overheating.	13.0	65.0
201604	2631	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Payroll gains surely need to moderate substantially at some point to avoid too large an undershoot of unemployment below its longer-run sustainable rate.	13.0	65.0
201604	2632	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	But it’s entirely possible that labor force participation may continue to surprise to the upside for a while longer.	13.0	65.0
201604	2633	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Estimates of the level of the trend participation rate are unavoidably imprecise.	13.0	65.0
201604	2634	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	And even though the staff has revised up its estimate of the trend in response to the recent surprises, a tighter labor market could potentially draw yet more people back into the labor force on a sustained basis.	13.0	65.0
201604	2635	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Such a development would be of great benefit to the nation, and we need to be wary of inadvertently blocking it by tightening monetary policy too quickly or too much.	13.0	65.0
201604	2636	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Further increases in labor demand may also be partially satisfied by reductions in involuntary part-time employment, which is still 1 percentage point above its pre-crisis level.	13.0	65.0
201604	2637	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	I recognize that this persistence may reflect structural changes that have permanently increased the demand for part-time workers, but employment practices also depend on the ease and cost of finding workers who are willing to work less than full time, something that may become increasingly hard to do as the economy nears full employment.	13.0	65.0
201604	2638	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	And in this regard, I think it’s noteworthy that a number of major retailers—including J.	13.0	65.0
201604	2639	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Crew, the Gap, Abercrombie & Fitch, and Pier 1 Imports—are now phasing out their use of on-call scheduling, which is a practice that is extremely convenient for managers but one that’s highly unpopular with workers.	13.0	65.0
201604	2640	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	We will also have to wrestle with the implications of low productivity growth should it continue.	13.0	65.0
201604	2641	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Our longer-run SEP numbers for real GDP growth suggest that many of us, like the staff, have been assuming that trend labor productivity will accelerate appreciably over time to a pace more in line with its historical average.	13.0	65.0
201604	2642	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	But as the Tealbook warns, and as many of you emphasized in your comments today, productivity growth may remain low for the rest of the year and beyond.	13.0	65.0
201604	2643	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	If such an expectation is already incorporated into household and business decisions, as assumed in one of the Tealbook simulations, then continued low productivity growth could cause the unemployment rate to fall appreciably over the next few quarters despite relatively slow real GDP growth.	13.0	65.0
201604	2644	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	In this event, we may need to tighten policy more quickly than we currently anticipate.	13.0	65.0
201604	2645	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	But as another Tealbook simulation shows, if households and firms are also surprised, then slower productivity growth over the next several years might have only limited implications for the paths of both employment and monetary policy.	13.0	65.0
201604	2646	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	In this case, the level of aggregate demand would shift down roughly one for one with surprising weak productivity.	13.0	65.0
201604	2647	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Another possibility not simulated in the Tealbook is that productivity growth might surprise everyone by being permanently lower, and that’s something that would likely result in a much slower than anticipated pace of tightening because it would reduce the long-run equilibrium funds rate.	13.0	65.0
201604	2648	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	In light of these and other ambiguities, we will have little choice but to monitor developments carefully and avoid being overly confident in any projection.	13.0	65.0
201604	2649	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	So with those remarks, let me stop there.	52.0	65.0
201604	2650	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	We have a lot of time tomorrow for the policy round, so I suggest letting Thomas begin with his policy remarks first thing tomorrow morning.	52.0	65.0
201604	2651	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	We have dinner and a reception across the street.	52.0	65.0
201604	2653	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	April 27 Session .	52.0	65.0
201604	2654	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	52.0	65.0
201604	2655	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	My gavel has been restored.	52.0	65.0
201604	2656	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	52.0	65.0
201604	2657	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	To start off this morning, I want to turn to Steve Kamin to talk about this morning’s trade report.	11.0	65.0
201604	2658	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11.0	999.0
201604	2659	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Today we received the advance report on US trade.	11.0	999.0
201604	2660	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Just to be clear:  The full report on March US trade, including exports and imports of both goods and services, is going to come out next week.	11.0	999.0
201604	2661	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	But today’s release is the preview, based just on nominal merchandise exports and merchandise imports.	11.0	999.0
201604	2662	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	And these data are going to be used in the advance GDP release that will come out tomorrow.	11.0	999.0
201604	2663	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	We were expecting that the trade balance for March would be a $47 billion deficit, which would have been the same as in February.	11.0	999.0
201604	2664	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	In the event, merchandise exports, which we expected would stay more or less the same, fell $2 billion, but merchandise imports fell about $8 billion, compared with a small rise that we were anticipating.	11.0	999.0
201604	2665	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	As a result, our estimate for the trade balance in March has fallen from $47 billion to $41 billion.	11.0	999.0
201604	2666	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Assuming we don’t get any surprises either in trade prices, which we have not yet received, or in trade in services, which we have also not yet received, we would lower our estimate for the net export drag on US GDP growth in Q1 from our current estimate of 0.7 percent to only 0.1 percent.	11.0	999.0
201604	2667	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Wow.	11.0	65.0
201604	2668	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	So, in principle, if that full change in our net export estimate was passed through to US GDP growth, it would actually raise our Q1 estimate of real GDP growth by 0.6 percentage point.	11.0	999.0
201604	2669	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	That’s what we know on the trade side, but Bill will expand on that a bit.	11.0	999.0
201604	2670	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	In terms of the components, what detail there is in the trade report suggested that there was a big drop in capital goods imports, which may mean that we would offset a little bit of the smaller drag arising from net exports by weakening our investment forecast a bit.	11.0	999.0
201604	2671	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	So I guess at this point, I’d say our Q1 estimate for GDP growth is going to be somewhere between ¾ percent and 1 percent, still up noticeably from the 0.4 percent that we had in the Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201604	2672	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any questions for Steve?	12.0	65.0
201604	2673	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Doesn’t a decline in imports say something more than about capital goods?	12.0	108.0
201604	2674	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	It’s also about other demand, isn’t it?	12.0	108.0
201604	2675	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Consumer spending?	12.0	65.0
201604	2676	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	It could be.	12.0	999.0
201604	2677	2016-04-27	meeting	WASCHER	Again, we have a lot of information on consumer spending, so we don’t take a lot of signal, on the basis of the trade data, for our consumer spending estimates for Q1 at this point.	12.0	999.0
201604	2678	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	Of course, when the BEA writes in its guesses for services for March, we don’t expect any big changes, but it’s possible that they would surprise us, and the net export drag that would be in tomorrow’s GDP data might be a little different than we expect.	12.0	999.0
201604	2679	2016-04-27	meeting	KAMIN	But right now, we think there’s clearly been a shortfall in our estimate, and that should show up.	12.0	999.0
201604	2680	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12.0	65.0
201604	2681	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, let’s begin our policy round.	21.0	65.0
201604	2682	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to call on Thomas to start us off.	21.0	65.0
201604	2683	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201604	2684	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for the Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21.0	999.0
201604	2685	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	As Simon noted yesterday, your communications following the March FOMC meeting, accompanied by some good news on foreign economic activity, appear to have contributed importantly to calming global financial markets over the intermeeting period.	21.0	999.0
201604	2686	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	As illustrated in the top-left panel of the exhibit, sovereign yields here and in other advanced economies declined across the curve.	21.0	999.0
201604	2687	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	While such widespread declines often have been associated with investors seeking to reduce their exposure to risky assets, in this instance it seems to have reflected investors’ assessment that central banks would act to reduce downside risks to the global economy.	21.0	999.0
201604	2688	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Consistent with that perception, equity prices rose around the globe, and, as illustrated in the top-right panel, corporate bond spreads reversed their run-up of earlier in the year.	21.0	999.0
201604	2689	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Steve noted in his briefing that the firming in oil prices and the depreciation of the dollar—developments that might be viewed as negatives for the global outlook—also appeared to support the improved tone in financial markets.	21.0	999.0
201604	2690	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The continuing rebound in oil and other commodity prices seemed to ease the pain for commodity producers and reduce tail risks for US energy firms, while the softness of the dollar made a more disruptive RMB devaluation against the dollar less likely, at least for a time.	21.0	999.0
201604	2691	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	By contrast, as Bill Wascher discussed in his briefing, the incoming information on domestic economic activity, the labor market, and inflation has been challenging to interpret.	21.0	999.0
201604	2692	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The draft of alternative B you are considering today acknowledges the crosscurrents in the recent data but indicates that the Committee anticipates the economy will get back on a track of moderate expansion with further strengthening of the labor market and with inflation rising to 2 percent over the medium term.	21.0	999.0
201604	2693	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	If the incoming information on the economy between now and the June meeting supports that outlook, alternative B is intended to leave the possibility of an increase in the federal funds rate in June firmly on the table without pre-committing to a particular decision.	21.0	999.0
201604	2694	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	A separate question is whether alternative B positions the Committee to respond appropriately to outcomes off its baseline trajectory.	21.0	999.0
201604	2695	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The draft alternative communicates that you are less concerned about risks associated with global economic and financial developments than in March, though still concerned.	21.0	999.0
201604	2696	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	It does so by replacing the sentence in the March statement that indicated that global developments pose risks to the outlook with new language that says you will closely monitor global developments and inflation indicators.	21.0	999.0
201604	2697	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The middle-left panel highlights three sources of uncertainty on which you may have some greater clarity by the time of your June meeting.	21.0	999.0
201604	2698	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	For instance, the spending indicators might pick up, or they might remain weak and cast doubt on a continuation of labor market improvement, which in turn might leave the Committee less confident in its baseline view.	21.0	999.0
201604	2699	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternatively (or in addition), a renewed deterioration in financial conditions—possibly triggered by the looming Brexit referendum—might be seen as a factor that could cause the Committee to stay its hand in June.	21.0	999.0
201604	2700	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The wording in alternative B continues to recognize that developments abroad may significantly affect how the US economy will evolve.	21.0	999.0
201604	2701	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The middle-right panel highlights some of the fundamental medium-term uncertainties you are confronted with that the data you will receive during the intermeeting period will not materially reduce.	21.0	999.0
201604	2702	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	As highlighted in the alternative view box presented in Tealbook A, the evolution of productivity during the current expansion raises the possibility of a more sobering longer-run growth outlook than we currently anticipate.	21.0	999.0
201604	2703	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	By current estimates, labor productivity has risen between 2011 and 2015 by just under ½ percent per year, on average, the worst five-year performance in postwar US history.	21.0	999.0
201604	2704	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Whether continued weak productivity growth would result in a commensurate slowdown in demand over the medium term or in a faster take-up of resource utilization and attendant inflation pressures is a key question for the outlook beyond the near term.	21.0	999.0
201604	2705	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Another risk is that inflation might fail to rise as expected later this year.	21.0	999.0
201604	2706	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	It may be that a combination of slow economic growth and a decline in inflation would pose the most difficult challenge in light of the limited space that remains for conventional monetary stimulus in the advanced economies.	21.0	999.0
201604	2707	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	In a new question in the Desk surveys of primary dealers and market participants, respondents were asked about their perceptions of your likely reaction if economic developments over the remainder of this year deviated significantly from the outlook summarized by the March SEP medians.	21.0	999.0
201604	2708	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The matrix in the lower-left panel shows the level of the federal funds rate that the median respondent would expect to see at the end of this year if core inflation and/or the unemployment rate deviated 50 basis points in either direction from the medians reported in the March SEP.	21.0	999.0
201604	2709	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	This panel was lovingly referred to by some of my colleagues as the Mondrian box, and, in fact, I asked my RA to make a version of it that would remind you very much of that.	21.0	999.0
201604	2710	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	[Laughter]	21.0	999.0
201604	2711	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	But perhaps for the sake of legibility, I thought we should go with a more restrained version.	21.0	999.0
201604	2712	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The shaded box at the center shows that, if economic conditions at the end of the year match the March SEP medians of 1.6 percent for core PCE inflation and 4.7 percent for the unemployment rate, the median respondent to the Desk’s surveys expects the federal funds rate to be 88 basis points.	21.0	999.0
201604	2713	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The other boxes tell us two things about dealers’ and market participants’ perceptions.	21.0	999.0
201604	2714	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	First, they believe you would respond more strongly to deviations in inflation from your projection than to deviations in unemployment—that is, there are greater variations in the entries as you move up or down the table than when you move left or right.	21.0	999.0
201604	2715	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Second, they believe that you would respond more strongly to inflation outcomes that leave you even further below your 2 percent goal—moving from the middle row to the upper row—than to higher-than-expected inflation.	21.0	999.0
201604	2716	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The draft of alternative B for this meeting would report in paragraph 2 that the Committee is continuing to “closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments” and would retain in paragraph 4 the language that “the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.”	21.0	999.0
201604	2717	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	That is, the Committee would be stating that it will be alert to the types of scenarios that could result in a shortfall of core inflation from the Committee’s baseline expectation—those that might fall in the upper row of the matrix.	21.0	999.0
201604	2718	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	In such circumstances, respondents to the Desk’s surveys expect that you would react relatively strongly, at least for any unemployment rate outcome within the range shown.	21.0	999.0
201604	2719	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	They also anticipate that you would raise the funds rate more steeply if, over the next several quarters, the economy was on a track to both higher inflation and a sharper-than-expected drop in the unemployment rate by year-end—the outcome in the bottom-left corner.	21.0	999.0
201604	2720	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	But they seem to anticipate a more cautious reaction to higher inflation if the unemployment rate comes in as expected (the middle cell in the bottom row), and they project that you would increase rates even more gradually if the higher inflation occurred at a time when the unemployment rate was increasing (the bottom-right cell).	21.0	999.0
201604	2721	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Why do respondents think that you will react more to lower-than-expected inflation than to inflation reaching 2 percent faster than anticipated?	21.0	999.0
201604	2722	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	One possibility is that they believe policymakers are concerned about the potential for the economy to become mired in a low-growth, low-inflation state.	21.0	999.0
201604	2723	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Monetary policy would have limited scope to stimulate real activity in this situation, as these developments would reduce the equilibrium real interest rate further and so increase an already considerable risk of being persistently stuck at or near the effective lower bound.	21.0	999.0
201604	2724	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The red dots in the lower-right panel show that the median respondent to the Desk’s surveys sees the neutral real federal funds rate at the end of this year as having drifted down significantly since last summer.	21.0	999.0
201604	2725	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The same is true for the median estimate of the longer-run real federal funds rate, the blue triangles, under the assumption of inflation attaining the 2 percent objective over time.	21.0	999.0
201604	2726	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	With scope for providing monetary policy accommodation possibly further diminished, the cautious outlook for future rate increases described in paragraph 4 remains appropriate.	21.0	999.0
201604	2727	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201604	2728	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	That concludes my prepared remarks.	21.0	999.0
201604	2729	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The March statement and the draft alternatives are shown on pages 2 to 9.	21.0	999.0
201604	2730	2016-04-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I’ll be happy to take the Committee’s questions.	21.0	999.0
201604	2731	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	22.0	65.0
201604	2732	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any questions for Thomas?	22.0	65.0
201604	2733	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	22.0	65.0
201604	2734	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	22.0	65.0
201604	2735	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, why don’t we begin our go-round, and I’d like to start with President Rosengren.	23.0	65.0
201604	2736	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201604	2737	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B.	23.0	90.0
201604	2738	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is appropriate to see whether the weakness in spending for the first quarter is reflecting more than a temporary pause in real GDP growth.	23.0	90.0
201604	2739	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	My expectation is that the second quarter will be stronger.	23.0	90.0
201604	2740	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If the incoming data between now and the June meeting confirm that real GDP is growing at least as fast as potential GDP and labor markets are continuing to improve, then, in my view, it will be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.	23.0	90.0
201604	2741	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	On account of my expectation that we will not move at this meeting and my assessment that it will be appropriate to move at the next meeting, I do have communications concerns.	23.0	90.0
201604	2742	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	My reading of alternative B is that it is unlikely to significantly increase market perceptions of the probability attached to a tightening in June.	23.0	90.0
201604	2743	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If that is correct, the market probably has too low a probability regarding both a tightening in June and our likely policy rate path over the forecast horizon.	23.0	90.0
201604	2744	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The market’s expectation that we may move only 75 basis points through 2018 reflects much more pessimism than I have about the economy and, in my view, risks a taper tantrum response as the market realizes that, while policy will be accommodative from our perspective, it will not be nearly as accommodative as financial markets currently expect.	23.0	90.0
201604	2745	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If the incoming data over the next two months are consistent with the Tealbook forecast—and recognizing that we will not have another SEP to signal policy intentions—we will need to communicate more clearly before the June meeting about the likely path of policy.	23.0	90.0
201604	2746	2016-04-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201604	2747	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me say that I do have a speech that I’ve scheduled for June 6, which is the very last day before the blackout period.	23.0	65.0
201604	2748	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	I know that’s pretty close to the meeting, but I did schedule it in order to be able to communicate reasonably clearly if it becomes utterly evident that there’s a gap between market expectations and our likely behavior.	23.0	65.0
201604	2749	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	And I know others also will be speaking.	23.0	65.0
201604	2750	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Do you know which ones?	23.0	108.0
201604	2751	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Lots of people, I suspect.	23.0	65.0
201604	2752	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	23.0	65.0
201604	2753	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Now, Governor Tarullo.	23.0	65.0
201604	2754	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201604	2755	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	I support alternative B.	23.0	97.0
201604	2756	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	As Thomas indicated, the change in the language in paragraph 2 indicates a slight downgrading of concerns about the global economy.	23.0	97.0
201604	2757	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	As I said yesterday, that’s consistent with my own assessment of the risks that I think we can more or less get our arms around.	23.0	97.0
201604	2758	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	As I also said yesterday, I don’t quite see how to get our arms around the Brexit risk.	23.0	97.0
201604	2759	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	It’s closer to Knightian uncertainty than to some risk that we can do an assessment of.	23.0	97.0
201604	2760	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Having said that, I don’t think it would be the wisest thing in the world to refer to that either directly or indirectly, so I’m okay with the language as it exists here.	23.0	97.0
201604	2761	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	My own position with respect to June is not a tilt toward raising rates, although I’m open- minded on the topic, and I think the virtue of this alternative as presented is that it maintains everyone’s optionality.	23.0	97.0
201604	2762	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201604	2763	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201604	2764	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23.0	65.0
201604	2765	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201604	2766	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	As always, I found the comparisons in the Tealbook among the various policy rules very helpful.	23.0	107.0
201604	2767	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, the optimal control rule that places greater weight on deviations of inflation from its target than on unemployment running below its assumed natural rate has some intuitive appeal, both because we have some uncertainty about what the natural rate is in the wake of the crisis and because it’s hard to see the welfare costs associated with having unemployment run a bit low temporarily, as distinct, of course, from any possible implications that may have for inflation.	23.0	107.0
201604	2768	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I took two lessons from this analysis.	23.0	107.0
201604	2769	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	First, even with this policy rule that places greater weight on inflation, we have to work pretty hard to get inflation back up to its target, which it does not reach until 2018.	23.0	107.0
201604	2770	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In fact, interestingly, this is the only policy rule that gets inflation back to 2 percent by 2018.	23.0	107.0
201604	2771	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The slow rise in inflation is due in part to a very flat Phillips curve.	23.0	107.0
201604	2772	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	But even assuming nominal wage growth is four times more responsive to the unemployment gap than it currently appears to be—a setting that might be associated with a nonlinearity in the Phillips curve near the natural rate of unemployment—inflation doesn’t get back to 2 percent until 2018, with a policy rate path that is shallower than that in the March SEP.	23.0	107.0
201604	2773	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Of course, achieving our target on inflation under these scenarios requires that unemployment will run below what we currently believe to be its natural rate, and that inflation will run about one- to two-tenths above 2 percent from 2019 to 2020.	23.0	107.0
201604	2774	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And, of course, the public would need to believe that the FOMC would tolerate such a modest overshoot due to the symmetry of our inflation target around 2 percent.	23.0	107.0
201604	2775	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I think that’s an important thought exercise— remembering that, in 70 out of the 74 months since the beginning of 2010, the 12-month change in core PCE inflation has been below 2 percent and that we are indeed comfortable with being symmetric around the 2 percent target.	23.0	107.0
201604	2776	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Turning to today’s context, I see the intermeeting period as mixed.	23.0	107.0
201604	2777	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	On the one hand, financial market conditions have improved notably, but I believe this is in no small part a response to a perceived softening in the expected rate path in the United States and its spillback effects through pressures on China’s currency peg and, through that, to broader emerging market risks.	23.0	107.0
201604	2778	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Oil appears to have reached an inflection point, and China’s stimulus, while it raises some questions about long-term sustainability, appears to be supporting near-term economic growth.	23.0	107.0
201604	2779	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Here at home, however, despite ongoing strength in the labor market, domestic spending indicators have disappointed for the second consecutive quarter, and there’s some concern that US consumption may be softening despite important supports coming from income, the behavior of gasoline prices, and sentiment.	23.0	107.0
201604	2780	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Importantly, the data suggest that the earlier improvement in core inflation may have been relatively short lived, and measures of inflation expectations and inflation compensation remain low.	23.0	107.0
201604	2781	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Progress in the labor market has continued.	23.0	107.0
201604	2782	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Interestingly, the composition of that progress has changed with a shift toward the participation margin, suggesting a greater elasticity of labor supply than previously thought.	23.0	107.0
201604	2783	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Wages have been subdued, and, as in March, there still appears to be just a little more slack remaining.	23.0	107.0
201604	2784	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The broad-based easing in financial markets has brightened the medium-term outlook a bit and made the balance of risks more favorable.	23.0	107.0
201604	2785	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	But it’s important to recognize how closely tied this improvement in financial conditions is to recent monetary policy communication, particularly including, I think, the downward shift in the policy rate path implied by the SEP, which has suggested an awareness on the part of this Committee of the risks posed by the global environment and the need to shape policy in accordance with those risks.	23.0	107.0
201604	2786	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	With realized economic conditions relative to our goals, particularly inflation, little changed since March, and with the medium-term outlook also only modestly changed, especially after taking into account recent monetary policy communication, it seems appropriate to leave the federal funds rate at its current level.	23.0	107.0
201604	2787	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	At our next meeting we’ll have received two more labor market reports, two more PCE inflation reports, two estimates of first-quarter GDP growth, and some of the spending data relevant for assessing second-quarter GDP.	23.0	107.0
201604	2788	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	These data will be important for me in helping to determine whether the weakness that we’re seeing currently is likely to prove persistent as well as whether we’re seeing any improvement in progress on inflation and on, importantly, inflation expectations.	23.0	107.0
201604	2789	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	This leaves me very comfortable with the wait-and-see approach that the Committee has adopted and that is captured in alternative B.	23.0	107.0
201604	2790	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	My preference is to reserve judgment about possible actions in June and to let the data do the talking.	23.0	107.0
201604	2791	2016-04-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	23.0	107.0
201604	2792	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201604	2793	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23.0	65.0
201604	2794	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	81.0
201604	2795	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	I believe this would have been a fine meeting to raise the target federal funds rate.	23.0	81.0
201604	2796	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Short-term real interest rates lie well below all of the benchmarks we use for evaluating where real rates ought to be—benchmarks derived from estimated policy rules that capture our successful past behavior and from estimates of the natural real rate, taking into account that real rates may have been trending downward.	23.0	81.0
201604	2797	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Even under plausible assessments of the secular decline in real rates, we are more than 1 percentage point below where we need to be.	23.0	81.0
201604	2798	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	One argument for keeping our policy rate low is that inflation is below our target.	23.0	81.0
201604	2799	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	But in recent months, we’ve seen various measures of underlying inflation rise toward 2 percent, and, as I said yesterday, I believe a broad firming trend is now evident, notwithstanding the March CPI.	23.0	81.0
201604	2800	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	The lag between policy actions and inflation responses leaves me expecting this trend to continue.	23.0	81.0
201604	2801	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Of course, many of our benchmarks take into account the difference between current inflation and our objective.	23.0	81.0
201604	2802	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Even with the remaining gap, they indicate that rates should be far higher.	23.0	81.0
201604	2803	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	When we lifted off in December, we expected to close the gap between the actual policy rate and the levels indicated by our benchmarks at a gradual but deliberate pace.	23.0	81.0
201604	2804	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Early in the first quarter, financial market developments at home and abroad raised prospects of downside risks to US growth.	23.0	81.0
201604	2805	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Those risks seemed to have diminished substantially by the time of our March meeting, but, nonetheless, we left rates unchanged and pulled down our rate projections.	23.0	81.0
201604	2806	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Now that those risks have dissipated more conclusively and the US economic outlook is in line with what we were projecting in December, we need to return policy toward the path we thought to be appropriate back then.	23.0	81.0
201604	2807	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	At this meeting, therefore, it would be appropriate for us to resume gradually pushing rates toward a more normal level.	23.0	81.0
201604	2808	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Yes, data dependence implies that when downside risks appear to rise, both the policy rate and the expected rate path should respond.	23.0	81.0
201604	2809	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	And if those risks subside, the policy rate path should respond accordingly in the opposite direction.	23.0	81.0
201604	2810	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	If not—if we delay raising rates in response to every episode of financial market heartburn but never correct course when the turmoil dies down—we will leave ourselves with a shortfall in rates that I fear we may not be able or willing to close fast enough when the time comes.	23.0	81.0
201604	2811	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	It looks like we’re at risk of doing just that in June if Brexit heartburn stays our hand.	23.0	81.0
201604	2812	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	I hope we can all agree that if we delay because of Brexit and then it turns out to be a manageable event, we don’t necessarily have to wait until September to see if we want to move again.	23.0	81.0
201604	2813	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	If it is correct that monetary policy is too easy and has been for some time, then the stability of inflation expectations is a remarkable testament to our credibility.	23.0	81.0
201604	2814	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	The longer we deviate from our policy rate benchmarks, however, the more we draw from the reservoir of that credibility.	23.0	81.0
201604	2815	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	I cannot claim to know how or when we will reach its limits.	23.0	81.0
201604	2816	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Indeed, the evolution of expectations, as Governor Tarullo noted yesterday, is hard to predict.	23.0	81.0
201604	2817	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	It is possible that even staying put through the end of the year would not test it, but I see it as a significant risk as long as we delay closing gaps to our benchmarks.	23.0	81.0
201604	2818	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	81.0
201604	2819	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201604	2820	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Two-hander—Governor Tarullo.	23.0	65.0
201604	2821	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	President Lacker, because you did refer to me, can I ask, you’re worried about expectations becoming unanchored, in view of where inflation is right now?	23.0	97.0
201604	2822	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	I’m not worried about them being unanchored tomorrow.	23.0	81.0
201604	2823	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	But you’re worried that the approach to 2 percent may unanchor inflation expectations, while you weren’t worried that, for a number of years, the failure to reach 2 percent could have unanchored those expectations?	23.0	97.0
201604	2824	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Inflation has gone from below 2 percent to well above 2 percent before.	23.0	81.0
201604	2825	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	We had this experience in 2003 and 2004, when we thought it was below 1, and within 12 months, it was close to 3, and we were off to the races and ended up with 2.9 percent inflation.	23.0	81.0
201604	2826	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Right.	23.0	97.0
201604	2827	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	But, with the exception of that, for almost all of the period from the financial crisis until today?	23.0	97.0
201604	2828	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Was I worried about downside risk?	23.0	81.0
201604	2829	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Yes.	23.0	97.0
201604	2830	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	Sure.	23.0	81.0
201604	2831	2016-04-27	meeting	LACKER	We all were.	23.0	81.0
201604	2832	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Okay.	23.0	97.0
201604	2833	2016-04-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	23.0	97.0
201604	2834	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Two-hander—President Bullard.	23.0	65.0
201604	2835	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Madam Chair, Brexit has been brought up, and it’s a vote on a particular day.	23.0	94.0
201604	2836	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Is it feasible to think about calling a meeting after the Brexit vote and making the decision at that point?	23.0	94.0
201604	2837	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	As an intermeeting move?	23.0	65.0
201604	2838	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Intermeeting, yes.	23.0	94.0
201604	2839	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	If we felt like we wanted to go, but we wanted to see the outcome of the Brexit vote, then you could have a meeting after the Brexit vote.	23.0	94.0
201604	2840	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Is that something to consider?	23.0	94.0
201604	2841	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	My mind isn’t closed on it, but it would suggest a level of urgency.	23.0	65.0
201604	2842	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	We will be meeting in July and have an opportunity then.	23.0	65.0
201604	2843	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	I don’t quite know what message it would send that we felt it was utterly urgent to have an intermeeting move.	23.0	65.0
201604	2844	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	But it’s obviously not impossible.	23.0	65.0
201604	2845	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	23.0	94.0
201604	2846	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	23.0	94.0
201604	2847	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23.0	65.0
201604	2848	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	It’s your turn.	23.0	65.0
201604	2849	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Oh.	23.0	94.0
201604	2850	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I guess I didn’t need this two-hander.	23.0	94.0
201604	2851	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	You two-handed yourself.	23.0	104.0
201604	2852	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	It’s illegal.	23.0	104.0
201604	2853	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	[Laughter]	23.0	104.0
201604	2854	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I didn’t know I was violating the rules.	23.0	94.0
201604	2855	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201604	2856	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I support alternative B for today.	23.0	94.0
201604	2857	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	My remarks are concentrated on the June meeting.	23.0	94.0
201604	2858	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think we’re in poor position for June even though many around the table have penciled in an increase in the policy rate at that meeting.	23.0	94.0
201604	2859	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Financial markets at this juncture are putting only a 20 percent probability on a move.	23.0	94.0
201604	2860	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	That implies a substantial uphill climb in the next six weeks or so in Federal Reserve communication.	23.0	94.0
201604	2861	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The data are running against a move as of today, the trade report this morning notwithstanding.	23.0	94.0
201604	2862	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	My view is that if we do not move in June, our normalization program will be paralyzed and our credibility on this issue will be significantly damaged.	23.0	94.0
201604	2863	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The conclusion of financial markets may be “Do not listen to the Fed.”	23.0	94.0
201604	2864	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	This may make the FOMC policy less effective in the future.	23.0	94.0
201604	2865	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	At the June meeting, we will be 18 months past the end of QE in the United States.	23.0	94.0
201604	2866	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	During that period, we will have raised the policy rate once, and just 25 basis points.	23.0	94.0
201604	2867	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	We have no current plans to reduce the size of the balance sheet.	23.0	94.0
201604	2868	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I do not think it is meaningful to say that we are normalizing interest rates at a pace of 25 basis points per year, which is what we would likely be doing if we do not move in June.	23.0	94.0
201604	2869	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	This sort of pace is so slow as to be essentially meaningless.	23.0	94.0
201604	2870	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	It would take four years to raise the policy rate 100 basis points at that pace.	23.0	94.0
201604	2871	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	This pace is also well outside the historical experience on which our econometric estimates of the effects of monetary policy are based.	23.0	94.0
201604	2872	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think it is very awkward for the Committee to present an upward-sloping median policy rate dot plot to the public but then constantly cite downside risks to the US economy.	23.0	94.0
201604	2873	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	In the past, if the Committee was thinking about raising the policy rate in the future, it was because upside risks existed, which, if the Committee did not react to them in an appropriate way, could lead to mandate-inconsistent outcomes.	23.0	94.0
201604	2874	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	This seems to me to be one element of our current policy that is causing considerable confusion in global financial markets.	23.0	94.0
201604	2875	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	In short, I think we need a plan.	23.0	94.0
201604	2876	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	We need to change our messaging to better fit the situation in which we find ourselves.	23.0	94.0
201604	2877	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	An advantage of changing our messaging is that we could get in much better sync with financial market expectations and therefore cause less turmoil as we try to react to macroeconomic developments appropriately.	23.0	94.0
201604	2878	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	In particular, I think our dot plot from December, combined with a weak spate of data in January and February, caused a lot of consternation internationally, and the method that I’m suggesting would help us get out of that kind of a loop.	23.0	94.0
201604	2879	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	My goal would be to get out of the box of projecting rate increases in the SEP, which can be interpreted as quasi commitments, and simultaneously citing downside risks, including global events, slower productivity growth, or low inflation expectations.	23.0	94.0
201604	2880	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’m just putting this on the table as a suggestion, one part of which would be to eliminate the portion of the dot plot that gives forward guidance on the policy rate.	23.0	94.0
201604	2881	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is causing more problems than it’s solving.	23.0	94.0
201604	2882	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	It is essentially announcing a relatively hawkish policy in a situation in which the Committee may well not be all that hawkish.	23.0	94.0
201604	2883	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	This would force markets to pay more attention to the data and less attention to the dot plot.	23.0	94.0
201604	2884	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	They wouldn’t have a dot plot to look at, I guess.	23.0	94.0
201604	2885	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Because we are now off the lower bound, we could use the idea that the policy rate could go up or down in the future.	23.0	94.0
201604	2886	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Communication could emphasize that, in light of all we know today, the policy rate is exactly the right level that the Committee intends it to be for today.	23.0	94.0
201604	2887	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	A statement on risks would then emphasize whether the Committee saw the next move as more likely to be up or down.	23.0	94.0
201604	2888	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	We could stress that if inflation develops, we will raise the policy rate commensurately.	23.0	94.0
201604	2889	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	This would be more consistent with how the Committee has behaved in the past and how the Committee has used the statement of risks in the past.	23.0	94.0
201604	2890	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	If we adopted this approach, we could still normalize in about the same way that we currently expect, but without constantly sending out the hawkish signal that comes out of the upward-sloping SEP median.	23.0	94.0
201604	2891	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	We could also do so in a way that is more consistent with the historical practice of the Committee.	23.0	94.0
201604	2892	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	We could get rid of the dynamic that announces a relatively hawkish policy for the period ahead through the dot plot but tempers that policy by citing downside risks in speeches and Committee communications.	23.0	94.0
201604	2893	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The risks statement would become something closer to what it was historically.	23.0	94.0
201604	2894	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	The bottom line is, I think the Committee is at substantial risk for the June meeting, and better messaging would possibly be very helpful for managing US monetary policy.	23.0	94.0
201604	2895	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	We would very much like to, I think, better align policymaker expectations with market expectations.	23.0	94.0
201604	2896	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	My suggested changes might be helpful in this regard, and perhaps we could think about them in the next several weeks.	23.0	94.0
201604	2897	2016-04-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201604	2898	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201604	2899	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23.0	65.0
201604	2900	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201604	2901	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I support the policy recommendation in alternative B and the statement as written.	23.0	88.0
201604	2902	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Coming out of the March meeting, my position was that the April meeting should be kept alive for a rate move if the incoming data proved to be largely confirming of a beginning-of-the- year real-side outlook of moderate economic growth between 2 and 2½ percent, provided that growth momentum was accompanied by continuing strength in labor reports and evidence of inflation firming.	23.0	88.0
201604	2903	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The economic growth signals have not been confirming that outlook, although the employment and inflation data have mostly cooperated.	23.0	88.0
201604	2904	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	So I have backed off any inclination to move at this meeting.	23.0	88.0
201604	2905	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I advocate a wait-and-see posture.	23.0	88.0
201604	2906	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I believe June ought to remain a live option, and I’m satisfied that the language in alternative B adequately preserves that option.	23.0	88.0
201604	2907	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Unfortunately, as the data calendar presented in Bill Wascher’s presentation yesterday shows, there will not be a lot of information on hand on second-quarter economic growth by the June meeting.	23.0	88.0
201604	2908	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	And, to state the obvious, as everyone has mentioned, the pending Brexit vote has the potential to be a very significant event.	23.0	88.0
201604	2909	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	So I think we could be facing ambiguous circumstances again in June.	23.0	88.0
201604	2910	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	If progress toward the Committee’s mandated objectives moves along with even soft, below-forecast economic growth—below 2 percent—and otherwise mixed incoming data, policy-setting in conditions of ambiguity may be our curse for a good while.	23.0	88.0
201604	2911	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Circumstances may force the Committee to more explicitly explain its reaction function as regards normalization and, as a participant, may force the question of my preferred policy-setting decision framework.	23.0	88.0
201604	2912	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The approach I expect to apply is to test my baseline assumptions against accumulated incoming data, looking for evidence that invalidates those assumptions.	23.0	88.0
201604	2913	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	This is a lower bar than requiring an improved and broadly affirmative constellation of data that sounds the all-clear.	23.0	88.0
201604	2914	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m concerned we will always have some reason not to act, and, although I perceive little potential cost associated with a patient, wait-and-see posture, at this moment I doubt we can rely on such conditions indefinitely.	23.0	88.0
201604	2915	2016-04-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201604	2916	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201604	2917	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	23.0	65.0
201604	2918	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	111.0
201604	2919	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I support alternative B, and I share the Tealbook baseline outlook of continuing employment gains and inflation slowly picking up.	23.0	111.0
201604	2920	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Under that outlook, a very gradual path for the federal funds rate seems appropriate.	23.0	111.0
201604	2921	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	As I said in March, I believe that, while inflation remains low, it’s appropriate for the Committee to keep rates low to support continued job creation, especially as recent job gains reflect rising labor force participation rather than a falling unemployment rate.	23.0	111.0
201604	2922	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	When I think about June, I think about two communication challenges.	23.0	111.0
201604	2923	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	One is changing market expectations in advance of such a move; as you said, you have a speech coming up when you can do that.	23.0	111.0
201604	2924	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The second communications challenge is really the data.	23.0	111.0
201604	2925	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We’ve said that we’re data dependent, and if, between now and June, we haven’t seen a move in inflation or inflation expectations and if we haven’t seen a move in wages or in the headline unemployment rate, how do we explain the move?	23.0	111.0
201604	2926	2016-04-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I struggle with being able to point to data in any of our key indicators that would justify the move, so that’s something I’d like us to think about.	23.0	111.0
201604	2927	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201604	2928	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23.0	65.0
201604	2929	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201604	2930	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	I support alternative B.	23.0	91.0
201604	2931	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Both my December and March SEP paths assumed two funds rate increases sometime in 2016.	23.0	91.0
201604	2932	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	I’m sticking with that assessment today.	23.0	91.0
201604	2933	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	My outlook for economic growth over the remainder of the year is basically on track with my earlier forecasts.	23.0	91.0
201604	2934	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Here the improvement in financial conditions we’ve experienced since midwinter is an important factor.	23.0	91.0
201604	2935	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Otherwise, I would have carried some of the first-quarter weakness into my outlook for the remainder of the year.	23.0	91.0
201604	2936	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	The incoming data have also led me to stick with my March inflation forecast, which had the four-quarter change in core PCE prices in the fourth quarter of 2016 at 1.6 percent.	23.0	91.0
201604	2937	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	I do not think, however, that one of those two policy moves should occur today.	23.0	91.0
201604	2938	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	First, I prefer waiting until the incoming data on spending corroborate my forecast of recovering economic growth.	23.0	91.0
201604	2939	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Second, the improvement in financial conditions supporting my forecast is due in good part to the more accommodative policy rate path that markets began to expect during the winter and that we delivered on in the March SEP.	23.0	91.0
201604	2940	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	We should not hazard undoing that welcome support, especially at a time when the risks to both the economic outlook and inflation forecasts are tilted to the downside and our policy rate is still close to the effective lower bound.	23.0	91.0
201604	2941	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	For today, I believe alternative B serves us well, and I support it as written.	23.0	91.0
201604	2942	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	It clearly communicates our assessment of appropriate policy, in view of the outlook and surrounding risks, for achieving our dual-mandate objectives.	23.0	91.0
201604	2943	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Furthermore, in view of the uncertainties and risks, at the moment I think we should be agnostic about when the next rate hike is likely to take place.	23.0	91.0
201604	2944	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Alternative B as written neither commits us to a move soon nor takes June off the table, and I think that’s a good place to be.	23.0	91.0
201604	2945	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Because President Bullard mentioned his lack of support for the dot plot, I just want to register that I support the dot plot very strongly.	23.0	91.0
201604	2946	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Without it, I think our statement would need to convey a much better, stronger consensus view of our policy expectations, and that’s historically been difficult to accomplish within our statement.	23.0	91.0
201604	2947	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	The dot plot adds more information, all of this at a time when the ultimate renormalization would be on the order of 250 to 300 basis points eventually.	23.0	91.0
201604	2948	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	I think that’s tough.	23.0	91.0
201604	2949	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	If we took it away, we’d have to replace it with something, and, in the past, we’ve talked about constructing a consensus forecast.	23.0	91.0
201604	2950	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	I’m not optimistic about our ability to deliver on that, but it would be an alternative.	23.0	91.0
201604	2951	2016-04-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201604	2952	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201604	2953	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	23.0	65.0
201604	2954	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201604	2955	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I support alternative B.	23.0	110.0
201604	2956	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Between now and the next meeting, I’m hoping to see evidence—jobs growth, PCE data, and other measures—that is more consistent with my GDP forecast of approximately 2 percent growth for 2016.	23.0	110.0
201604	2957	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I do believe we will see that improvement, in light of the strength of the consumer and the strong jobs market, but time will tell.	23.0	110.0
201604	2958	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	While I remain concerned about risks outside the United States, I also believe that the FOMC’s slowing of its expected pace of rate increases as well as firming prices of oil have helped stabilize financial conditions and have helped ease the adjustment process that’s going on in China and other non-US countries.	23.0	110.0
201604	2959	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Assuming I see firming economic data, I will likely be advocating that we remove some amount of accommodation at our June meeting.	23.0	110.0
201604	2960	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And I believe that if we see that firming in incoming data—even though we won’t have a GDP estimate—market expectations of a June move will rise.	23.0	110.0
201604	2961	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So I think the data may, to some extent, help resolve that issue.	23.0	110.0
201604	2962	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I would like to see any removal of accommodation be slow, gradual, and cautious.	23.0	110.0
201604	2963	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In that regard, I would like to have the option of waiting more than a quarter to observe the effects of our next move.	23.0	110.0
201604	2964	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So, to me, moving in June is attractive because it would give us the time needed to be patient and assess the effect of that move, and I think it would give us greater options with regard to moving at least a second time this year.	23.0	110.0
201604	2965	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In my view, waiting beyond June reduces our options.	23.0	110.0
201604	2966	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m also mindful that the world is very different—to me, at least—than it was 10 years ago, particularly because of key secular forces, which I’ve talked a lot about:  overcapacity globally, aging demographics, and high levels of debt to GDP in advanced economies, which, all things being equal, tend to put downward pressure on potential GDP growth and inflation.	23.0	110.0
201604	2967	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In a world that is more interconnected than we had even 10 years ago, the transmission of these forces affects the US economy and has a greater potential to spill over into overall financial conditions.	23.0	110.0
201604	2968	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	To me, all of that reinforces the desire to have a slow, gradual, and cautious removal of accommodation.	23.0	110.0
201604	2969	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	That said, I remind myself that there is a cost to excessive accommodation.	23.0	110.0
201604	2970	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It hurts savers.	23.0	110.0
201604	2971	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It creates distortions in investment decisions, some of which we talked about yesterday.	23.0	110.0
201604	2972	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It affects asset allocation and hiring decisions.	23.0	110.0
201604	2973	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And some of these imbalances can be painful to absorb and unwind and are easier to recognize in hindsight.	23.0	110.0
201604	2974	2016-04-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201604	2975	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201604	2976	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	23.0	65.0
201604	2977	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201604	2978	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	In view of the recent near-term weakness in economic activity, I am supportive of no change in the funds rate at this meeting.	23.0	999.0
201604	2979	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Inflation remains below target, and some patience is called for as more data allow us to better assess whether current economic weakness is largely transitory, perhaps partly driven by residual seasonality in the data, as mentioned yesterday.	23.0	999.0
201604	2980	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	But as I noted yesterday as well, my modal outlook is for economic activity to grow slightly above trend and for inflation to return to target relatively quickly.	23.0	999.0
201604	2981	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	If this outcome transpires, then it will be appropriate to continue on the path toward normalization at the June meeting.	23.0	999.0
201604	2982	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Doing anything else would most likely require an entirely new narrative.	23.0	999.0
201604	2983	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	However, if market probabilities of a June increase do not rise from their exceptionally low levels, then raising rates in June will be made unnecessarily difficult.	23.0	999.0
201604	2984	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Thus, the language in the statement is of paramount importance, and I am skeptical that the language in alternative B is up to the task.	23.0	999.0
201604	2985	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	I prefer paragraphs 1 and 2 in alternative C, which give a more upbeat view of the economy.	23.0	999.0
201604	2986	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	That said, we will have significant amounts of new data between today and the June meeting, and there are other avenues of communication that can and should be used to influence market sentiment.	23.0	999.0
201604	2987	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	So I can support alternative B as written for today.	23.0	999.0
201604	2988	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Monetary policy is quite accommodative and, as emphasized in the Tealbook, will still be accommodative in the event of a few future rate hikes.	23.0	999.0
201604	2989	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	If economic data come in much weaker than I envision or if inflation retreats from its firming trend, then, of course, no rate hike will be called for.	23.0	999.0
201604	2990	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	But in order for monetary policy to normalize in a predictable and coherent way, all meetings must be “live.”	23.0	999.0
201604	2991	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	And our statement language must ensure that this is the case.	23.0	999.0
201604	2992	2016-04-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201604	2993	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201604	2994	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23.0	65.0
201604	2995	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201604	2996	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	The unemployment part of our mandate has largely been met, and inflation is gradually moving toward our goal of 2 percent.	23.0	999.0
201604	2997	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	In my view, risks to the outlook are roughly balanced.	23.0	999.0
201604	2998	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Although economic growth remained sluggish in the first quarter, the signals from the labor market continue to be quite strong, and those have proven to be more reliable as the economy has continued to be resilient through financial market volatility, the drop in oil prices, the higher dollar, and relatively weak economic growth abroad.	23.0	999.0
201604	2999	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	With that as backdrop, I believe it’s appropriate for the federal funds rate to continue to be on a gradual upward path.	23.0	999.0
201604	3000	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Even considering that estimates of the short-run equilibrium real rate are still very low, monetary policy is very accommodative, and I expect it to remain accommodative for some time because the anticipated pace of normalization is slow.	23.0	999.0
201604	3001	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Thus, policy will continue to provide some insurance against downside risks even as we implement gradual reductions in the level of accommodation to provide some insurance against the upside risks.	23.0	999.0
201604	3002	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	I do not think the FOMC is “behind the curve,” but while there are risks associated with moving too soon, there are also risks associated with waiting too long, on account of the lags with which monetary policy affects the economy.	23.0	999.0
201604	3003	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	If we wait until every piece of data lines up or all uncertainty is resolved, then we will surely have waited too long.	23.0	999.0
201604	3004	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	We should have the courage to act when the economic outlook calls for it, as I believe it currently does.	23.0	999.0
201604	3005	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	And if the economy evolves in an unexpected way, we should have the courage to change course if necessary.	23.0	999.0
201604	3006	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	I view that as essentially the meaning of running policy in a data- dependent way.	23.0	999.0
201604	3007	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Data dependency was meant to give us flexibility so that we could react appropriately to evolving economic conditions, but, in reality, I think it has actually come to constrain our flexibility.	23.0	999.0
201604	3008	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	It hasn’t given the public enough indication of our own reaction function.	23.0	999.0
201604	3009	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	It has not helped the public understand the economic considerations that will drive our policy decisions this year and next.	23.0	999.0
201604	3010	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	At the same time, we don’t want to act in a way that surprises the public.	23.0	999.0
201604	3011	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Thus, we’re at an impasse.	23.0	999.0
201604	3012	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	The public is not expecting us to raise rates at this meeting, and the policy rate path that market participants currently anticipate is quite a bit shallower than the path we’ve indicated in the March SEP as most likely to be appropriate.	23.0	999.0
201604	3013	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	As long as we are ineffective in conveying our interpretation of economic developments and the outlook, the market’s policy expectations need not align with ours.	23.0	999.0
201604	3014	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	If we are, then, unwilling to act in such a situation, we have essentially ratified the market participants’ expectations and not our own.	23.0	999.0
201604	3015	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	I can go along with alternative B today because we haven’t prepared the public for anything else, but I would like us to be in a position to raise rates in June because of the actual progress we’ve made on our dual-mandate goals.	23.0	999.0
201604	3016	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	That means we need to be working on our message throughout the intermeeting period.	23.0	999.0
201604	3017	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Conditional on the economic outlook, my operating assumption is that we will likely raise the funds rate in June, and only if we get some negative surprises would we back off from that.	23.0	999.0
201604	3018	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	We’ll need to start preparing the public.	23.0	999.0
201604	3019	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Unfortunately, I don’t think today’s statement is going to be much of a help.	23.0	999.0
201604	3020	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Indeed, I think it could very well be read as indicating a lower probability of a rate increase in June, because the statement is silent on whether we view risks as having receded since March and because the tone of paragraph 1, in which most of the changes appear, could be read more negatively than intended.	23.0	999.0
201604	3021	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	I appreciate the Chair making a speech the day before the next blackout period, but I hope the Chair will take on the burden of speaking publicly throughout the intermeeting period to ensure that we do indeed have the flexibility to raise rates in June should the economy evolve as expected.	23.0	999.0
201604	3022	2016-04-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201604	3023	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201604	3024	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23.0	65.0
201604	3025	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	103.0
201604	3026	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Since the March meeting, potential downside risks have softened or shifted but, of course, not entirely disappeared.	23.0	103.0
201604	3027	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	With financial conditions calmer, however, my modal outlook is unchanged from our March meeting, and I see current economic outcomes as well aligned with our mandated objectives.	23.0	103.0
201604	3028	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Labor markets are near maximum employment.	23.0	103.0
201604	3029	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Prices are rising at a rate commensurate with the economy’s longer-run potential.	23.0	103.0
201604	3030	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	In this context, I see economic fundamentals consistent with a 25 basis point rate increase at this meeting and consistent with a gradual and patient approach.	23.0	103.0
201604	3031	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	My other concern with alternative B is that it seems likely to be read as placing more weight on transitory financial and economic factors and too little weight on our modal outlook for economic growth, employment, and inflation.	23.0	103.0
201604	3032	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	It is increasingly unclear what framework will guide our policy decisions.	23.0	103.0
201604	3033	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Policy rules appear to be carrying little, if any, weight.	23.0	103.0
201604	3034	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Tealbook B shows we are likely to be well behind even the prescriptions from the inertial Taylor (1999) rule for some time.	23.0	103.0
201604	3035	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	However, many frameworks suggest that the equilibrium real rate is lower, though we seem reluctant to adjust the stance of policy in response to changes in the equilibrium real rate.	23.0	103.0
201604	3036	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	For example, Tealbook B shows that the current real federal funds rate has fallen, while the Tealbook-consistent measure of r* has risen.	23.0	103.0
201604	3037	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	The widening spread suggests that monetary policy has become more accommodative since the March FOMC meeting during a period when conditions might suggest less accommodation would be appropriate.	23.0	103.0
201604	3038	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	In fact, the spread between the Tealbook-consistent measure of r* and the current real federal funds rate is at the widest level at any point, according to my staff’s look at Tealbooks, over at least the past 10 years.	23.0	103.0
201604	3039	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, recalling the January 2015 Board staff memo that compared the “early and gradual” approach to normalization with the “late and steep” approach, it is striking to look at the distribution of the funds rate under these two strategies.	23.0	103.0
201604	3040	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Our current policy setting is below or on the boundary of the lower bound of the 90 percent confidence intervals in either case.	23.0	103.0
201604	3041	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Yet current inflation and unemployment are well inside the 70 percent confidence bands.	23.0	103.0
201604	3042	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Certainly, the discrepancy reflects concerns about downside risks, although risks were viewed as balanced last December at liftoff.	23.0	103.0
201604	3043	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, the current Tealbook offers another framework, one that attaches asymmetric losses to the unemployment rate gap.	23.0	103.0
201604	3044	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	This approach takes the projected path closer to what is implied by the current SEP projections but still suggests a slightly faster removal of accommodation.	23.0	103.0
201604	3045	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Essentially, none of the frameworks align with our policy settings.	23.0	103.0
201604	3046	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	As we approach the June meeting, I would like to see our policy choices begin to align with such decisionmaking frameworks more closely.	23.0	103.0
201604	3047	2016-04-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	23.0	103.0
201604	3048	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201604	3049	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23.0	65.0
201604	3050	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	102.0
201604	3051	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I support alternative B as written.	23.0	102.0
201604	3052	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The statement sets us up to react appropriately at the upcoming meetings to the incoming data on labor markets, economic activity, and inflation.	23.0	102.0
201604	3053	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Since our March meeting, concerns about global economic and financial developments have ebbed.	23.0	102.0
201604	3054	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Therefore, I think it’s appropriate that paragraph 2 no longer puts a spotlight on these as specific sources of risks.	23.0	102.0
201604	3055	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, as we think about future policy, changes in the outlook for inflation are particularly important because we’re already essentially at or very near our full employment goal.	23.0	102.0
201604	3056	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Alternative B correctly emphasizes that we’ll closely monitor both inflation and global developments.	23.0	102.0
201604	3057	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I recently looked back at my forecast and the Tealbook’s forecast from a year ago, April 2015.	23.0	102.0
201604	3058	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	For both core inflation and unemployment, the economy is currently very close to the path that we forecast a year ago.	23.0	102.0
201604	3059	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, the main miss is core inflation over the past year, and, in the current quarter, it’s been just a tad stronger than expected a year ago.	23.0	102.0
201604	3060	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The fact that the expansion remains on track gives me confidence that we can and should soon make another gradual move to normalize the federal funds rate.	23.0	102.0
201604	3061	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In addition, there are potential risks to waiting too long, as our discussion yesterday of monetary policy and financial stability highlighted.	23.0	102.0
201604	3062	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In light of these considerations, I like to think ahead about the statement language that may be used when we raise rates.	23.0	102.0
201604	3063	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Alternative C is a good starting point.	23.0	102.0
201604	3064	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	One concern, though, is that paragraph 2 of alternative C mentions the balance of risks for economic activity and the labor market but not for inflation.	23.0	102.0
201604	3065	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It would be good to emphasize the risks to both of our mandate goals, and that’s easily remedied by moving the risk assessment to the end of paragraph 2 and then being symmetric about the two parts of the mandate.	23.0	102.0
201604	3066	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	For example, we might say, “The Committee sees the risks to its outlook for both economic activity and inflation as nearly balanced but is monitoring inflation indicators and global economic and financial market developments closely.”	23.0	102.0
201604	3067	2016-04-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23.0	102.0
201604	3068	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201604	3069	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23.0	65.0
201604	3070	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201604	3071	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	I will support alternative B, and I support the statement as written.	23.0	104.0
201604	3072	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	My base case is that we should proceed with a gradual pace of interest rate increases, including probably two increases this year, provided that the economy continues on its projected path.	23.0	104.0
201604	3073	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	As for June, if we have two more months of continued labor market progress and some indication of a brighter picture on spending, then I could support another rate increase as soon as June.	23.0	104.0
201604	3074	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	I have to say that, sitting here today, the question of whether to move in June strikes me as a particularly tricky one for two reasons.	23.0	104.0
201604	3075	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	First, US and global financial conditions are significantly improved since early February, and that is due, in large part, to the perceived shift in US monetary policy, which was validated by the March SEP.	23.0	104.0
201604	3076	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	I would like to see things come together for an increase in June.	23.0	104.0
201604	3077	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	I’m not at all certain that they will.	23.0	104.0
201604	3078	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	And that’s partly because of the data that are incoming, as President Lockhart indicated.	23.0	104.0
201604	3079	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	The second thing is Brexit.	23.0	104.0
201604	3080	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	There was a lot of discussion on it yesterday and some today.	23.0	104.0
201604	3081	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	The June meeting ends on June 15, eight days before the Brexit vote.	23.0	104.0
201604	3082	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	As of June 15, the result of the Brexit vote may or may not be in serious doubt, and markets may or may not be in turmoil over that.	23.0	104.0
201604	3083	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	So I’m just saying I can imagine circumstances in which I would think it risky to proceed with another rate increase, and I can also imagine circumstances in which it might be safe, assuming the data also justify it.	23.0	104.0
201604	3084	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	I would not want to tighten going into a situation in which it’s highly uncertain what’s going to happen.	23.0	104.0
201604	3085	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	I think we don’t need to be in that kind of a hurry.	23.0	104.0
201604	3086	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	So I’ll leave it there.	23.0	104.0
201604	3087	2016-04-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201604	3088	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201604	3089	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23.0	65.0
201604	3090	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201604	3091	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	I support alternative B.	23.0	108.0
201604	3092	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	The probability that we will raise the interest rate in our June meeting is likely lower today than the parallel probability for a December 2015 increase was at our October 2015 meeting.	23.0	108.0
201604	3093	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	I regard today’s probability as somewhere around 40 percent.	23.0	108.0
201604	3094	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Obviously, our decision on June 15 will depend on what happens between now and then and on our expectations of the development of the US economy and the global economy in the months and years following June 15, 2016.	23.0	108.0
201604	3095	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Our decision will depend, to a considerable extent, on the conclusions we will have reached by then about economic growth in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year and on the implications of those conclusions for the growth of the economy in the remaining three quarters of this year.	23.0	108.0
201604	3096	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	And that conclusion will depend, to a considerable extent, on whether the labor market continues to strengthen.	23.0	108.0
201604	3097	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Before our next meeting we will receive two employment reports, on May 6 and on June 3.	23.0	108.0
201604	3098	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	The probability that we will want to raise the rate seven weeks from now will be higher if these reports confirm the basic dilemma we’ve had to deal with for well over a year—that the labor market is strong, while economic growth is disappointing.	23.0	108.0
201604	3099	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	I continue to go with the advice to focus on the labor market, which I was given soon after arriving here.	23.0	108.0
201604	3100	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Of course, there’ll be many other factors that we’ll take into account when we make the next interest rate decision, among them current and expected rates of inflation and wage growth and current and expected exchange rates.	23.0	108.0
201604	3101	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	But there’s no point at this late stage in our discussions in trying to summarize our collective reaction function not only in terms of the arguments that enter our explicit or implicit monetary rule, but also in terms of what determines our beliefs about that rule and about future values of those arguments.	23.0	108.0
201604	3102	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	So, to save time, I’ll conclude by mentioning only two key issues, both of which have been mentioned several times already in this discussion.	23.0	108.0
201604	3103	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	The first is the message we want to send about the probability of our raising the interest rate on June 15.	23.0	108.0
201604	3104	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Probably most of us prefer not to surprise the markets, at least unnecessarily.	23.0	108.0
201604	3105	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	If that is our approach, we need to raise the markets’ estimated probability of an increase in June.	23.0	108.0
201604	3106	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	That could be done both through today’s statement and by messages that we send in the next seven weeks.	23.0	108.0
201604	3107	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	I do not think that alternative B will send the message that I believe conveys the right probability.	23.0	108.0
201604	3108	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	And if our aim is to not create surprises, we should not wait too long to send the message that the probability of an increase in June is well above the 20 percent number we’ve heard several times this week.	23.0	108.0
201604	3109	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	I hope that the statement and, in particular, the minutes will be useful in this regard.	23.0	108.0
201604	3110	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Second, we confront the issue of what to do about the possibility of Brexit, which was discussed yesterday by several people, including in some detail by Vice Chairman Dudley, and again today by others.	23.0	108.0
201604	3111	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	In principle, the way we should handle the Brexit issue seems clear.	23.0	108.0
201604	3112	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	If the odds on Brexit are low on June 15, we should go ahead and make the decision on the interest rate, ignoring the possibility of Brexit.	23.0	108.0
201604	3113	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	If the odds on a “leave”	23.0	108.0
201604	3114	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Brexit vote result are close to or above 50 percent, we should delay our decision on the rate, particularly if the tentative decision would have been to raise the rate, until the July meeting.	23.0	108.0
201604	3115	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	This has one extra advantage.	23.0	108.0
201604	3116	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	That could be the ideal occasion to show that, in practice, all of our meetings are live—that is to say, we really can make an interest rate decision at any meeting.	23.0	108.0
201604	3117	2016-04-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201604	3118	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201604	3119	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23.0	65.0
201604	3120	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201604	3121	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B as written.	23.0	96.0
201604	3122	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we need to acknowledge both the weakness in recent economic activity, which I believe we do in paragraph 1, and the fact that financial conditions have improved so that the downside risks arising from this source have diminished somewhat, and I think the changes in paragraph 2 address this.	23.0	96.0
201604	3123	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Unlike some others, I expect the statement will be viewed as slightly on the “hawky” side, in view of the elimination of the “continue to pose risks” language.	23.0	96.0
201604	3124	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	How much so is difficult to tell.	23.0	96.0
201604	3125	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t read the statement as indicating a bias one way or another about June.	23.0	96.0
201604	3126	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But with the market expectations for June at only about a 20 percent probability, it seems to me this statement, even if it really is not indicating a lean to June, should push the probability up a little bit, and I view that as a good outcome.	23.0	96.0
201604	3127	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Yesterday I discussed the Brexit issue.	23.0	96.0
201604	3128	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m pretty much where Governor Fischer is on that.	23.0	96.0
201604	3129	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that if it’s obvious at the next meeting that we would like to tighten ex Brexit and the probability of Brexit is low, we should just go ahead.	23.0	96.0
201604	3130	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But if the probability of a leave vote is high, then it may very well make sense to wait.	23.0	96.0
201604	3131	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I do think that there is an option to potentially have a very hawky statement in June and then make it clear in the press conference that we’re very close to tightening monetary policy, setting up the expectations that the July meeting would be live.	23.0	96.0
201604	3132	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And I agree with Governor Fischer that tightening in July has some other attractions, because it would eliminate this idea that we can tighten only at press conference meetings.	23.0	96.0
201604	3133	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201604	3134	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201604	3135	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, I think I’ve heard broad-based support for alternative B for today and heard many of you emphasize the importance of communications between now and June.	24.0	65.0
201604	3136	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	And if we see a divergence between what markets think and what views are developing in the Committee, I will be very attuned to try to remedy that.	24.0	65.0
201604	3137	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	For today, let me ask Brian to call for a vote on alternative B as written and the associated directive.	24.0	65.0
201604	3138	2016-04-27	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	24.0	999.0
201604	3139	2016-04-27	meeting	MADIGAN	As you mentioned, this vote will be on the policy statement for alternative B as indicated on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas’s briefing materials and on the directive to the Desk as included in the implementation note on page 10 of those materials.	24.0	999.0
201604	3140	2016-04-27	meeting	MADIGAN	Chair Yellen  Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Brainard  Yes President Bullard  Yes Governor Fischer  Yes President George  No President Mester  Yes Governor Powell  Yes President Rosengren Yes Governor Tarullo  Yes .	24.0	999.0
201604	3141	2016-04-27	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you.	24.0	999.0
201604	3142	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	53.0	65.0
201604	3143	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	53.0	65.0
201604	3144	2016-04-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s a new record.	53.0	96.0
201604	3145	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, it is a record, and while I’m an early eater for lunch [laughter], I think we’re pushing it.	53.0	65.0
201604	3146	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	The date of the next meeting is Tuesday and Wednesday, June 14 and 15.	53.0	65.0
201604	3147	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	Linda Robertson is prepared to give us an update on legislative affairs, and lunch will be available at 11:30 for those of you who want to stay.	53.0	65.0
201604	3148	2016-04-27	meeting	YELLEN	The meeting is adjourned at this point, and Linda is welcome to begin whenever she’d like.	53.0	65.0
201606	0	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Good afternoon, everybody.	50.0	65.0
201606	1	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	As usual, today’s meeting will be in its entirety a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board of Governors.	50.0	65.0
201606	2	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	So I need a motion to close the Board meeting.	50.0	65.0
201606	3	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	50.0	108.0
201606	4	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	50.0	65.0
201606	5	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	As I think almost everyone here knows, Tom Baxter will retire from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in September.	50.0	65.0
201606	6	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	This was to be the last FOMC meeting that he attended, but he recently decided that his to-do list was sufficiently lengthy that, in order to actually retire as planned, he would need to stay in New York to work rather than attend today’s meeting.	50.0	65.0
201606	7	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I think it is entirely appropriate, though, that we recognize him in absentia.	50.0	65.0
201606	8	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Tom’s well- deserved retirement will follow 36 years of service to the New York Bank, at which he has served as general counsel since 1995.	50.0	65.0
201606	9	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Tom also has been deputy general counsel of the FOMC the past two decades, attending 106 regularly scheduled Committee meetings.	50.0	65.0
201606	10	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Tom’s contributions to the work of the Federal Reserve were especially crucial during the recent financial crisis when the Federal Reserve needed to design and implement a broad range of effective lending programs to help support the financial system and the economy, in many cases in a matter of days, if not hours.	50.0	65.0
201606	11	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Tom was at the center of many of those efforts.	50.0	65.0
201606	12	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	We appreciate all that Tom has done for the Federal Reserve, for the New York District, and for the country, and I’m sure that I speak for all of us in wishing him the best in retirement.	50.0	65.0
201606	13	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	And I believe Vice Chairman Dudley would also like to make some remarks about Tom.	50.0	65.0
201606	14	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, my views are very much the same as yours, Madam Chair.	50.0	96.0
201606	15	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I think Tom played a key role in the System throughout his long career.	50.0	96.0
201606	16	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	He will especially be remembered for his leadership at the time of the 9/11 attack and during the financial crisis, figuring out with Scott Alvarez and many others exactly what we legally could do to save the financial system from collapse, and that was not an easy task.	50.0	96.0
201606	17	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, of course, I appreciate the support he has given me during my tenure.	50.0	96.0
201606	18	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	You know, 21 years as general counsel meant that he was serving under three different New York Federal Reserve presidents, and in some ways he’s tracked your own career at the Federal Reserve, Madam Chair, basically being the deputy counsel to the FOMC when you were Governor, when you were president of the San Francisco Fed, Vice Chair, and now the Chair.	50.0	96.0
201606	19	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I imagine that he’s pretty high up in the hierarchy of attending meetings at the Fed—probably not quite in “Don Kohn” territory [laughter], but maybe in the top 10 or 20.	50.0	96.0
201606	20	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I wish he could be here today, but I think it’s important to acknowledge his contributions and wish him all the success in whatever comes his way after his retirement.	50.0	96.0
201606	21	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	And it’s not really a retirement.	50.0	96.0
201606	22	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s a retirement from the Federal Reserve.	50.0	96.0
201606	23	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	The idea that Tom would actually retire [laughter], that’s just not going to happen.	50.0	96.0
201606	24	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	50.0	96.0
201606	25	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	50.0	65.0
201606	26	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Next, I wanted to provide you with a brief update on the long-run framework project.	93.0	65.0
201606	27	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	As Thomas and Simon noted in their March 7 memo to the Committee, the analysis is being conducted by five main work groups.	93.0	65.0
201606	28	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	The first three so-called foundational groups are focusing on lessons from the crisis, the foreign experience, and money markets.	93.0	65.0
201606	29	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	These groups have conducted workshops with academics, market experts, and central bankers, and their work has been presented and reviewed in Systemwide plenary sessions that have been well attended and very productive.	93.0	65.0
201606	30	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	In addition to these foundational groups, two framework groups are conducting analysis, one focused on interest rate targets and operating regimes and another on a range of issues associated with the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.	93.0	65.0
201606	31	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	These framework groups have also held workshops with a range of experts from inside and outside the System.	93.0	65.0
201606	32	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Now, we anticipate that the work of the three foundational groups will be presented to the FOMC at the July meeting and that of the two framework groups at the November meeting.	93.0	65.0
201606	33	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	As background for the July presentation, you will receive summary memos from each of the three foundational work groups early next month, and the research directors will receive several background memos later this month.	93.0	65.0
201606	34	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	At the meeting, staff presentations will review the material provided in the memos, and we will reserve ample time for FOMC participants to ask questions and to offer their views on the key issues raised by the memos and staff presentations.	93.0	65.0
201606	35	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Now, at this time, does anyone have questions or comments about these plans?	93.0	65.0
201606	36	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	93.0	65.0
201606	37	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	93.0	65.0
201606	38	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	The next item, before we turn to our regular agenda items, is that I wanted to update you on our meeting schedule for next year.	50.0	65.0
201606	39	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	As you know, a draft meeting calendar for 2017 was circulated to the Committee earlier this month, and we received no objections from participants.	50.0	65.0
201606	40	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	We had planned to publish the calendar this Friday.	50.0	65.0
201606	41	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Unfortunately, we just learned that a newly scheduled international meeting and its potential knock-on effects on the scheduling of other international meetings will raise a question about the workability of part of the proposed FOMC schedule.	50.0	65.0
201606	42	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	And we are now looking into those complications.	50.0	65.0
201606	43	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Depending on the outcome, we may be able to move ahead with the currently proposed FOMC schedule possibly as soon as this Friday, or, conceivably, we may need to change the date of the March meeting, potentially by moving it either a week earlier or a day later.	50.0	65.0
201606	44	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	And we will get back to you as soon as we possibly can if that proves necessary.	50.0	65.0
201606	45	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Meanwhile, we want to ask that, for now, you reserve on your calendar the dates that have been proposed.	50.0	65.0
201606	46	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Any questions about that?	50.0	65.0
201606	47	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	50.0	65.0
201606	48	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	50.0	65.0
201606	49	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	So we can now turn to the first agenda item, the Desk briefing, and let me turn to Simon to do that.	61.0	65.0
201606	50	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201606	51	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The top-left panel of your first exhibit shows changes in domestic asset prices over various periods this year.	61.0	999.0
201606	52	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	As you can see, the net changes in risk asset prices over the intermeeting period, shown in the final column, were mild compared with the swings experienced through April.	61.0	999.0
201606	53	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	However, the decline in the 10-year Treasury yield was relatively large.	61.0	999.0
201606	54	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In the past few days, “Brexit” concerns have lowered global risk asset prices and created additional safe-haven demand.	61.0	999.0
201606	55	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Recall that, in the previous Desk briefing, I reported that although the FOMC was not viewed as an important factor in sparking the financial turbulence at the start of the year, more-accommodative-than-expected FOMC communication in March was viewed as an important factor in calming markets.	61.0	999.0
201606	56	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In this intermeeting period, market participants were surprised by the less accommodative tone of the April FOMC minutes and related Federal Reserve communications regarding the release, but the asset price impact outside of the movement in short-term rates was relatively subdued.	61.0	999.0
201606	57	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The top-right panel shows the evolution of market-implied expectations of a rate hike occurring at or before the July FOMC meeting, in relation to how expectations evolved ahead of liftoff in December.	61.0	999.0
201606	58	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	As shown by the light blue line, the impression of a less-accommodative stance generated around the time of the release of the April minutes had a sharp effect on the perceived probability of a move at the June or July meetings, one similar in magnitude to the effect of the September 2015 FOMC statement on liftoff expectations, albeit in the opposite direction.	61.0	999.0
201606	59	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	This effect was undone by the much weaker-than-expected May employment report, and the market- and survey-implied probability of a hike happening at this meeting declined to effectively zero.	61.0	999.0
201606	60	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-left panel, the average probability distribution for the federal funds rate at year-end from the Desk surveys was little changed over the period, with the average probability attached to a decrease or no change in the target rate more or less constant.	61.0	999.0
201606	61	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	However, compared with the January survey, views have consolidated a bit in the 51-to-100 basis point bucket, at least in part because of the lack of additional rate hikes to date.	61.0	999.0
201606	62	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The median respondent now views one rate hike by the end of this year as the most likely outcome, down from two hikes in April and three hikes in January.	61.0	999.0
201606	63	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The middle-right panel shows how the survey- and market-implied rate paths through 2018 have shifted over this year.	61.0	999.0
201606	64	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	During the sharp repricing of near-term rate expectations in mid-May, there was little follow-through into the market-implied rate path past 2016, and after the May employment report the market-implied path continued the striking flattening we have seen since the December rate increase.	61.0	999.0
201606	65	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Meanwhile, the survey-implied mean path has remained little changed compared with our January Desk surveys, the earliest surveys using our current probabilistic question format.	61.0	999.0
201606	66	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	On the surface, this difference between the changes in survey expectations and the market-implied path may suggest a further decline in term premiums.	61.0	999.0
201606	67	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	However, the comparison between the aggregate survey-implied mean path and the market-implied path neglects much of the richness in expectations that we glean from the Desk surveys.	61.0	999.0
201606	68	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The bottom-left panel shows individual survey respondents’ 2017 year-end target rate probabilities.	61.0	999.0
201606	69	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Here, red identifies primary dealers and blue signifies market participants.	61.0	999.0
201606	70	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The responses are ordered from lowest to highest mean, and the various shades differentiate respondents from one another.	61.0	999.0
201606	71	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	As you can see, most of the respondents have bimodal distributions for the level of the policy rate, which include a “low rate” mode that, across respondents, mostly lies in the range of negative ¼ to positive ¼ percent, and a “higher rate” mode, which varies substantially across respondents and ranges from about 1 to 3 percent.	61.0	999.0
201606	72	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	When we compare individual density forecasts with the 2017 market-implied expectations for the target rate, we find that quite a few respondents have implied mean expectations that are at or below rates implied by market prices.	61.0	999.0
201606	73	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Thus, it is possible to reconcile the flattening of the path over the first half of the year with a switch in the identity of the marginal investor to one who believes more strongly in the lower-rate model.	61.0	999.0
201606	74	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In this case, the market-implied path would be an accurate reflection of physical expectations for the target rate path without the need to appeal to term premiums.	61.0	999.0
201606	75	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	On the other hand, the fact that so many investors place nonnegligible probability on a return to the effective lower bound is consistent with large negative term premiums in futures markets.	61.0	999.0
201606	76	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	That is, there are few investors who would be prepared to sell a futures contract on the basis of a belief that rates will be considerably higher with substantial probability and many investors who want to hedge against their perceived significant probability of returning to the lower bound.	61.0	999.0
201606	77	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Thus, the futures market will clear at prices that embed negative term premiums.	61.0	999.0
201606	78	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Forward measures of inflation compensation declined notably over the period, as shown in the bottom-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201606	79	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The declines came in spite of a 10 percent increase in spot oil prices, a notable decoupling of the relationship we have highlighted in our briefings over the past year.	61.0	999.0
201606	80	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Market participants have attributed the increase in oil prices to various global supply disruptions.	61.0	999.0
201606	81	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Meanwhile, the declines in longer-dated measures of inflation compensation were reportedly driven by the below-expectations May employment report and the less-accommodative-than-expected FOMC communications regarding the minutes.	61.0	999.0
201606	82	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In a new Desk survey question, we asked respondents to discuss whether the relationship between spot oil and far-forward measures of inflation compensation had changed recently and, if so, why.	61.0	999.0
201606	83	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The responses highlighted that market understanding of the relationship remains tenuous, but a number of respondents took the opportunity to highlight that their view of the Fed’s reaction function had changed over the intermeeting period, as the less accommodative Federal Reserve communications came despite there being no substantive change, in their view, of the economic outlook.	61.0	999.0
201606	84	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	As far-forward inflation compensation in the United States settled near record lows, comparable measures in other advanced economies remained stuck at very low levels, as shown in the top-left panel of your second exhibit.	61.0	999.0
201606	85	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Many market participants continue to point to these measures as a clear indicator of concerns about global growth and the efficacy of monetary policy, particularly in Japan and the euro area, in which monetary easing programs of unprecedented size and scope appear to be having little effect on investors’ confidence in inflation returning to mandate- consistent levels over the longer run.	61.0	999.0
201606	86	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The recent fall in interest rates globally has generally been even more pronounced in longer-dated nominal yields, as shown by the red dots in the top-right panel, as longer-term real interest rates have also declined.	61.0	999.0
201606	87	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	It is important to note that Treasury yields are high relative to G-4 peers, and market participants continue to suggest global portfolio rebalancing out of lower-yielding euro-area and Japanese government bonds into the United States is pressuring domestic rates lower.	61.0	999.0
201606	88	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Thomas will examine the low level of longer-term rates in the United States further in his briefing.	61.0	999.0
201606	89	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Despite record low forward nominal rates that many interpret as signaling heightened concern about the longer-run global growth picture and the efficacy of monetary policy, the middle-left panel shows that near-term equity and interest rate implied volatility, the dark blue and red lines, remained at or below their historical averages and levels reached earlier this year for most of the period, with a recent uptick from Brexit-related concerns.	61.0	999.0
201606	90	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Developed market currency volatility, the light blue line, has spiked recently and is noticeably above its historical average.	61.0	999.0
201606	91	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	As reflected in the middle-right panel, the recent increase in currency implied volatility appears to reflect mostly the repercussions for sterling of the very immediate risk of Brexit.	61.0	999.0
201606	92	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	But even before Brexit came squarely onto investors’ radar screens, there was a meaningful increase in implied volatility on the yen.	61.0	999.0
201606	93	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Investors expect that the pound will depreciate broadly should a vote to leave the EU prevail and believe there could be appreciation pressures on safe-haven currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc.	61.0	999.0
201606	94	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	To date there is little indication these moves would be disorderly.	61.0	999.0
201606	95	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In the past few days there appears to be more impact of Brexit concerns on euro- area asset prices as the referendum date gets closer and polls indicate a very close decision.	61.0	999.0
201606	96	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In view of how close the polls are on the support for the “leave” and “remain” camps, we expect to see volatility increase further in the trading days up to the vote.	61.0	999.0
201606	97	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The bottom-left panel shows a kink in equity-implied volatility in the United Kingdom and Europe around the June 23 referendum date, with levels of implied volatility on the FTSE rising above that seen during the February market turbulence.	61.0	999.0
201606	98	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	By comparison, the implied volatility curve for US equities shows a small kink.	61.0	999.0
201606	99	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The spillover effects of Brexit in the euro area would be expected to be more acute than in the United States due to the tighter links between the UK and euro-area economies and negative implications of the vote for European political cohesion.	61.0	999.0
201606	100	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Shaghil will discuss Brexit further.	61.0	999.0
201606	101	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In stark contrast to market discussion over Brexit, concerns regarding China and its FX policy were not primary points of focus among market participants over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201606	102	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The renminbi depreciated a bit against the US dollar, but unlike earlier in the year, this had little effect on global risk sentiment.	61.0	999.0
201606	103	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The dark blue line in the bottom-right panel shows that the renminbi’s exchange value against the dollar is now roughly back to where it was in January when the market was highly sensitive to the risk of a sudden devaluation of the renminbi.	61.0	999.0
201606	104	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	However, the light blue line shows that the CFETS Index, which represents the renminbi’s effective exchange rate against a basket of 13 currencies, has depreciated by roughly 5 percent year-to- date.	61.0	999.0
201606	105	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	On the other hand, investors continue to have deep concerns about the risk of a sharp slowing in Chinese growth and the ability of China’s highly leveraged financial system to withstand the effects of this slowing.	61.0	999.0
201606	106	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Turning to the top-left panel of your last exhibit, the effective federal funds rate remained near the middle of the target range over the intermeeting period amid typical volumes.	61.0	999.0
201606	107	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Secured rates trended modestly lower, with average GCF and triparty repo rates a few basis points below their prior-period averages.	61.0	999.0
201606	108	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The decline in GC repo rates has largely been ascribed to larger-than-expected cash inflows into the repo market over recent weeks.	61.0	999.0
201606	109	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Despite lower GC repo rates in late May, the volume of overnight triparty repo trades conducted below the ON RRP offering rate remained very low, as shown in the top-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201606	110	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Further, the slight increase in activity below the overnight RRP rate—less than 1 percent of total volume over the second half of May—was composed almost entirely of trades by entities that do not have direct access to the overnight RRP, shown as the dark blue area in the panel, and activity below the overnight RRP rate from our counterparties remained negligible.	61.0	999.0
201606	111	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Looking ahead, there is heightened attention on the potential consequences of SEC money market reform implementation later this year.	61.0	999.0
201606	112	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Market participants continue to highlight the possibility of large and rapid shifts in money fund investor allocations in response to the October 14 deadline, which could result in volatility in short-term interest rate markets and increased usage of the overnight RRP facility.	61.0	999.0
201606	113	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-left panel, a recent survey of money market fund complexes conducted by the Desk found that respondents expected $410 billion, on average, to flow out of prime funds between now and the October effective date of the SEC reforms, with the bulk of these outflows expected to occur in August and September.	61.0	999.0
201606	114	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Prime funds are shortening maturities in anticipation of these redemptions, and it is possible that the private sector will be unable to increase its balance sheet offered to prime funds on an overnight basis to meet this increase in demand.	61.0	999.0
201606	115	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	This dynamic could display some parallels with financial reporting dates, when less private-sector balance sheet is available for prime fund investment and overnight RRP usage increases.	61.0	999.0
201606	116	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Also, like we see with financial reporting dates, we would anticipate such increased usage from this shortening in maturities of prime funds to be temporary until they have better insight about the size of outflows.	61.0	999.0
201606	117	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	On the other hand, if the outflows are as large as expected, the shift itself may have both temporary and permanent effects on money markets and overnight RRP usage.	61.0	999.0
201606	118	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The survey found that 80 percent of anticipated investor outflows, or around $320 billion, were expected to move into government funds, with the remainder moving to a combination of bank deposits and short-term investment vehicles falling beyond the scope of the SEC money market fund reform initiative.	61.0	999.0
201606	119	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Respondents were also asked how they expected inflows to government funds to be allocated, given a choice of holding securities outright, engaging in repo, or placing funds in Federal Reserve RRPs.	61.0	999.0
201606	120	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The responses indicate that usage of the ON RRP facility is expected to increase by approximately $90 billion.	61.0	999.0
201606	121	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Market participants note a high level of uncertainty regarding their views on the potential magnitude of reallocation to Federal Reserve RRP in the run-up to the October conversion date and whether such flows would be permanent or temporary.	61.0	999.0
201606	122	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	While a number of firms expressed a preference for reallocating funds to the private repo market as opposed to RRPs with the Fed, they see their decisions as highly dependent on the pace of outflows and the availability of close substitutes with higher rates like Treasury bills or private market triparty repo.	61.0	999.0
201606	123	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In addition to the uncertainty regarding what instruments the outflows from prime funds will end up in, we also do not know how the scale of individual prime and government funds will be affected by these substantial changes in the money fund industry.	61.0	999.0
201606	124	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	For example, we could see a number of firms that are currently counterparties fall below the $5 billion requirement to be an RRP counterparty or growth in smaller funds with assets under management below the $5 billion requirement as funds try to specialize to specific investor needs.	61.0	999.0
201606	125	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	This additional cash outside the Fed’s counterparty system could lead to an increased instance of repo trading below the overnight RRP offering rate.	61.0	999.0
201606	126	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	For now, usage of the overnight RRP facility, shown in the middle-right panel, has remained below levels seen in early 2016, a trend that continues to be associated with increased availability of private-sector balance sheet for repo.	61.0	999.0
201606	127	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Daily average overnight triparty repo volumes between dealers and customers have remained elevated, reaching multiyear highs of nearly $300 billion in mid-May.	61.0	999.0
201606	128	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Around the time of the April FOMC meeting, we understood the principal driver of the elevated volumes to be increased need for financing on the part of dealers due primarily to elevated foreign central bank reserves sales and Treasury bill supply.	61.0	999.0
201606	129	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	However, Treasury GC repo volumes have continued to increase through the second quarter of 2016, despite evidence of a decline in dealers’ financing needs from slowing reserves sales and substantial declines in Treasury bills outstanding.	61.0	999.0
201606	130	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Recent dealer conversations reveal that some have become more willing to expand their repo books, citing more comfort with balance sheet management amid current regulations, firm- specific factors, and attractive opportunities to intermediate via matched book repo.	61.0	999.0
201606	131	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Turning to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, expectations for the timing of a cessation of some or all reinvestments continued to be pushed out, according to the most recent Desk surveys.	61.0	999.0
201606	132	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	As market participants have over recent months come to expect a slower pace of policy rate normalization, their views on the timing of a change to the reinvestment policy have also shifted out.	61.0	999.0
201606	133	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-left panel, the median expectation has shifted out from approximately one year ahead following the December FOMC to one and a half years ahead in the June surveys.	61.0	999.0
201606	134	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In calendar terms, this corresponds to a one-year delay in the expected timing of a change to reinvestment policy, from December 2016 to December 2017.	61.0	999.0
201606	135	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS continued to proceed smoothly, in accordance with the FOMC’s reinvestment policy.	61.0	999.0
201606	136	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Similar to the prior intermeeting periods, MBS reinvestment purchases continued to be somewhat elevated at around $30 billion per month, largely the result of elevated mortgage prepayment activity associated with the ongoing level of longer-term interest rates.	61.0	999.0
201606	137	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	We continue to execute Treasury rollovers at auction in line with FOMC policy.	61.0	999.0
201606	138	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	While on the topic of reinvestments and rollovers, we would like to update the Committee on staff contingency planning with regard to operations to maintain the size of the Treasury portfolio, summarized in the bottom-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201606	139	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Recall that our current policy is to roll over all maturing proceeds of SOMA Treasury holdings into newly issued securities pro rata at auction.	61.0	999.0
201606	140	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In the event that the Desk is unable to roll over Treasury securities at auction, the size of the SOMA portfolio would decline unless the Desk were to reinvest by purchasing Treasury securities in the secondary market.	61.0	999.0
201606	141	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Under the current directive, my view is that the Desk does not have such authority from the Committee.	61.0	999.0
201606	142	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Inability to roll over could be caused by technical or operational issues or errors related to the auction or rollover process or by a change to the auction calendar.	61.0	999.0
201606	143	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	For example, on February 25 of this year, the seven-year auction was rescheduled for the next day.	61.0	999.0
201606	144	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Although this did not prevent the Desk from rolling over maturing SOMA holdings at auction, a longer delay would have, as the auction would not have settled on the same day that the maturing funds were received.	61.0	999.0
201606	145	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In such a scenario, the Desk, if directed to do so, could make purchases in the secondary market in order to maintain the size of the balance sheet.	61.0	999.0
201606	146	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Much like MBS reinvestments, these purchases would occur over a period of days or weeks so as to ensure smooth market functioning.	61.0	999.0
201606	147	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The Desk will prepare procedures to seek Committee direction through a notation vote and prepare operational procedures for announcing and conducting such secondary market purchases in the unlikely event of a delayed or rescheduled auction in the future.	61.0	999.0
201606	148	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In a continuing effort to enhance our preparedness to act in pursuit of the Committee’s objectives, the staff also conducted a number of small-value operational tests over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201606	149	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	These tests, along with a list of upcoming exercises, are summarized in the appendix of the handout.	61.0	999.0
201606	150	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Finally, as noted in the staff memo circulated to the Committee on Brexit, barring extreme circumstances, we do not see a UK vote to leave the EU causing a breakdown in financial market functioning.	61.0	999.0
201606	151	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Weekly US dollar liquidity auctions are offered by the BOE, BOJ, ECB, and SNB on the understanding that the swaps with the Federal Reserve can be used to fund demand at these auctions.	61.0	999.0
201606	152	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The BOE announced that it stands ready to provide liquidity both in sterling and dollars to a wide range of counterparties through its liquidity framework, and its US dollar auctions are currently scheduled for one day prior and six days following the referendum.	61.0	999.0
201606	153	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	While market-implied measures of US dollar funding stress remain well below levels at which the demand by UK banks at the BOE’s dollar operations would be economical, we are operationally ready for a number of contingencies.	61.0	999.0
201606	154	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	We will update the Committee if there is a significant increase in funding stress, and the Chair would consult the Committee, if possible under the circumstances then prevailing, should a draw on the swap line be requested outside of the regular auction schedule.	61.0	999.0
201606	155	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201606	156	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	That concludes my prepared remarks.	61.0	999.0
201606	157	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	61.0	65.0
201606	158	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Simon or comments?	62.0	65.0
201606	159	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62.0	65.0
201606	160	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201606	161	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, we need a vote to ratify domestic open market operations.	63.0	65.0
201606	162	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Can I have a motion?	63.0	65.0
201606	163	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	63.0	108.0
201606	164	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	63.0	65.0
201606	165	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	63.0	65.0
201606	166	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63.0	65.0
201606	167	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	And I guess we are moving along expeditiously and ready to turn to the economic outlook.	11.0	65.0
201606	168	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Today Jeremy Rudd is going to begin a series of chart-show briefings.	11.0	65.0
201606	169	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201606	170	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Our exhibits are in the packet titled “Material for Staff Presentation on the Economic and Financial Situation.”	11.0	999.0
201606	171	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In table 1 of your first exhibit, I’ve summarized our near-term outlook.	11.0	999.0
201606	172	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Since the April Tealbook the news on economic activity has been mixed, with the recent data on the labor market and business investment coming in worse than expected and the latest readings on consumer spending and net exports surprising us to the upside.	11.0	999.0
201606	173	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	As you can see if you look at line 1 of the table, we continue to expect that real GDP growth will pick up from its unimpressive first-quarter pace.	11.0	999.0
201606	174	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	However, we’ve marked down our near-term projection to reflect our view that there’s now less momentum in hiring and business spending than we had previously thought, and also we now expect residential investment to recover more gradually than we had in April.	11.0	999.0
201606	175	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Given the mixed nature of the incoming data—and how little hard evidence on the current quarter we actually have in hand at this point—it’s worth asking how much confidence we should have in our projection of a second-quarter pickup.	11.0	999.0
201606	176	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	To help answer this question, panel 2 shows second-quarter nowcasts from various models, including the Board’s dynamic factor model—the red line—and some of the nowcasting models that are maintained elsewhere in the System—the blue dashed lines; the staff’s judgmental projection, which is what’s in the Tealbook, is shown as the black line.	11.0	999.0
201606	177	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	As you can see, the 70 percent confidence interval around the Board’s factor model, which is that gray shaded region in the panel, is still nearly 3 percentage points wide.	11.0	999.0
201606	178	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	This morning we received the May retail sales report, which came in stronger than expected, with upward revisions to March and April.	11.0	999.0
201606	179	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The retail sales data, along with other pieces of spending data that we received after the Tealbook closed, leave our first-quarter real GDP growth estimate unrevised at 1.2 percent but imply an upward revision to our second-quarter growth projection of 0.2 percentage point, which puts our Q2 forecast at 2.1 percent.	11.0	999.0
201606	180	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The Board’s factor model was also surprised by these data; as of this morning, its second-quarter GDP growth nowcast is 3¼ percent, which is up about ¼ percentage point from a week ago.	11.0	999.0
201606	181	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The next four panels summarize the medium-term outlook.	11.0	999.0
201606	182	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	My focus here is on comparisons between the June Tealbook and our forecast from last December, which is when the Committee moved the federal funds rate above the effective lower bound.	11.0	999.0
201606	183	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	As you can see from panel 3, relative to December we’ve lowered projected real GDP growth in 2016 and nudged it up over the subsequent two years.	11.0	999.0
201606	184	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Now, what that leaves us with at the end of 2018 is a level of GDP that’s essentially unrevised relative to our December projection.	11.0	999.0
201606	185	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The main sources of the revisions that we put through since December are summarized in panel 4.	11.0	999.0
201606	186	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Panels 5 and 6 give the outlook for the labor market, again with the comparison being made with our December Tealbook projection.	11.0	999.0
201606	187	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Starting with payroll employment, panel 5, the incoming data imply a sharply lower pace of job gains over the first half of this year than what we expected in December.	11.0	999.0
201606	188	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In our current projection, we have largely looked through this weakness, which seems at odds with what we’re seeing in other indicators.	11.0	999.0
201606	189	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In fact, in light of our downgraded outlook for productivity growth, the projected level of payrolls at the end of 2018 is actually slightly higher than in our December forecast.	11.0	999.0
201606	190	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Meanwhile, our unemployment rate forecast, which is shown in panel 6, is little changed from the December Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201606	191	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Now, panel 6 also indicates that the current level of the unemployment rate is now just a bit below our estimate of the natural rate.	11.0	999.0
201606	192	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	As we’ve pointed out in the past, there are other margins of labor market slack besides those captured by the unemployment gap; in the next exhibit, I provide our assessment of where several of those additional margins currently stand.	11.0	999.0
201606	193	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Panel 1 plots the labor force participation rate against the staff’s judgmental estimate of its trend.	11.0	999.0
201606	194	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Over the past couple of years, the participation rate has fluctuated widely but currently stands a little below its estimated trend.	11.0	999.0
201606	195	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	As you can see from panel 2, if we combine the participation rate gap with the unemployment rate gap, we get the gap between the employment-to-population ratio, and the staff’s estimate of its trend is basically close to zero right now.	11.0	999.0
201606	196	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Another potential margin of labor underutilization is the share of those employed who are working part time for economic reasons.	11.0	999.0
201606	197	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	This is shown by the black line in panel 3.	11.0	999.0
201606	198	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	If you look at that line, you can see that this series has now retraced most of its increase over the previous recession; however, if you compare it with the blue line, which shows a predicted value of that series on the basis of its historical relationship with the unemployment rate, you can see that there’s still some gap or some unusually elevated level of part time for economic reasons.	11.0	999.0
201606	199	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Although this unusually elevated level plausibly represents an additional margin of labor market slack, in aggregate terms it’s probably not overly large:  If we were to close it, it would probably lead to an increase in aggregate hours—and, hence, aggregate labor input— on the order of maybe 0.4 percent, which would in turn translate to maybe ¼ percent on real GDP.	11.0	999.0
201606	200	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Panel 4 compares our estimate of the unemployment gap—the black line—with two other variables that have historically tended to move relatively closely with it; namely, households’ view of job availability as measured by the Conference Board— that’s shown by the blue line—and small businesses’ view, as measured by the NFIB, of the difficulty that they’re having in filling job openings—that’s the red line.	11.0	999.0
201606	201	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	On the basis of on a mechanical choice of scaling of those two alternative series, you can see that these series currently bracket the value of our own gap estimate right around now.	11.0	999.0
201606	202	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Finally, panels 5 and 6 compare the extent to which different racial and ethnic groups have shared in the broader improvement in labor market conditions.	11.0	999.0
201606	203	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Panel 5 shows that the differentials in jobless rates across these groups are now close to where they were prior to the 2007–09 recession, with blacks and Hispanics still suffering notably higher rates of unemployment.	11.0	999.0
201606	204	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	And, as shown to the right, for involuntary part-time work, the gap for both blacks and Hispanics relative to whites remains higher than it was in the years just before the recession.	11.0	999.0
201606	205	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In the next exhibit, I review some of the considerations that help inform the staff’s judgmental assessment of labor- and product-market slack.	11.0	999.0
201606	206	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	One traditional approach to gauging the extent of slack has been to look at the behavior of inflation.	11.0	999.0
201606	207	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Unfortunately, as the Phillips curve—the relationship between slack and inflation—has become flatter over time, this approach no longer works as well as it used to.	11.0	999.0
201606	208	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Panels 1 and 2 show why, by means of a couple of stylized examples.	11.0	999.0
201606	209	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	If inflation’s long-term trend is stable—say, it’s tied down by well-anchored inflation expectations—and if we’ve already controlled for the other determinants of inflation besides slack, such as, say, imported goods prices, then periods in which the unemployment rate is below its natural rate—and, hence, the unemployment gap is negative—should be associated with above-trend inflation, and vice versa.	11.0	999.0
201606	210	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	This relation is captured by the red line in panel 1, which provides an example of a relatively steep Phillips curve.	11.0	999.0
201606	211	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Specifically, what the figure shows is a downward- sloping relationship between the unemployment gap—which is plotted on the horizontal axis—and deviations of inflation from its trend—which is measured by the vertical axis.	11.0	999.0
201606	212	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	(Note that the data constructed for this example—like the real-world inflation data—include a certain amount of unexplainable noise, which is why the relationship doesn’t fit perfectly and, hence, the black dots don’t lie right on the red line.)  Importantly, when the Phillips curve is steep, unemployment doesn’t have to move too far away from the natural rate for us to reliably see above- or below-trend inflation.	11.0	999.0
201606	213	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Here, for instance, in panel 1, if the unemployment rate is just ½ percentage point or more below its natural rate—which would put us in the red region of the figure—then inflation usually tends to be above its trend:  In this example, detrended inflation will be less than zero only about one-fifth of the time.	11.0	999.0
201606	214	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Similarly, when the unemployment rate is ½ percentage point or more above its natural rate—which puts us in the blue region—inflation is usually below its trend, with detrended inflation coming in greater than zero only about one-fifth of the time.	11.0	999.0
201606	215	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The behavior of inflation, therefore, is going to be reasonably informative in pinning down the level of the natural rate when the Phillips curve is steep.	11.0	999.0
201606	216	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	But when the Phillips curve is flat—panel 2—the situation is quite different:  Even if the unemployment rate is more than 1½ percentage points above or below its natural rate, we’re about equally likely to see above-trend inflation as we are to see below-trend inflation.	11.0	999.0
201606	217	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Hence, when the Phillips curve is flat—which we think is currently the case—the behavior of inflation will not tell us very much about how much slack is present in the economy.	11.0	999.0
201606	218	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Now, one way you can try to to deal with that problem is to try to bring additional information to bear, in the form of, say, other relationships like Okun’s Law or a production function, or other variables that might tell us something useful about slack.	11.0	999.0
201606	219	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	This additional information can be exploited in a relatively unrestricted way through the use of a time-series model, or, alternatively, you can impose the stronger restrictions implied by theory in the context of a fully specified structural model.	11.0	999.0
201606	220	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Panel 3 reports output gap estimates from three time-series models maintained by Board staff.	11.0	999.0
201606	221	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The range of the models’ point estimates is given by the gray shaded region, and the staff’s judgmental estimate of the output gap is shown as the black line.	11.0	999.0
201606	222	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In broad terms, these various gap estimates move relatively similarly.	11.0	999.0
201606	223	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Right now, these three time-series models generally point to a little more tightness in resource utilization than what’s implied by the staff’s judgmental estimate.	11.0	999.0
201606	224	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	A similar pattern is obtained if we consider the range of estimates of the natural rate of unemployment that are implied by these models (these are given by the gray shaded region in the next panel), and again, these suggest somewhat greater tightness in utilization than what the staff’s estimate would imply.	11.0	999.0
201606	225	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In panel 5, I present output gap estimates from the three DSGE models that are currently maintained as part of the System’s DSGE modeling project (once again, the Board staff’s judgmental estimate is shown here in the picture as the black line).	11.0	999.0
201606	226	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Over history, the range of DSGE model estimates is somewhat wider than what you see for the time-series models.	11.0	999.0
201606	227	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	More recently, however, these models’ gap estimates have converged and point to somewhat less tightness in utilization than what’s reflected in the judgmental estimate.	11.0	999.0
201606	228	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Depending on what you look at, what class of models, you can get relatively different current estimates for the output gap.	11.0	999.0
201606	229	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	I’d further note that the analysis that I’ve presented here pertains only to point values and doesn’t even attempt to characterize the degree of statistical uncertainty that typically surrounds these sorts of estimates.	11.0	999.0
201606	230	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Finally, in panel 6 I provide updated estimates of the short-run real natural rate of interest from the three DSGE models, in which this rate is defined as the real risk-free short-term interest rate that would be obtained in the absence of nominal rigidities.	11.0	999.0
201606	231	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Here, the range of model estimates is shown by the gray shaded region, but the solid line gives the model’s median estimate.	11.0	999.0
201606	232	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In the wake of the 2007–09 recession, the models saw the real natural rate of interest as having been pushed well below zero; by the end of 2018, however, all of the models expect the natural rate to be positive, with a median estimate of around 1¼ percent.	11.0	999.0
201606	233	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Your next exhibit relates to the inflation component of your dual mandate.	11.0	999.0
201606	234	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Panels 1 and 2 summarize the revisions that the staff have made to the inflation outlook since the December Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201606	235	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	As you can see from the black line in panel 1, the net revisions that we’ve made to total PCE price inflation have been relatively small.	11.0	999.0
201606	236	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	For core PCE price inflation, revisions to which are shown in panel 2, the largest revision is to the current year, 2016, and reflects an upward surprise to first- quarter core inflation—which is captured by the yellow region of the second stacked bar—that we’ve mostly interpreted as noise.	11.0	999.0
201606	237	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In addition, in the March round we edged down our judgmental estimate of underlying inflation 5 basis points, to 1.75 percent; this adjustment is captured by the gray portions of the bars.	11.0	999.0
201606	238	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	We had left this assumption unrevised since the June 2014 Tealbook; as we noted in March, we made the revision in response to continued low levels of market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation and in response to the decline we had seen in the Michigan survey measure of longer-term expected inflation.	11.0	999.0
201606	239	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	As you can see from panel 3, the preliminary June value of the Michigan measure, which is the red line in the figure, fell to 2.3 percent, which is the lowest level ever recorded for that series.	11.0	999.0
201606	240	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	This measure can be quite noisy from month to month.	11.0	999.0
201606	241	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Even so, a smoothed value of the series—given in the blue line in the panel—shows a relatively steady decline over the past couple of years.	11.0	999.0
201606	242	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	We continue to think that a portion of the decline in this measure of expectations is attributable to the low rates of headline inflation that we saw last year.	11.0	999.0
201606	243	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Indeed, when we try to control for the effect of food and energy price changes, the resulting estimate of the trend—which is the green line in the picture—manifests a much less pronounced decline of late, and it does not fall outside of the historical 70 percent range of the series, which is given by the gray shaded area.	11.0	999.0
201606	244	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Of course, this finding doesn’t rule out the possibility that a more persistent reduction in inflation expectations actually is under way.	11.0	999.0
201606	245	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Panel 4 summarizes results from a number of models that we also use to inform our view of underlying inflation.	11.0	999.0
201606	246	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	If you compare the first two columns of figures, the point estimates from every model except for the time-varying parameter VAR (which is the model shown in line 4) have declined since late 2007.	11.0	999.0
201606	247	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	If we throw out the very low reading coming from the TIPS-based model, which is shown on panel 3, the most recent point estimates run from 1.6 to 2 percent, with an equal-weighted mean of 1.7 percent—which is about the same as our judgmental assumption.	11.0	999.0
201606	248	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Panel 5 shows three of the measures of labor compensation that we follow.	11.0	999.0
201606	249	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	We have not revised our compensation forecast much in response to the incoming data since April; in particular, we think that the recent acceleration in the productivity and costs measure of business-sector hourly compensation—which is shown in the figure by the blue line—leaves it out of line with its fundamental drivers, and so we don’t expect this current pace to continue.	11.0	999.0
201606	250	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In addition, the ECI came in about as expected in the first quarter, and I’d point out that we anticipate that the 12-month change in the ECI—which is the black line in the figure—will move up to 2¼ percent in the current quarter as an unusually low reading from last year drops out of the calculation.	11.0	999.0
201606	251	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Although the staff closely monitor compensation developments, for some time we have tended to put relatively little weight on movements in labor compensation when we prepare the judgmental forecast for price inflation.	11.0	999.0
201606	252	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Simply as an empirical matter, we can no longer find any evidence of pass-through of labor costs to prices if we use compensation measures that are based on the productivity and costs data.	11.0	999.0
201606	253	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Moreover, even ECI-based labor cost measures—for which we still do find evidence of pass- through—appear to have had almost no material effect on price inflation in recent years.	11.0	999.0
201606	254	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	To illustrate this latter point, panel 6 uses a vector autoregression, or VAR, to decompose actual price inflation movements—the black line—into a baseline forecast and the cumulative effects of various structural shocks as identified by the VAR model.	11.0	999.0
201606	255	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	For example, the solid red line plots the VAR’s baseline forecast (which is obtained from a dynamic simulation of the VAR starting in 2001) plus the estimated effects of shocks to the unemployment gap.	11.0	999.0
201606	256	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	When these unemployment gap shocks are included, the model can track actual inflation tolerably well (the red line sort of tracks the low-frequency movements in the black line; if I were to add in all of the model’s shocks, it would track actual inflation perfectly).	11.0	999.0
201606	257	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The dashed red line then shows what happens if I also add in shocks to ECI-based trend unit labor costs.	11.0	999.0
201606	258	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	As you can see, the dashed red line lies very close to the solid red line.	11.0	999.0
201606	259	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	What that means is, the VAR attributes very little of the movement in core inflation over this period to labor cost shocks.	11.0	999.0
201606	260	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	I want to be clear here:  We don’t actually think that labor costs are immaterial for pricing.	11.0	999.0
201606	261	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Rather, we think that in a world in which inflation expectations are well anchored and, therefore, wage–price spirals are a thing of the past, observed year-to- year movements in price inflation are likely to mostly reflect a mix of changes in slack, supply shocks, and idiosyncratic variation, not independent movements in labor cost growth.	11.0	999.0
201606	262	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Shaghil will now continue our presentation.	11.0	999.0
201606	263	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	The contour of our foreign outlook is hardly something to write home to Mom about, even if she had FOMC clearance.	11.0	999.0
201606	264	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	[Laughter]	11.0	999.0
201606	265	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	As can be seen from line 1 of the table in exhibit 5, we see growth abroad reaching its trend pace of about 2¾ percent in the second half of this year and staying there through the remainder of the forecast period.	11.0	999.0
201606	266	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	While this suggests that the eagerly-awaited global recovery is all but done, we would not characterize foreign economic conditions as having returned to “normal” for several reasons.	11.0	999.0
201606	267	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	First, we appear to be having a dip in the current quarter.	11.0	999.0
201606	268	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	As shown in panel 2, even though the pickup in foreign real GDP growth in the first quarter to 2½ percent was a little larger than we had estimated, more recent indicators have disappointed, leading us to mark down second-quarter foreign GDP growth to 1¾ percent.	11.0	999.0
201606	269	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	The step-down in growth is concentrated in the advanced foreign economies, or AFEs (line 2 of the table), and primarily reflects transitory factors—wildfires in Canada that have disrupted oil production and an earthquake in Japan—the effects of which should reverse.	11.0	999.0
201606	270	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Moreover, in our baseline view, UK activity should reaccelerate after UK citizens vote to remain in the EU.	11.0	999.0
201606	271	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Growth in the emerging market economies, or EMEs (line 7), is estimated to have remained at its first-quarter pace.	11.0	999.0
201606	272	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Chinese growth (line 8) looks set for a moderate pickup in the current quarter, but Mexican GDP (line 10) should decelerate from its first-quarter surge.	11.0	999.0
201606	273	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	The second reason the foreign recovery doesn’t feel normal is that inflation (shown in panel 3), especially in the AFEs, is continuing to run low—even core inflation.	11.0	999.0
201606	274	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Remaining pockets of slack in some regions, such as in the euro area, help explain some of this weakness, but inflation is running below target even in countries, such as the United Kingdom, whose output gaps are nearly closed.	11.0	999.0
201606	275	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Third, it is taking an unusual amount of stimulus to achieve what we are now thinking of as trend growth.	11.0	999.0
201606	276	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	As noted in panel 4, the ECB’s monetary policy remains very accommodative, and its balance sheet is slated to expand further.	11.0	999.0
201606	277	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	We think the Bank of Japan will likely ease further, and the government has also announced a postponement to 2019 from 2017 of the planned consumption tax hike.	11.0	999.0
201606	278	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	And we don’t expect policy rates to start rising in Canada and the United Kingdom until next year.	11.0	999.0
201606	279	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	As I alluded to earlier, we also recognize that the “new normal” likely involves trend growth that is lower than it used to be.	11.0	999.0
201606	280	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Labor productivity growth (panel 5) has been declining in both the AFEs and EMEs.	11.0	999.0
201606	281	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	In EMEs, this primarily represents structural factors such as demographics (particularly in China), the process of economic convergence, and supply bottlenecks in some countries.	11.0	999.0
201606	282	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Some of the decline in the AFEs could be structural as well, as discussed in our Tealbook box on the topic, but it may also reflect lingering effects of the global financial crisis.	11.0	999.0
201606	283	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Consistent with these trends, as shown in panel 6, we have revised down our estimate of potential growth for both types of economies over the past several years.	11.0	999.0
201606	284	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	In this challenging global environment with monetary policies near their limits, it is more difficult to counter negative shocks, and risks to the outlook become more worrisome.	11.0	999.0
201606	285	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	So where do we now stand on our familiar downside risks to the global outlook?	11.0	999.0
201606	286	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Turning to exhibit 6, the recent increases in oil prices (panel 1) from very low levels have reduced the risk of severe financial instability or extraordinary belt- tightening in some oil-producing economies.	11.0	999.0
201606	287	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	We judge this benefit to exceed the cost to those economies that have benefited from the low oil prices.	11.0	999.0
201606	288	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	However, at this point, a further rise in oil prices would probably be a minus, on balance, for the global economy.	11.0	999.0
201606	289	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	On Chinese risks, the message is also mixed.	11.0	999.0
201606	290	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Depreciation pressures on the Chinese renminbi (panel 2) have eased this year, and capital flows and foreign exchange intervention have been relatively muted.	11.0	999.0
201606	291	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Earlier in the year, this was because the dollar’s generalized depreciation enabled the renminbi to appreciate against the dollar (the black line) even as the exchange value of the basket (the blue line) was falling.	11.0	999.0
201606	292	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	More recently, markets have taken in stride the depreciation of the renminbi against the dollar as the dollar has generally strengthened, and of the basket, but this could change and exchange rate concerns could flare up again.	11.0	999.0
201606	293	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Also, the rapid credit growth encouraged by authorities to keep the economy expanding is further boosting corporate debt and, thus, the risk of financial problems down the road.	11.0	999.0
201606	294	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Consequently, we wouldn’t push risks associated with China to the back burner.	11.0	999.0
201606	295	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Continuing our world tour of risks, Brexit looms large, as Simon discussed.	11.0	999.0
201606	296	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	A leave vote next week could trigger significant additional spillovers to global markets.	11.0	999.0
201606	297	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	To provide a sense of the impact of this on the US economy, as noted in panel 3, we ran two simulations using our SIGMA model:  a “moderate” one in which the reaction of global financial markets is relatively muted, and a more “disorderly” one (presented in the Tealbook) in which there are greater spillovers in terms of borrowing spreads and dollar appreciation.	11.0	999.0
201606	298	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	As shown in panel 4, our results imply that Brexit would take off about ¼ percentage point from US growth under the moderate scenario (the green line), and a larger negative effect under the disorderly scenario (the red line), resulting in a lower path of the federal funds rate (panel 5).	11.0	999.0
201606	299	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	In view of the uncertainties, the range of possible outcomes is, of course, broader.	11.0	999.0
201606	300	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Brexit is not the only risk emanating from the AFEs.	11.0	999.0
201606	301	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Greece’s problems are not yet resolved, and long-run inflation expectations in the AFEs have been falling, which increases the risk that high real interest rates in an environment of a zero-lower-bound constraint could impede progress in some economies.	11.0	999.0
201606	302	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Another key risk involves spillover effects from US monetary policy normalization.	11.0	999.0
201606	303	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	One such spillover, discussed in the next exhibit, is that financial stresses in the EMEs could ratchet up, putting a hurt on their real economies.	11.0	999.0
201606	304	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Our baseline view is that EMEs will be able to manage US monetary policy normalization without facing consequences that are too adverse.	11.0	999.0
201606	305	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	As suggested by our in-house EME vulnerability index (the red line in panel 1), in many dimensions— including improved policy frameworks, greater exchange rate flexibility, and adequate foreign exchange reserves—EMEs are much less vulnerable than in the crisis-prone 1980s and 1990s.	11.0	999.0
201606	306	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	That said, both our vulnerability index and EMBI global spreads—a measure of investor perceptions of creditworthiness—have been trending up a bit over the past few years.	11.0	999.0
201606	307	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Some of this upturn reflects the run-up in credit to the private sector shown in panel 2, especially to nonfinancial corporations (the blue portions of the bars).	11.0	999.0
201606	308	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	This creates the risk that US policy normalization and resultant increases in borrowing costs might lead to financial distress in EMEs.	11.0	999.0
201606	309	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Panel 3 depicts an event study of the response of EME spreads to surprises in the federal funds rate following FOMC announcements.	11.0	999.0
201606	310	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	As indicated by the regression line, unexpected hikes in the policy rate do boost EME spreads, but it is a moderate effect—a 100 basis point increase in the policy rate is associated with a 44 basis point increase in spreads.	11.0	999.0
201606	311	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	This means that the cumulative market surprise in US tightening implied by our baseline federal funds rate path through 2018 should result in about a 65 basis point increase in the EMBI global spread.	11.0	999.0
201606	312	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	But this is very uncertain, and spreads could certainly rise more.	11.0	999.0
201606	313	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	To examine the consequences of a sharp rise in financial stresses, I estimate a simple equation (presented in panel 4) in which EME growth is a function of its own lag, aggregate growth in the advanced economies (both the United States and AFEs), and current and lagged value of the EMBI global spread.	11.0	999.0
201606	314	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	As noted in the inset box, a 100 basis point rise in spreads is associated with a decline in EME growth of ¼ percentage point in the long run, with the short-run drag being substantially larger.	11.0	999.0
201606	315	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	The fit of the model is quite good.	11.0	999.0
201606	316	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	To assess spillovers in a stress scenario, I assume that EME global spreads rise 250 basis points in the third quarter—about half that seen during the global financial crisis—and do not return to current levels until end-2018.	11.0	999.0
201606	317	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	The hit to EME growth according to this model, shown in panel 5, would be sizable, although well short of crisis proportions.	11.0	999.0
201606	318	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Adverse effects of FOMC policy normalization on foreign growth would, of course, hurt the US external sector—the subject of your next exhibit—with the effects compounded if there was also a bigger rise in the dollar than we are expecting.	11.0	999.0
201606	319	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	As indicated in panel 1, in our baseline, we are expecting some further appreciation of the dollar, especially against the AFE currencies.	11.0	999.0
201606	320	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	This appreciation reflects the fact that, as depicted in panel 2, we are projecting a larger increase in the federal funds rate than the market, and we assume that as the market raises its expected path of rate tightening in response to ongoing surprises, the dollar will rise.	11.0	999.0
201606	321	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	We calibrate the responses to these surprises on the basis of the historical reaction of the dollar to US monetary policy announcements (the black line in panel 3), which implies a 1.5 percent appreciation of the dollar against the AFE currencies following a 100 basis point policy surprise.	11.0	999.0
201606	322	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Of late, however, the response of the dollar has been considerably greater—the same relationship following all FOMC meetings since June 2014 is shown by the pink line.	11.0	999.0
201606	323	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	While we cannot conclude from such a short period that there has been a structural break in the historical relationship, we have nodded a bit in that direction by increasing our baseline 1.5 percent coefficient to 2.5 percent.	11.0	999.0
201606	324	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	This boosts the slope of our dollar path a bit, other things equal, but, as I mentioned earlier, the dollar could rise much more in response to policy surprises.	11.0	999.0
201606	325	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Accordingly, we presented a “Stronger Dollar” alternative scenario in your Tealbook (not shown), in which the dollar rises an additional 10 percent, leading to moderate declines in US GDP growth and core inflation from their baseline paths.	11.0	999.0
201606	326	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Even without a surge in the dollar, as you can see from line 1 of the table, net exports continue to be a drag on US GDP growth in our forecast, though this drag diminishes by 2018 as the flattening of the dollar kicks in.	11.0	999.0
201606	327	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	In the first quarter, extraordinarily surprising weakness in imports (line 2) made the contribution of net exports slightly positive, but we are expecting that to reverse as import growth moves toward the pace we would expect, in view of the behavior of the dollar and faster US GDP growth.	11.0	999.0
201606	328	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	With the flattening of the dollar, we are also seeing core import prices (panel 4) rising for the first time in nearly two years.	11.0	999.0
201606	329	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	In fact, this morning, May import prices printed a little higher than we were expecting, and we have boosted somewhat our forecast for second-quarter core import price inflation.	11.0	999.0
201606	330	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	To sum up, with growth abroad settling at a moderate pace, we see a gradual ebbing of the headwinds from the foreign sector on the US economy.	11.0	999.0
201606	331	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	But the global recovery has yet to become self-sustaining, and plenty of downside risks remain, which perhaps are worth writing home to Mom about.	11.0	999.0
201606	332	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Jason will now continue our presentation.	11.0	999.0
201606	333	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Thank you, Shaghil.	11.0	999.0
201606	334	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	I will be referring to the packet labeled “Material for Briefing on the Summary of Economic Projections.”	11.0	999.0
201606	335	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	To summarize briefly:  Compared with the SEP in March, your economic projections have not changed much, but many of you revised down your assessments of the levels of the federal funds rate that will be consistent with those projections in 2017, 2018, and over the longer run.	11.0	999.0
201606	336	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	In addition, more of you now see the risks to inflation as balanced than as weighted to the downside.	11.0	999.0
201606	337	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Exhibit 1 summarizes your economic projections, which are conditional on your individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.	11.0	999.0
201606	338	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	As shown in the top panel, the median of your projections for real GDP growth is 2 percent for each year from 2016 through 2018, equal to the median of your projections of its longer-run pace.	11.0	999.0
201606	339	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Looking at your individual projections, a majority of you project that real GDP growth this year will be at or slightly above your individual assessments of its longer- run pace.	11.0	999.0
201606	340	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Most of you forecast that economic growth will pick up a bit next year and will remain at or above your estimate of its longer-run pace in 2018.	11.0	999.0
201606	341	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	I should note in passing that one participant did not submit longer-run projections.	11.0	999.0
201606	342	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	That fact will be noted in the SEP materials that will be released to public.	11.0	999.0
201606	343	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	As shown in the second panel, the median of your projections for the unemployment rate is 4.7 percent this year, 4.6 percent for the next two years, and 4.8 percent in the longer run.	11.0	999.0
201606	344	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	A large majority of you project that the unemployment rate will be at or a bit below its longer-run normal level through 2018.	11.0	999.0
201606	345	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	As can be seen in the third panel, the median of your projections for headline PCE inflation moves up from 1.4 percent this year to 1.9 percent in 2017 and 2 percent in 2018, when almost all of you project that inflation will be equal to or within 0.1 percentage point of the Committee’s objective.	11.0	999.0
201606	346	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Turning to the bottom panel, the median projections for core inflation also increase gradually over the next three years.	11.0	999.0
201606	347	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Exhibit 2 compares your current projections with those in the March SEP and with the forecasts from the March and June Tealbooks.	11.0	999.0
201606	348	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	As shown in the top panel, the median path of your projections for real GDP growth edged down this year and next as compared with March and is below the Tealbook forecast over the medium term.	11.0	999.0
201606	349	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Many of you attributed your downward revisions to growth to recent soft readings on economic activity, such as those on business spending, as well as the weaker-than-expected employment report for May.	11.0	999.0
201606	350	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Notably, the range of your projections for GDP growth has become wider for the next two years and for the longer run, mainly as a result of changes to the bottom end of the range.	11.0	999.0
201606	351	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The median of your forecasts for unemployment, shown in the second panel, is essentially unrevised at all horizons.	11.0	999.0
201606	352	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	As can be seen in the third panel, the median of your projections for total PCE inflation for this year was revised up 0.2 percentage point, but the medians are unrevised for 2017 and 2018.	11.0	999.0
201606	353	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Many of you attributed a higher inflation projection for this year to stronger-than-expected readings on inflation in recent months as well as the stabilization of oil prices.	11.0	999.0
201606	354	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The median inflation projections through 2018 continue to lie a bit above the Tealbook baseline projection, although the difference has narrowed since March, particularly in the near term.	11.0	999.0
201606	355	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The median path of your forecasts for core PCE inflation, shown in the fourth panel, ticked up for this year and the next.	11.0	999.0
201606	356	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Exhibit 3 provides an overview of your assessments of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate.	11.0	999.0
201606	357	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The median projection, indicated by the red horizontal lines in the top panel, stands at 0.9 percent at the end of 2016, suggesting two rate hikes by the end of this year, 1.6 percent at the end of 2017, and 2.4 percent at the end of 2018.	11.0	999.0
201606	358	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The median projection for the federal funds rate at the end of this year is unchanged from the March projections (which are shown in the bottom panel).	11.0	999.0
201606	359	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Still, it is worth noting that a majority of you revised down your individual forecasts, that the mean declined 19 basis points, and that now only two of you have year-end projections above 1 percent, compared with seven in March.	11.0	999.0
201606	360	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	All but a few of you revised down your funds rate forecast over the next two years, and the median funds rate projections for 2017 and 2018 are now lower than in March by 38 and 62 basis points, respectively.	11.0	999.0
201606	361	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Many of you expressed a view that increases in the federal funds rate over the next several years will need to be gradual in light of a short-term equilibrium real interest rate that is currently low and will only rise slowly—a phenomenon several of you attributed to persistently low productivity growth and other headwinds.	11.0	999.0
201606	362	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Some of you cited risk-management considerations arising from the proximity of the effective lower bound as a reason for a cautious approach to normalization.	11.0	999.0
201606	363	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	With respect to the longer-run federal funds rate, about half of you lowered your projections 25 basis points, and the median now stands at 3 percent compared with 3¼ percent in March.	11.0	999.0
201606	364	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Participants attributed the downward revisions to a number of factors, including global demographic dynamics, weak productivity growth, and a slower pace of potential growth.	11.0	999.0
201606	365	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	As in March, almost all of you anticipate that the appropriate level of the funds rate at the end of 2018 will remain below your individual judgments of its longer-run level, but the median shortfall—at 62 basis points—is now wider than it was in March.	11.0	999.0
201606	366	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	As shown by the red diamonds in exhibit 3, the median federal funds rate that a non-inertial Taylor (1999) rule prescribes for the end of this year, conditional on your individual projections for core inflation, the unemployment gap, and the longer-run federal funds rate, shifted up slightly since March, boosted mainly by higher projections of core inflation.	11.0	999.0
201606	367	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	In contrast, the prescriptions for 2017 and 2018 shifted down a bit as a result of downward revisions to the longer-run federal funds rate.	11.0	999.0
201606	368	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Still, all of you continue to project levels of the federal funds rate for this year and next that are well below the prescriptions of the rule, and only one of you projects the federal funds rate in 2018 to be higher than suggested by the rule.	11.0	999.0
201606	369	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	In fact, for most of you, the gaps between your projections of the federal funds rate and the rule’s prescriptions have widened since March at all forecast horizons.	11.0	999.0
201606	370	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Exhibit 4 shows your assessments of the uncertainty and risks surrounding your economic projections.	11.0	999.0
201606	371	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	As shown in the figures to the left, you continue to view the uncertainty about your projections as broadly similar to its historical average.	11.0	999.0
201606	372	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	As in March, most of you also see the risks to your projections of GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly balanced, as illustrated in the top two figures to the right, but quite a few of you see the risks to growth as weighted to the downside and risks to unemployment as weighted to the upside.	11.0	999.0
201606	373	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Moving to the two bottom-right figures, in contrast to March, a majority of you now see the risks to your inflation projections as broadly balanced rather than as tilted to the downside.	11.0	999.0
201606	374	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	A couple of you pointed to the firming of some measures of inflation in recent months as contributing to the change in your risk assessment.	11.0	999.0
201606	375	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Among those who continue to judge that the risks to inflation are weighted to the downside, almost all cited recent declines in certain measures of longer-run inflation expectations as a reason for your assessment.	11.0	999.0
201606	376	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The final exhibit explores the extent to which the gap between your projections for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate and the prescriptions of a non-inertial Taylor (1999) rule are correlated with your assessments of the risks to your economic projections.	11.0	999.0
201606	377	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The top two panels focus on your assessments of the risks to your projections for PCE inflation.	11.0	999.0
201606	378	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The blue line in the first panel displays, across SEP dates, the median value of the Taylor rule residuals for 2016.	11.0	999.0
201606	379	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The blue line in the second panel displays the same variable on the basis of your projections for 2017.	11.0	999.0
201606	380	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	As you can see, the median Taylor rule residuals for both 2016 and 2017 have generally become larger since September 2014, indicating that your funds rate projections have moved further below the prescriptions of the Taylor rule.	11.0	999.0
201606	381	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The red lines in the first two panels show, over the SEP dates, the net fraction of participants who assessed that the risks to PCE inflation are weighted to the downside.	11.0	999.0
201606	382	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Over time, more of you judged the risks to your inflation projections to be weighted to the downside.	11.0	999.0
201606	383	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The co-movement between the median residuals and the net fraction is notable.	11.0	999.0
201606	384	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The bottom two panels plot the same blue lines—the median Taylor rule residuals—against the net fraction of participants who assessed that the risks to the unemployment rate are weighted to the upside.	11.0	999.0
201606	385	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Over the past year and a half, more of you judged the risks to the unemployment rate to be weighted to the upside.	11.0	999.0
201606	386	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The co- movement here between the net fraction and the Taylor rule residuals is more modest.	11.0	999.0
201606	387	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	One potential rationale for co-movement between your risk assessments and the Taylor rule residuals could be the proximity of the ELB:  When the risks to the real economy and especially inflation are significantly skewed to the downside, you adopt a risk-management approach to policy normalization.	11.0	999.0
201606	388	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	As a result, you deem it appropriate to provide a greater amount of accommodation relative to a Taylor rule benchmark that uses your modal forecasts for inflation and the unemployment rate.	11.0	999.0
201606	389	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Another rationale, which could be complementary to the first one, is that the widening Taylor rule residuals reflect your assessments that the short-term equilibrium real interest rate has moved down, reducing the scope for providing policy accommodation through the federal funds rate.	11.0	999.0
201606	390	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	This in turn increases the vulnerability of the economy to adverse shocks.	11.0	999.0
201606	391	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201606	392	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The three of us would be happy to take your questions.	11.0	999.0
201606	393	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Any questions?	12.0	65.0
201606	394	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	The floor is open for questions for any of our presenters.	12.0	65.0
201606	395	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	12.0	65.0
201606	396	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	12.0	111.0
201606	397	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Jeremy, on exhibit 4, looking at inflation in panel 2, you have the yellow bars labeled “other.”	12.0	111.0
201606	398	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	I think you said that that was noise.	12.0	111.0
201606	399	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	For 2016.	12.0	999.0
201606	400	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	For 2016.	12.0	111.0
201606	401	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Could you talk a little bit more about how much confidence you have in that noise?	12.0	111.0
201606	402	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	It just looks large.	12.0	111.0
201606	403	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Yes, so one thing to point out is that it actually isn’t that large—given the volatility that we tend to see quarter to quarter in inflation, it’s not absolutely huge.	12.0	999.0
201606	404	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In fact, when we brought this exhibit into the Tealbook a few rounds ago, we pointed out that what we were showing as the range of the y-axis was calibrated on the basis of the confidence interval from a year, year-and-a-half-ahead forecast—I believe it was the 2017 confidence interval, as we were jumping off in, say, December 2015.	12.0	999.0
201606	405	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	So that gives you a way to calibrate how large that yellow residual is.	12.0	999.0
201606	406	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The reason why we are more convinced that it’s noise now than we were is because we’ve basically seen recent inflation readings come in closer in line with our forecast, except for the portion of that miss that we label the nonmarket component of PCE prices.	12.0	999.0
201606	407	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	We don’t think there’s much signal in nonmarket prices.	12.0	999.0
201606	408	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	They’re very erratic from quarter to quarter, and we don’t think there’s a lot of persistence or information about inflation trends in that portion.	12.0	999.0
201606	409	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In addition, we just saw a number of anomalous movements in January 2016 that pushed up inflation for the year as a whole.	12.0	999.0
201606	410	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	They were in some strange categories—like in the goods category, I believe jewelry had a very large spike that, at the time, seemed inexplicable and later didn’t—	12.0	999.0
201606	411	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	I think President Williams said he was purchasing in January.	12.0	111.0
201606	413	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s true.	12.0	102.0
201606	414	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Exactly.	12.0	111.0
201606	415	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	We didn’t expect that to be repeated, and recently things have come in more or less in line with our forecast.	12.0	999.0
201606	416	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	We’re reasonably confident that that was basically transitory volatility in this series.	12.0	999.0
201606	417	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Okay.	12.0	111.0
201606	418	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	12.0	111.0
201606	419	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	12.0	65.0
201606	420	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	94.0
201606	421	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I’m looking at exhibit 8, panel 1, which is real dollar indexes.	12.0	94.0
201606	422	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I guess I wasn’t quite sure what the experiment was here.	12.0	94.0
201606	423	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The dashed lines are the April Tealbook, and then the other lines are the 100 basis point surprise?	12.0	94.0
201606	424	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	No, panel 1 is just our baseline forecast.	12.0	999.0
201606	425	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	What are the dashed lines?	12.0	94.0
201606	426	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	What are the solid lines?	12.0	94.0
201606	427	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	The solid line is our current forecast, and the dashed lines are our April Tealbook forecast.	12.0	999.0
201606	428	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I see.	12.0	94.0
201606	429	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	So the dollar jumped against the emerging market currencies, and we have a higher starting point.	12.0	999.0
201606	430	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	And then we have the slope obtained on the basis of market reactions to surprises to the path of policy rates in the US and foreign economies.	12.0	999.0
201606	431	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12.0	94.0
201606	432	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	So during your presentation, you were talking about 100 basis point surprises.	12.0	94.0
201606	433	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	So what were you talking about?	12.0	94.0
201606	434	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	What I was talking about was, basically, I think you’re referring to the EME exhibit, maybe.	12.0	999.0
201606	435	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Yes, well, I’m not sure.	12.0	94.0
201606	436	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Why don’t we abstract from which panel exactly the surprise was and just talk about the rationale behind our dollar forecast?	12.0	999.0
201606	437	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I guess my question is, why would you want to talk about a 100 basis point surprise in the funds rate?	12.0	94.0
201606	438	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Oh, sorry.	12.0	999.0
201606	439	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	That was just to talk about the slope of this black line in panel 3, which is based on the historical relationship between the response of federal funds futures to FOMC announcements and the 1-day change in the dollar.	12.0	999.0
201606	440	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Then if you want to talk about 25 basis points, divide the slope of 1.5 by 4.	12.0	999.0
201606	441	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12.0	94.0
201606	442	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	The reason that’s relevant is because of the way we forecast the evolution of the dollar.	12.0	999.0
201606	443	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	We start with the basic presumption that the current level of the exchange rate should incorporate the markets’ expectations about anything that happens in the future.	12.0	999.0
201606	444	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	So if the markets expected the federal funds rate to rise by a certain amount and they expected the euro- area interest rate to fall by a certain amount, that would already be incorporated into the current level of the dollar.	12.0	999.0
201606	445	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	We would not expect the dollar to move in the future as the market saw the changes in the interest rates that it expected.	12.0	999.0
201606	446	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	However, the staff forecast is for a steeper rise in the federal funds rate than the markets expect.	12.0	999.0
201606	447	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	So we assume that as the markets perceive this higher-than-expected interest rate, they will respond by bidding the dollar up.	12.0	999.0
201606	448	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Now the question becomes:  Well, how do we tell, when the market experiences a surprise interest rate, how do we tell how much that should affect the dollar?	12.0	999.0
201606	449	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	And in order to come up with an estimate of that sensitivity, we look at the past history of the responses of the dollar to surprises in the interest rate, using the FOMC announcements as a way to take a clear reading on that expectational change.	12.0	999.0
201606	450	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12.0	94.0
201606	451	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I think that’s fair.	12.0	94.0
201606	452	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	So these estimates in panel 3 are on a one- day window, it looks like.	12.0	94.0
201606	453	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201606	454	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Whereas what’s going to happen if you think that the market expects a lower funds rate and the Committee expects a higher funds rate, that information is going to be revealed over a very long time period.	12.0	94.0
201606	455	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	So what do you do with that when you look at the dollar?	12.0	94.0
201606	456	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	We’re making the assumption that the effect of changes in market expectations of the interest rate in short periods can basically be linearly transferred to what should happen over a long period of time.	12.0	999.0
201606	457	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	And we have some support for that, because if you did a very similar experiment in which you looked at changes in 10-year yields from before to after FOMC announcements, they also map in a systematic way into changes in the dollar.	12.0	999.0
201606	458	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	And if you then take into account the fact that changes in 10-year yields are kind of related in a systematic way to changes in short yields, you get a similar relationship.	12.0	999.0
201606	459	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	We think that, by and large, this approach toward calibrating the sensitivity of the dollar to interest rate changes works, although considering how incredibly uncertain the dollar forecast is anyway, we could be splitting some hairs here.	12.0	999.0
201606	460	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12.0	94.0
201606	461	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	So let’s suppose the Committee did what’s in panel 2 here, which is the solid black line, and the market expected the dashed line below, so we’re surprised over the next couple of years with higher rates.	12.0	94.0
201606	462	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The dollar’s going to be stronger than the baseline.	12.0	94.0
201606	463	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	This is going to have an effect on net exports, and that’s the top line in the bottom table.	12.0	94.0
201606	464	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Is this correct?	12.0	94.0
201606	465	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Exactly.	12.0	999.0
201606	466	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12.0	94.0
201606	467	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	Well, just with the caveat that this is what is built in.	12.0	999.0
201606	468	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	I assume you are talking about how things work in our baseline.	12.0	999.0
201606	469	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	In other words, as the actual interest rate exceeds market expectations, that boosts the dollar in the way shown in the baseline, panel 1.	12.0	999.0
201606	470	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	And then we get this net exports contribution to GDP.	12.0	94.0
201606	471	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	And then we get the net exports contribution, exactly, shown in table 1.	12.0	999.0
201606	472	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I actually calculated the net exports contribution to GDP during the previous expansion, 2001 to 2007, and I got numbers that look about like this, slightly negative numbers.	12.0	94.0
201606	473	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I am interpreting this as almost nothing happens.	12.0	94.0
201606	474	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Well, a couple of things.	12.0	999.0
201606	475	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Number one, that previous expansion, the first part of it was, indeed, a period of dollar strength.	12.0	999.0
201606	476	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	So you typically—let’s put it this way—	12.0	999.0
201606	477	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Surprise dollar strength?	12.0	94.0
201606	478	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Well, not necessarily.	12.0	999.0
201606	479	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	But it was a period of dollar strength.	12.0	999.0
201606	480	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	And so, right now, as we move into looking at the effect of the dollar on the trade forecast, we now can leave behind the expectations element.	12.0	999.0
201606	481	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	We take it as given that the dollar had a certain trajectory.	12.0	999.0
201606	482	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	The dollar peaked in 2002, so the dollar was actually very strong for much of our previous expansion.	12.0	999.0
201606	483	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	And, more generally, dollar strength does tend to be correlated with our expansions.	12.0	999.0
201606	484	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	So it should not be a surprise that during our previous cyclical expansion, we did have a negative contribution of net exports to GDP growth.	12.0	999.0
201606	485	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	All that said, it should be noted that looking forward, and as you alluded to, these contributions of minus 0.3 percentage point, minus 0.4 percentage point, they are not very large.	12.0	999.0
201606	486	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	They are getting into a very manageable size.	12.0	999.0
201606	487	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	12.0	94.0
201606	488	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	12.0	65.0
201606	489	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I was looking at the international forecasts.	12.0	96.0
201606	490	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	You have another disappointment in terms of global growth, yet an environment in which monetary policies around the world are supposedly very accommodative.	12.0	96.0
201606	491	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	How do you square the circle?	12.0	96.0
201606	492	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	What do you think is fundamentally going on?	12.0	96.0
201606	493	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	And there are a couple of completely alternative sort of scenarios.	12.0	96.0
201606	494	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	One scenario would be that monetary policy stimulus isn’t as great as we think it is, and so then we have to come up with an explanation for that.	12.0	96.0
201606	495	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	One possible explanation is maybe monetary policy stimulus becomes attenuated over time, because over time people buy things, it pulls things forward, and that means they don’t buy those things in the future, or maybe household savings reacts to the low level of interest rates by deciding that they have to save more.	12.0	96.0
201606	496	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s one possible explanation.	12.0	96.0
201606	497	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Another possible explanation is there is a global saving glut.	12.0	96.0
201606	498	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	And it just seems like it would be useful to dive in a little bit more into this issue of why we consistently see global economic weakness in an environment in which monetary policy is super stimulative, supposedly.	12.0	96.0
201606	499	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t feel like we have a coherent story reconciling those two things.	12.0	96.0
201606	500	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	I think I would interpret it as implying that there are still fragilities.	12.0	999.0
201606	501	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Even though this is a trendlike pace in global growth, there are still fragilities in the economies.	12.0	999.0
201606	502	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	And, therefore, the policy support is required.	12.0	999.0
201606	503	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So is this a headwinds type of story, and the headwinds will dissipate over time, and eventually we will do better?	12.0	96.0
201606	504	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201606	505	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	It’s not that we will do better.	12.0	999.0
201606	506	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	As you can see in the forecast, we have a lower trend—period.	12.0	999.0
201606	507	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	And it stays at 2.8 percent.	12.0	999.0
201606	508	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	When you look at Japan and Europe, you have to sort of say that it’s not really working, right?	12.0	96.0
201606	509	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	They are supposedly having these very stimulative monetary policies, and it’s not really working.	12.0	96.0
201606	510	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I just don’t feel like we have a coherent story about why that is.	12.0	96.0
201606	511	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Well, it is worthwhile to distinguish between the average and the marginal effects of these monetary policies.	12.0	999.0
201606	512	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	You could argue persuasively, I think, that doing additional QE or moving further into negative interest rates at this point might not be effective.	12.0	999.0
201606	513	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	It would be hard to argue with that.	12.0	999.0
201606	514	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	On the other hand, it’s unambiguously clear that actual interest rates, both short term and long term, are incredibly low.	12.0	999.0
201606	515	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Certainly by that metric, monetary policies are extraordinarily easy.	12.0	999.0
201606	516	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	And then if you said, “Well, why is—”	12.0	999.0
201606	517	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	“Easy” or “stimulative”?	12.0	96.0
201606	518	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Those are different things.	12.0	96.0
201606	519	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	All right.	12.0	999.0
201606	520	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Let me just start by saying “easy” in the sense of any firm that wants to invest and actually hire people and build a factory can do so for virtually no cost of funds.	12.0	999.0
201606	521	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	So, to me, that suggests clearly that there are huge headwinds on spending itself.	12.0	999.0
201606	522	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	We know that’s true in the corporate investment side, in which corporations are earning far more profits around the world than they are investing, and they are returning that cash to their shareholders via dividends and buybacks.	12.0	999.0
201606	523	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	And then we know that consumption has not been particularly strong.	12.0	999.0
201606	524	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	I would say, for starters, it is obvious there are very strong headwinds against spending.	12.0	999.0
201606	525	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	And then, on top of that, whether monetary policy has lost its oomph, I think we could make an argument that certainly marginal policy stimulus has.	12.0	999.0
201606	526	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	But, as I say, I think the fault must lie on the part of the spenders and why they don’t spend.	12.0	999.0
201606	527	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Clearly, interest rates are now so low that money for investment can be had for nothing.	12.0	999.0
201606	528	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	See, my suspicion is that we are sort of mistaking level for change in monetary policy.	12.0	96.0
201606	529	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	In other words, when you ease monetary policy, when you change the level of rates, you have an effect on spending.	12.0	96.0
201606	530	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But if you stay at that level, it sort of loses its effect.	12.0	96.0
201606	531	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	And we can look at the level and judge from the level obtained from Taylor-rule formulations and others that policy is really accommodative.	12.0	96.0
201606	532	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But, in fact, the degree of accommodation is actually lessening over time.	12.0	96.0
201606	533	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I feel like we haven’t really entertained this possibility seriously, and the reason why we haven’t is we’ve never really been in this situation before in which you’ve stayed at a level of interest rates that are very low for a very long period of time.	12.0	96.0
201606	534	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Typically, what happens is you go to this low level of interest rates, which generates a cyclical recovery.	12.0	96.0
201606	535	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I wonder, is it worth—	12.0	96.0
201606	536	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	It is certainly worth arguing—	12.0	999.0
201606	537	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	I can only address the domestic component of that, and there I’d say the picture is a bit mixed.	12.0	999.0
201606	538	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	With respect to portfolio policy, we’ve considerably downgraded our estimates of the effect of increases in the size of the portfolio since the time of QE1, which we thought was redressing serious bond market dysfunction, and we thought that had a very big effect on economic activity.	12.0	999.0
201606	539	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	And, progressively over time, the estimates that are implicit in the projection show smaller effects from increments to the size of the portfolio.	12.0	999.0
201606	540	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	On the traditional component, the funds rate component, I invert your hypothesis and say that, at the margin, we are assuming that what’s implicit in the forecast, I think, roughly speaking, is that the margin changes in the path of interest rates—not just the funds rate today, but the path of interest rates—have, roughly speaking, the same effect as before.	12.0	999.0
201606	541	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	But it’s the intercept, I would say, that has shifted down.	12.0	999.0
201606	542	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	And so, you know, this is reflected in our own 25 basis point adjustment in long-run r*.	12.0	999.0
201606	543	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	I think your comments are very well taken, but they incorporate, as you know, an ongoing pitched battle between people like Larry Summers and Paul Krugman and Ken Rogoff and Ben Bernanke, all of whom have different answers to the very question that you are asking.	12.0	999.0
201606	544	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	And I think what you are exposing is that, for lack of a better way to put it, the staff are not smarter than the combination of Larry Summers, Ken Rogoff—	12.0	999.0
201606	545	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Don’t give up.	12.0	96.0
201606	546	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	12.0	96.0
201606	547	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	So we have to take a pragmatic stand with, on the one hand, balancing— we don’t know the answer to that question, but we need to try to recalibrate the projection realistically so that we think it’s giving you a sensible picture of how aggregate demand will evolve.	12.0	999.0
201606	548	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	And I think that our assessment is that it takes a lower level of interest rates at this point now than we thought it did.	12.0	999.0
201606	549	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	That would be consistent with monetary policy attenuation, that you gradually keep lowering your intercept term over time to—	12.0	96.0
201606	550	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	Well, I am not sure what you mean by “attenuation.”	12.0	999.0
201606	551	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	I think when I hear “attenuation,” what—	12.0	999.0
201606	552	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I mean that a given level of interest rates has a diminished effect on economic activity over time—the same level.	12.0	96.0
201606	553	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	Okay.	12.0	999.0
201606	554	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	That’s the part I think I am agreeing with.	12.0	999.0
201606	555	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	The piece that I was taking issue with was, at the margin today, if you considered a decision tree with branches on it, roughly speaking I think we’d say you’d get the same amount of oomph today at the margin if you did the optometrist’s comparison of “better A” or “better B.”	12.0	999.0
201606	556	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	Does 25 basis points get you the same amount?	12.0	999.0
201606	557	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I wouldn’t necessarily disagree with that.	12.0	96.0
201606	558	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But I would say that the 25 basis points would give you “X” amount in period 1, but “X minus something” in period 2, and “X minus something greater” in period 3.	12.0	96.0
201606	559	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	In other words, the effect of that cut would peter out over time.	12.0	96.0
201606	560	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s really what I’m suggesting.	12.0	96.0
201606	561	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer would like to join this debate.	12.0	65.0
201606	562	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Discussion.	12.0	97.0
201606	563	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Discussion.	12.0	108.0
201606	564	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks, Madam Chair.	12.0	108.0
201606	565	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I think you’re talking about levels and rates of change.	12.0	108.0
201606	566	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes.	12.0	96.0
201606	567	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Exactly.	12.0	65.0
201606	568	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	When the FOMC introduced the large-scale purchases of domestic assets, it was a change in policy.	12.0	108.0
201606	569	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Furthermore, it hadn’t been anticipated.	12.0	108.0
201606	570	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	When it happened, we got a fairly big reduction in long-term interest rates at the time.	12.0	108.0
201606	571	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Now, if that expansionary policy stayed in place forever, we would have expected long-term interest rates to rise gradually back up partway as the economy strengthened, until they reached a new level.	12.0	108.0
201606	572	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	However, we had expected, all of us, that that strengthening process would be led by the interest-sensitive sectors, namely residential investment, and to a lesser extent, business investment.	12.0	108.0
201606	573	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Well, it didn’t happen.	12.0	108.0
201606	574	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	What we were expecting to come in didn’t come in.	12.0	108.0
201606	575	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	At the same time, productivity growth seems to be very low.	12.0	108.0
201606	576	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	With productivity and investment both low—what have we got to spur the economy other than continued accommodative monetary policy?	12.0	108.0
201606	577	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	As of now, we haven’t gotten either the productivity growth or investment we might have expected.	12.0	108.0
201606	578	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	I think it’s the headwinds story.	12.0	999.0
201606	579	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	And I think the crucial question is whether those headwinds are temporary or permanent, right?	12.0	999.0
201606	580	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	And so—	12.0	999.0
201606	581	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Or are the headwinds just time?	12.0	96.0
201606	582	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I mean—	12.0	96.0
201606	583	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	If you look out to 2021 through 2025, the forward interest rate in Japan is minus 4 basis points.	12.0	999.0
201606	584	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	That’s pretty low.	12.0	999.0
201606	585	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Which implies that it’s not a headwind.	12.0	96.0
201606	586	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	It implies it’s more a permanent feature of the environment.	12.0	96.0
201606	587	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Well, it’s why people think that it’s more a permanent feature—	12.0	999.0
201606	588	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Yes, think it is, but it’s a pretty low border.	12.0	999.0
201606	589	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, anyway, thank you.	12.0	96.0
201606	590	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	We will all think about these things.	12.0	999.0
201606	591	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Are there further—yes, President Lockhart.	12.0	65.0
201606	592	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	88.0
201606	593	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Back to Steve, if I could, and I’m asking you because you’ve talked on this subject before.	12.0	88.0
201606	594	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Exhibit 7, panels 1 and 2—if I interpret this correctly, with the exception of China debt, the picture doesn’t look elevated relative to conditions in ’94 and ’97.	12.0	88.0
201606	595	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	And you could conclude, looking at the vulnerability index, that it’s reasonably flat and that there’s no strong signal there.	12.0	88.0
201606	596	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	But then I look at the China debt and the EME composite with the dark blue for corporations and the red for households, and it pushes quite a bit above ’97 and ’94.	12.0	88.0
201606	597	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Could you update your thinking for us on China debt-related  risk?	12.0	88.0
201606	598	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	And I would note that there’s been a fair amount of publicity recently of major investors who are focused on this and shorting.	12.0	88.0
201606	599	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	So if you overlay short interest on this picture, how much risk do you get?	12.0	88.0
201606	600	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Sure.	12.0	999.0
201606	601	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	I’ll say a few things because you’ve addressed the question to me, but Shaghil’s actually pretty expert on this, so he can add on.	12.0	999.0
201606	602	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Just a couple points.	12.0	999.0
201606	603	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Number one, indeed, for the other countries, it falls below that Mexico ’94 and Asia financial crisis line.	12.0	999.0
201606	604	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	But those were pretty bad crises, and a lot of the countries here almost make it up to the Mexico ’94 line.	12.0	999.0
201606	605	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	And so, for that reason, we are looking at all the EMEs very closely—and a lot of other analysts are, too—because, as you can see, just looking at the numbers, all of these countries have experienced very substantial increases in debt to GDP.	12.0	999.0
201606	606	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	So just the fact that they haven’t made it up to those lines doesn’t mean there’s no cause for worry.	12.0	999.0
201606	607	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	The second point is, China, of course, is way above those lines, so it is more of a tangible risk.	12.0	999.0
201606	608	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	If China were, in fact, to have a hard landing, that could easily spill over to all these EMEs that are below the line.	12.0	999.0
201606	609	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	China therefore poses a substantial risk.	12.0	999.0
201606	610	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	How big a risk?	12.0	999.0
201606	611	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	The fact of the matter is, it’s very hard to gauge.	12.0	999.0
201606	612	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	What we know is that if we just look at China alone, it’s got corporate debt to GDP that’s over 200 percent of GDP.	12.0	999.0
201606	613	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	And it’s grown very rapidly.	12.0	999.0
201606	614	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Both the size and the fact that it’s grown rapidly are considered the best possible signals of an impending crisis.	12.0	999.0
201606	615	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	If China were any other EME, it likely would have had its crisis already.	12.0	999.0
201606	616	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	But China has very rapid growth, and that growth can paper over a lot of ills.	12.0	999.0
201606	617	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Also, the government has a very solid fiscal situation relative to most EME governments, with a huge stockpile of foreign exchange reserves, and most of that debt that Chinese corporations owe is in local currency, not in foreign currency.	12.0	999.0
201606	618	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	All those things help it.	12.0	999.0
201606	619	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	The long and the short of it is, it’s very hard to gauge how great the risk is in China, but it’s certainly very, very substantial.	12.0	999.0
201606	620	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Shaghil, is there anything you’d like to add to that?	12.0	999.0
201606	621	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Well, just to emphasize that point about mitigants, that a lot of this lending is just state-owned banks to state-owned enterprises.	12.0	999.0
201606	622	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	And China has plenty of resources to capitalize those banks—at a cost, of course, so it has these mitigants that other countries don’t have and can sustain a high level without crisis.	12.0	999.0
201606	623	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	I think the hard-landing scenario may be in the tail risk, but I think there’s a more significant risk that China could significantly slow without a hard landing.	12.0	999.0
201606	624	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	And I do think it’s underappreciated, what effect a less-than-hard landing slowing would have on the rest of the world.	12.0	999.0
201606	625	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	But, in terms of people shorting, I think that’s not as big a factor as it was earlier this year, except for one prominent investor.	12.0	999.0
201606	626	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	12.0	65.0
201606	627	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	999.0
201606	628	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	I want to go back to a few comments that were made about corporate investment and ask for your thinking on why this has been so low.	12.0	999.0
201606	629	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	One of the things that my staff pointed out to me is that, if you look at a graph of net private nonresidential fixed assets versus nonfarm private employees, we’re well above trend because of the Great Recession—which makes sense, right?	12.0	999.0
201606	630	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Do you lay a lot of people off?	12.0	999.0
201606	631	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	But you’re starting to see that return to trendline.	12.0	999.0
201606	632	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	So one story is that we will start to see that pick up as firms get back to trend in terms of capital stock relative to employees.	12.0	999.0
201606	633	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Have you looked at that in terms of your forecast?	12.0	999.0
201606	634	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	It’s the one area that I worry about with respect to spending, because consumer spending is robust, it’s strong, but we’re not seeing business investment picking up.	12.0	999.0
201606	635	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	But there may be a reason for that, in that we had a lot of capital, we’re now reaching a trend ratio, and that should start to pick up.	12.0	999.0
201606	636	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Have you thought about that?	12.0	999.0
201606	637	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Has that been built into your forecast?	12.0	999.0
201606	638	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	One thing that we have looked at is the capital-to-effective-worker ratio, which is a measure of capital relative to workers adjusted for productivity.	12.0	999.0
201606	639	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Another way to put that is, it’s the capital-to-potential-output ratio that you want to look at.	12.0	999.0
201606	640	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	And potential output is slowing, and therefore we would expect the growth rate of the capital stock to slow.	12.0	999.0
201606	641	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	There was a FEDS Notes article that was written a year or two ago by some of my colleagues that tried to adduce that as one of the explanations for why the rate of growth of the capital stock might not be as rapid in a period in which potential growth is slower.	12.0	999.0
201606	642	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Now, one thing we have trouble doing is trying to gauge exactly where the target capital stock should be, and if we’re behind or ahead of that.	12.0	999.0
201606	643	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	We tried to do it a lot in the late ’90s.	12.0	999.0
201606	644	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	We never had a lot of luck in measuring capital overhang or something like that, so we don’t usually try to look at a particular target level for the capital stock and then key the forecast off that.	12.0	999.0
201606	645	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	What we do is, our full fundamentals model backs out our investment forecast by looking at the growth rate of business output.	12.0	999.0
201606	646	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	To the extent that business output has been doing what it’s doing, we can explain, over most of recent history, what’s been going on with business investment, except very recently.	12.0	999.0
201606	647	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Very recently, it’s very difficult for us to explain why it’s been so weak.	12.0	999.0
201606	648	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	One of the things that one of my colleagues presented on Monday in her pre-FOMC briefing was the possible explanations as to what could be driving that weakness and how much we think those explanations carry water.	12.0	999.0
201606	649	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	And the answer is, I think it’s pretty hard for us to explain what’s going on with recent softness in business investment.	12.0	999.0
201606	650	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Even if you combine all of those explanations, and we have something quantitatively, we can’t really get most of the way there, which suggests it could just be bad luck, noise, or something like that.	12.0	999.0
201606	651	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	But we don’t really have a satisfactory reason for why it’s been so weak recently.	12.0	999.0
201606	652	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	Our thinking is very similar to yours.	12.0	999.0
201606	653	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	I’m going to try to boost the citation count for my colleagues.	12.0	999.0
201606	654	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	The FEDS Notes article that Jeremy referenced was written by Eugenio Pinto and Stacey Tevlin, and that’s available on our website.	12.0	999.0
201606	655	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	The model that they present there does a good job of accounting for business fixed investment, I think, through about the third quarter of last year, something like that.	12.0	999.0
201606	656	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	In our assessment, it’s the last couple of quarters that have been a bit of a puzzle.	12.0	999.0
201606	657	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	And there’s no real reason that you can give why that’s the case?	12.0	999.0
201606	658	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	As Jeremy mentioned, Ekaterina Peneva summarized a variety of hypotheses.	12.0	999.0
201606	659	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	Corporations have expressed some concern about weakness in their profits.	12.0	999.0
201606	660	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	We’ve wondered about spillover from the drilling and mining collapse into other elements of investment.	12.0	999.0
201606	661	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	A number of outside analysts have pointed to the possibility that uncertainty is unusually high, perhaps related to geopolitical concerns or domestic political concerns.	12.0	999.0
201606	662	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	These things have an air of plausibility to them.	12.0	999.0
201606	663	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	They’re very hard to test, empirically, how significant they are.	12.0	999.0
201606	664	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	It’s not more than a sense, but I think I’d agree exactly with the summary that Jeremy gave, which is, our sense is that they probably account for some of the weakness in the past few quarters.	12.0	999.0
201606	665	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	But it’s an inherently volatile series.	12.0	999.0
201606	666	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	We think it’s been puzzlingly weak the last couple of quarters.	12.0	999.0
201606	667	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	It’s an element of concern for us.	12.0	999.0
201606	668	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Thank you.	12.0	999.0
201606	670	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Any further questions?	52.0	65.0
201606	671	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	52.0	65.0
201606	672	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, I suggest we take a break, maybe for about 20 minutes, and return around 3 pm .	52.0	65.0
201606	673	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, folks.	52.0	65.0
201606	674	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Let us resume.	13.0	65.0
201606	675	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I think we can begin our economic go- round.	13.0	65.0
201606	676	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to call on President Bullard first.	13.0	65.0
201606	677	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201606	678	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I’m going to devote my comments today to the St Louis Federal Reserve’s new characterization of the outlook for the US economy.	13.0	94.0
201606	679	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The St Louis Federal Reserve is changing its characterization of the US macroeconomic and monetary policy outlook.	13.0	94.0
201606	680	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	An older narrative that the Bank has been using since the financial crisis ended has now likely outlived its usefulness, so it is being replaced by a new narrative.	13.0	94.0
201606	681	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The hallmark of the new narrative is to think of medium- and longer-term macroeconomic outcomes in terms of regimes.	13.0	94.0
201606	682	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The concept of a single long-run steady state to which the economy is converging is abandoned and replaced by a set of possible regimes that the economy may visit.	13.0	94.0
201606	683	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Regimes are generally viewed as persistent, and optimal monetary policy is viewed as regime dependent.	13.0	94.0
201606	684	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Switches between regimes are viewed as not forecastable.	13.0	94.0
201606	685	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The upshot is that the new approach delivers a very simple forecast of US macroeconomic outcomes over the next two and a half years.	13.0	94.0
201606	686	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Over this horizon, the forecast is for output growth of 2 percent, unemployment of 4.7 percent, and inflation of 2 percent.	13.0	94.0
201606	687	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	In light of this new approach and the associated forecast, the appropriate regime-dependent policy rate path is 63 basis points over the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201606	688	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	My remarks today will describe how this regime could be upset by switches in fundamental factors that may cause changes in the recommended setting of the policy rate path.	13.0	94.0
201606	689	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	It is a good time to consider a regime-based conception of medium- and longer-term macroeconomic outcomes.	13.0	94.0
201606	690	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Key macroeconomic variables, including output growth, unemployment, and inflation, appear to be at or near values that are likely to persist over the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201606	691	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We think of this as the mean outcome of the “current regime.”	13.0	94.0
201606	692	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Of course, the situation can and will change in the future, but exactly how is difficult to predict.	13.0	94.0
201606	693	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Therefore, the best we can do today is to forecast that the current regime will persist and set policy appropriately for this regime.	13.0	94.0
201606	694	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	If there’s a switch to a new regime in the future, then that will likely affect all variables, including the policy rate.	13.0	94.0
201606	695	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	But such a switch is not forecastable.	13.0	94.0
201606	696	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Consistent with the regime-based concept, the new approach does not contain projected long-run values for either macroeconomic variables or the policy rate; that is, the forecast simply stops at two and a half years.	13.0	94.0
201606	697	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Again, the new narrative views medium- and longer-term macroeconomic outcomes in terms of a set of possible regimes that the economy may visit instead of a single, unique steady state.	13.0	94.0
201606	698	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	By doing this, we are backing off the idea that we have dogmatic certainty about where the US economy is headed in the medium and longer run.	13.0	94.0
201606	699	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We are trying to replace that dogmatic certainty with a manageable expression of the uncertainty surrounding medium- and longer-run outcomes.	13.0	94.0
201606	700	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	By doing so, we hope to provide a better description of the nature of the data dependence of monetary policy in the period ahead.	13.0	94.0
201606	701	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Fundamental factors determine the nature of the regimes in play.	13.0	94.0
201606	702	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	One important fundamental is productivity growth.	13.0	94.0
201606	703	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The average productivity growth rate in the United States has been low since at least 2011.	13.0	94.0
201606	704	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We think of this as a “low productivity growth” regime.	13.0	94.0
201606	705	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We know from past observation of the US economy that productivity could switch to a “high growth” regime.	13.0	94.0
201606	706	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	If such a switch occurred, it might have important effects on many variables but especially on output growth, which would be higher.	13.0	94.0
201606	707	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Because we view the low-productivity-growth regime as very persistent, for purposes of forecasting, we simply assume that we will remain in the low-productivity-growth regime—and hence the “low output growth” regime—throughout the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201606	708	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The idea that productivity may switch to a high-growth regime is not incorporated in the forecast directly but is an upside risk to the forecast.	13.0	94.0
201606	709	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The switch to the high-growth regime is viewed as possible but not forecastable.	13.0	94.0
201606	710	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	But simply having a high- and low-productivity-growth regime is insufficient to describe the current macroeconomic situation.	13.0	94.0
201606	711	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	There are at least two other fundamental factors that have to remain in their current state to maintain the status quo.	13.0	94.0
201606	712	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	One of these fundamentals is the real rate of return on short-term government debt.	13.0	94.0
201606	713	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	This return is very low today by recent historical standards, perhaps less than negative 1 percent.	13.0	94.0
201606	714	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	In our framework, we view this as a “low real rate” regime.	13.0	94.0
201606	715	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The alternative regime, which has been observed historically, is for a considerably higher value of this rate.	13.0	94.0
201606	716	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Again, we view the current low-real-rate regime as very persistent.	13.0	94.0
201606	717	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	So, for purposes of forecasting, we simply assume that we will remain in the low-real-rate regime through the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201606	718	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	A switch to the “high real rate” regime is possible and, if it occurred, would likely affect many variables in the system, including the appropriate policy rate.	13.0	94.0
201606	719	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	But the possibility of such a switch does not enter directly into the forecast.	13.0	94.0
201606	720	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Instead, it is a risk to the forecast.	13.0	94.0
201606	721	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Let me note that although the real return to short-term government debt is low today, the real return to capital does not appear to have declined meaningfully.	13.0	94.0
201606	722	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	For this reason, we prefer to interpret the low real rate of return on short-term government debt not as reflecting low real returns throughout the economy, as in the simple New Keynesian model, but instead as an abnormally large liquidity premium on government debt.	13.0	94.0
201606	723	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We sometimes refer to this value as r† to distinguish it from the more commonly discussed r*.	13.0	94.0
201606	724	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	A third fundamental is the possibility of recession, perhaps driven in part by a collapse in asset prices—as occurred for the housing crisis during the 2006–09 period—or other factors.	13.0	94.0
201606	725	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We are currently in a “no recession” state, but it is possible that we could switch to a “recession” state.	13.0	94.0
201606	726	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	If a switch occurred, all variables would be affected, but, most notably, unemployment would rise substantially.	13.0	94.0
201606	727	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Again, the possibility of such a switch does not enter directly into the forecast because we have no reason to forecast a recession, in light of the data available today.	13.0	94.0
201606	728	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The possibility of a recession is, instead, a risk to the forecast.	13.0	94.0
201606	729	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We have described a very basic set of fundamental factors as following regime-switching stochastic processes.	13.0	94.0
201606	730	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The current configuration is, one, low growth; two, low real rate on short- term government debt; and, three, no recession.	13.0	94.0
201606	731	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Conditional on this configuration, our forecast is the one I described at the beginning of my remarks.	13.0	94.0
201606	732	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The recommended policy rate is then regime dependent.	13.0	94.0
201606	733	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The value of 63 basis points for the policy rate over the forecast horizon could be viewed in terms of a one-year Fisher equation with expected inflation at 2 percent.	13.0	94.0
201606	734	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The value of the real rate in the low-real-rate regime of short-term government debt—the so-called r†— would then have to be the value that would solve this equation.	13.0	94.0
201606	735	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	That would be minus 137 basis points.	13.0	94.0
201606	736	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	If you look at the ex post real rate, as measured by the one-year nominal Treasury yield less the 12- month Dallas Federal Reserve trimmed mean inflation rate over the past three years, it has been very close to this value.	13.0	94.0
201606	737	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	There are risks to this forecast in the sense that any of these fundamental factors could switch to alternative values, thus knocking the system out of the current regime.	13.0	94.0
201606	738	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	What are the risks to this forecast aside from those associated with switching in one of the fundamentals?	13.0	94.0
201606	739	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We think a key risk not expressed in the regime-switching part of the description may be on inflation.	13.0	94.0
201606	740	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We have described a situation in which Phillips-curve influences on inflation are negligible.	13.0	94.0
201606	741	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Low unemployment and generally strong labor markets, despite being in place throughout the forecast horizon, do not put upward pressure on inflation in the forecast we have described.	13.0	94.0
201606	742	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	It could be that meaningful Phillips-curve mechanisms return and drive inflation higher even though nothing else about the situation as we have described it has changed.	13.0	94.0
201606	743	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	This is one risk.	13.0	94.0
201606	744	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	In addition, this forecast says little about incoming data on inflation expectations, which, according to market-based measures, seem to be too low to be consistent with the forecast we are describing.	13.0	94.0
201606	745	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The approach presented here also says little about the risk of asset price bubbles, a factor that often enters the actual policy discussion.	13.0	94.0
201606	746	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The forecast values for output growth, inflation, and unemployment in the new St Louis Federal Reserve forecast are only somewhat different from those given under the previous narrative.	13.0	94.0
201606	747	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The main difference in the new approach is in the characterization of the recommended future FOMC policy via the projected policy rate.	13.0	94.0
201606	748	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	In the previous narrative, we had a dogmatic medium- and long-run outcome for the economy expressed in terms of a single long-run steady state.	13.0	94.0
201606	749	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	In that formulation, all variables tend to trend toward values that are consistent with the assumed long-run outcome.	13.0	94.0
201606	750	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	This includes the policy rate, which trended toward a value of 350 basis points, higher than it is today.	13.0	94.0
201606	751	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	If the Committee moved at a pace of 25 basis points per year, it would take 14 years to reach such a value.	13.0	94.0
201606	752	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	In the new narrative, uncertainty about possible medium- and longer-run outcomes is more explicitly taken into account.	13.0	94.0
201606	753	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The economy does not necessarily converge to a single steady state but, instead, may visit many possible regimes.	13.0	94.0
201606	754	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Regimes can be persistent, as we think the current one may be.	13.0	94.0
201606	755	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The timing of a switch to an alternative regime is viewed as not forecastable, so we simply forecast that the current regime will persist.	13.0	94.0
201606	756	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Policy is regime- dependent, leading to a recommended policy rate path that is essentially flat over the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201606	757	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Of course, the flat policy rate characterization is conditional on no switches occurring.	13.0	94.0
201606	758	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	If a switch does occur, then the policy rate would have to change appropriately.	13.0	94.0
201606	759	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	This is a form of data dependence.	13.0	94.0
201606	760	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We have described some of the risks to this forecast.	13.0	94.0
201606	761	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	And taking these risks into account, we think that, on balance, the policy rate path may be somewhat higher than the one we are forecasting over the next two and a half years.	13.0	94.0
201606	762	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	In this sense, we think there’s some upside risk to our forecast.	13.0	94.0
201606	763	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Nevertheless, by describing the expected policy rate path as essentially flat with some upside risk, and with no presumption about a long-run outcome, we hope we can provide a better description of our view of the current policy situation in this narrative as opposed to the previous formulation.	13.0	94.0
201606	764	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201606	765	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	766	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13.0	65.0
201606	767	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	107.0
201606	768	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	The data we’ve received since April have been mixed, which leaves considerable uncertainty about what to infer about the pace of progress toward our goals.	13.0	107.0
201606	769	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	I’ve found it helpful to think about the range of scenarios that might be plausibly consistent with the mix of data we’ve received so far.	13.0	107.0
201606	770	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	At one end of the range is the scenario in which activity continues to increase at the 2 to 2½ percent pace of the past three years, the economy has effectively reached full employment, and resource constraints should soon start to bind, putting stronger upward pressure on inflation and nominal wage growth.	13.0	107.0
201606	771	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent data offer some support for this scenario:  Consumer spending rebounded strongly in April and retail sales were strong in May, net exports appear to be exerting less of a drag on activity, and some labor market indicators suggest little slowing.	13.0	107.0
201606	772	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, initial claims for unemployment insurance remain near cyclical lows, and JOLTS job openings are at a cyclical high.	13.0	107.0
201606	773	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, with the unemployment rate having reached the median participant’s estimate of the longer-run rate and the staff estimating that the output gap is closed, it could be argued the economy has reached full employment.	13.0	107.0
201606	774	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	And some indications of a step-up in nominal wage growth and higher production costs for businesses could portend that resource constraints should soon start to bind.	13.0	107.0
201606	775	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	For example, compensation per hour in the business sector increased 3.7 percent over the past four quarters.	13.0	107.0
201606	776	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	When combined with anemic productivity growth, this has implied an increase in unit labor costs of nearly 3 percent over the same period.	13.0	107.0
201606	777	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In this “binding resource constraint” scenario, price pressures should soon become noticeable, with full employment reached and demand growth continuing to exceed supply by a healthy margin.	13.0	107.0
201606	778	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	If the outlook evolves in accordance with this scenario over the second half of this year, we should expect to see the unemployment rate continue to climb.	13.0	107.0
201606	779	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	The 12-month change in core PCE inflation should move up steadily, nominal wage growth should accelerate, and inflation expectations should begin to move up.	13.0	107.0
201606	780	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	At the other end of the plausibly consistent range is a scenario in which the recent employment report heralds a downshift in activity and labor market momentum.	13.0	107.0
201606	781	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In this “downshift” scenario, growth would move noticeably lower, and resource utilization would flatten out and possibly edge down even though the labor market hasn’t yet fully recovered.	13.0	107.0
201606	782	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Some of the recent data could be consistent with this scenario.	13.0	107.0
201606	783	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Over the past 12 months, manufacturing output has barely increased, while overall industrial production has fallen about 1 percent.	13.0	107.0
201606	784	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Assuming the staff projection for second-quarter GDP growth is correct, even with this morning’s positive read on retail sales, real GDP growth since the end of last summer looks to average only around 1.5 percent.	13.0	107.0
201606	785	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	The staff’s estimate of 2016 potential output growth is 1.6 percent.	13.0	107.0
201606	786	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	If activity continued at this subdued pace, this would suggest no further progress on employment and could jeopardize progress toward our inflation goal.	13.0	107.0
201606	787	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	The recent slowing has been concentrated in the business sector, which may reflect the continued strength in the dollar, weak foreign demand, and recent bouts of financial turbulence.	13.0	107.0
201606	788	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Business fixed investment has declined in the past two quarters and appears to be flat in the current quarter, a highly unusual outcome outside periods around recessions.	13.0	107.0
201606	789	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Recently, this weakness appears to have spread to business hiring.	13.0	107.0
201606	790	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Job growth in the past two months averaged only 100,000 after adjusting for the effects of the Verizon strike, not meaningfully above current estimates of the breakeven payroll job growth consistent with the unemployment rate remaining constant as the labor force returns to trend.	13.0	107.0
201606	791	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	The three-month moving average of the flow of workers from unemployment to employment—a proxy for hiring—has fallen since February.	13.0	107.0
201606	792	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Here, too, such a decline is unusual outside of periods around recessions.	13.0	107.0
201606	793	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	By these measures, both the labor market and the recent GDP data could be construed as signaling that growth is little different from potential.	13.0	107.0
201606	794	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In this downshift scenario, activity could turn out to have slowed to a pace that is barely sufficient to keep resource utilization at current levels.	13.0	107.0
201606	795	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Finally, between these two possibilities, we could expect to see a scenario of continued slow progress.	13.0	107.0
201606	796	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In such a scenario, growth would turn out to be somewhat below the 2.3 percent average pace over the past three years but rapid enough to put very gradual upward pressure on resource utilization.	13.0	107.0
201606	797	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	At the same time, while the economy is near full employment, some slack still exists, as evidenced by the still-depressed employment share of prime-age men that’s still more than 2 percentage points below pre-crisis norms.	13.0	107.0
201606	798	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	And supply curves are flat enough to require substantial further increases in resource utilization to push inflation to our 2 percent goal.	13.0	107.0
201606	799	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In this scenario, employment would continue to move higher through some combination of lower unemployment and higher participation; job growth would remain above breakeven levels; but progress on inflation would continue to be slow, with inflation reaching our 2 percent target only at the end of the medium term.	13.0	107.0
201606	800	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	At the same time, because the forces that have pushed down the neutral rate in recent years appear to be highly persistent, including forces emanating from abroad and very depressed productivity growth, the appropriate path of policy would likely be very shallow, and today’s policy settings would likely be closer to neutral than previously expected.	13.0	107.0
201606	801	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	On balance, my baseline forecast is for this continued slow progress scenario, but the data picture so far is sufficiently clouded that it could potentially be consistent with any of these scenarios.	13.0	107.0
201606	802	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	As a consequence, additional data over the next several months will be particularly valuable to narrowing the bands of uncertainty and allowing us to be more confident about the outlook and the appropriate path for policy.	13.0	107.0
201606	803	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In view of this uncertainty, it’s also important to consider possible risks to inflation and activity.	13.0	107.0
201606	804	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Here we’ve seen recent improvement in conditions supportive of progress on inflation over the medium term.	13.0	107.0
201606	805	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	The price of oil, in particular, has rebounded significantly from the lows reached earlier in the year.	13.0	107.0
201606	806	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	And the dollar has receded a bit, on net, from its peak in January.	13.0	107.0
201606	807	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, non-oil import prices look likely to firm this quarter after a year and a half of declines.	13.0	107.0
201606	808	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, the persistently low level of inflation, together with signs of a deterioration in inflation expectations, suggests that downside risks remain.	13.0	107.0
201606	809	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	With some survey-based measures of inflation expectations having moved lower in recent years, the preliminary June Michigan measure of inflation expectations touched an all-time low earlier this month.	13.0	107.0
201606	810	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, both swaps and TIPS market-based measures of inflation compensation have recently moved lower again even as the price of oil has moved higher, reversing the correlation that was apparent earlier.	13.0	107.0
201606	811	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	And the TIPS measure is now close to the low it touched earlier this year.	13.0	107.0
201606	812	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, the foreign outlook continues to present downside risks to activity and inflation, as we heard earlier today.	13.0	107.0
201606	813	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Most immediately, there is the possibility of a vote for Britain to leave the EU, which could unsettle financial markets and create a period of uncertainty while the relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU is renegotiated.	13.0	107.0
201606	814	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	We can’t rule out a significant adverse reaction to such an outcome in the near term, such as a substantial jump in financial risk premiums.	13.0	107.0
201606	815	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, we cannot dismiss the possible reemergence of risks surrounding China and other emerging market economies.	13.0	107.0
201606	816	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Although capital outflows from China have moderated as pressures on the exchange rate have eased, should those exchange rate pressures vis-à-vis the dollar reemerge, financial stress could return—a development that would affect not only China but also emerging markets linked to China via supply chains and commodity exports and, of course, conditions here.	13.0	107.0
201606	817	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	While authorities in China have taken steps to limit the extent of any slowdown, there is an evident tension in policy between reform and stimulus.	13.0	107.0
201606	818	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	And the effect of the stimulus may already be waning.	13.0	107.0
201606	819	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	High and growing levels of corporate debt, excess capacity, and risks in the shadow banking sector could create continued vulnerabilities over the medium term.	13.0	107.0
201606	820	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	More broadly, global markets are likely to remain fragile for some time.	13.0	107.0
201606	821	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Growth in advanced economies remains highly dependent on extraordinary unconventional monetary policy measures.	13.0	107.0
201606	822	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	With conventional policy in many countries continuing to be constrained near the effective lower bound, this skews risks to the downside and may amplify the sensitivity of exchange rates.	13.0	107.0
201606	823	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Indeed, recent work by the staff that was also referred to earlier provides support for the observation that, over the past year, dollar exchange rate movements have become considerably greater in response to monetary policy surprises than previously.	13.0	107.0
201606	824	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Thus, while the easing in financial conditions is very welcome, it’s important to recognize that fragility remains and an important reason for the fading of the recent turbulence was the expectation of more-gradual US monetary policy tightening.	13.0	107.0
201606	825	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Should an event trigger renewed fears about global growth or a reassessment of the policy reaction function, turbulence could well return.	13.0	107.0
201606	826	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	107.0
201606	827	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	828	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13.0	65.0
201606	829	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201606	830	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Even without the disappointing payroll numbers we received on June 3, we would very likely have waited to decide whether to change the interest rate until our July meeting because of the economic uncertainties for the United Kingdom and the European Union that a decision by the United Kingdom to leave the EU would create and because of the wider economic and financial consequences, including for the United States, that such a decision could cause.	13.0	108.0
201606	831	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Delaying raising the interest rate would have been the right decision.	13.0	108.0
201606	832	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	We would, in any case, have been focusing today and tomorrow on what decision we should make in July and in the FOMC meetings that follow.	13.0	108.0
201606	833	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	If the decision next Thursday is for Brexit, we will likely need at least another month, and probably more than that, after July to begin to understand the consequences of that decision for the British, European, and other economies.	13.0	108.0
201606	834	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Whatever the referendum decision on British membership in the EU, we will also have to appraise the recent weakening in payroll data.	13.0	108.0
201606	835	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	In light of the May payroll data and the downward revision to payrolls in April, the main question we will need to answer in July is whether recent data may be a result of the start of a significant slowdown in employment growth or, rather, reflect the month-to-month noise that is likely to appear in any macroeconomic time series.	13.0	108.0
201606	836	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	We’ll have only one more set of payroll data to help us choose between these hypotheses.	13.0	108.0
201606	837	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	If we conclude that employment growth is slowing significantly, then, in order to judge whether we are at least maintaining the important progress we have made toward our full employment mandate, we will have to pay more attention to the number of additions to payrolls that are needed to maintain full employment.	13.0	108.0
201606	838	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	The answer depends on the trend in the labor force participation rate.	13.0	108.0
201606	839	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	In their forecast, the staff projects average monthly increases in employment as 160,000 this year, increasing to 190,000 next year, and slowing to 150,000 in 2018.	13.0	108.0
201606	840	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	This path is sufficient to reduce the unemployment rate to 4.3 percent at the end of 2018, with the unemployment rate estimated to decline late in 2018 from 4.5 to 4.3 percent.	13.0	108.0
201606	841	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	From these data, I conclude that, following the publication of the first estimate of 160,000 for the net payroll increase in April, we should have been more vigorous in explaining to the public that although that number was below our forecast and that of others, it was still adequate to prevent increases in unemployment, conditional on plausible behavior in the participation rate—though, of course, that is not the case for the May payroll data.	13.0	108.0
201606	842	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Just to explain, I was amazed that there were so many headlines about adverse data following the 160,000 number.	13.0	108.0
201606	843	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Actually, the data were adverse from the viewpoint of expectations but were not adverse from the viewpoint of employment.	13.0	108.0
201606	844	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	One small point before continuing our discussion of our June, July, and later decisions—I wondered, at one stage, whether the adjustment the staff has made to the monetary policy rule used to construct the forecast could be a case of a self-fulfilling forecast, leading the median SEP monetary policy forecast path to come closer to the path implied by the new rule introduced by the staff.	13.0	108.0
201606	845	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I concluded that it probably is not such a case and that, by basing the staff forecast on what appears to be a more plausible path for the funds rate, the staff has made the forecast more helpful for us.	13.0	108.0
201606	846	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Now, back to my current thinking about July.	13.0	108.0
201606	847	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t believe we should send any strong signal to the markets this month about our July decision, even—or especially—in the form of a Brexit outcome conditional statement.	13.0	108.0
201606	848	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	But we should certainly continue to deepen our internal discussion.	13.0	108.0
201606	849	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	First, there are at least four reasons why we might want to make no change in the interest rate at our next meeting.	13.0	108.0
201606	850	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	One, the economy might, by then, look significantly weaker than we had hoped and than it does now.	13.0	108.0
201606	851	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Two, we might have concluded, on the basis of recent declines and indicators of the expected inflation rate, particularly in the Michigan series, that the trend of inflation is declining.	13.0	108.0
201606	852	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I’d like to add a word about that.	13.0	108.0
201606	853	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I’ve never been quite clear in the Michigan series as to what entitled us to deduct 100 basis points from the average of the Michigan series before we started and then to conclude that what we had was an estimate of expected inflation.	13.0	108.0
201606	854	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I think what we may equally likely have had is a bunch of people who took a very long time to absorb what was actually happening, saw that for the past decade or so they’d been overestimating the rate of inflation and are gradually beginning to reduce the rate of inflation that they expect.	13.0	108.0
201606	855	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	They have now hit 2.3 percent.	13.0	108.0
201606	856	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	They’ve got another at least 0.3 percentage point, maybe 0.5, to go until they get to what is actually happening.	13.0	108.0
201606	857	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	So I’m not entirely clear about how to relate to the Michigan numbers, although I know how we have treated them for some time.	13.0	108.0
201606	858	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Three, the global economic situation may be problematic, though the staff forecasts offer a stronger global economy than we had feared earlier this year.	13.0	108.0
201606	859	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	And, four—this is why we might want to make no change at the next meeting—risk-management factors, arising from our proximity to the effective lower bound, would come into play.	13.0	108.0
201606	860	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Second, why might we want to increase the interest rate at our July meeting, thus moving farther along the road to normalization of asset prices and of the economy as a whole?	13.0	108.0
201606	861	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Well, one reason is, we might conclude—based in part on the higher rates of wage increase that we’ve seen recently and a core PCE price inflation rate that is at about 1.5 percent—that we are close to our targets, that the inflation rate is within close reach of 2 percent, and that we are already at very near full employment.	13.0	108.0
201606	862	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Two, we might want to put the interest rate back into action as a price that affects the timing of investment by increasing the cost of waiting to invest—a point that was made in the literature of the 1980s, notably in Ben Bernanke’s PhD thesis.	13.0	108.0
201606	863	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	And, three, we might want to increase the distance of the interest rate from the effective lower bound, in particular because it’s far from clear what, on balance, the very low interest rates are buying us.	13.0	108.0
201606	864	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Third, what should we be doing on the research front?	13.0	108.0
201606	865	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Well, one, we need to continue to work on improving our estimates of r*.	13.0	108.0
201606	866	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	And, two, we need to continue to analyze the factors that affect r*, such as the rate of technical progress on the capital stock and by asking what factors, including infrastructure, determine the effective capital stock.	13.0	108.0
201606	867	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Here I’m concerned about the fact that we keep asking “What is r*?” without asking “What is it that the rest of the economy could do by changing their policy such that r* would become higher?”	13.0	108.0
201606	868	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	That leads to, three, the suggestion for research of quantifying the “only game in town” argument by refining the estimates of the effects on growth of the three arrows—monetary policy, fiscal policy, and structural reforms.	13.0	108.0
201606	869	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	And, four, analyzing how much we should take expected foreign economic developments into account.	13.0	108.0
201606	870	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Finally, I want to discuss briefly an issue that is close to a set of issues that I expected at least one participant in the meeting might mention.	13.0	108.0
201606	871	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	That participant has already spoken, and he didn’t quite mention the issues I thought he would, but I will continue.	13.0	108.0
201606	872	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I was originally surprised to read and to hear criticisms of data dependency—which one sees in the commentary on what the FOMC is doing all the time—which strikes me as the only way to deal with the uncertainties that the future presents to us.	13.0	108.0
201606	873	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	The main disadvantage of data dependency emphasized by critics appears to be that the markets may not know until quite near the meeting, or even until the FOMC’s decision is announced, what the interest rate decision will be.	13.0	108.0
201606	874	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Most market participants appear not to like that, and they express their dislike in the press and in the surveys that the New York Federal Reserve undertakes.	13.0	108.0
201606	875	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Well, what’s the alternative?	13.0	108.0
201606	876	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Presumably, it’s forward guidance, which carries with it the difficulty of changing the guidance—something we saw in the taper tantrum.	13.0	108.0
201606	877	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	However, the reason for data dependency is fundamental:  The future is uncertain.	13.0	108.0
201606	878	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	There’s not a whole lot we can do about that.	13.0	108.0
201606	879	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	So, one way or the other, modern monetary policy will continue to have to be data dependent.	13.0	108.0
201606	880	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	The effect of data dependency on the economy and on market participants depends on the structure of the financial system, the transmission mechanism of monetary policy to the economy, and the quality of monetary policy decisions.	13.0	108.0
201606	881	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	We have to keep working to make monetary policy more effective.	13.0	108.0
201606	882	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Obviously, we’re all doing that, but we should not blame data dependency for the difficulties that uncertainty about the future creates for market participants.	13.0	108.0
201606	883	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	However, I do believe that criticisms of the data dependency of our decisions relate, in large part, to our failure to emphasize to the public and to market participants how uncertain the future is.	13.0	108.0
201606	884	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	One of my reactions to my first SEP was to say that I could not fill in certain entries because I had no idea what the growth rate would be three years from now.	13.0	108.0
201606	885	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Nonetheless, I ended up filling in the form, although I must admit that I didn’t feel any the wiser as to what the future growth rate would be.	13.0	108.0
201606	886	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I believe we need to emphasize our uncertainty about the future, for that way we will be informing the public about the uncertainties that beset our SEP forecast and preferences as well as about our policy decisions.	13.0	108.0
201606	887	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	And it will come as no surprise to any of you that I believe we can best do that by including fan charts in the presentations of the SEP results.	13.0	108.0
201606	888	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	13.0	108.0
201606	889	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	You weren’t ready for that?	13.0	108.0
201606	890	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	I was waiting for it.	13.0	97.0
201606	891	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Oh, good.	13.0	108.0
201606	892	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Well, you can shut me up very easily.	13.0	108.0
201606	893	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	No, no, no.	13.0	97.0
201606	894	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	More on that in July.	13.0	108.0
201606	895	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	13.0	108.0
201606	896	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	For now, the bottom line is that we should leave July open and await information that will, I hope, reduce the uncertainties that we face.	13.0	108.0
201606	897	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	That decision—the July decision—is truly data dependent, as it should be.	13.0	108.0
201606	898	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201606	899	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	900	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13.0	65.0
201606	901	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	102.0
201606	902	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Setting aside the employment report for the moment, the data since our April meeting have been consistent with continued moderate expansion.	13.0	102.0
201606	903	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, consumer spending has been surprisingly positive, boosted by rising incomes and favorable financial conditions.	13.0	102.0
201606	904	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Recent readings on inflation have also been encouraging.	13.0	102.0
201606	905	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Core inflation is running at 1.6 percent over the past year, and transitory factors that had been pushing inflation down are receding.	13.0	102.0
201606	906	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	For example, oil is now trading consistently around $50 a barrel.	13.0	102.0
201606	907	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Ignoring the employment report is akin to asking, “Other than that, Mrs.	13.0	102.0
201606	908	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Lincoln, how did you like the play?”	13.0	102.0
201606	909	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Job gains in May were modest, and previous months were revised down.	13.0	102.0
201606	910	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, some of the drop-off in May was due to the Verizon strike.	13.0	102.0
201606	911	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	But even adjusting for that, the published establishment data suggest a noticeable downward trend in job growth in recent months.	13.0	102.0
201606	912	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the slowdown in job gains seems out of tune with other recent indicators, like initial claims for unemployment insurance and household surveys on labor market conditions.	13.0	102.0
201606	913	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	So what signal should we take from this?	13.0	102.0
201606	914	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Our first step in extracting the signal from the noise is to do a bit of averaging.	13.0	102.0
201606	915	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Payroll gains over the past three months, adjusted for the effects of the Verizon strike, averaged a little more than 125,000 jobs per month.	13.0	102.0
201606	916	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s still a step-down from last year but well ahead of the 80,000 to 100,000 jobs we need to keep up with labor force growth.	13.0	102.0
201606	917	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Work by my staff suggests that even this number likely understates the underlying trend.	13.0	102.0
201606	918	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Exploiting county-level data on weather patterns, they assessed the contribution of monthly variation in local weather conditions to the job numbers.	13.0	102.0
201606	919	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	They found that, once one accounts for the effects of unusual weather patterns as well as the Verizon strike, job gains have averaged closer to 150,000 jobs for the past three months.	13.0	102.0
201606	920	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the adjusted number for May is only modestly below this pace, as opposed to the downward trend that we see in the unadjusted data.	13.0	102.0
201606	921	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	On the basis of this analysis and my own forecast for spending growth, I expect to see job gains averaging around 150,000 per month for the remainder of the year—again, after adjusting for the effects of the Verizon workers coming back.	13.0	102.0
201606	922	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, that’s definitely lower than the 230,000 jobs per month we saw last year, but it still means that we’ll be adding something like 1.8 million jobs this year, which, again, is well above the increase in the labor force.	13.0	102.0
201606	923	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I therefore expect the unemployment rate to drift further below the natural rate over the course of the year, reaching about 4.5 percent by year-end.	13.0	102.0
201606	924	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	With the economy having reached full employment with only 2 percent GDP growth, my staff and I have revisited the issue of the long-run growth rate of potential output.	13.0	102.0
201606	925	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the long run, two factors determine the speed at which the economy can grow in a balanced manner: labor productivity and the size of the labor force.	13.0	102.0
201606	926	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	So we looked over the past 40 years:  Total economy productivity—that is, GDP per hour for the total economy—has typically run between about 1 and 1¼ percent.	13.0	102.0
201606	927	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Since the ’70s, we’ve only deviated from this pace during the information technology boom of the late ’90s and early 2000s.	13.0	102.0
201606	928	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, the crystal ball is hazy about when the next technological revolution will arrive, although I assure you that everyone who works within an hour of me believes it’s already happening.	13.0	102.0
201606	929	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, in the meantime, a reasonable benchmark is that total economy productivity growth in the range of 1 to 1¼ percent is the normal incremental growth that we should expect in the future.	13.0	102.0
201606	930	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	This benchmark is consistent with the views expressed by Bob Gordon in his recent book, in my colleague John Fernald’s extensive work along with colleagues here at the Board, in research by the New York Fed, and in the literature on general purpose technologies.	13.0	102.0
201606	931	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Moreover, since educational attainment is unlikely to rise the way it did during much of the 20th century, the future pace of productivity growth will likely be at the lower end of this historical range.	13.0	102.0
201606	932	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	By that I mean not much above 1 percent, and that is my modal forecast for longer-run productivity growth for the total economy.	13.0	102.0
201606	933	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Turning to the next ingredient of potential output growth—the labor force: The notable development here is that the world is turning gray.	13.0	102.0
201606	934	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	The CBO projects that the labor force in the United States will grow about 0.5 percent per year over the next decade, and that’s a considerable drop from what we’ve experienced in the past 40 years.	13.0	102.0
201606	935	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	The transition of women to the labor force is long complete, and baby boomers are already retiring.	13.0	102.0
201606	936	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	That means that, unlike the 1970s and ’80s, demographics will hinder rather than boost potential output growth.	13.0	102.0
201606	937	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Putting these two ingredients—about 1 percent total productivity growth and the demographics— together, my new long-run forecast for potential GDP growth is 1.6 percent.	13.0	102.0
201606	938	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is, admittedly, a far cry from the 3 percent rates engrained back from our college days, but demographic trends are difficult to bend, and in many ways the die has already been cast.	13.0	102.0
201606	939	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	The slowdown in long-run growth isn’t unique to the United States.	13.0	102.0
201606	940	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	We heard about that in the briefing earlier today.	13.0	102.0
201606	941	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	In recent research by Kathryn Holston and Thomas Laubach here at the Board and myself, using the Laubach-Williams model, we also find secular declines in potential GDP growth in Canada, the euro area, and the United Kingdom.	13.0	102.0
201606	942	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I should note that we find large declines in the estimates of the natural rate of interest in these regions as well.	13.0	102.0
201606	943	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	And that brings me to my favorite topic:  r*.	13.0	102.0
201606	944	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Economic forces link the potential for growth and the natural rate of interest.	13.0	102.0
201606	945	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Along with this more subdued view of the US economy’s longer-run potential growth rate, I’ve lowered my long-run estimate of the natural rate of interest to 1 percent.	13.0	102.0
201606	946	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	As a result, my projection for the long-run value of the federal funds rate is 3 percent.	13.0	102.0
201606	947	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, my views in this regard match those that we saw in the Tealbook.	13.0	102.0
201606	948	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	All in all, I expect the economic expansion to proceed at a moderate pace, with GDP growth a touch under 2 percent this year.	13.0	102.0
201606	949	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Output and unemployment gaps have essentially closed already.	13.0	102.0
201606	950	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	And with substantial monetary stimulus still in play, I expect these aggregate indicators to overshoot their marks this year.	13.0	102.0
201606	951	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	This necessitates a continued gradual removal of policy accommodation over the next few years to bring output growth back below the rate of potential growth.	13.0	102.0
201606	952	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	As a result, my own projection has GDP growth slowing to around 1½ percent next year and in 2018.	13.0	102.0
201606	953	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	With labor markets forecast to be tight for three straight years, I expect inflation pressures to continue to build up and for there to be a modest overshoot by inflation of our 2 percent inflation target in 2018.	13.0	102.0
201606	954	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	As a result, I foresee the need to raise the funds rate above the long-run natural rate at the end of 2018 in order to bring the economy back to full employment and push inflation back to our 2 percent objective.	13.0	102.0
201606	955	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	From my estimate of the long-run growth rate, you can already figure out that I’m respondent number 16.	13.0	102.0
201606	956	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have one last comment in terms of President Bullard’s detailed discussion concerning these various regimes.	13.0	102.0
201606	957	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I obviously don’t come to that same conclusion.	13.0	102.0
201606	958	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	One of the things that I find in thinking about these issues is:  Is the macroeconomy fundamentally not behaving the way we would expect it to?	13.0	102.0
201606	959	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m drawn to Jeremy Rudd’s exhibit 4, panel 6—the VAR decomposition of core market-based inflation—or other analysis that Board and other economists have done, which basically shows that core inflation is behaving more or less as you would expect to see in a period of reasonably well-anchored inflation expectations.	13.0	102.0
201606	960	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ve seen dramatic increases in employment, declines in unemployment, over the past several years, reflecting, I think, very strong effects of monetary policy in boosting economic growth above potential, working in the way that we would expect to see.	13.0	102.0
201606	961	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I see the gaps closing.	13.0	102.0
201606	962	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I see, personally, inflation not far from a basic Phillips-curve model.	13.0	102.0
201606	963	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m not drawn at this time to see what is broken in our fundamental view of how monetary policy works in terms of affecting aggregate demand, how the Phillips-curve relationship works.	13.0	102.0
201606	964	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Obviously, as we know—as you can see in this picture—the data move around.	13.0	102.0
201606	965	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	There’s “noise,”	13.0	102.0
201606	966	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think, as Jeremy referred to it.	13.0	102.0
201606	967	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	But these are residuals to any of our equations.	13.0	102.0
201606	968	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	And when I look at the estimates of r*, the biggest driver of those, both for the United States and for the other countries in the recent work that we’ve been doing, is declines in long-run growth.	13.0	102.0
201606	969	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I consider that a standard result in pretty much any macroeconomic model that you write down, that if you have slower long-run trend growth, you’re going to have lower real interest rates.	13.0	102.0
201606	970	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think there are a lot of other factors at play, too, and we’ve talked about some of those in terms of a global saving glut, other risks, changes in risk premiums.	13.0	102.0
201606	971	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I guess I’m not feeling, right now, why I would want to abandon this basic framework of how I think about it.	13.0	102.0
201606	972	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I’m not trying to have a debate.	13.0	102.0
201606	973	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I just thought I’d respond because I thought those were very interesting remarks.	13.0	102.0
201606	974	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13.0	102.0
201606	975	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	976	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13.0	65.0
201606	977	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Could you just clarify the numbers you used?	13.0	108.0
201606	978	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	You used this estimate for natural long-run growth.	13.0	108.0
201606	979	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Assuming that we all live 70 years, which is no longer true, does that mean that income will double in each lifetime?	13.0	108.0
201606	980	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay, so you’re asking me a question I can answer and a question that I will get wrong.	13.0	102.0
201606	981	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’ll do the one I can answer, which is that our estimate of long-run trend growth for GDP is 1.6 percent.	13.0	102.0
201606	982	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Per capita?	13.0	108.0
201606	983	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	No.	13.0	102.0
201606	984	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Oh, 1 percent productivity growth.	13.0	102.0
201606	985	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m sorry, thank you, 1.6 percent for potential GDP.	13.0	102.0
201606	986	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Basically, 1 percent on productivity and 0.6 percentage point on labor force growth, is how it works out.	13.0	102.0
201606	987	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Roughly 1.05 and 0.55, I think, is what we have.	13.0	102.0
201606	988	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	The way I think about this is, go back to the ’70s and ’80s.	13.0	102.0
201606	989	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	How did we get potential growth at 3 percent?	13.0	102.0
201606	990	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Well, we basically had this 1.25 percent productivity growth.	13.0	102.0
201606	991	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	We had a lot of labor force growth.	13.0	102.0
201606	992	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	The reason we think of 3 percent as normal is because the labor force during that period was growing fast.	13.0	102.0
201606	993	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Productivity was bad.	13.0	102.0
201606	994	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s why it was called the productivity slowdown.	13.0	102.0
201606	995	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	But the other thing is, even within the productivity of that 1¼ percent that we had, some of that was basically increases in human capital per person.	13.0	102.0
201606	996	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Educational attainment was moving up year by year about two- or three-tenths.	13.0	102.0
201606	997	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Today the best estimates from the various economists are that educational attainment per person for the next 5 to 10 years will probably be only adding maybe 0 to 0.1 percentage point to productivity.	13.0	102.0
201606	998	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s how I get to something like 1 to 1.1 percent for productivity growth and something like 0.5 for labor force.	13.0	102.0
201606	999	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	So that’s potential GDP of 1.6 percent.	13.0	102.0
201606	1000	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t know how to answer your other question—I’m not going to try to do the math.	13.0	102.0
201606	1001	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Seventy years—you’ll double your income level.	13.0	96.0
201606	1002	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes, right.	13.0	102.0
201606	1003	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s all downside risk.	13.0	102.0
201606	1004	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13.0	65.0
201606	1005	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201606	1006	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Just to respond a little bit to President Williams, I think that you asked, “Well, what’s broken?”	13.0	94.0
201606	1007	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Our gaps are close to zero, but the policy rate is way below what we would associate with the normal steady state.	13.0	94.0
201606	1008	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	And I think what we’ve done is struggle with that by saying, “Okay.	13.0	94.0
201606	1009	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The productivity growth rate is moving around,” as you just described.	13.0	94.0
201606	1010	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Or, “Maybe the value of r* is different from what we’re used to.”	13.0	94.0
201606	1011	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	And all we’re doing is saying that maybe those are following switching processes instead of mean-reverting processes.	13.0	94.0
201606	1012	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	If you thought r* was low today but is going to revert to the steady- state value, or productivity growth is low today but it’s going to revert, then everything would go back to the old steady state.	13.0	94.0
201606	1013	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	And then you’d have this upward-sloping path for the policy rate.	13.0	94.0
201606	1014	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	What we did is replace those with switching processes.	13.0	94.0
201606	1015	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	So you just stay at the low r* or the low productivity for the next two-and-a-half years, and you don’t make a prediction about the long run.	13.0	94.0
201606	1016	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	And then you say, “Well, the policy is regime dependent.	13.0	94.0
201606	1017	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	So as long as we’re in this regime, this is the best we can do while we’re in the regime.	13.0	94.0
201606	1018	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	It may switch in the future, and we’ll certainly look out for that, but we’re not going to be drawing pictures in which it’s going back to some presumed mean in the long run.”	13.0	94.0
201606	1019	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	1020	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	13.0	65.0
201606	1021	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201606	1022	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Like the Tealbook, my modal forecast has not changed much.	13.0	90.0
201606	1023	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	I expect growth to be somewhat faster than potential, the unemployment rate to decline below the natural rate, and both core and total PCE inflation rates to be only slightly below 2 percent by the end of next year.	13.0	90.0
201606	1024	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	The monetary policy assumption that goes with this forecast is for two increases in the federal funds rate this year and then more frequent increases in subsequent years, as the forecast expects us to hit the inflation target and to exceed full employment.	13.0	90.0
201606	1025	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	The same is roughly true of most private forecasters—relatively little change in the outlook since our April meeting.	13.0	90.0
201606	1026	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	A key question is why so little change in the forecast has produced such wide fluctuations in the market perceptions of the appropriate path of monetary policy.	13.0	90.0
201606	1027	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	With the model forecasts produced by our bank and the Tealbook both changing little, it might plausibly turn to the risks and uncertainties surrounding the forecast as an explanation for market movements.	13.0	90.0
201606	1028	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	The Tealbook did a nice job of considering scenarios that I felt were most relevant to assessing risks.	13.0	90.0
201606	1029	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	I found it interesting that the staff viewed the uncertainty surrounding their projection as being quite similar to the average over the past 20 years.	13.0	90.0
201606	1030	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Looking at the first scenario, the “Recession” scenario, seemed to be the right place to start.	13.0	90.0
201606	1031	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	I personally think the risk of a recession remains quite low.	13.0	90.0
201606	1032	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think the most recent labor market report was quite disappointing.	13.0	90.0
201606	1033	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	The negative surprise on both payroll employment and on labor force participation probably do warrant waiting for more data to assess whether the most recent report is an anomaly.	13.0	90.0
201606	1034	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	My current assessment is that it is.	13.0	90.0
201606	1035	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	First-quarter GDP estimates have been moving up, and my forecast for the second quarter is for growth exceeding 2 percent.	13.0	90.0
201606	1036	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	One interpretation of that pattern is that seasonal growth patterns have not been well captured by the BEA, and that averaging over the first half may be more appropriate than focusing on quarterly patterns.	13.0	90.0
201606	1037	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	My estimate of average growth for the first half of 2016 is about equal to my estimate of potential, consistent with my view that spending data do not seem to be a harbinger of a broader slowdown.	13.0	90.0
201606	1038	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Spending data also are likely to be buoyed by the easing of financial conditions that we have seen.	13.0	90.0
201606	1039	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	With longer-term rates lower, markets are provided a more accommodative financial environment.	13.0	90.0
201606	1040	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Furthermore, initial claims data do not seem to portend widespread concern by employers.	13.0	90.0
201606	1041	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	My working assumption is that the most recent employment report reflects the temporary effects of the Verizon strike plus the kind of monthly fluctuation that can occur in view of the error inherent in estimating monthly payroll employment.	13.0	90.0
201606	1042	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Still, additional data will be helpful in determining whether that assessment is correct.	13.0	90.0
201606	1043	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	The second scenario that I found relevant was the “Disorderly Brexit” scenario.	13.0	90.0
201606	1044	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Even with a more adverse scenario than expected by the staff and conditioned on a leave vote, the Tealbook scenario does not expect the unemployment rate to rise back to 5 percent.	13.0	90.0
201606	1045	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Interestingly, on a recent trip to Europe, the central bankers I spoke with were unanimous about the greatest risk to financial stability, and it was not Brexit—it was the electoral process and possible outcome in the United States.	13.0	90.0
201606	1046	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	The fact that, a few weeks before the Brexit vote, the big concern of Europeans was not the United Kingdom possibly leaving the European Union but the US elections highlights why using elections to defer monetary policy actions can be tricky and why many in the market think it is unlikely we’ll tighten later in the year, a topic I will return to tomorrow.	13.0	90.0
201606	1047	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	The scenario I am most worried about is the “Weaker Productivity” scenario.	13.0	90.0
201606	1048	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	For reasons I will explain, this is the scenario most likely to result in a recession.	13.0	90.0
201606	1049	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	With growth a little over 2 percent during the recovery, the unemployment rate has been declining much more than we have expected.	13.0	90.0
201606	1050	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is quite possible that growth averaging a bit above 2 percent, as in both my forecast and that of the staff, could result in an unemployment rate even lower than the significant decline below full employment already in the staff forecast, and that’s where the risk of recession enters.	13.0	90.0
201606	1051	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Historically, it is almost unprecedented in such circumstances that the unemployment rate returns just to the natural rate without undershooting it and culminating in a recession.	13.0	90.0
201606	1052	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	My biggest concern is that we could be repeating that pattern.	13.0	90.0
201606	1053	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201606	1054	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13.0	65.0
201606	1055	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201606	1056	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	My SEP forecast remains close to my December and March submissions.	13.0	104.0
201606	1057	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	I see real GDP increasing about 2 percent this year, somewhat faster than its potential rate.	13.0	104.0
201606	1058	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	I expect the labor market to continue to tighten, with unemployment declining to 4½ percent by the end of this year and remaining near there in 2017 and ’18.	13.0	104.0
201606	1059	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	I see core inflation coming in this year at 1.6 percent and moving up to 2 percent by 2018 as the economy tightens further and as the effects of past dollar appreciation and the plunge in oil prices fade.	13.0	104.0
201606	1060	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	I wrote down two rate increases for this year and three for each of the next two years, admittedly with low levels of confidence.	13.0	104.0
201606	1061	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Over the past three years, a strong labor market has allowed the Committee to look through sometimes volatile readings on GDP.	13.0	104.0
201606	1062	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Payroll growth averaged well over 200,000 per month from the beginning of 2013 even through the latest readings in May.	13.0	104.0
201606	1063	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	The unemployment rate declined over that period by more than 3 percent, including three-tenths this year and eight-tenths over the past 12 months through May.	13.0	104.0
201606	1064	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	And, like others, I have taken the view that the stronger labor market data, not the GDP data, are the better measure of the underlying strength and cyclical position of the economy.	13.0	104.0
201606	1065	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	The strength of the labor market and the quickly tightening unemployment gap provided perhaps the best argument for raising the federal funds rate last December for me.	13.0	104.0
201606	1066	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	And now payroll growth has hit a soft patch, with April and May jobs reports averaging about 100,000 jobs per month on a strike-adjusted basis, and, at this point, the range of plausible explanations for the apparent sudden weakening in payrolls is quite wide.	13.0	104.0
201606	1067	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	First, it could be just noise, resembling the temporary slumps we have seen in previous years.	13.0	104.0
201606	1068	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Six-month average payroll job growth plunged well below 200,000 in 2012 and then recovered, and there were other weak periods in 2013 and 2014 as well, but those too were followed by payroll growth well above 200,000.	13.0	104.0
201606	1069	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Second, alternatively, the April and May readings could be a sign that growth from now on will be accompanied by smaller, but still significant, job gains, which would point to stronger productivity growth.	13.0	104.0
201606	1070	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	And a third and more negative possibility is that it could turn out to be a sign of weakening demand.	13.0	104.0
201606	1071	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Of course, it is very hard to have much conviction about which of those explanations is the right one at this point.	13.0	104.0
201606	1072	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	My baseline, though, is a combination of the first two explanations rather than the last.	13.0	104.0
201606	1073	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	In this view, job growth has probably slowed but not nearly as much as suggested by the April and May job reports.	13.0	104.0
201606	1074	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Survey measures of both employers and individuals concerning the ease of filling or finding jobs indicate a healthy labor market.	13.0	104.0
201606	1075	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Wages are increasing faster than the combination of productivity and inflation, leading to rising real unit labor costs, which is consistent with the uptick in the labor share of income over the past year.	13.0	104.0
201606	1076	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	With unemployment roughly at the natural rate, wages now clearly if gradually rising, and indicators suggesting at most a modest margin of slack, perhaps we may see the arrival of slower payroll job growth as firms begin to respond to higher labor costs.	13.0	104.0
201606	1077	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	It is comforting to see a rebound in activity for Q2 and upward revisions for Q1 as well.	13.0	104.0
201606	1078	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Consumption increased robustly in April, led by strong retail and auto sales, and auto sales remained strong in May.	13.0	104.0
201606	1079	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Today’s strong retail sales report represents another welcome positive note, and conditions are quite supportive of strong consumption, including solid real income gains, a high ratio of household wealth to income, and a healthy level of consumer confidence.	13.0	104.0
201606	1080	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Investment has been weak, however, with business fixed investment falling in Q4 and Q1 and expected to edge down further in the current quarter.	13.0	104.0
201606	1081	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	A portion of the weakness stems from the lower oil prices, but the softness outside of the oil sector is troubling, as it suggests continued business expectations of weak demand and also a weaker path for capital deepening and, hence, the path of productivity.	13.0	104.0
201606	1082	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Inflation seems to be firming a bit, with core at 1.6 percent over the past 12 months through April, up a little bit from the prior year.	13.0	104.0
201606	1083	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	And, of course, core is still being held down by the indirect effects of lower oil prices and, more importantly, the declines due to the strength of the dollar.	13.0	104.0
201606	1084	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Looking through those factors, I see underlying inflation as being fairly close to 2 percent, and the fading of those influences should move core and total inflation to 2 percent over the medium term, particularly as resource utilization tightens further.	13.0	104.0
201606	1085	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Inflation expectations, however, continue to raise concerns, and this underscores the need to actually achieve 2 percent inflation.	13.0	104.0
201606	1086	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Productivity growth has been anemic, to be generous about it.	13.0	104.0
201606	1087	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	I expect productivity to rise only gradually, which is one reason why I expect the unemployment rate to decline over the remainder of the year to 4½ percent.	13.0	104.0
201606	1088	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	I see the domestic risks as nearly balanced despite the weaker labor data.	13.0	104.0
201606	1089	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	The risks posed from abroad remain to the downside, and although they have diminished and markets have calmed substantially since the turmoil of the first two months of the year, if the Brexit vote is to leave, there may be ramifications for our economy and for the path of policy.	13.0	104.0
201606	1090	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Inflation and growth remain low in many European economies and in Japan.	13.0	104.0
201606	1091	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	While China’s stimulus measures should support growth in the near term, the ongoing buildup of debt there is worrisome, and there’s also remaining uncertainty about China’s exchange rate policy.	13.0	104.0
201606	1092	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Despite our increase in the federal funds rate in December, financial conditions have actually eased somewhat on net since then, with interest rates down, the dollar down, and equity prices up.	13.0	104.0
201606	1093	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	In part, these developments reflect the market’s expectation that the Committee’s withdrawal of monetary accommodation will be even slower than had been expected.	13.0	104.0
201606	1094	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	The changing expectations reflect the ongoing learning of how low rates need to be to achieve our mandate, and I suspect that the learning process on that score is not yet complete.	13.0	104.0
201606	1095	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	In the meantime, I have lowered my estimate of the long-run federal funds rate to 2.75 percent.	13.0	104.0
201606	1096	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	To wrap up, while I do expect both spending and labor market data to remain solid for the next few quarters, the weaker recent labor market data suggest reason for caution in the near term.	13.0	104.0
201606	1097	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	More on that tomorrow.	13.0	104.0
201606	1098	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201606	1099	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	1100	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13.0	65.0
201606	1101	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	103.0
201606	1102	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Outside of the services sector, economic growth remains subdued in the Tenth District.	13.0	103.0
201606	1103	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Job growth is weak in areas dependent on energy production and manufacturing, while job growth continues to be relatively strong in areas concentrated in service sectors.	13.0	103.0
201606	1104	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Although job growth in the District continues to lag the nation, gains in service-sector employment have led to a modest improvement in overall District growth in recent months.	13.0	103.0
201606	1105	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	The housing market in the region continues to strengthen.	13.0	103.0
201606	1106	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Housing starts have improved notably this year, and home prices continue to rise as inventories have tightened.	13.0	103.0
201606	1107	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Mortgage delinquency rates also have trended lower except for energy-concentrated counties.	13.0	103.0
201606	1108	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Despite recent increases in energy prices, financial stress for District energy companies continues.	13.0	103.0
201606	1109	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Recently, four large energy firms headquartered in the region filed for bankruptcy, and credit ratings for several others have been marked lower.	13.0	103.0
201606	1110	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, past-due loans at our banks with energy exposures have been increasing and rose sharply in the first quarter of this year.	13.0	103.0
201606	1111	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, the District’s agricultural economy remains relatively weak, although futures prices for some key agricultural commodities have increased in the past few weeks, primarily because of supply disruptions in South America.	13.0	103.0
201606	1112	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Even so, farm income for 2016 is expected to be subdued.	13.0	103.0
201606	1113	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Turning to the national outlook, the May employment report was a surprise and has given me pause for how to interpret its signal.	13.0	103.0
201606	1114	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Clearly, manufacturing and the energy sector are still shedding jobs, and the question remains whether these adjustments are going to spill over more aggressively into the service sectors.	13.0	103.0
201606	1115	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	I take some reassurance from broader labor market measures.	13.0	103.0
201606	1116	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	For example, the Kansas City Federal Reserve Labor Market Conditions Indicators report two conditions being better than average in terms of the overall level of activity.	13.0	103.0
201606	1117	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	The other component, though, which captures momentum or the pace of improvement and is highly correlated with the Board staff’s LMCI, has declined since January, although it’s still a bit above its historical average.	13.0	103.0
201606	1118	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Whether the recent slowing reflects demographics or a slowing in activity will take time to determine.	13.0	103.0
201606	1119	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	On the other hand, the picture for aggregate demand, at least for the consumer, is quite positive.	13.0	103.0
201606	1120	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	The University of Michigan consumers’ assessment of current economic conditions is at its highest levels since July 2005.	13.0	103.0
201606	1121	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	We’ve seen improvements in recent consumption data, such as retail sales and autos.	13.0	103.0
201606	1122	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Household balance sheets also continue to strengthen, and wage growth has been steadily increasing.	13.0	103.0
201606	1123	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	The median measure of wage growth in the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s wage tracker, which tracks wage gains for individuals from one year to the next, is rising at its fastest rate since the crisis.	13.0	103.0
201606	1124	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	The overall distribution has also shifted higher as the 25th and 75th percentiles hit post-recession highs.	13.0	103.0
201606	1125	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of my real GDP forecast, I have marked it down modestly in 2016 and 2017 but otherwise expect growth to be slightly above trend.	13.0	103.0
201606	1126	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of risks, the decline in corporate profits, elevated inventory levels, and weak business fixed investment all suggest the corporate sector is facing some headwinds.	13.0	103.0
201606	1127	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, core inflation looks to have firmed, increasing 2.1 percent in the first quarter relative to the prior quarter at an annualized rate.	13.0	103.0
201606	1128	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	And I expect it to remain near 2 percent for the remainder of the year.	13.0	103.0
201606	1129	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	An interesting anecdote from one of our directors who noted that, as a result of lower margins in his retail business, his firm has hired a consultant to assist with implementing targeted price increases.	13.0	103.0
201606	1130	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	This is the first such report I’ve heard related to raising prices.	13.0	103.0
201606	1131	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	With the economy above full employment, output growth expected to increase faster than trend, rising wages, and the increase in commodity prices, I see support for inflation in the period ahead.	13.0	103.0
201606	1132	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	I continue to watch the lower longer-term inflation expectations, both market- and consumer- based measures, for signals.	13.0	103.0
201606	1133	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	But more broadly, in my view, current inflation rates seem consistent with price stability.	13.0	103.0
201606	1134	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	13.0	103.0
201606	1135	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	1136	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	13.0	65.0
201606	1137	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201606	1138	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Economic activity in the Third District continues to improve, but there has been some deceleration in overall growth.	13.0	999.0
201606	1139	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	The unemployment rate rose 0.3 percentage point to 5 percent in April, with the bulk of the increase arising from higher labor force participation as employment growth remained solid.	13.0	999.0
201606	1140	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Our manufacturing index nudged back into positive territory, but most of the subindexes, such as those for new orders and shipments, remained slightly negative.	13.0	999.0
201606	1141	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Manufacturers, however, continue to retain an optimistic view, with the future general activity index at 29.8, which is exactly its nonrecessionary average, and all future subindexes remain solidly in positive territory.	13.0	999.0
201606	1142	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Like the nation, my region’s manufacturing activity may have bottomed out.	13.0	999.0
201606	1143	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Nonmanufacturing activity in the District continues to grow modestly at a somewhat slower-than-historical rate as reflected by our Nonmanufacturing Business Outlook Survey headline activity index, which ticked up to 18.2 in May.	13.0	999.0
201606	1144	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Like our manufacturers, area service providers remain relatively optimistic with respect to future activity.	13.0	999.0
201606	1145	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Our Beige Book contacts reported a slight-to-modest improvement in economic conditions.	13.0	999.0
201606	1146	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Homebuilders have reported that economic activity increased only slightly during a somewhat soggy—some would say quite soggy—May.	13.0	999.0
201606	1147	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Permits have leveled off in the multifamily sector of the market, but single-family housing is showing signs of accelerated activity.	13.0	999.0
201606	1148	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	House prices are appreciating at a moderate pace, growing at less than half of the US average.	13.0	999.0
201606	1149	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Only in the Philadelphia metro area could one classify the housing market as vibrant.	13.0	999.0
201606	1150	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Consumers continue to spend at a modest clip, and the growth rate of bank lending has accelerated.	13.0	999.0
201606	1151	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	In our recent survey of labor market conditions, one-third of responding firms in the region indicated that it was harder to retain workers, as opposed to only 5 percent who found it easier.	13.0	999.0
201606	1152	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Additionally, 44 percent indicated they were increasing wages for select job categories, while 15 percent indicated they were increasing wages across the board.	13.0	999.0
201606	1153	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	One-half indicated they would be increasing employment, and a majority intended to increase wages for new hires.	13.0	999.0
201606	1154	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Thus, our contacts’ responses are consistent with the modest acceleration in wage growth occurring nationally and much of what we are seeing in the JOLTS data.	13.0	999.0
201606	1155	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Overall, the Philadelphia region should see steady, if unspectacular, growth, and contacts are generally upbeat about the future.	13.0	999.0
201606	1156	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Turning to the nation as a whole, the latest employment report is a cause for concern.	13.0	999.0
201606	1157	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	It is also a bit puzzling, as economic activity appeared to have strengthened of late.	13.0	999.0
201606	1158	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	The two series seem a bit disconnected, with robust employment and weak demand in Q1 and a pickup in activity and a weakening in employment in the current quarter.	13.0	999.0
201606	1159	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Job openings in April were at historic highs, and unemployed workers continue to find jobs at a healthy pace.	13.0	999.0
201606	1160	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	In any event, labor market behavior will weigh heavily on my views of appropriate monetary policy.	13.0	999.0
201606	1161	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	My forecast of real economic activity is fairly consistent with that of the staff and is little changed from the one I made in March.	13.0	999.0
201606	1162	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	An important assumption underlying my view is that the labor force participation rate will continue to be largely governed by secular forces and will continue to decline over my forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201606	1163	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	I don’t believe that the recent decline in the labor force participation rate is an indicator of a significant weakening in the labor market.	13.0	999.0
201606	1164	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	I therefore project that the unemployment rate will hold steady over the remainder of the year before declining and remaining at 4.4 percent over the last two years of the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201606	1165	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	I expect that output growth will accelerate over the remainder of the year, averaging around 2 percent before rising slightly to 2.3 percent in 2017 and returning to approximately trend after that.	13.0	999.0
201606	1166	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	My view on inflation is that we will see a path that returns to target a bit faster than the path presented in the Tealbook, perhaps by the end of the year.	13.0	999.0
201606	1167	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	With unemployment falling below its natural rate, oil prices rising, and a fairly stable dollar, I don’t believe price increases will be delayed for much longer.	13.0	999.0
201606	1168	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	That viewpoint drives me to anticipate two additional rate hikes this year and then increases of 1 percent in both 2017 and 2018, leaving the funds rate slightly below my 3.25 percent longer-run neutral level.	13.0	999.0
201606	1169	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Thus, I believe that accommodation should not be fully withdrawn by the end of the forecast horizon, and that normalization should proceed gradually.	13.0	999.0
201606	1170	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201606	1171	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	13.0	65.0
201606	1172	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201606	1173	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Starting with energy:  As you all know, the price of oil has firmed at $50 a barrel.	13.0	110.0
201606	1174	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	This reflects an expectation that global supply and demand will get into rough balance by the early part of 2017.	13.0	110.0
201606	1175	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	There are those who predict it will happen sooner, in the latter half of ’16, and those who expect it will be later.	13.0	110.0
201606	1176	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	The point is, the trend is clear—we’re heading toward balance.	13.0	110.0
201606	1177	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	This balance has been artificially accelerated, though, in the past few months by recent outages, particularly in Nigeria and Canada, but this balancing trend continues and is particularly underpinned by expected demand growth of approximately 1.2 million barrels a day in 2016.	13.0	110.0
201606	1178	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	On the basis of this trend, our contacts suggest the price of oil should continue to firm in 2016 and ’17.	13.0	110.0
201606	1179	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Looking beyond that to 2018 through 2020, our base case is that the price of oil is likely to gravitate up to between $70 and $80 a barrel, with a spike risk as high as $100 a barrel—again, 2018 to 2020.	13.0	110.0
201606	1180	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	As we’ve discussed before, long-lived projects over the past few years have been shelved or put on hold by most major oil companies.	13.0	110.0
201606	1181	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	These projects take as long as 5 to 10 years to complete but have production lives in excess of 20 years.	13.0	110.0
201606	1182	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	These projects fundamentally increase global oil supply as opposed to shale projects, which tend to rapidly decline over the first three years of production.	13.0	110.0
201606	1183	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Looking at shale, $50 oil is helpful, but many shale properties still will not be viable at this price and will remain dormant.	13.0	110.0
201606	1184	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	On the basis of our discussions with contacts in the industry, we think that prices are going to need to move up toward $60 and higher in order to spur a meaningful increase in deployment of rigs.	13.0	110.0
201606	1185	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	This is why, for the time being, we’re likely to see more bankruptcies and restructurings in the energy sector for the remainder of 2016.	13.0	110.0
201606	1186	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Turning to the District, then, this is the first time since I’ve been coming here that the headwinds from energy for this District are now beginning to dissipate.	13.0	110.0
201606	1187	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	In fact, we have now increased our jobs growth forecast for Texas, which was ½ to 1 percent—we’ve now increased it to 1½ percent in 2016.	13.0	110.0
201606	1188	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	This compares with 1.3 percent job growth in 2015.	13.0	110.0
201606	1189	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Dallas, San Antonio, and Austin are continuing to grow and benefit from continued migration of people and firms to the state of Texas.	13.0	110.0
201606	1190	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Houston also has positive migration trends, but those trends have not been sufficient to offset headwinds from energy.	13.0	110.0
201606	1191	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Housing in Dallas, San Antonio, and Austin remains strong.	13.0	110.0
201606	1192	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Housing prices in Houston we believe declined in the first quarter of 2016.	13.0	110.0
201606	1193	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	As with the nation, manufacturing in the Eleventh District continues to be weak, but the service sector is showing steady, moderate growth.	13.0	110.0
201606	1194	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Looking at a cross section of Texas-based companies that operate throughout the United States, they are reporting, despite the retail sales report today, a modest slowing in consumer spending in the month of May.	13.0	110.0
201606	1195	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Exceptions to this slowing include beauty, health care, and some consumer staples, but as these companies reported last month, they are seeing a consumer with improving capacity to spend but becoming more cautious, possibly due to political uncertainty, but they haven’t been quite able to figure it out.	13.0	110.0
201606	1196	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Many companies are also quick to cite increases in regulation and rules—at the national, state, and local levels—which are impediments to their efforts to build their businesses.	13.0	110.0
201606	1197	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	They particularly cite the effect of new overtime rules, which, combined with disruption, are causing them to explore much more fully the use of technology, which allows them to better control and even reduce their head count.	13.0	110.0
201606	1198	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	I think this is a growing trend we are seeing.	13.0	110.0
201606	1199	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Others cite the challenge of disruptive competitors.	13.0	110.0
201606	1200	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Most of them that don’t make profits have unlimited sources of capital—Amazon is a good example—and basically make no incremental margin but offer convenience and dynamic daily pricing that could be changed at any point during the day, and many companies are struggling with how to deal with this threat, which also is giving them pause.	13.0	110.0
201606	1201	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	In response to sluggish demand and this high threat of disruption, many companies we speak with are now much more cautious about new capital spending and expanding capacity.	13.0	110.0
201606	1202	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Except for skilled trades, such as nursing, technology, and building trades, most companies we talk to report very little in the way of wage pressure or trouble finding an ample supply of new employees for hire.	13.0	110.0
201606	1203	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Looking to the outlook and the SEP, I have not made major changes to my economic projections since those I submitted in March.	13.0	110.0
201606	1204	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Our GDP forecast for 2016 is the same as the Tealbook, and it is based on the expectation of a strong consumer.	13.0	110.0
201606	1205	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	We have a little bit higher path of unemployment in the out-years, probably due to our expectation of weaker growth.	13.0	110.0
201606	1206	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Our breakeven job estimate for job growth necessary to keep the unemployment rate constant over the next 12 months is now at approximately 120,000 jobs per month, on the basis of the view that much of the decline in the participation rate from 2007 to today reflectedthe aging of the workforce.	13.0	110.0
201606	1207	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Further, by 2024, we expect this participation rate to decline to below 61 percent on the basis of continued aging in the workforce, which, as we’ve discussed earlier, is going to lower, in our view, potential GDP growth in the future.	13.0	110.0
201606	1208	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Finally, the Dallas trimmed mean inflation rate continues to run between 1.8 and 1.9 percent.	13.0	110.0
201606	1209	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	It’s been very consistent and gives us continued confidence that we will reach our 2 percent inflation objective in the medium term.	13.0	110.0
201606	1210	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	We continue to expect growth outside the United States to, on balance, create risk to our US GDP forecast.	13.0	110.0
201606	1211	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	In particular, I am concerned about overcapacity outside the United States, particularly in China; aging demographics in all advanced economies; and high levels of debt to GDP, particularly again in China.	13.0	110.0
201606	1212	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Weak growth prospects, both here and overseas, and strong demand for safe assets, as we’ve all discussed, have put greater downward pressure on the neutral rate.	13.0	110.0
201606	1213	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	I believe we will continue to be vulnerable to periodic bouts of tighter financial conditions—in the short run, potentially from Brexit; and in the longer run because of turmoil in China and beyond this year into 2017.	13.0	110.0
201606	1214	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	We think the pressures for a devaluation there are building.	13.0	110.0
201606	1215	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Again, it won’t happen this year, but pressures are building into next year, and we’re seeing that as highly likely, on the basis of contacts that we’re speaking to.	13.0	110.0
201606	1216	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	That will have some jarring effect, depending on the size of the devaluation when it happens.	13.0	110.0
201606	1217	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Accordingly, my SEP funds rate path is slightly shallower than my submission in March.	13.0	110.0
201606	1218	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	13.0	110.0
201606	1219	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	1220	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	13.0	65.0
201606	1221	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201606	1222	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Economic activity and sentiment in the Fourth District remain consistent with continued moderate growth.	13.0	999.0
201606	1223	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The Bank’s diffusion index of business contacts reporting better versus worse conditions moved down slightly from plus 16 at the time of our April meeting to plus 9, a reading indicating moderate growth.	13.0	999.0
201606	1224	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	After exhibiting some deterioration in the first quarter, District manufacturing has stabilized, and our manufacturing contacts expect further improvement in the months ahead.	13.0	999.0
201606	1225	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Steel producers were encouraged by recent increases in product prices but remain uncertain about the sustainability of those increases.	13.0	999.0
201606	1226	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Due to recent increases in oil prices, some projects in the energy sector that had been placed on hold are now moving forward.	13.0	999.0
201606	1227	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Manufacturers are investing, but mainly in maintenance and process improvement equipment.	13.0	999.0
201606	1228	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Some contacts said that reluctance on the part of businesses to invest in large-scale capacity-expanding projects reflects concern about the overall longer-run direction in the economy and not concerns about the economy in the near term or their own firm’s performance, which has been strong.	13.0	999.0
201606	1229	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	In their view, a rise in interest rates would not deter spending plans.	13.0	999.0
201606	1230	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	One contact in the commercial real estate sector said that while low interest rates were helpful to his clients in terms of their capital investment, low rates were not a primary motivator.	13.0	999.0
201606	1231	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Rather, the regulatory and political environments were seen as stronger headwinds to capital spending than potentially rising interest rates.	13.0	999.0
201606	1232	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Labor markets in the District remain healthy.	13.0	999.0
201606	1233	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland Federal Reserve staff estimates that District employment grew 1.2 percent over the year ending in April.	13.0	999.0
201606	1234	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The District’s unemployment rate has remained low and stable, with the April estimate at 5.1 percent.	13.0	999.0
201606	1235	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The Fourth District results of the special System inquiry on employment, wages, and labor shortage are comparable to the averages across all Districts.	13.0	999.0
201606	1236	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	More than twice as many firms expect to increase rather than decrease employment over the next 12 months.	13.0	999.0
201606	1237	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Nearly 40 percent of Fourth District firms report that it’s getting harder to retain workers, somewhat higher than the national average.	13.0	999.0
201606	1238	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Nearly two-thirds of firms hiring expect to increase starting wages for some or selected job categories, and nearly three-fourths said they couldn’t find qualified job candidates to fill at least some of their open positions.	13.0	999.0
201606	1239	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	A shortage of applicants plus a lack of skills of those who do apply appear to be the main factors driving the shortage.	13.0	999.0
201606	1240	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Wage levels don’t appear to be the key factor.	13.0	999.0
201606	1241	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The survey results are in line with the anecdotal reports we’ve been receiving from business contacts for quite some time and with the recent National Federation of Independent Business survey.	13.0	999.0
201606	1242	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The NFIB survey indicates that worker availability has become increasingly constrained over the expansion and is now at the level consistent with past expansion peaks.	13.0	999.0
201606	1243	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	I interpret these results as suggesting that labor supply issues are having a significant effect on labor markets, both at the District and national levels.	13.0	999.0
201606	1244	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Turning to the national economy, the disappointing May jobs report got my attention.	13.0	999.0
201606	1245	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Some of the weakness in May reflects the Verizon strike.	13.0	999.0
201606	1246	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Some of the downward revisions to May and April reflect revised seasonal adjustment factors.	13.0	999.0
201606	1247	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Even so, the report indicates weaker employment growth than we’ve been seeing.	13.0	999.0
201606	1248	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Averaging through the past three months and adjusting for the strike, the average increase for payrolls is 120,000 jobs per month.	13.0	999.0
201606	1249	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	This is a step-down from the more than 200,000 per month gains we saw over last year and earlier this year.	13.0	999.0
201606	1250	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	But let’s keep this in perspective.	13.0	999.0
201606	1251	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	One thing we have learned over this expansion is that we shouldn’t take too much signal from one month’s report.	13.0	999.0
201606	1252	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Payroll growth slowed in March 2015, early in 2014, and late in 2013, but these episodes did not ultimately signal a reversal in the labor market.	13.0	999.0
201606	1253	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	More recently, you might recall that last summer we were concerned about a couple of weaker payroll reports as well, but then payroll growth strengthened.	13.0	999.0
201606	1254	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Cleveland staff analysis documents that in the midst of an ongoing expansion, it’s not unusual to see employment growth slow down for a brief period and then kick back up on a sustained basis.	13.0	999.0
201606	1255	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	In addition, we should be expecting some slowdown in the pace of job growth as the economy nears full employment.	13.0	999.0
201606	1256	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The bigger surprise may have been the very strong reports that came earlier this year, which seemed out of sync with the weaker output growth.	13.0	999.0
201606	1257	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Now output growth is picking up while payroll growth is slowing.	13.0	999.0
201606	1258	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Job growth over the past three months exceeds the 75,000 to 120,000 per month range of trend growth estimates from various models.	13.0	999.0
201606	1259	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	So even if the reduced current pace is sustained, it will be sufficient to put further downward pressure on the unemployment rate.	13.0	999.0
201606	1260	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Finally, other labor market data do not suggest a marked deterioration of the labor market.	13.0	999.0
201606	1261	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Significant slowdowns in employment growth are usually accompanied by a marked rise in unemployment claims.	13.0	999.0
201606	1262	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Instead, initial jobless claims are close to cyclical lows, and continuing claims are the lowest they’ve been in over a decade.	13.0	999.0
201606	1263	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The April Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey was positive, with the job openings rate at a record high and the quits rate near pre-recession levels.	13.0	999.0
201606	1264	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	On the other hand, just as I discount taking a strong signal from May payrolls, I don’t read the sharp drop in the unemployment rate last month as indicating a significant tightening in the labor market.	13.0	999.0
201606	1265	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The drop reflects not only a decline in unemployment, but also an outsized decline in the participation rate.	13.0	999.0
201606	1266	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	In light of the month-to-month volatility, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a reversal in participation in the near term.	13.0	999.0
201606	1267	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	In constructing my SEP for this round, I decided to avoid erring on the side of reading too much into a single jobs report.	13.0	999.0
201606	1268	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	In my view, the fundamentals supporting the expansion remain favorable, including accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions, household balance sheets that have improved greatly since the recession, continued improvement in labor markets, and low oil prices.	13.0	999.0
201606	1269	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	First-quarter output growth was weak, but incoming data indicate it was not as weak as originally estimated.	13.0	999.0
201606	1270	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Many of the nowcasts of second-quarter growth suggest it will rebound to between 2 and 2½ percent, led by a strong pickup in consumer spending.	13.0	999.0
201606	1271	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	I expect housing to continue to improve and to support growth.	13.0	999.0
201606	1272	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Business investment has been quite weak, but I believe it will pick up modestly over the forecast horizon, in line with overall growth.	13.0	999.0
201606	1273	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	On balance, I slightly marked down my growth forecast for 2016 to recognize the relatively weak first quarter, but otherwise I made little change to my growth, unemployment, and inflation projections since the March SEP.	13.0	999.0
201606	1274	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Overall, I expect growth to be slightly above trend over the next couple of years, which will support further improvement in labor markets and a gradual return of inflation to our targeted 2 percent over the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201606	1275	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	In my view, the economy is at maximum employment from the standpoint of what monetary policy can do, and I expect a slowing in the pace of labor market gains compared with last year and earlier this year.	13.0	999.0
201606	1276	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	By the end of 2018, I project that the economy will be near its steady state.	13.0	999.0
201606	1277	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	We’re already seeing acceleration in some of the wage measures like average hourly earnings, in line with anecdotal reports of increasing wage pressures across a range of industries.	13.0	999.0
201606	1278	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Inflation measures have gradually risen as the effects of previous declines in oil prices and the strengthening of the dollar have faded, consistent with the dynamics anticipated by the FOMC.	13.0	999.0
201606	1279	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Headline PCE and CPI inflation moved up from the very low levels reported last year, and they’ve been stable at a little more than 1 percent in recent months.	13.0	999.0
201606	1280	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Measures of core inflation have also remained at levels above last year’s lows, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s median CPI measure has continued to edge up, reaching nearly 2½ percent in April, its highest level since April 2009.	13.0	999.0
201606	1281	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Stable inflation expectations are an important component of inflation dynamics.	13.0	999.0
201606	1282	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	At this point, I view inflation expectations as reasonably well anchored and expect them to remain so, but I am monitoring readings carefully.	13.0	999.0
201606	1283	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Longer-run inflation expectations in the preliminary June Michigan survey notably fell to 2.3 percent.	13.0	999.0
201606	1284	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Analysis by the Cleveland Federal Reserve staff indicates that the Michigan expectation series is fairly noisy from month to month, so it’s too soon to say whether the recent softness is signaling the beginning of a more pronounced and sustained decline in expectations, but this certainly does bear watching.	13.0	999.0
201606	1285	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Better news comes from the Survey of Professional Forecasters.	13.0	999.0
201606	1286	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	In May, the survey’s median 10-year PCE inflation measure moved back up to 2 percent, and the 10-year CPI inflation measure increased to 2.2 percent.	13.0	999.0
201606	1287	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Our bank’s five-year, five-year-forward measure of inflation expectations, which is based on a model that incorporates survey measures of expectations as well as market data on nominal Treasury yields and inflation swaps, has been stable at about 1.9 percent in recent months.	13.0	999.0
201606	1288	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	As usual, there are risks associated with my forecast, but I see the risks as roughly balanced at this point.	13.0	999.0
201606	1289	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Should inflation expectations show a more significant downward move, this would pose a downside risk to my inflation projection.	13.0	999.0
201606	1290	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	On the other hand, too slow a withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation while unemployment continues to decline has the potential to create upside risks to inflation over the medium run.	13.0	999.0
201606	1291	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Risks to financial stability associated with very low interest rates appear so far to be contained.	13.0	999.0
201606	1292	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	I expect them to remain so, provided we gradually normalize interest rates.	13.0	999.0
201606	1293	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	However, failure to do so increases these risks.	13.0	999.0
201606	1294	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	I expect financial market volatility to continue to increase as the United Kingdom’s June 23 vote about whether to leave the European Union approaches.	13.0	999.0
201606	1295	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	If the United Kingdom votes to stay, I expect this volatility to be short lived, with no implications for the medium-run outlook.	13.0	999.0
201606	1296	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	If the United Kingdom votes to exit, this volatility could be longer lasting.	13.0	999.0
201606	1297	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	If it were to develop into a more general tightening of credit conditions, it would have implications for the outlook.	13.0	999.0
201606	1298	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Given my outlook and the risks, I believe a gradual upward path of interest rates over the forecast horizon remains appropriate, as the economy continues to make progress on our dual- mandate goals.	13.0	999.0
201606	1299	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The timing of the rate increase and the overall slope of that gradual path will depend on how the economy and forecasts evolve.	13.0	999.0
201606	1300	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Reflecting the slightly weaker growth forecast for 2016, my federal funds rate path is slightly shallower than in my March projection.	13.0	999.0
201606	1301	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	I do not think the Committee is “behind the curve” yet, but I am seriously concerned that we will forestall rate increases for too long because of the uncertainties clouding the outlook from meeting to meeting even as we continue to make cumulative progress on our goals.	13.0	999.0
201606	1302	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	An abundance of caution might suggest waiting for more clarity before acting.	13.0	999.0
201606	1303	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	However, that depends on which risk you’re taking into account.	13.0	999.0
201606	1304	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Waiting too long to act in the hope that things will get clarified risks waiting too long, and so increasing the risk to financial stability and raising the potential of overshooting, requiring sharper rate increases in the future—an eventuality that poses its own set of risks to the outlook.	13.0	999.0
201606	1305	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	It also puts at risk our future ability to use the nontraditional monetary policy tools that the Federal Reserve developed to deal with the recent financial crisis and recession.	13.0	999.0
201606	1306	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	If we fail to glacially navigate back toward a more normal policy stance, I believe there’s considerable chance that these tools will effectively be off the table because they will have been deemed by the public as ultimately ineffective.	13.0	999.0
201606	1307	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	I know this is not the usual sort of risk we consider, but it does weigh on my mind as I contemplate appropriate policy.	13.0	999.0
201606	1308	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201606	1309	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	1310	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13.0	65.0
201606	1311	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201606	1312	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Relative to our previous round, the reports from my directors and other business contacts were a mixture of small positives and negatives.	13.0	91.0
201606	1313	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Overall, the tone was quite similar to my discussions prior to recent FOMC meetings, and on balance their comments seem consistent with growth proceeding along at the 2 percent or so pace that we’ve experienced over the past year.	13.0	91.0
201606	1314	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Starting with the positive reports, my contact at Caterpillar said his dealers were getting more business by refurbishing mining equipment.	13.0	91.0
201606	1315	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	He also noted that the recent federal highway bill appeared to have state governments floating bonds to gear up for infrastructure spending, though it is unlikely to come online before 2017.	13.0	91.0
201606	1316	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	More generally, several contacts pointed to improved commercial construction.	13.0	91.0
201606	1317	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	And making lemonade from the weak May labor market report, labor developments did not appear to coincide with any major decline in business attitudes.	13.0	91.0
201606	1318	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	With the exception of one or two financial market contacts, no one else was getting bent out of shape over the employment numbers.	13.0	91.0
201606	1319	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Now, for the negatives.	13.0	91.0
201606	1320	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Even though my contacts generally were on an even keel, they indicated that business sentiment remained quite weak.	13.0	91.0
201606	1321	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	For example, one of my banking directors reported on a survey of 75 of the largest companies in Michigan, only a dozen or so of the 75 think the economy will improve over the next 18 months—the rest are about equally split between things staying the same or getting worse.	13.0	91.0
201606	1322	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Another director who is a member of the US Business Roundtable noted the same lack of confidence among most of the CEOs in the nation’s largest firms.	13.0	91.0
201606	1323	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, one contact characterized today’s business leaders as being like the children of the Depression era.	13.0	91.0
201606	1324	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Scarred by the Great Recession, they are highly attuned to reasons to worry about the outlook, and CEOs do not want to undertake any capital expenditures or workforce expansions that entail even a small risk of getting help ahead of the product demand.	13.0	91.0
201606	1325	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Factoring the anecdotes in with our analysis of the incoming macroeconomic data, our bank’s real GDP forecast continues to be similar to the Tealbook’s.	13.0	91.0
201606	1326	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	We, too, see growth at about 2 percent this year and then a bit stronger in 2017.	13.0	91.0
201606	1327	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	We currently think that there’s a little more slack in labor markets than the Tealbook does, but under our forecast this is eliminated by mid- 2017.	13.0	91.0
201606	1328	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	To be sure, the May labor market report increased uncertainty over the strength of the expansion.	13.0	91.0
201606	1329	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	It and the GDP data are reminders that the economy still faces substantial headwinds and that the equilibrium real interest rate is still quite low, and our Chicago forecast is predicated on a more accommodative policy rate path than the Tealbook.	13.0	91.0
201606	1330	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Still, while there are important risks, I remain reasonably confident that an appropriately accommodative policy will keep us close to our employment mandate.	13.0	91.0
201606	1331	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	I cannot express a similar confidence about reaching our inflation target.	13.0	91.0
201606	1332	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Let me frame my discussion with the familiar taxonomy used by the Board staff’s inflation model.	13.0	91.0
201606	1333	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	The model forecasts increasing inflation due to three factors.	13.0	91.0
201606	1334	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	First, there’s an unwinding of the transitory effects of lower energy prices and the higher dollar.	13.0	91.0
201606	1335	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Second, the short-run Phillips curve will dictate rising inflation, due to the reduction and eventually overshooting of resource slack.	13.0	91.0
201606	1336	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	And, third, there is the pull of the inflation attractor—I guess sometimes it’s referred to as underlying inflation.	13.0	91.0
201606	1337	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	This is the factor that captures inflation expectations and other elements of price- setting behavior that induce a stochastic trend into actual inflation.	13.0	91.0
201606	1338	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	So where do we stand on these stories?	13.0	91.0
201606	1339	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Well, the transitory disinflationary effects are waning.	13.0	91.0
201606	1340	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	On slack, we can debate whether or not any slack remains in labor markets, but in view of the flat slope of the Phillips curve, even the Tealbook’s overshooting is not going to provide much boost to inflation.	13.0	91.0
201606	1341	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	So that leaves us with the inflation attractor.	13.0	91.0
201606	1342	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Will there be enough pull to get us to 2 percent?	13.0	91.0
201606	1343	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	I’m skeptical, on account of the current state of inflation expectations.	13.0	91.0
201606	1344	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	The Tealbook forecast embeds an assumption of a gradual target-reverting updrift in the attractor from 1¾ percent in 2017 to 2 percent by 2020, and it is this updrift that lifts the inflation forecast to target in 2020.	13.0	91.0
201606	1345	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	However, as of today, I think there are important downside risks to this assumption.	13.0	91.0
201606	1346	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, in the near term, I could see the attractor falling even further below 2 percent.	13.0	91.0
201606	1347	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	None of my contacts talk about anticipating more pricing power when formulating their business plans, even if they wanted to.	13.0	91.0
201606	1348	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Most worrisome, measures of inflation expectations may be slipping.	13.0	91.0
201606	1349	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Despite this year’s welcome news on energy prices, the dollar, and core inflation, TIPS inflation compensation has moved sideways at very low levels, and household measures of inflation expectations have fallen to new lows.	13.0	91.0
201606	1350	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	We have mostly discounted such developments going back to the fall of 2014.	13.0	91.0
201606	1351	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	This is a long period to think we are only observing statistical noise and coincidences.	13.0	91.0
201606	1352	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	My SEP submission involves an assumption that we could solidify inflation expectations by communicating a stronger commitment to a symmetric 2 percent inflation target.	13.0	91.0
201606	1353	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	This commitment would be reflected in the Committee’s forward guidance comments.	13.0	91.0
201606	1354	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Importantly, my view of appropriate policy includes communications of a very shallow projected path for policy normalization, conditional on economic and inflation developments.	13.0	91.0
201606	1355	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	If this works, inflationary expectations will solidify back in line with 2 percent, and the attractor will pull inflation up to target within a reasonable amount of time.	13.0	91.0
201606	1356	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	It is critically important that it does, because I do not see the upward force from the other factors as being adequate to bring inflation close to target over the forecast period to 2018.	13.0	91.0
201606	1357	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	In contrast, if a steeper path of policy rate normalization is socialized with the public without further economic and inflation improvements, my inflation concerns become stronger on the downside.	13.0	91.0
201606	1358	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201606	1359	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	1360	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13.0	65.0
201606	1361	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	81.0
201606	1362	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Economic conditions in the Fifth District have continued to improve since the previous FOMC meeting, although survey results have been somewhat mixed.	13.0	81.0
201606	1363	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The business activity index from our survey of manufacturing firms fell last month to right around the breakeven level, negative 1 in May versus the April reading of plus 14.	13.0	81.0
201606	1364	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Our contacts attribute the softening in manufacturing to weakening exports, and they say that manufacturers that do not export are healthy.	13.0	81.0
201606	1365	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Meanwhile, our services-sector revenue indicator fell slightly but remained firmly in a positive territory, at plus 11.	13.0	81.0
201606	1366	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The fall in the overall services indicator was due entirely to the retail component, which is very, very volatile—it went from plus 37 in April to plus 1 in May.	13.0	81.0
201606	1367	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The employment indicators in our surveys continue to show expansion.	13.0	81.0
201606	1368	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	They’re strongly positive except for retail, for which the index is right around breakeven.	13.0	81.0
201606	1369	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Wage indicators also remained solidly positive in our survey.	13.0	81.0
201606	1370	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	These figures are consistent with continuing reports we hear of firms having difficulty hiring, including reports that some commercial builders are turning down jobs because their plates are full and expanding their workforce is just too difficult.	13.0	81.0
201606	1371	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	We heard no reports of cutbacks in planned hiring over the intermeeting period.	13.0	81.0
201606	1372	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Richmond is home to a large national online job search firm that specializes in hourly, low-skilled jobs—think retail and restaurants.	13.0	81.0
201606	1373	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	They have 1.4 million job postings on their site, which, for comparison, is about one-fourth the size of the JOLTS job openings number, although the JOLTS definition of a job opening is a little stricter than just the posting.	13.0	81.0
201606	1374	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	So it’s not directly comparable, but it gives you a sense of the size of the firm.	13.0	81.0
201606	1375	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	They’re reporting a 30 percent year- over-year increase in openings posted on their site, and that’s predominantly expanded postings from existing clients.	13.0	81.0
201606	1376	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	At the same time, the number of people registered with them to search for jobs has been fairly stable.	13.0	81.0
201606	1377	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The average wage growth for postings on their site was up over 10 percent from the summer of 2014 to the summer of 2015, which is the way they compile and report these things.	13.0	81.0
201606	1378	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	And their survey indicates it’s expected to be up more than 10 percent again this summer.	13.0	81.0
201606	1379	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	They say that job seekers are becoming increasingly selective.	13.0	81.0
201606	1380	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The number of applications the typical job seeker submits in their first 30 days on the site is declining, and they have also seen a noticeable shift in the stated reason for searching away from “I need a job” toward “I want a better job.”	13.0	81.0
201606	1381	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I think this sheds light on the national labor market data.	13.0	81.0
201606	1382	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Obviously, the big news on the national front was the May jobs report—employment growth much weaker than expected, but the unemployment rate declined substantially.	13.0	81.0
201606	1383	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The decline, as was noted, was the result of household unemployment being relatively flat and a steep decline in the labor force.	13.0	81.0
201606	1384	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	As others have noted, it’s not uncommon to get an employment report that’s out of line with ongoing trends, and I think the May report may turn out to be a fluke.	13.0	81.0
201606	1385	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The contribution of the Verizon strike bolsters that possibility.	13.0	81.0
201606	1386	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	But the downward revisions in previous months’ payroll numbers suggest we may be seeing a sustained downturn in employment growth.	13.0	81.0
201606	1387	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Over the past three months, average monthly employment growth has stepped down from over 200,000 per month to about 100,000 per month.	13.0	81.0
201606	1388	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I guess that’s a larger number if you adjust for the Verizon strike, as President Williams did, but still lower than 200,000.	13.0	81.0
201606	1389	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	If a slowdown in employment growth persists, I think there are two ways to interpret this.	13.0	81.0
201606	1390	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Here I’m following Governor Brainard’s paradigm.	13.0	81.0
201606	1391	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	One is that employment growth is slowing because final demand is weakening, and, obviously, nonresidential fixed investment has contracted for two straight quarters now.	13.0	81.0
201606	1392	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The decline in payroll growth could reflect continuing weakness in this and other related fields.	13.0	81.0
201606	1393	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The other interpretation is that the economy has reached its trend growth path, which is something we’ve been anticipating for some time.	13.0	81.0
201606	1394	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Labor supply constraints are starting to bind in this scenario, and employment growth will be limited by the growth in the working-age population.	13.0	81.0
201606	1395	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I think there are arguments for either of these interpretations, but to me the case for supply constraints seems more convincing.	13.0	81.0
201606	1396	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Since the recession, the US economy has grown at a fairly steady 2 percent annual rate, and the unemployment rate has steadily declined.	13.0	81.0
201606	1397	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Apparently, various frictions in adjustment costs prevented us from reducing the overhang of unemployed and discouraged workers at a pace any more rapid than we actually saw over that period.	13.0	81.0
201606	1398	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	We’ve always known, however, that at some point, absent shocks, the underutilization of labor resources would be eliminated, and at that point growth would be governed by demographics and productivity growth.	13.0	81.0
201606	1399	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	This expectation has been evident in the SEP numbers in recent years, showing real GDP growth moderating and the unemployment rate flattening out over the forecast horizon.	13.0	81.0
201606	1400	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I think we need to take seriously the idea that the May employment report is indicating that this transition has arrived sooner than we thought.	13.0	81.0
201606	1401	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	At our March meeting, every participant said that the longer-run unemployment rate was greater than or equal to the May number of 4.7 percent.	13.0	81.0
201606	1402	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	So the notion that labor market resources are fully utilized shouldn’t be too controversial.	13.0	81.0
201606	1403	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	If resource utilization remains stable, employment growth should match the trend determined by demographics.	13.0	81.0
201606	1404	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Estimates of that trend range between 50,000 and 100,000.	13.0	81.0
201606	1405	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	There has been some commentary about that number in reports so far.	13.0	81.0
201606	1406	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	So the May employment report is consistent with the notion that we’ve now converged to that trend path.	13.0	81.0
201606	1407	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Of course, the May report, as Governor Brainard noted, is also consistent with the first interpretation that demand growth is weakening and we’re in danger of a recession, but I don’t think that the other labor market data support that interpretation.	13.0	81.0
201606	1408	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	For one, firms haven’t been cutting back on hiring plans, so we can discern job opening rates have increased significantly over the past three years—as was cited before from the JOLTS report—and at this point there isn’t any sign that that trend is reversing.	13.0	81.0
201606	1409	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	In contrast, prior to the previous recession, job opening rates flattened out in 2006 and had declined noticeably when the cyclical peak arrived in December of 2007.	13.0	81.0
201606	1410	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	In addition, layoff rates remain stable and initial unemployment insurance claims are at extremely low levels by historical standards.	13.0	81.0
201606	1411	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	So firms haven’t been scaling back on their workforce in anticipation of weak demand.	13.0	81.0
201606	1412	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	In contrast, initial claims began rising in the fourth quarter of 2007.	13.0	81.0
201606	1413	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Quits rates continue to increase and are up 8½ percent year over year.	13.0	81.0
201606	1414	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	In contrast, the quits rate hit a plateau in 2005 and began falling in the summer of 2007.	13.0	81.0
201606	1415	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The notion of weakening demand during an emerging economic downturn, therefore, doesn’t seem to me consistent with these gross flow data, nor is it consistent with broader evidence on second-quarter spending picking up from the first quarter, as Governor Brainard pointed out.	13.0	81.0
201606	1416	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Given the data in hand, I find the supply constraint interpretation more compelling.	13.0	81.0
201606	1417	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Now, I recognize that the seasonally adjusted flow of workers from “unemployed” to “out of the labor force” in the CPS jumped 300,000 from March to May.	13.0	81.0
201606	1418	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	This is a fairly choppy series, though, if you take a look at it.	13.0	81.0
201606	1419	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	And I think it’s too soon to make too much of it.	13.0	81.0
201606	1420	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	For example, the flow rose by over 400,000 from February to April of 2014 but then obviously reversed course.	13.0	81.0
201606	1421	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Moreover, the total number of workers out of the labor force fell nearly 1 million from September to March, the recent rise in labor force participation looks like a return to the previous trend.	13.0	81.0
201606	1422	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	If we are running into increasingly binding resource constraints, you would expect some effect on wages and prices.	13.0	81.0
201606	1423	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	As I and many others have pointed out, we actually have seen a clear rise in the rate of nominal wage growth over the past year or two, and the Tealbook points out that real wages are rising faster than labor productivity.	13.0	81.0
201606	1424	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Moreover, core inflation has been firming, and it is running higher than expected on net this year—2.1 percent at an annual rate versus a median projection of 1.6 percent in the March SEP.	13.0	81.0
201606	1425	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Obviously, the policy implications of these two scenarios are diametrically opposed.	13.0	81.0
201606	1426	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Demand weakness calls for further delay in raising rates, whereas supply constraints call for avoiding delay or, if anything, suggest a steeper rate path.	13.0	81.0
201606	1427	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	So I have left my funds rate projection unchanged in this submission.	13.0	81.0
201606	1428	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Furthermore, if labor supply constraints are limiting growth, I think we need a shift in how we communicate.	13.0	81.0
201606	1429	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I think we should no longer suggest, as the statement does now, that we are dissatisfied with current labor market conditions, and we should find a way to convey to the public—someone else mentioned this, I think—that the monthly employment growth of around 100,000 is quite reasonable and not cause for alarm.	13.0	81.0
201606	1430	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I would like to, finally, just add a comment or two elaborating on President Williams’s comments, and this is all a follow-up from Vice Chairman Dudley’s question.	13.0	81.0
201606	1431	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	There is a large literature on the determinants of economic growth over time and a huge number of models and economic analysis that abstract from monetary policy.	13.0	81.0
201606	1432	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Expanding that class of models to encompass a nontrivial role for monetary policy is the signal achievement of economics in the past 40 years.	13.0	81.0
201606	1433	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	For many analytical purposes, it’s very useful to conceive of business cycles as fluctuations around a steady state in which the determinants of growth fluctuate around constant means.	13.0	81.0
201606	1434	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	But that shouldn’t distract us from the possibility of the fact that those distributions could shift over time—and indeed, I think this a major message we can take away from this economic expansion.	13.0	81.0
201606	1435	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	There’s no rule written down in nature or that we can divine that those should be constant distributions over time, and President Williams’s analysis is an example of that.	13.0	81.0
201606	1436	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	As for monetary policy effectiveness, for many analytical purposes, linearizing around such a steady state delivers models with a small system of equations that closely resemble the IS- LM models that were popular in the ’60s and ’70s.	13.0	81.0
201606	1437	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I think, similarly, that shouldn’t distract us from the likelihood that significant asymmetries are relevant to monetary policy and growth.	13.0	81.0
201606	1438	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	In particular, I think the capacity of monetary policy to disrupt and interfere with growth is arguably much greater than the capacity of monetary policy to achieve growth substantially greater on a sustained basis than the pace given by those fundamental determinants that President Williams referenced.	13.0	81.0
201606	1439	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	1440	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13.0	65.0
201606	1441	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201606	1442	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	My comments will be devoted entirely to the labor market, beginning with whether we should take much of a signal from that May employment report—a topic many of you have already addressed—and, if so, what is being signaled.	13.0	97.0
201606	1443	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Then I will turn to the question of how I think we should assess the labor market even if the May numbers prove to be an aberration.	13.0	97.0
201606	1444	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	As, again, many of you have already noted, if taken at face value, the May numbers reflect a very rapid deceleration in job growth, seemingly across a wide range of industries.	13.0	97.0
201606	1445	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Even adding back all 35,000 striking Verizon workers, we still have a slowdown considerably more pronounced than consensus expectations and considerably short of even low-range estimates of the number of jobs required to absorb new entrants.	13.0	97.0
201606	1446	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	But, again, as many of you have noted, there are some grounds for believing that the May report may be an aberration.	13.0	97.0
201606	1447	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	First, there is the usual caution about noisiness in any one month’s data.	13.0	97.0
201606	1448	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Second, there are some other labor market indicators, such as first-time unemployment claims and a Conference Board survey, which continue to suggest improvement.	13.0	97.0
201606	1449	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	I wouldn’t draw any conclusions, though, from the JOLTS report, which some people have mentioned, because the report that was issued last Wednesday is for April, not for May, so it doesn’t really reflect the same set of labor market developments.	13.0	97.0
201606	1450	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	And, finally, the unemployment rate ticked down 0.3 percentage point.	13.0	97.0
201606	1451	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Of course, that reduction in unemployment was entirely due to an unusually large reported drop in labor force participation, a data series that is, if anything, more prone to noisiness than the others.	13.0	97.0
201606	1452	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	So, all in all, I don’t think there is enough information with which to answer the signal versus aberration question.	13.0	97.0
201606	1453	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Indeed, there’s at least one other possible explanation, which is that increasing numbers of businesses are hitting the pause button in advance of a national election, a phenomenon that is often observed in democracies around the world because economic policy directions can depend so much on electoral outcomes.	13.0	97.0
201606	1454	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	However, while acknowledging that any view has to be tentative, I lean slightly toward taking some signal from the May numbers because of the numbers for those working part time for economic reasons and temporary business employment.	13.0	97.0
201606	1455	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	The first—part time for economic reasons—increased 468,000, or about 8 percent, in a single month.	13.0	97.0
201606	1456	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Even if one takes the not unreasonable position that the level of PTER may not go all the way down to pre-crisis levels because of structural labor market changes, this much of a jump in a single month, even with some discount for noise, does suggest that there’s something more than an aberration.	13.0	97.0
201606	1457	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	This suggestion is reinforced by the decline of 21,000 in temporary health services employment.	13.0	97.0
201606	1458	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Now, in absolute terms, this is a less impressive number than the PTER change, but it does represent an unusually large decline in that category for a month neither at the end of the Christmas rush nor at the end of the summer.	13.0	97.0
201606	1459	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	The reason these two numbers incline me toward taking some signal from the May report is that they both can be early indicators of employers beginning to pull back on their workforces in ways that are relatively less disruptive internally than actually laying people off.	13.0	97.0
201606	1460	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	So assuming for a moment that there is some signal in the employment report, what is being signaled?	13.0	97.0
201606	1461	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Well, again, several of you have already mentioned some possibilities, and I count three.	13.0	97.0
201606	1462	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	First, the May numbers may reflect a reduction in hiring to levels that seem more consistent with near-trend growth in GDP.	13.0	97.0
201606	1463	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Many have expected such a slowing, just not this abruptly.	13.0	97.0
201606	1464	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	If this turns out to be the case, then the argument that has been advanced for further increases in the federal funds rate would seem to me to be weakened considerably, since there would be no need to slow employment growth further in order to foreclose a substantial overshooting of full employment, which proponents of this argument presume is associated reasonably directly with the risk of an overshoot of the 2 percent target.	13.0	97.0
201606	1465	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	A second possibility, in my view a less likely though not trivial one, is that the numbers portend a slowdown throughout the economy that is also reflected in the soft business investment numbers, and that would raise the question of whether more, rather than less, accommodation was appropriate.	13.0	97.0
201606	1466	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	And third is the argument that hiring has slowed down for supply-side reasons—this is the one Jeff was just articulating—that employers cannot find qualified workers to hire.	13.0	97.0
201606	1467	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	This argument, I think, does have some plausibility within some discrete sectors, such as construction and some parts of the IT industry, but I find it also to be somewhat less likely as a broader application, since it’s not consistent either with what’s been observed in prior expansions, with the broad-based nature of the hiring slowdown, or with the possible signals of increasing slack I mentioned earlier.	13.0	97.0
201606	1468	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Moreover, at the lower end of the labor market, in which technical skills or qualifications are not so important, the issue is probably more one of wage increases and the related issue of pulling people back into the labor market.	13.0	97.0
201606	1469	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	But let’s now assume that the May numbers are an aberration and that we revert to higher levels of job growth, lower than the 200,000 or better performance we have been at for the past couple of years but still solidly in the mid-to-high 100,000s range.	13.0	97.0
201606	1470	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	The first point worth noting here is that in the past nine months, most of which had job creation of near or above 200,000, the unemployment rate has been essentially unchanged because the rate of job growth needed to meet workforce increases is probably around 100,000.	13.0	97.0
201606	1471	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	We have had, by this calculus, about 800,000 or 900,000 new jobs filled by people coming back into the workforce—that is, the jobs have been filled from slack not captured in the standard U-3 measure during or even after the time when some had declared the economy had reached full employment.	13.0	97.0
201606	1472	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Now, this is as good a time as any to note, once again, that staff estimates of full employment—as well as estimates of many others who find little slack in the economy—have become largely detached from price inflation.	13.0	97.0
201606	1473	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Instead, they rely on estimates of such structural factors as labor force participation.	13.0	97.0
201606	1474	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	While this approach is interesting for labor economists to pursue in light of the flattened Phillips curve, its utility for monetary policy decisions seems to me at least somewhat questionable.	13.0	97.0
201606	1475	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	This limited utility is underscored by the reality that the standard errors for estimating the natural rate are relatively high and by the fact that staff estimates find the unemployment rate to have been well below the natural rate for significant periods, such as 1997 to 2001, during which both core inflation and long-run inflation expectations were essentially flat.	13.0	97.0
201606	1476	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Turning back to the present, wages have been accelerating in only a very measured way.	13.0	97.0
201606	1477	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Indeed, as shown in a recent interesting report by economists at Morgan Stanley, the diffusion of accelerating wages across industries has been unusually gradual for an expansion and, with a few high-profile but less economically consequential exceptions, concentrated in lower-wage jobs— the very areas in which people only marginally attached to the workforce or out of it altogether are most likely to be able to reenter.	13.0	97.0
201606	1478	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	And I actually think this is somewhat consistent with the anecdote that President Lacker was telling a few minutes ago.	13.0	97.0
201606	1479	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	While the same Morgan Stanley report expects that some continued improvement in the labor market would lead to a continued diffusion of higher wage increases in middle-income jobs, they continue to expect that this would be at a measured pace, with no indication of a job market running hot.	13.0	97.0
201606	1480	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Finally, it is worth repeating that if and as accelerating wage increases do diffuse more broadly through the economy, the size and timing of their effect on price inflation of tightening labor markets remain unclear.	13.0	97.0
201606	1481	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	As an anecdotal matter, I note that recent NABE and Duke surveys suggest that while an increasing number of firms do expect to increase wages more, they generally do not expect to be able to pass those increased costs along through greater price increases.	13.0	97.0
201606	1482	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	At a more theoretical level, I would further note that there is increasing evidence for the proposition that the flattening of the Phillips curve that we have observed at work in recent years actually took place over roughly 20 years from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s and has been fairly stable since then.	13.0	97.0
201606	1483	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Furthermore, as demonstrated by the recent paper by Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers, this flattening, by and large, occurred not just in the United States, but also around the world.	13.0	97.0
201606	1484	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Both of these circumstances would imply, though of course not prove, that even if a snapback to a steeper Phillips curve were to occur in the United States, it is unlikely to happen quickly or simply because labor markets were approaching pre-crisis conditions.	13.0	97.0
201606	1485	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Adding these observations to the fact that growth has not been running particularly hot and it’s been only somewhat above what most of us estimate to be the trend, this, again, does suggest a circumstance in which—unless there is some evidence to the contrary—the effect of tighter labor markets on price inflation, while real, will be somewhat attenuated.	13.0	97.0
201606	1486	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	The foregoing is not an excuse for complacency about inflation, of course, or a reason to disregard a sustained period of accelerating or high wage increases.	13.0	97.0
201606	1487	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	But I think it is a reasonable basis for presuming that the causal link between employment and wages on the one hand and inflation on the other will play out only over time.	13.0	97.0
201606	1488	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Accordingly, we should have ample time to react, and it doesn’t seem as though there is a high risk of falling “behind the curve.”	13.0	97.0
201606	1489	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Indeed, in light of recent readings on both market- and survey-based inflation and for the reasons that President Evans discussed a few minutes ago, a good case can be made for the proposition that there is as much risk to the downside for inflation as there is to the upside.	13.0	97.0
201606	1490	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201606	1491	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	1492	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13.0	65.0
201606	1493	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201606	1494	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	My staff and I found connecting the dots for this meeting a bit of a challenge.	13.0	88.0
201606	1495	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	What we’re hearing from District contacts is not very consistent with the perspective on the economy and outlook that takes a negative signal from the recent employment report.	13.0	88.0
201606	1496	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Overall, businesses reported little change in the economic environment in the most recent cycle compared with earlier in the year.	13.0	88.0
201606	1497	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Our contacts describe an economy on a moderate growth path.	13.0	88.0
201606	1498	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Most contacts are not seeing evidence of weakening, and most remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook.	13.0	88.0
201606	1499	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	For the most part, Main Street in my District related “steady as she goes” economic conditions.	13.0	88.0
201606	1500	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	We continue to question our contacts about the weakness of business investment.	13.0	88.0
201606	1501	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	In this case, we got feedback largely in line with the data.	13.0	88.0
201606	1502	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Much of the deployment of new capital is replacement, not expansion.	13.0	88.0
201606	1503	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	At this juncture, we’re not hearing much that would point to improvement in business fixed investment spending in the near term.	13.0	88.0
201606	1504	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	The feedback from the economic trenches lines up well with the probable growth outcome for the first half.	13.0	88.0
201606	1505	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	We are assuming a second-quarter bounceback that—taken with the first quarter, which we expect to be revised up to slightly above 1 percent—produces first-half growth a little below 2 percent.	13.0	88.0
201606	1506	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	This conclusion is supported by our GDP tracking estimate for the second quarter.	13.0	88.0
201606	1507	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	As of this morning, with the retail sales and inventory numbers included in the computation, our nowcast stands at 2.8 percent for the second quarter.	13.0	88.0
201606	1508	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	The forecast I submitted for this meeting projects growth on basically a 2 percent path over the forecast horizon.	13.0	88.0
201606	1509	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	I expect 2 percent growth to be sufficient to absorb the remaining slack in the labor market and push the inflation trend to target next year.	13.0	88.0
201606	1510	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	So 2 percent growth, accompanied by effective achievement of our dual-mandate objectives, is my baseline.	13.0	88.0
201606	1511	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Around that outlook, I currently see somewhat more downside risks than upside.	13.0	88.0
201606	1512	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	An important risk question, of course, which many have discussed, is how to interpret the recent employment report and, more generally, how to size up the labor market picture.	13.0	88.0
201606	1513	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	The labor market picture is more muddled than it’s been for some time.	13.0	88.0
201606	1514	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	While I am not taking as much negative signal from the payroll survey as could be taken in isolation, I am not interpreting the household survey—that is, the drop in the unemployment rate particularly—as all positive news.	13.0	88.0
201606	1515	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	About one-third of the decline was due to an unusual flow of unemployed persons out of the labor force.	13.0	88.0
201606	1516	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	The majority of our District interactions with contacts preceded the May jobs report.	13.0	88.0
201606	1517	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	However, in the week following the report, we asked a number of contacts, including our directors, how much signal to take from the soft jobs number.	13.0	88.0
201606	1518	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	On the whole, our contacts did not hold perceptions of the labor market consistent with the jobs report.	13.0	88.0
201606	1519	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	On the contrary, we heard a number of anecdotal reports of growing tightness in labor markets.	13.0	88.0
201606	1520	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Worker turnover has become a significant problem in some regions and industries.	13.0	88.0
201606	1521	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Also, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s contribution to the recent System labor market survey did not reveal a meaningful drop-off in the demand for workers.	13.0	88.0
201606	1522	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Even with mixed information, I am not dismissing the possibility that the slowing trend in employment gains over the past three months signals an incipient growth slowdown.	13.0	88.0
201606	1523	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	One other comment on downside risk:  Recently my attention has been drawn to the declining trend in corporate profits.	13.0	88.0
201606	1524	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Corporate profits could tell us something about how to interpret both business investment and employment data.	13.0	88.0
201606	1525	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	My staff and I have to do more work on how much  weight to give to the profits decline as a causal factor in a possible slowdown.	13.0	88.0
201606	1526	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	And we’ll be doing that work in coming weeks.	13.0	88.0
201606	1527	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	So, in light of my perception of greater uncertainty associated with my forecast and the tilt of risks to the downside, I am comfortable with a wait-and-see stance at this meeting.	13.0	88.0
201606	1528	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	More on that tomorrow.	13.0	88.0
201606	1529	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201606	1530	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	1531	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	13.0	65.0
201606	1532	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank, you, Madam Chair.	13.0	111.0
201606	1533	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	The Ninth District economy continues to perform well.	13.0	111.0
201606	1534	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Jobs are relatively plentiful, while qualified workers are relatively scarce.	13.0	111.0
201606	1535	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	I made my first trip to the Bakken a few weeks ago, and I expected to find a bust—that’s how it’s characterized in the national media—but that’s actually not what I found.	13.0	111.0
201606	1536	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	A lot of the froth is off the market, and many of the temporary workers who came there to work the oil fields have gone home.	13.0	111.0
201606	1537	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	But the underlying employment situation is actually still quite healthy and robust, and there is actually a lot of optimism there.	13.0	111.0
201606	1538	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	The recent uptick, obviously, in oil prices has helped.	13.0	111.0
201606	1539	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Several large new infrastructure projects are getting started, including a new almost $4 billion oil pipeline from the Bakken to southern Illinois and a new large refinery in western North Dakota.	13.0	111.0
201606	1540	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	But my takeaway was, if even the Bakken employment situation is pretty healthy, I think that speaks well for the overall robustness of the employment situation nationally.	13.0	111.0
201606	1541	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	My overall take on the national economy is, I don’t see a sign of imminent crisis nor do I see signs of unsustainable growth and imminent overheating.	13.0	111.0
201606	1542	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Rather, I expect continued modest growth, coupled with low and stable inflation.	13.0	111.0
201606	1543	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	However, I am concerned about the low global inflation environment and long-term nominal rates that are at or near record lows in many major economies.	13.0	111.0
201606	1544	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	The United States doesn’t seem to be immune to this low global inflation.	13.0	111.0
201606	1545	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	The Michigan survey that many people have mentioned for long-term expectations has just fallen to a record low.	13.0	111.0
201606	1546	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	I’m trying to make sense of what we’re seeing in the global economy and what it means for how we think about monetary policy here.	13.0	111.0
201606	1547	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Vice Chairman Dudley’s question, I thought, was a good one earlier in the day, and I have a theory that President Evans mentioned, which is psychological scarring from the crisis.	13.0	111.0
201606	1548	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	It could explain a lot of the things that we are seeing—the persistence of the low-rate environment, the global nature of some of the trends that we are seeing, the low investment, the high savings.	13.0	111.0
201606	1549	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	I can’t quantify it, and I don’t have a model behind it.	13.0	111.0
201606	1550	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	I will certainly work with my staff and, maybe, Board staff—if you have ideas on this, I think it is worth looking at.	13.0	111.0
201606	1551	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Because if we are in for a period of extended psychological scarring, I think it’s going to affect how we think about monetary policy not just in the forecast horizon, but, potentially, much further beyond that.	13.0	111.0
201606	1552	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	13.0	111.0
201606	1553	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	1554	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13.0	65.0
201606	1555	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201606	1556	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Our baseline forecast, like everybody else’s, hasn’t really changed much since the March meeting.	13.0	96.0
201606	1557	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	We expect real GDP growth at slightly more than 2 percent over the remainder of the year, and we do continue to expect inflation to move gradually back toward our 2 percent objective over the next few years.	13.0	96.0
201606	1558	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the funds rate, we’ve had two interest rate hikes penciled in for 2016, going back to the December 2015 meeting, and we’re sticking with that for the time being.	13.0	96.0
201606	1559	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But I think there is a risk that our forecast could slip back to one or even no hikes for 2016 by the time we get to the next SEP round in September.	13.0	96.0
201606	1560	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Longer term, we have reduced the number of rate hikes in 2017 to two from three, and, like many others, we’ve lowered our long-run federal funds rate projection another ¼ point to 3 percent.	13.0	96.0
201606	1561	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we all have this sort of Bayesian model—the longer we stay in this very low interest rate environment, the more we say, “Well, okay, another quarter.”	13.0	96.0
201606	1562	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So to sum up, we made only marginal adjustments to our modal growth and inflation forecast and only small downward adjustments to our federal funds rate trajectory, but we are more worried about the downside risks to our growth, inflation, and interest rate forecast than we were at the time of the April meeting.	13.0	96.0
201606	1563	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	On the growth side, I judge the data as mixed.	13.0	96.0
201606	1564	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	On the one hand, we’ve had a very strong retail sales report and PCE report for April, and I was gratified by the May retail sales report today, because there was some risk that it was going to reverse the strength that we saw in April.	13.0	96.0
201606	1565	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	And, in fact, it was actually a bit stronger than expected.	13.0	96.0
201606	1566	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So that’s good news.	13.0	96.0
201606	1567	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But against this, we’ve seen continued weakness in investment, and we’ve seen softness in services activity, at least judging by recent declines in the nonmanufacturing ISM index.	13.0	96.0
201606	1568	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Real GDP looks like it’s picked up after a weak first quarter, but the rebound is quite modest.	13.0	96.0
201606	1569	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Even if we take our nowcast number of 2.8 percent, we’re talking about 2 percent growth for the first half of the year, and that’s probably on the high side of most estimates at this point.	13.0	96.0
201606	1570	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Of the greatest concern, of course, is the fact that the household and payroll employment reports were unambiguously weak.	13.0	96.0
201606	1571	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the effect on the labor market, I’m where Governor Tarullo is.	13.0	96.0
201606	1572	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I do suspect that the most recent payroll figures exaggerate the degree of deterioration of the US labor markets, but I do take some signal from the data.	13.0	96.0
201606	1573	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	As I noted at the most recent meeting, although there was some prospect that the gap between the strength in payroll growth and the weakness in real GDP could be closed by stronger real GDP growth, there was also the possibility the gap could be closed by weaker employment growth.	13.0	96.0
201606	1574	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	If you think about what’s happened since then, we’ve really closed the gap in both ways, somewhat stronger real GDP growth and a somewhat weaker labor market.	13.0	96.0
201606	1575	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	And it seems to me like we should put some signal on both of those things.	13.0	96.0
201606	1576	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the weakness in the payroll figures, several other measures, I think, harken to some the notion that there has been a significant slowing.	13.0	96.0
201606	1577	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	If you look at the one- month, three-month, and six-month diffusion indexes for private industry payrolls, for example, they’ve all fallen very sharply over the past two months, and the one-month and three-month private industry diffusion indexes are at their lowest levels since early 2010.	13.0	96.0
201606	1578	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So, in connection with President Mester’s point, there has been slowing in the labor market before, but if you look at the diffusion index, this seems a little bit bigger than what we’ve seen earlier in the cycle.	13.0	96.0
201606	1579	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, some people might argue—and Jeff, I think, made this point—that the slowdown in payroll growth reflects supply constraints rather than weakness in the demand for labor.	13.0	96.0
201606	1580	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I suppose that’s possible, but I don’t find that argument particularly compelling, because we don’t have one national labor market.	13.0	96.0
201606	1581	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	We have hundreds of local labor markets at different degrees of labor market slack.	13.0	96.0
201606	1582	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Even if the labor market was improving and we were getting to full employment, I would never expect to hit the wall and see a very, very sharp slowdown in payroll growth in a month or two, because I just don’t think you’d run out of an available supply of labor at the same time in all of these different labor markets across the country.	13.0	96.0
201606	1583	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	If you look at the evidence from past expansions, it basically suggests that when the economy reaches what’s viewed as full employment, what happens is the unemployment rate flattens out, but the job gains actually tend to persist in line with the growth rate of real activity, and what happens is that an increasing share of the hires comes from those who are induced by improvement in the labor market to enter the labor force.	13.0	96.0
201606	1584	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think it’s premature to conclude from the wage compensation data that we’ve reached full employment.	13.0	96.0
201606	1585	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t view the pickup in wage compensation as very large.	13.0	96.0
201606	1586	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	In the ECI, there’s basically been none, at least to date, although we’re expecting an uptick with the next report.	13.0	96.0
201606	1587	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	In the trend of average hourly earnings, I think it’s a modest uptick, but somewhat less than what I would evaluate as consistent with reaching full employment.	13.0	96.0
201606	1588	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	On the growth side, I have several concerns.	13.0	96.0
201606	1589	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	First, I’m a little bit less sanguine about consumer spending, in view of the fact that we’re actually transitioning from a period in which we had very strong real income gains supporting consumer spending to a situation in which real income gains are going to be distinctly slower now because the growth of hours worked has slowed, and we’ve had an uptick in energy prices.	13.0	96.0
201606	1590	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So the situation is exactly the reverse of what it was earlier in the year.	13.0	96.0
201606	1591	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, I also worry about the chronic weakness that we’ve seen in investment spending.	13.0	96.0
201606	1592	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Not only has it been persistent, but the election season could contribute to further weakness.	13.0	96.0
201606	1593	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s because an election can increase uncertainty about future policies, and that increased uncertainty can raise the option value of deferring investment.	13.0	96.0
201606	1594	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	There was an interesting cross- country study of the effect of elections on investment spending by Brandon Julio and Youngsuk Yook in the February 2012 issue of the Journal of Finance.	13.0	96.0
201606	1595	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	And they concluded, after looking at all of these different countries and all of these different elections, “In the period leading up to the election, investment expenditures decline by an average of 4.8 percent, controlling for growth opportunities, cash flows, and economic conditions.”	13.0	96.0
201606	1596	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So one could argue that this year’s election in the United States is highly uncertain in several respects not only at the presidential level, but also with respect to which party will be in the majority in the US Senate and, as a consequence, what policies will result.	13.0	96.0
201606	1597	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So it seems to me the option value of waiting in terms of investment has presumably increased in the current environment.	13.0	96.0
201606	1598	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Thus, we shouldn’t be surprised if the softness in investment spending persists and probably actually even worsens a bit.	13.0	96.0
201606	1599	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I also have a bit of concern about inventories.	13.0	96.0
201606	1600	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	They could prove to be a more persistent drag on growth.	13.0	96.0
201606	1601	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	The rate of inventory accumulation has been pretty high now for the past eight quarters, more than $70 billion at an annual rate each quarter, and so this has really pushed up the business inventories-to-sales ratio over time.	13.0	96.0
201606	1602	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So getting inventories back down to normal levels will require a lower inventory accumulation rate, which implies that inventories will likely be a drag on the economy for a while.	13.0	96.0
201606	1603	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I raise this issue because inventory cycles—maybe not so much recently, but if you go back to past economic history, they have, at times, been important in influencing the pace of economic activity.	13.0	96.0
201606	1604	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Speaking about monetary policy, another concern I have is that US monetary policy may not be as accommodative as we think it is.	13.0	96.0
201606	1605	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I know that several estimates of the equilibrium real short-term rate are currently close to zero, and that suggests that maybe we’re roughly 100 basis points above the actual real short-term rate.	13.0	96.0
201606	1606	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But I think the measurement of the equilibrium real short-term rate is imprecise and model dependent.	13.0	96.0
201606	1607	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	We also have to reconcile the notion that monetary policy is relatively accommodative with the fact that we’ve only been growing at a 1.5 percent rate over the past few quarters.	13.0	96.0
201606	1608	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Another aspect that I think about the monetary policy normalization story may also be in doubt:  One motivation we’ve had for an upward path for short-term rates has been the notion that the headwinds holding back growth will gradually subside over the next few years, and that will push up the neutral real short-term rate.	13.0	96.0
201606	1609	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But I ask myself the question, why should we expect these headwinds to subside to any appreciable degree from here?	13.0	96.0
201606	1610	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	If they haven’t subsided much in the seven years since the end of the Great Recession, why is this going to happen in the next year or two?	13.0	96.0
201606	1611	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	It could be that these headwinds that we talk about are much more persistent:  global savings glut, lower productivity growth, and tighter lending standards for residential mortgages.	13.0	96.0
201606	1612	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	When you think about the Great Depression, those headwinds lasted for decades, presumably.	13.0	96.0
201606	1613	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So my bottom line is that there’s a reasonable likelihood that we may not have much more to do in terms of removing monetary policy accommodation in order to get back to neutral.	13.0	96.0
201606	1614	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I’ve been pretty negative up to now, so I’m going to give you some balance, focusing on what I see as some of the more positive aspects of the outlook.	13.0	96.0
201606	1615	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me, and I think this is the sentiment around the table, that recession risks are low.	13.0	96.0
201606	1616	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	We have had decent trends in real income, we have accommodative fiscal and monetary policy, and we have buoyant financial market conditions.	13.0	96.0
201606	1617	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	The stock market has recovered, long-term rates have fallen, and the dollar has been relatively stable.	13.0	96.0
201606	1618	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So I feel like we have a pretty supportive environment for continuation of growth.	13.0	96.0
201606	1619	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Moreover, some of the drag we’ve seen in terms of real GDP should diminish or reverse.	13.0	96.0
201606	1620	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I noticed that the staff forecast for trade shows it’s a continued drag but less drag in the period ahead than what we’ve had in the past, which makes sense to me, as the broad trade-weighted dollar has steadied over the past six months or so and the drag on investment, as was noted by many, from the collapse in oil and gas drilling activity is certainly lessening at a minimum and may actually be ending.	13.0	96.0
201606	1621	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	On the inflation side of the ledger, my views haven’t really changed much.	13.0	96.0
201606	1622	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I continue to think that if the growth materializes, then we don’t really have to worry too much about inflation.	13.0	96.0
201606	1623	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But if the growth doesn’t materialize, then there’s a risk inflation will stay stuck below our 2 percent objective.	13.0	96.0
201606	1624	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I do get a little worried about the decline in the TIPS five-year, five-year-forward inflation compensation measure, especially in light of the fact that, earlier, we tended to explain it away because it was just correlated with the decline in energy prices.	13.0	96.0
201606	1625	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s a little bit more difficult to do now that energy prices are heading in the opposite direction.	13.0	96.0
201606	1626	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, I guess I take a little bit of signal from the University of Michigan five-year inflation expectations measure.	13.0	96.0
201606	1627	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But I think, on the other hand, if you look at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s three-year median estimate, that’s been pretty stable over this year.	13.0	96.0
201606	1628	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	It doesn’t show a clear trend downward, so I take a little bit of comfort from that.	13.0	96.0
201606	1629	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	We think this is a better survey—we ask the question better, have a broader sample, and we ask a lot of the same people the same question over time.	13.0	96.0
201606	1630	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So the bottom line for me is, I think we should just hang out, get more information, see what happens in terms of Brexit, and then think really carefully about what we should do about monetary policy.	13.0	96.0
201606	1631	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But more on that tomorrow.	13.0	96.0
201606	1632	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201606	1633	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Well, my thanks to everyone for an interesting discussion of the economic outlook and risks.	13.0	65.0
201606	1634	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to add a few brief comments of my own.	13.0	65.0
201606	1635	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Prior to June 3, I would have said that things were going well.	13.0	65.0
201606	1636	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Labor market indicators, on the whole, were favorable and suggested continued improvement into the spring.	13.0	65.0
201606	1637	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	The incoming data showed a sizable pickup in consumer spending after the winter’s weakness, as expected, and the housing sector continued its gradual recovery.	13.0	65.0
201606	1638	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Global economic and financial conditions had improved somewhat further and increased my confidence that the drag on the US economy due to external factors would gradually abate later this year and beyond.	13.0	65.0
201606	1639	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, indicators of business investment outside the energy sector had remained puzzlingly soft, but with firms still willing to expand their workforces, I was optimistic that capital spending would gradually pick up in response to stronger household spending and foreign growth.	13.0	65.0
201606	1640	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, the price data had come in about as I expected, consistent with my forecast that inflation would move up to 2 percent over the next two years or so, conditional on further labor market improvement, reasonably well-anchored inflation expectations, and roughly stable prices for oil and non-energy imports.	13.0	65.0
201606	1641	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Under those circumstances, my view was that another ¼ percentage point increase in the target range would soon be warranted, although I was inclined to wait until the July meeting to act in order to verify that any fallout from the Brexit vote would, indeed, be minor, in view of the fact that the cost of waiting a few weeks while clearly signaling a high probability of acting seemed low.	13.0	65.0
201606	1642	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	But the release of the May labor market report puts a considerably different light on matters, as many around the table have noted.	13.0	65.0
201606	1643	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Although I don’t think we should make too much out of one report, the May report was remarkably weak.	13.0	65.0
201606	1644	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Adjusting for the effects of the Verizon strike, payrolls increased only 73,000 in May, and the figures for March and April were marked down a total of 85,000.	13.0	65.0
201606	1645	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	As a consequence, the average increase over the past three months, while admittedly somewhat better than the May figure, was just 125,000 per month, representing a marked and abrupt slowdown in employment growth whether measured relative to average monthly gains of 220,000 over the preceding three months or the 230,000 per month pace seen last year.	13.0	65.0
201606	1646	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	And while the unemployment rate in May fell to 4.7 percent, this reduction reflected another large decline in labor force participation, as many of you noted.	13.0	65.0
201606	1647	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Indeed, the rise in labor force participation that we had seen since last summer has been largely reversed in the past two months.	13.0	65.0
201606	1648	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	This development suggests that recovery along that dimension has been much more limited than I had thought.	13.0	65.0
201606	1649	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, involuntary part-time employment jumped, leaving the broad U-6 measure of labor utilization little changed since the beginning of the year.	13.0	65.0
201606	1650	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	As many of you noted, the implications of this disappointing news are not at all clear.	13.0	65.0
201606	1651	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	One possibility is that these data are simply an aberration, as many of you suggested, that will disappear with the release of additional employment data.	13.0	65.0
201606	1652	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Lending support to this interpretation is that other timely labor market indicators did not deteriorate.	13.0	65.0
201606	1653	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Weekly initial claims have continued at a low level.	13.0	65.0
201606	1654	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Consumer expectations for labor market conditions were relatively upbeat in May, and net hiring plans by small businesses have changed little since the start of the year.	13.0	65.0
201606	1655	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	And on the basis of what I heard around the table, and also the results from the recent survey the Banks conducted in their Districts, our contacts’ assessment of the economy and the labor market don’t seem to have deteriorated significantly, although some of you did note that firms don’t seem particularly upbeat, either.	13.0	65.0
201606	1656	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, while payroll employment and the unemployment rate are two of the most reliable indicators we have, they are both subject to considerable sampling error.	13.0	65.0
201606	1657	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	For example, the 90 percent confidence interval on monthly payroll gains is plus or minus 115,000, according to the BLS.	13.0	65.0
201606	1658	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	A second possibility is that the reported slowdown in employment growth is real but reflects a lagged response on the part of firms to the weakness in aggregate spending seen late last year and this winter.	13.0	65.0
201606	1659	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Such a slowdown would arguably be consistent with the recent weakness in non-energy-related business investment.	13.0	65.0
201606	1660	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	On the whole, this interpretation could be a relatively benign one for the economic outlook.	13.0	65.0
201606	1661	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	In light of the recent rebound in consumer spending, the ongoing recovery in the housing market, and the improvement in global financial and economic conditions, the odds seem reasonably good to me that overall activity will expand at a moderate pace in coming quarters, and if so, we should expect to see a pickup in employment growth relatively soon.	13.0	65.0
201606	1662	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	A third possibility is that firms may now be finding it very difficult to hire qualified workers, resulting in employment growth downshifting to a pace more in line with its sustainable long-run rate, as President Lacker suggested.	13.0	65.0
201606	1663	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Such a deceleration does have to occur at some point, as a stable unemployment rate probably requires average payroll gains to settle down at less than 100,000 per month in the longer run.	13.0	65.0
201606	1664	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	But if such a persistent slowdown has just occurred, its abruptness is puzzling.	13.0	65.0
201606	1665	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Also, this tight labor market story is difficult to square with the jump in involuntary part-time employment, decreased demand for temporary workers, and wage growth that remains fairly subdued.	13.0	65.0
201606	1666	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	But if it is true, and in line with Governor Tarullo’s suggestion, I think it suggests little need to tighten, as the current stance of monetary policy has already, under that interpretation, succeeded in slowing employment growth to a more sustainable pace, assuming that wage growth doesn’t start to accelerate unduly.	13.0	65.0
201606	1667	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, the May report could be a harbinger of a more general and persistent slowdown in the overall economy.	13.0	65.0
201606	1668	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	This is not my expectation, and I remain cautiously optimistic that the overall economy will expand at a moderate rate over the remainder of the year—and that employment growth will pick up noticeably in the next few months.	13.0	65.0
201606	1669	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	But with the data we have in hand today, I cannot dismiss the possibility that domestic demand, which has been quite resilient in the face of a range of headwinds in recent years, may now be faltering.	13.0	65.0
201606	1670	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	So where does that leave us?	13.0	65.0
201606	1671	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	For me, the policy implications are clear.	13.0	65.0
201606	1672	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	We need to leave policy unchanged until we have a better sense of the true state of the labor market and the broader economy.	13.0	65.0
201606	1673	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Perhaps we may achieve this as early as the July meeting if the June labor market report shows a marked rebound in payroll growth and significant upward revisions to prior months’ data.	13.0	65.0
201606	1674	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Clearly, we would also like to see relatively strong, and hence reassuring, readings on spending and production.	13.0	65.0
201606	1675	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	But due to the limited amount of information we will receive in the next five weeks, some important questions may well remain unresolved by the time of our next meeting, so I think we will need to be prepared to be patient in order to confirm that conditions are evolving in line with our baseline expectations.	13.0	65.0
201606	1676	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	13.0	65.0
201606	1677	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	It is reasonably early, so let’s turn to Thomas for his briefing on monetary policy.	21.0	65.0
201606	1678	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Then we can start at a reasonable hour tomorrow and discuss policy.	21.0	65.0
201606	1679	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Be animated here, Thomas.	21.0	97.0
201606	1680	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	I will do my best.	21.0	999.0
201606	1681	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201606	1682	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21.0	999.0
201606	1683	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	In financial markets, one notable development in recent years has been the sizable decline in longer-term Treasury yields.	21.0	999.0
201606	1684	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	That decline continued over the intermeeting period, leaving the 10-year yield close to historic lows.	21.0	999.0
201606	1685	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Before turning to the draft policy statements, I will briefly explore some of the factors that may have contributed to this decline and consider what it might suggest for the Committee’s policy communications.	21.0	999.0
201606	1686	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The top-left panel of exhibit 1 illustrates the extent to which the decline in the 10- year Treasury yield has surprised the forecasters on the Blue Chip panel and has led them to repeatedly mark down their projections for the path of the 10-year yield.	21.0	999.0
201606	1687	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	For example, as of mid-2014—that’s the yellow line—forecasters expected the 10-year Treasury yield to rise about 140 basis points over the coming two years; in fact, it declined 70 basis points.	21.0	999.0
201606	1688	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The track record of the staff’s projections for longer-term rates over this period is quite similar.	21.0	999.0
201606	1689	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	This ratcheting down in the expected path for longer-term Treasury yields in part reflects shifts in the expected path of the federal funds rate, as illustrated on the right.	21.0	999.0
201606	1690	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Notably, these shifts occurred even as outcomes for the labor market and inflation were about as expected.	21.0	999.0
201606	1691	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The exhibit on the “Evolution of the Staff Forecast” that’s always shown in Tealbook A nicely illustrates this point:  It shows that, from the staff’s perspective, the unemployment rate has declined slightly more than predicted, while core inflation has been only slightly to the low side of earlier projections.	21.0	999.0
201606	1692	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The same is broadly true for the Blue Chip forecasters.	21.0	999.0
201606	1693	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Taken together, these results suggest that the economy has required a lower-than-anticipated path for the federal funds rate in order to sustain progress toward the Committee’s mandated objectives— that is, short-run r* has fallen to very low levels, as many of you noted in your SEP comments.	21.0	999.0
201606	1694	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The middle two panels review evidence on two other factors likely influencing longer-term yields.	21.0	999.0
201606	1695	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	First, as shown by the solid line to the left, the nominal term premium as calculated using the Kim-Wright model or, as shown by the dashed- dotted line, derived by the staff from the Blue Chip survey has trended down in the past several years.	21.0	999.0
201606	1696	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Although we cannot say for sure what underlies this move, the divergence in nominal yields between the United States and other advanced economies, reflecting in part diverging monetary policies, appears to be one factor.	21.0	999.0
201606	1697	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	In addition, investors appear to have revised down their views on inflation in the longer run.	21.0	999.0
201606	1698	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	As shown to the right, some market- and survey-based measures of longer-run expected inflation have moved lower over the past two years.	21.0	999.0
201606	1699	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Furthermore, with inflation running persistently low and the global economic outlook still soft, investors likely see a lower probability of an upside inflation surprise, and some may see a greater likelihood of a downside surprise, potentially reducing the inflation risk premium.	21.0	999.0
201606	1700	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The left column of the table at the bottom left shows the results of using Blue Chip surveys in combination with the staff’s term structure model of nominal and real yields to quantify the contributions of various factors to the change in the 10-year yield between the June 2014 and June 2016 Blue Chip surveys.	21.0	999.0
201606	1701	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The second and fifth lines decompose the total decline in the 10-year yield into changes in the expected path of the short-term rate over the life of the 10-year note and changes in the nominal term premium.	21.0	999.0
201606	1702	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The bulk of the decline is estimated to reflect lower term premiums.	21.0	999.0
201606	1703	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Lines three and four dig deeper and provide estimates of the real and inflation components of the change in expected short rates; lines six and seven do the same for term premiums.	21.0	999.0
201606	1704	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	This decomposition points to a drop in the inflation risk premium as the most important driver of the decline in the 10-year yield over the past two years.	21.0	999.0
201606	1705	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	To focus more directly on the longer-run determinants of yields, the right column of the table shows the same two decompositions for the 127 basis point decline in the 5-year, 5-year forward yield.	21.0	999.0
201606	1706	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The total change in this yield reflects a 52 basis point decline in expected short rates 5 to 10 years into the future and a 75 basis point drop in the corresponding term premium.	21.0	999.0
201606	1707	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Notably, as shown on line 3, most of the change in expected short-term nominal rates between 5 to 10 years ahead is due to lower expected short-term real rates, consistent with estimates indicating that r* has declined.	21.0	999.0
201606	1708	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Among the term premium components, the inflation risk premium again explains the bulk of the change, as investors may have come to view longer-term fixed-coupon nominal assets as increasingly valuable hedges against lower-than- anticipated inflation.	21.0	999.0
201606	1709	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	But the real risk premium has come down as well, as investors may also increasingly value insurance against periods of low real interest rates.	21.0	999.0
201606	1710	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Although this decomposition may help identify some of the sources of unanticipated developments, the size and persistence of the forecast errors highlight our limited ability to predict how these factors will evolve.	21.0	999.0
201606	1711	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The staff has responded to the persistence of surprisingly low rates by again reducing the estimates of the nominal term premium and longer-run r* in the Tealbook.	21.0	999.0
201606	1712	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Many of you have successively lowered your estimates of longer-run r* in your projections.	21.0	999.0
201606	1713	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	As we discussed in April, shifts in trend productivity growth, one of the likely determinants of the longer-run level of r*, are difficult to recognize in real time.	21.0	999.0
201606	1714	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	And the term premium is affected by a number of difficult-to-predict factors, including the global economic outlook and associated policy responses as well as the future path of the SOMA portfolio.	21.0	999.0
201606	1715	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Another source of uncertainty is how longer-term inflation expectations will evolve, as they appear to have remained low even as labor markets have tightened, core inflation has firmed, and oil prices have risen.	21.0	999.0
201606	1716	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The box at the bottom right summarizes several potential implications for your policy communications.	21.0	999.0
201606	1717	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The experience of the past couple of years suggests that we are in a period of elevated uncertainty about the equilibrium real interest rate and the evolution of inflation expectations and, hence, elevated uncertainty about the policy rate path consistent with achieving the Committee’s mandated objectives.	21.0	999.0
201606	1718	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	In such an environment, policy necessarily needs to be made in a more adaptive way, as indeed your changes to your policy rate paths in recent SEP submissions illustrate.	21.0	999.0
201606	1719	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	This uncertainty also highlights the importance of communicating, as in paragraph 4 of the postmeeting statement, that the policy rate path associated with achieving and sustaining your labor market and inflation objectives will depend on “realized and expected economic conditions” relative to your objectives.	21.0	999.0
201606	1720	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Thus, in your communications, you may be well served by continuing to emphasize that the policy rate path that will be associated with achieving your objectives is in no way preset.	21.0	999.0
201606	1721	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Turning to the draft alternatives for your consideration tomorrow, the important differences across the three drafts are their assessments of the information received over the intermeeting period and their implications for the Committee’s policy decision.	21.0	999.0
201606	1722	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Regarding the recent news, alternative B would emphasize the crosscurrents in the recent data but would indicate that the Committee’s modal outlook has not changed.	21.0	999.0
201606	1723	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	With respect to the policy decision, alternative B would indicate that the Committee still expects to raise the target range for the funds rate gradually but avoids signaling the likely timing.	21.0	999.0
201606	1724	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	It would suggest that, as in April, the Committee judges that it is prudent to wait and see that the economy is evolving as expected before deciding when next to raise the target range for the funds rate.	21.0	999.0
201606	1725	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	With alternative B, the Committee would communicate that the policy rate path in the period ahead will remain data dependent.	21.0	999.0
201606	1726	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Of course, investors will also look to the SEP for guidance on the Committee’s thinking about the timing of the next rate increase and the path of the funds rate thereafter.	21.0	999.0
201606	1727	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The first version of paragraph 3 in alternative C would indicate that the Committee views the recent data positively, implying that it views the economy as still on track.	21.0	999.0
201606	1728	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Accordingly, it would provide a strong signal that an increase in the target range may come in July or September.	21.0	999.0
201606	1729	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The second version of paragraph 3 in alternative C would indicate sufficient confidence that the Committee will achieve its statutory goals to raise the funds rate target at this meeting, which would be a significant surprise to investors.	21.0	999.0
201606	1730	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Like alternative B, alternative C would continue to emphasize that the path for the federal funds rate will be data dependent.	21.0	999.0
201606	1731	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	By contrast, alternative A would suggest a change in the Committee’s expectations for policy normalization in light of the recent disappointing data on employment and inflation compensation, the downside risks to the outlook, and the persistence of inflation below the Committee’s objective.	21.0	999.0
201606	1732	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	It would indicate that the appropriate policy rate path is lower, and that a decision to increase the target range would be deferred until the risks to the economic outlook are more closely balanced and inflation is closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis.	21.0	999.0
201606	1733	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	More generally, compared with alternatives B and C, it expresses less confidence in the expectation that the target federal funds rate will rise over time.	21.0	999.0
201606	1734	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Finally, I should point out that the draft alternatives in the handout include the changes that we circulated to the Committee yesterday afternoon.	21.0	999.0
201606	1735	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	In alternative B, the final sentence in paragraph 1 acknowledges the roughly 25 basis point decline in far-forward breakeven inflation and, indirectly, the 0.2 percentage point decline in the Michigan survey measure of longer-term inflation expectations.	21.0	999.0
201606	1736	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair, that concludes my prepared remarks.	21.0	999.0
201606	1737	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	21.0	65.0
201606	1738	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Questions?	22.0	65.0
201606	1739	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	22.0	65.0
201606	1740	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Just a question.	22.0	91.0
201606	1741	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Since my earlier comments today and the fact that I anticipate we’re going to mention inflation expectations in our statement tomorrow, I was slightly chastened by Governor Fischer’s critique of the Michigan survey expectations.	22.0	91.0
201606	1742	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	When he spoke about deducting 100 basis points from the average Michigan number—some type of change on the level of inflation expectations measured by the survey relative to what we’re actually targeting.	22.0	91.0
201606	1743	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Does the staff have a response to that critique?	22.0	91.0
201606	1744	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	I’ll take a crack at that.	22.0	999.0
201606	1745	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	We have one of the world’s experts here.	22.0	999.0
201606	1746	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	One starting place is to note that the question that’s asked of the respondents in the Michigan survey is quite vague.	22.0	999.0
201606	1747	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	They’re asked, “Now, about prices in general, what do you expect over the next 12 months, and what do you expect over the next 5 to 10 years?”	22.0	999.0
201606	1748	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	So I think it would strain credulity to expect a randomly selected household to have a specific view about a specific price index, but our view has always been that it would be pushing things a bit hard to assume that they’re answering specifically about the PCE price index or the CPI.	22.0	999.0
201606	1749	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	So, historically, I think we’ve been quite willing to forgive an intercept, and that’s exactly what we’ve done in fitting our Phillips curve equations.	22.0	999.0
201606	1750	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	Jeremy.	22.0	999.0
201606	1751	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	This is actually in exhibit 4 of the “Material for Staff Presentation on the Economic and Financial Situation,” panel 4.	22.0	999.0
201606	1752	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	That estimate is shown as “Phillips curve (Michigan)” and it is the estimate one gets from using the Michigan survey in a Phillips curve and allowing for an intercept adjustment that is estimated from the data.	22.0	999.0
201606	1753	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The idea is that what we view all of these survey-based expectation measures as is noisy indicators of the underlying long-term trend in inflation.	22.0	999.0
201606	1754	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	What the intercept of that kind of equation tells you is that over history, in order to get a particular observed inflation outcome as defined by, say, the core PCE price index, you had to have a wedge in that equation.	22.0	999.0
201606	1755	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Now, how you estimate that—you can debate whether it’s actually a sensible thing to do even—	22.0	999.0
201606	1756	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	But as soon as you take the view that it’s used for a forecasting relationship, the actual index level itself is of far less importance than its co-variation with the thing that you’re targeting.	22.0	91.0
201606	1757	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	That’s what I was expecting.	22.0	91.0
201606	1758	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Presumably we don’t think consumers make the hedonic adjustments in the consumer price index, I would expect.	22.0	96.0
201606	1759	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Well, there’s actually a second point about the Michigan survey that’s important to note, which is that a lot of people say a priori that the Michigan survey is ridiculous, because it’s obviously so high it’s biased—and so it’s not a good measure of an index like the CPI.	22.0	999.0
201606	1760	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	We don’t really know what the raw prices that consumers are facing look like compared with the CPI.	22.0	999.0
201606	1761	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	As you said, the CPI is heavily massaged.	22.0	999.0
201606	1762	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The BLS links prices of goods and services in the index with prices outside of the index, it makes quality adjustments, and it does other things to produce this index.	22.0	999.0
201606	1763	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	That’s even more true for the PCE price index.	22.0	999.0
201606	1764	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	It covers bundles of goods and services that aren’t necessarily what consumers have in mind when they think about what their current consumption costs are.	22.0	999.0
201606	1765	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	There’s an interesting paper by Moulton and Moses that appeared a number of years back in which they talk about the amount of quality adjustments being made in order to fit observed price quotes into the estimated CPI.	22.0	999.0
201606	1766	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	It’s a pretty large adjustment.	22.0	999.0
201606	1767	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Now, whether that can really—	22.0	999.0
201606	1768	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	What order of magnitude?	22.0	96.0
201606	1769	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	An order of magnitude sufficient enough that you could almost make the Michigan survey look reasonable compared with, say, the CPI.	22.0	999.0
201606	1770	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Now, you don’t want to necessarily look at that estimate and say, “Okay, all of those changes are obviously just statistical messing around.”	22.0	999.0
201606	1771	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	When you go to buy a tub of yogurt, and it’s 8 ounces versus 16 ounces, that kind of adjustment may be sensible, although there are a number of problems with even those sorts of adjustments that people who worry about price measurement do point out.	22.0	999.0
201606	1772	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	There’s not linear pricing for a lot of things—things that are sold in bulk are cheaper, that sort of thing.	22.0	999.0
201606	1773	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	So a lot of what’s being done to the price quotes that are then entering the CPI could be separating them from the kinds of prices that people are actually seeing and reacting to.	22.0	999.0
201606	1774	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	On the other hand, if you take the Michigan survey, and if you regressed it on, say, food, energy, and core CPI inflation, let’s say, the weights that you get are pretty close to the relative importance weights that you get for those components in the CPI.	22.0	999.0
201606	1775	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	This suggests that it’s not a completely irrational measure.	22.0	999.0
201606	1776	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	But it might be that the change in the measure, as opposed to the absolute level, is what you need to focus on if you want to think about what it means for price developments.	22.0	999.0
201606	1777	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	22.0	65.0
201606	1778	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	First of all, I compliment you on that learned discourse, but I took Governor Fischer’s critique to be that, in view of our uncertainty about the determinants of that gap, a very sharp and precise assumption that long-run inflation expectations are fixed for all time seems unwarranted.	22.0	81.0
201606	1779	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The fixity is an issue.	22.0	999.0
201606	1780	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Of course, it’s very hard to discern changes in that from other sorts of changes, like changes in the natural rate or something that might affect the inflation equation.	22.0	999.0
201606	1781	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In terms of the precision of the estimate—we did give the 70 percent range of that estimate.	22.0	999.0
201606	1782	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	If you use it in a price equation, that particular wedge is actually surprisingly well estimated because you’re basically estimating a mean, and so the more observations you have, the precision of the mean increases reasonably rapidly.	22.0	999.0
201606	1783	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	But I would agree with you.	22.0	999.0
201606	1784	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	We see this issue as well with the SPF.	22.0	999.0
201606	1785	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	We don’t have a very long series for the PCE-based SPF, but if we try to use the CPI-based SPF—we don’t really know how to do that particularly well, and how you do it can really influence the results you get and what the long-term inflation forecast would be from this kind of model.	22.0	999.0
201606	1786	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	And, again, I’d emphasize that I view these longer-term inflation expectations measures as just a noisy indicator of some kind of underlying trend, which we’re not really sure even from a theoretical standpoint how that’s tied down or how that’s determined.	22.0	999.0
201606	1787	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	It’s just something that seems to work, and a lot of people who use these sorts of measures use them because they appear to have some utility for forecasting.	22.0	999.0
201606	1788	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	I’m going to play “bad cop” just for a second to your “good cop.”	22.0	999.0
201606	1789	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	All these measurement challenges are well taken.	22.0	999.0
201606	1790	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	They’re not dramatically different today than they were a couple of years ago.	22.0	999.0
201606	1791	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	And if you look at Jeremy’s panel 3 on exhibit 4, the downward trend, I think, is pretty eye catching despite the fact that, predominantly, the measurement challenges today are substantially the same as they were in 2013.	22.0	999.0
201606	1792	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Point well taken.	22.0	81.0
201606	1793	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, though.	22.0	81.0
201606	1794	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	22.0	65.0
201606	1795	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I thought of the following argument.	22.0	108.0
201606	1796	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	The reason I know these things is that I once worked with the contents of the Michigan survey long ago, when I was interested in expectations.	22.0	108.0
201606	1797	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	They’re individually ridiculous.	22.0	108.0
201606	1798	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	They range from plus 100 percent to—I’m describing the situation in 1982.	22.0	108.0
201606	1799	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Maybe it hasn’t continued.	22.0	108.0
201606	1800	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	No, it’s substantially the same.	22.0	999.0
201606	1801	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	[Laughter]	22.0	999.0
201606	1802	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	So then you could say, “Well, it was this high, but we’re taking that out, and we’re just saying that the changes are okay.”	22.0	108.0
201606	1803	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	But that assumes that the changes are affected only by prices.	22.0	108.0
201606	1804	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Now, I don’t know what exactly is going on, but I thought what you were going to say is, “Well, yes, it’s true that their expected inflation has come down because we’ve had low inflation for a long time.	22.0	108.0
201606	1805	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	They’re adaptive.	22.0	108.0
201606	1806	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	They’ve got adaptive expectations.”	22.0	108.0
201606	1807	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	By the way, I think any person who was not trained in statistics would look at a series for a long time and say, “Gee, I’ve been saying that it’s 20 percent, but it hasn’t been 20 percent for a while, so maybe I should take it down to 19.”	22.0	108.0
201606	1808	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	You could say that the mean is moving down, and that’s what we’re really interested in.	22.0	108.0
201606	1809	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	That’s where I thought the—	22.0	108.0
201606	1810	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	Well, that’s Jeremy’s green line.	22.0	999.0
201606	1811	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	But the question is, what are they actually estimating?	22.0	108.0
201606	1812	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	They’ve got some vague idea of inflation.	22.0	108.0
201606	1813	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	But one question as well is, why does this longer-run expectations line stay so stable even after, say, when the recession hit?	22.0	999.0
201606	1814	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	You would expect if expectations really did react adaptively that you would probably see more of a reaction to, say, the—	22.0	999.0
201606	1815	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I would have expected to see more of a reaction, but they knew we were in strange times, and when you said, “Think ahead five years and tell us what you think,” you’re going to get an answer.	22.0	108.0
201606	1816	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	We’re beginning to think that these are not strange times, this is the new normal.	22.0	108.0
201606	1817	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	They, therefore, are beginning as a group to change their expectations.	22.0	108.0
201606	1818	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Now, that may be right.	22.0	108.0
201606	1819	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	It may be a justification for using this, but heaven knows what the standard error is.	22.0	108.0
201606	1820	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Well, so that’s one reason that we use a host of different measures as well as purely statistical approaches to try to filter out what is really going on with inflation’s underlying trend.	22.0	999.0
201606	1821	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	That’s actually what table 4 is trying to do.	22.0	999.0
201606	1822	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	It’s using a host of different statistical methods and different proxies for survey expectations.	22.0	999.0
201606	1823	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	To be completely honest with you, we don’t even know why this should matter for price setting.	22.0	999.0
201606	1824	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Why should your 10-year expectation matter for price setting?	22.0	999.0
201606	1825	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The best I can tell you is it seems to be a reasonable proxy for some stochastic trend in inflation.	22.0	999.0
201606	1826	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Jeremy, you’re not going to get me to defend the use of that.	22.0	108.0
201606	1827	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	22.0	108.0
201606	1828	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	22.0	65.0
201606	1829	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22.0	94.0
201606	1830	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I just had one question about exhibit 1, panel 2, which was the Blue Chip projections for the federal funds rate.	22.0	94.0
201606	1831	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I understood you to say that these are what the projections were as of June of all these years, and then you said that what actually happened in terms of unemployment and inflation was not that different from what the Blue Chip projected.	22.0	94.0
201606	1832	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	And which year was that for?	22.0	94.0
201606	1833	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Was that for all four of these?	22.0	94.0
201606	1834	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	No.	22.0	999.0
201606	1835	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	I can tell you for sure that for June 2014—	22.0	999.0
201606	1836	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	June 2014?	22.0	94.0
201606	1837	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Exactly.	22.0	999.0
201606	1838	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	If you look at the June 2014 expectations, for example, for CPI inflation for 2015 and the Blue Chip reports’ for average unemployment rate over the course of the year—in terms of CPI inflation, they were pretty much spot-on, and in terms of the unemployment rate, they were off by a few tenths.	22.0	999.0
201606	1839	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	This is two years ahead.	22.0	94.0
201606	1840	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The June 2014 expectation for the 2015 outcome.	22.0	999.0
201606	1841	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I just want to make sure I’m reading this right.	22.0	94.0
201606	1842	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	So Blue Chip projected 200 basis points of normalization as of June 2014.	22.0	94.0
201606	1843	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Unemployment and inflation came in as expected, but they got only 25 basis points of normalization—175 basis points off.	22.0	94.0
201606	1844	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	That’s what you’re saying?	22.0	94.0
201606	1845	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	That’s correct.	22.0	999.0
201606	1846	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	22.0	94.0
201606	1848	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions?	52.0	65.0
201606	1849	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	52.0	65.0
201606	1850	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	52.0	65.0
201606	1851	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	We have a reception and a dinner across the street.	52.0	65.0
201606	1852	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	We will resume tomorrow at 9:00 am June 15 Session .	52.0	65.0
201606	1853	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	50.0	65.0
201606	1854	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s see.	50.0	65.0
201606	1855	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I want to first turn things over to Brian to make a short announcement.	50.0	65.0
201606	1856	2016-06-15	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	50.0	999.0
201606	1857	2016-06-15	meeting	MADIGAN	I’d like to note that a corrected version of one of the exhibits from yesterday’s SEP briefing has been distributed and should be on the table in front of you.	50.0	999.0
201606	1858	2016-06-15	meeting	MADIGAN	The version of exhibit 3 included in yesterday’s SEP briefing package incorrectly showed the median federal funds rate projected for the end of 2017, a red horizontal line, as 1½ percent.	50.0	999.0
201606	1859	2016-06-15	meeting	MADIGAN	The correct value is 1⅝ percent.	50.0	999.0
201606	1860	2016-06-15	meeting	MADIGAN	The correct value was reflected in the initial projections package distributed to the Committee on Monday.	50.0	999.0
201606	1861	2016-06-15	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you.	50.0	999.0
201606	1862	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	50.0	65.0
201606	1863	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’re ready to begin our policy—	50.0	65.0
201606	1864	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Brian, I’m not sure that what I’ve got shows 1⅝ percent.	50.0	108.0
201606	1865	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	You’re talking about the top panel?	50.0	65.0
201606	1866	2016-06-15	meeting	MADIGAN	It’s in the top panel, the one for the June projections.	50.0	999.0
201606	1867	2016-06-15	meeting	MADIGAN	Sorry, I should have made that clear.	50.0	999.0
201606	1868	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	50.0	65.0
201606	1869	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we begin our policy go-round?	23.0	65.0
201606	1870	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll start with President Williams.	23.0	65.0
201606	1871	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	102.0
201606	1872	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Before I turn directly to my views on policy, I did want to make a brief comment about the memo on the new policy rule for the staff economic and financial forecast.	23.0	102.0
201606	1873	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I was planning on making this comment yesterday, but our conversation moved in a different direction, so I thought it was appropriate to make it today.	23.0	102.0
201606	1874	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	First of all, I think that the approach the staff is taking is very reasonable, and that it’s important for the staff—I’ve been in the Federal Reserve for over 20 years, and it’s an ongoing issue:  How does the staff write down an assumption about policy to build a baseline forecast?	23.0	102.0
201606	1875	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think the goal here is not to tell the Committee what it should be doing but to inform the Committee that, under a basic view on monetary policy, these are the consequences in terms of the outlook.	23.0	102.0
201606	1876	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Over the 20 years I’ve been here, this has evolved in different ways.	23.0	102.0
201606	1877	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think this approach—which, as I understand it, is to basically have an assumption about policy that seems to be close to the Committee’s median view or something—makes sense in that it provides some clarity for all of us to understand, “Well, here’s the view of policy, and then here’s what the outlook would look like.”	23.0	102.0
201606	1878	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	So there aren’t these two different things we have to figure out— what’s the staff’s view on policy, and what’s the staff’s view on the economy?—and try to discern what the two drivers of the differences in forecasts are.	23.0	102.0
201606	1879	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	That said, the real point I want to make is that we do have to be cautious in interpreting what the staff assumption is about policy—in particular, that there is a “hall of mirrors” now going on.	23.0	102.0
201606	1880	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	They’ve given us a path for policy that they think represents our views, so we have to be careful not to look at this path and maybe get comfort out of the fact that the staff’s view on policy is the same as ours.	23.0	102.0
201606	1881	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Obviously, we have all of these alternative ways of thinking about policy, with the policy rules, the optimal control experiments, and things like that.	23.0	102.0
201606	1882	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Those are important checks for thinking about how to think about the path for policy and alternatives for that.	23.0	102.0
201606	1883	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	But the only point I really want to make is that often I will say things, like “My views on the forecast or policy are very similar to the staff’s,” and then that coherence is somehow reassuring.	23.0	102.0
201606	1884	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Well, you just don’t want to do that about policy, because the staff, of course, is giving us the policy rate path that they think we essentially have in our own minds.	23.0	102.0
201606	1885	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, again, this was a very valuable change in the approach, and I just think we have to be cautious about not getting comfort out of the fact that the staff seems to agree with our views about policy.	23.0	102.0
201606	1886	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Turning to the outlook for policy, my baseline outlook for the dual-mandate goals has changed very little since April.	23.0	102.0
201606	1887	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’re essentially at full employment, and, while we continue to fall short of our inflation goal, the recent news on that front has been consistent with my forecast of a gradual return to 2 percent inflation.	23.0	102.0
201606	1888	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, all else being equal, in light of where we are on our dual-mandate goals and in light of the progress I anticipate seeing over the next year or two, I think that’s an economic situation that would call for a continued gradual removal of accommodation being appropriate.	23.0	102.0
201606	1889	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, not all else is equal.	23.0	102.0
201606	1890	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	There is Brexit, and then there’s the question that we discussed at length yesterday:  What signal should we take, if any, from the May employment report?	23.0	102.0
201606	1891	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	As these are acute uncertainties, which, especially in the case of Brexit, we should have better information about in a few weeks—we will get more data on the economic outlook in terms of the labor market and, more generally, economic indicators in the next month or so—as we heard from a number of people, there’s a good argument for waiting, based on the fact that these uncertainties should resolve in the next month or two.	23.0	102.0
201606	1892	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I would reiterate that we can’t always delay.	23.0	102.0
201606	1893	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	There’s always uncertainty in the economic outlook, and should the news between now and our next meeting in July be consistent with my forecast, I expect I will be arguing that it’s time to reengage on our announced policy of a gradual removal of accommodation.	23.0	102.0
201606	1894	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the meantime, I am concerned about the message that we’re sending with alternative B the way it’s written.	23.0	102.0
201606	1895	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	My modal projection, similar to the Tealbook’s, is one of gradual policy normalization later this year.	23.0	102.0
201606	1896	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Our discussion here was consistent with that view.	23.0	102.0
201606	1897	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	But the current version of alt-B is more dovish, if you will, even than the April statement.	23.0	102.0
201606	1898	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	And if you remember what happened after the April statement, the public and market participants widely viewed this as indicating that we are on an extended hold.	23.0	102.0
201606	1899	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s only after the minutes for the April meeting were released and some other public pronouncements that market participants even allowed for the possibility that there would be a rate hike at the next meeting, and I think we’re poised for a repeat performance of that.	23.0	102.0
201606	1900	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, as I understand what alt-B means in the FOMC and that’s the likely outcome, I do think it’s important, Madam Chair, to reiterate the key messages, which I believe I heard you and others say—that the outlook remains positive in terms of our dual-mandate goals.	23.0	102.0
201606	1901	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Our plan for gradual policy normalization remains in place, and our decision to sit tight today reflects a careful balancing of the costs, benefits, and risks but is not a sign of a shift in strategy or a fundamental reassessment of the outlook for our policy goals.	23.0	102.0
201606	1902	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23.0	102.0
201606	1903	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	1904	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Let me just assure you that I intend, or at least I hope, to send that message in my press conference statement—that our expectation is, we remain on a gradual path that’s not fixed.	23.0	65.0
201606	1905	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	It’s data dependent, but our expectation still is, over time, that some further increases will be appropriate if we do see the labor market on a solid path.	23.0	65.0
201606	1906	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23.0	102.0
201606	1907	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23.0	65.0
201606	1908	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	1909	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	23.0	65.0
201606	1910	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201606	1911	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B.	23.0	90.0
201606	1912	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is appropriate to wait to see whether the employment report was anomalous.	23.0	90.0
201606	1913	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Should the Brexit vote prove uneventful, which is my expectation, and the next labor market report shows improvement, I would like to keep an open mind on appropriate policy for July.	23.0	90.0
201606	1914	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	We are now at my estimate of full employment.	23.0	90.0
201606	1915	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	As corroborating evidence, wages are now showing more of an upward trend.	23.0	90.0
201606	1916	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I am less worried about undesirably high inflation than about an unemployment rate undershoot, still the lagged effect of oil prices will soon be pushing inflation up, not down.	23.0	90.0
201606	1917	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	In view of the uncertainty about how low the equilibrium interest rate might be, I would much prefer gradual increases in rates that allow us to gauge how far we have to go.	23.0	90.0
201606	1918	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	I fear that we might be forced to make much quicker increases if we greatly overshoot full employment.	23.0	90.0
201606	1919	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	As I mentioned yesterday, our own election is viewed by many as far riskier than the Brexit vote.	23.0	90.0
201606	1920	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	I am concerned that we might come to have the same view, which might make us reluctant to move in September, particularly because market participants will point to the Brexit vote as a reason we’re not moving today.	23.0	90.0
201606	1921	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, if the data improve as I expect, I would want to seriously consider a modest further removal of accommodation in July.	23.0	90.0
201606	1922	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Assurances to move later this year seem less promising than taking appropriate action relatively soon.	23.0	90.0
201606	1923	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because we’re at full employment and nearing our inflation goal, and recognizing that we have a poor record of slowing the economy just a little bit when we have fallen well below full employment, it will likely be time to act fairly soon.	23.0	90.0
201606	1924	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I favor a gradual path to normalization, we should not risk falling “behind the curve” and having to move rapidly to catch up.	23.0	90.0
201606	1925	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201606	1926	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	1927	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23.0	65.0
201606	1928	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201606	1929	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	A large component of actual monetary policy is expected future monetary policy.	23.0	94.0
201606	1930	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We represent this to the public and to global financial markets via the so-called dot plot, featuring the future value of the policy rate.	23.0	94.0
201606	1931	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The current policy rate dot plot appears to be too steep.	23.0	94.0
201606	1932	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The federal funds futures markets do not believe it.	23.0	94.0
201606	1933	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	They are priced for a much shallower path of rate increases than that shown by the median dots.	23.0	94.0
201606	1934	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Our own actual pace of rate increases has been much slower than what we mapped out in the past.	23.0	94.0
201606	1935	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We only moved once in 2015.	23.0	94.0
201606	1936	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	It does not seem likely to me that we’ll even move more than once in 2016.	23.0	94.0
201606	1937	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	That’s once per year.	23.0	94.0
201606	1938	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	It would take 14 years to normalize 350 basis points at this pace.	23.0	94.0
201606	1939	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Yesterday Thomas Laubach provided an example of the mismatch between the policy rate dots and reality.	23.0	94.0
201606	1940	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The 2014 June Blue Chip forecast was very accurate.	23.0	94.0
201606	1941	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The economy has evolved almost exactly as expected by Blue Chip between June 2014 and today.	23.0	94.0
201606	1942	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The Blue Chip forecasters should have also been right concerning the path of the policy rate between June 2014 and today.	23.0	94.0
201606	1943	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	But, based in part on Committee guidance, they predicted a policy rate of around 200 basis points today.	23.0	94.0
201606	1944	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	They were off by more than 150 basis points, a huge miss in this game.	23.0	94.0
201606	1945	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	This mismatch between what we are saying and what we are doing is arguably wreaking havoc in global market pricing, causing unnecessary confusion over future FOMC policy, and eroding the credibility of this Committee.	23.0	94.0
201606	1946	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Why are we doing this?	23.0	94.0
201606	1947	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	First, gaps are close to zero, implying that we should set the policy rate equal to the natural rate of interest.	23.0	94.0
201606	1948	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Second, we think in terms of a long-run steady state to which the economy must converge.	23.0	94.0
201606	1949	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	All variables must trend toward the steady-state values.	23.0	94.0
201606	1950	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	This implies that the policy rate has a substantial upward trend.	23.0	94.0
201606	1951	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	This is, in fact, reflected in our policy-rate dot plot.	23.0	94.0
201606	1952	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Even if we argue that r* is low today, it would also have to trend back toward steady state, sending the policy rate higher in tandem.	23.0	94.0
201606	1953	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	What are the Committee reactions to this situation?	23.0	94.0
201606	1954	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	One Committee reaction is to lower gradually the steady-state values over time.	23.0	94.0
201606	1955	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	This is a perfectly fine thing to do, but it can send a pessimistic signal about the future of the US economy.	23.0	94.0
201606	1956	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Another reaction is to stretch out the adjustment time.	23.0	94.0
201606	1957	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We’ve often told a headwinds story, for instance, and some of the discussion yesterday—Vice Chairman Dudley brought this up—was that the headwinds story seems to be losing credibility, as we’ve been using it ever since the end of the recession seven years ago.	23.0	94.0
201606	1958	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	What can be done?	23.0	94.0
201606	1959	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The policy rate dot plot logic puts too much weight on the idea that we “know” the long-run steady state of the economy.	23.0	94.0
201606	1960	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	In reality, we are uncertain about the medium- and long-run outcomes for the economy.	23.0	94.0
201606	1961	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We need a manageable way to express this uncertainty.	23.0	94.0
201606	1962	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	One way of doing this is to adopt a regime-based approach to the description of medium- and longer-term outcomes for the economy.	23.0	94.0
201606	1963	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The regime-based approach arguably allows one to describe the current situation for policy more accurately.	23.0	94.0
201606	1964	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	In particular, in the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis forecast, we argue that r†, the real return on short-term government debt, is exceptionally low due to an abnormally large liquidity premium.	23.0	94.0
201606	1965	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We put this r† at minus 137 basis points.	23.0	94.0
201606	1966	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We use the regime-based argument to say that this value is unlikely to change over the forecast horizon, as opposed to some kind of slow mean reversion.	23.0	94.0
201606	1967	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	So r† just stays where it is over the forecast horizon.	23.0	94.0
201606	1968	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Combined with other elements of our forecast, this means that the optimal regime- dependent policy rate is just 63 basis points through the forecast horizon—that is, through the end of 2018.	23.0	94.0
201606	1969	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	There are risks to this forecast that may imply a somewhat higher policy rate over the forecast horizon, but the baseline is for an essentially flat policy rate outlook.	23.0	94.0
201606	1970	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The regime- switching approach holds out some optimism for the future, as the economy can switch back to a high-growth and lower-liquidity-premium outcome.	23.0	94.0
201606	1971	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Under the SEP submission I’ve described yesterday and today, we need only one further rate increase to get to the correct level for the policy rate, under the regime that we’re in.	23.0	94.0
201606	1972	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I prefer to make that move on the back of good news about the US economy.	23.0	94.0
201606	1973	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The recent jobs report was not good news, so I do not think we should move today.	23.0	94.0
201606	1974	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Accordingly, today I’m supporting alternative B as written.	23.0	94.0
201606	1975	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201606	1976	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	1977	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23.0	65.0
201606	1978	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201606	1979	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	I’m fine with alternative B as written.	23.0	97.0
201606	1980	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	This is a text that hasn’t changed a lot in the past several meetings other than the normal adjustments that are made to paragraphs 1 and 2, reflecting recent developments.	23.0	97.0
201606	1981	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	And I’ve actually been in the camp that has favored minimal changes, certainly to the rest of the statement, because I thought the alternative was something that leaned more toward another rate increase, which is something I haven’t favored.	23.0	97.0
201606	1982	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	But I do think we’ve got some issues to address in connection with communication, which may counsel some nontrivial changes to the statement in the not-too-distant future, including in the action paragraphs lower in the statement.	23.0	97.0
201606	1983	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	I’ll return to this topic in a moment.	23.0	97.0
201606	1984	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	First, I wanted to explain a bit more the way I am thinking about the future course of policy, and I’ll note specifically what being data dependent means for me.	23.0	97.0
201606	1985	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Essentially, I begin from the language of the Federal Reserve Act, which instructs us to seek maximum employment consistent with price stability, not some extrapolated concept of full employment that is substantially disconnected from price inflation and thereby the second part of the mandate.	23.0	97.0
201606	1986	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Among other practical implications of pursuing this goal is that more progress in the labor market is more likely to benefit groups that are more on the margins of the labor market—blacks, Hispanics, and those generally with a weaker connection to the labor market.	23.0	97.0
201606	1987	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	As explained yesterday, a flattened Phillips curve—and, insofar as one has confidence in inflation expectations as a driving factor, well-anchored inflation expectations—makes it likely that there would be ample time for measured monetary policy reactions if the economy seemed to be overheating, rather than simply chugging along, or if inflation was demonstrably, and in a nontransitory fashion, moving not just in the direction of, but actually to, the target rate.	23.0	97.0
201606	1988	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	The notion that there’s enough time to react, I think, is further supported by the low equilibrium real interest rate, meaning we don’t have that far to go to reach a neutral or even restrictive position, and by some of the factors mentioned by Bill Wascher in yesterday’s session that may account for this low rate.	23.0	97.0
201606	1989	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	I might, in passing, add to yesterday’s list that the aggregated fiscal policies of the world’s major economies are hardly stimulative.	23.0	97.0
201606	1990	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	I think one can remain agnostic in the larger debate that was joined by Presidents Bullard and Williams during yesterday’s session but still take account of important nontransitory economic characteristics and conditions that shape the environment in which we’re making monetary policy.	23.0	97.0
201606	1991	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	I think those do shift from time to time and from business cycle to business cycle, and, arguably, the shifts have been even greater in the wake of the crisis.	23.0	97.0
201606	1992	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	So, for me, being data dependent means, in essence, looking for data that demonstrate, as I mentioned a moment ago, that inflation will get all of the way to 2 percent and then stay around that level on the basis of appropriate monetary policy adjustments.	23.0	97.0
201606	1993	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Now, obviously, I’ve been going along with statements that don’t really reflect that view, and it hasn’t been articulated in the minutes or elsewhere.	23.0	97.0
201606	1994	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	But, in and of itself, that doesn’t suggest there’s a problem.	23.0	97.0
201606	1995	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	It’s somewhat inevitable in a collective process, and neither those of us somewhat less inclined to move nor those of us somewhat more inclined to move are going to be totally comfortable with any statement that tries to walk more down the middle of the positions of the members of the Committee.	23.0	97.0
201606	1996	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	The fairly significant range of views around this table make it a little more challenging.	23.0	97.0
201606	1997	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	But, again, I don’t think that’s, in and of itself, a problem that needs to be corrected.	23.0	97.0
201606	1998	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	I actually think the greater problem may be that the Committee’s communications—taking together the statements, minutes, and rather plentiful public comments by Committee participants—may not accurately be reflecting the views of even those closest to the middle of the Committee.	23.0	97.0
201606	1999	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	What we’re projecting to the public, I think, at some points is that we’ll raise rates at some relatively near point in the future if the economy evolves as expected.	23.0	97.0
201606	2000	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	And, particularly when this projection is augmented by the frequent references to specific meetings made publicly by members of the Committee, I think the message becomes, or is at least heard by many as suggesting, that rates will rise soon unless something pretty dramatic happens.	23.0	97.0
201606	2001	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	That is, there’s an inference that the Committee is pretty confident that the economy will evolve as it expects, since we’re only a month or two away from the meetings being discussed.	23.0	97.0
201606	2002	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	But we’ve now had several occasions when things have come along—China, Brexit, and the labor market report—that, in my view, sensibly lead a majority of the Committee to want to hold back.	23.0	97.0
201606	2003	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	But, as President Williams mentioned a couple of minutes ago, that message then becomes confusing, particularly as these instances add up, because at that point, I think, people are having more difficulty understanding exactly what the Committee’s reaction function is.	23.0	97.0
201606	2004	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	I think the center of the Committee has, in fact, had a higher hurdle regarding another rate increase than has been perceived, although I don’t think it’s as high a hurdle as the one that I would fashion.	23.0	97.0
201606	2005	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	I suspect this reflects some of the underlying uneasiness about the various factors that Bill and others were mentioning yesterday.	23.0	97.0
201606	2006	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	So the pauses conform well to an approach that wants a higher degree of confidence that growth is not going to be thrown off track, but our communication is not reflecting that.	23.0	97.0
201606	2007	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Now, I certainly don’t have the formulation to suggest right now to adjust the communication strategy to be more accurate in communicating, certainly, where the critical mass of the center of the Committee is.	23.0	97.0
201606	2008	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	But I do think we need to begin working on something, unless perhaps all of the stars align and the economy starts moving ahead vigorously in the coming months.	23.0	97.0
201606	2009	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Perhaps the preferable option would be a more precise statement of what the data on which our decisions are dependent are supposed to be showing.	23.0	97.0
201606	2010	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	I guess the fallback would simply be no real guidance or not making the pretense of actually offering any guidance, but instead having a statement that was really stripped of anything resembling forward intentionality, which would kind of reflect the fact that there was a lot of disagreement and everybody was data dependent in their own terms.	23.0	97.0
201606	2011	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	But, for obvious reasons, the first path would be preferable.	23.0	97.0
201606	2012	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Now, changing toward something different than reference to the path the Committee expects the economy to follow will very probably make it more difficult for one or the other end of the spectrum that has defined the working consensus to stay on board.	23.0	97.0
201606	2013	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Ideally, of course, we would be able to find a formulation that would accomplish that, but, at some point, the efficacy of communication and the credibility costs associated with not communicating effectively might make the tradeoff—meaning some more dissent—the better of a not entirely appealing set of options.	23.0	97.0
201606	2014	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201606	2015	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	2016	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23.0	65.0
201606	2017	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	103.0
201606	2018	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	I can support alternative B today, in light of the sharp slowdown in employment growth in May, along with uncertainties and potential risks to our economy associated with the looming UK referendum.	23.0	103.0
201606	2019	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	My own view has been that our policy actions have not kept pace with the strengthening of the economy and our outlook for inflation and unemployment.	23.0	103.0
201606	2020	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, steps to withdraw accommodation ought to be initiated before our goals are fully reached.	23.0	103.0
201606	2021	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	In view of the current level of unemployment and actual and expected increases in inflation, we look to be approaching, if not close to achieving, our mandated goals.	23.0	103.0
201606	2022	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	For that reason, I believe that, as described in alternative C, “a modest increase in the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate in coming months if incoming information confirms ... expectations for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation.”	23.0	103.0
201606	2023	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	While the May employment report was particularly disappointing, I believe it should be viewed in the context of a labor market that is at or near full employment, a secularly declining labor force participation rate, and a potential growth rate that has likely fallen below 2 percent.	23.0	103.0
201606	2024	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	I would not expect to continue seeing the kinds of increases in employment we saw in the first quarter, nor should we expect broad strengthening of labor market indicators, but rather, moderate job gains consistent with maintaining full employment.	23.0	103.0
201606	2025	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	If structural factors are restraining productivity and labor force growth, our monetary policy may be pushing against the economy’s productive capacity.	23.0	103.0
201606	2026	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	In this situation, it would be appropriate, in my view, to continue gradually removing accommodation even with a lower terminal rate in mind.	23.0	103.0
201606	2027	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	23.0	103.0
201606	2028	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	2029	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	23.0	65.0
201606	2030	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201606	2031	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	In light of the recent disappointing employment report, I am supportive of no change in the funds rate at this meeting.	23.0	999.0
201606	2032	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Inflation is only gradually returning to target, and some patience is called for as more data allow us to better assess whether the falloff in employment is transitory or a signal of a more persistent decline in the demand for labor.	23.0	999.0
201606	2033	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	With many other labor market indicators still appearing healthy, my modal outlook is for employment growth to return to a pace greater than a mere replacement rate but not to return to the robust numbers that characterized its behavior over much of last year.	23.0	999.0
201606	2034	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	If that scenario was to unfold, I would favor a move in July, conditional on the Brexit vote and subsequent market reactions.	23.0	999.0
201606	2035	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Regarding alternative B, however, my impression is that the language does not adequately prepare the public for that possibility.	23.0	999.0
201606	2036	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Most significantly, substantial intermeeting communication would be required to make July a live meeting.	23.0	999.0
201606	2037	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	If others share my view of the economy and the language, then some modification of paragraph 1 would, I think, prove useful.	23.0	999.0
201606	2038	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Specifically, I suggest that the second sentence be changed to the following:  “Job gains have diminished, but the unemployment rate has declined and other labor market indicators appear healthy.”	23.0	999.0
201606	2039	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Wage growth is improving, new claims remain at low levels, and my overall reading of the JOLTS report is that the labor market remains vibrant.	23.0	999.0
201606	2040	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Now, granted, the JOLTS data are for April, as mentioned yesterday.	23.0	999.0
201606	2041	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	But I think it is unlikely that we will see a game-changing shift in May.	23.0	999.0
201606	2042	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	At least, my contacts in my region largely leave me with the opposite impression.	23.0	999.0
201606	2043	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	So I am skeptical that the language in alternative B adequately leaves July on the table, and I strongly believe that the appropriate policy will require every meeting to be viewed as live.	23.0	999.0
201606	2044	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	The language in alternative C is probably a bit too aggressive for my taste.	23.0	999.0
201606	2045	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	So, with that in mind, I would like to propose alternative language in paragraph 1 for alternative B.	23.0	999.0
201606	2046	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201606	2047	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Could you say again your suggestion?	23.0	65.0
201606	2048	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Sure.	23.0	999.0
201606	2049	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	“Job gains have diminished, but the unemployment rate has declined and other labor market indicators appear healthy.”	23.0	999.0
201606	2050	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	I’m just arguing for a slightly more balanced view of the labor market.	23.0	999.0
201606	2051	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	2052	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	23.0	65.0
201606	2053	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201606	2054	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	I do believe we are moving closer to achieving our dual-mandate objectives regarding unemployment and inflation, and I think I would be comfortable if paragraph 1 maybe reflected that to a greater, more balanced degree.	23.0	110.0
201606	2055	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Having said that, I’m also sensitive to the fact that sluggish, longer-term US growth prospects have combined with expanded worldwide demand for safe assets and a weak and uncertain economic and political outlook abroad to put downward pressure on the real federal funds rate.	23.0	110.0
201606	2056	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	The implication for me is that monetary policy is less accommodative at a given federal funds rate setting than might have been expected previously.	23.0	110.0
201606	2057	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Global financial integration means that financial market conditions are sensitive to increases in the level of US short-term rates relative to foreign rates.	23.0	110.0
201606	2058	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	And as long as the foreign economic outlook remains subdued, I am supportive of a shallower path for US interest rates.	23.0	110.0
201606	2059	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	What does all of this mean for today’s decision?	23.0	110.0
201606	2060	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	I was not, specifically, as much concerned by the weak May employment report as such.	23.0	110.0
201606	2061	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	But I am worried about the fact that it was, to me, the third consecutive month of a slowing in job growth, although, I think, within the context of a strong jobs market.	23.0	110.0
201606	2062	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Also, I note the falloff in the ISM nonmanufacturing survey, and I am struck by the fact that, although different than some of the anecdotes given around the room, the anecdotal reports I am getting from business contacts are more mixed.	23.0	110.0
201606	2063	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Obviously, when you overlay on that the potential fallout from the Brexit vote, I certainly agree with being patient before removing accommodation.	23.0	110.0
201606	2064	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	And if current policy is only mildly accommodative, I think we can afford to exercise some patience.	23.0	110.0
201606	2065	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Beyond this meeting, I will be in a wait-and-see mode regarding upcoming economic data that would reaffirm my GDP forecast and give me confidence in continued improvement in the jobs market as well as continued progress in reaching our 2 percent medium-term inflation target.	23.0	110.0
201606	2066	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m very open that we may, in fact, get that confirming data in the near future.	23.0	110.0
201606	2067	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	More broadly, though, I would say my assessment of conditions reinforces my view that economic policy aside from monetary policy—that is, structural reforms and fiscal policy—is going to be necessary to address key secular trends we’ve been talking about:  aging demographics; high levels of debt to GDP, which, at a minimum, make fiscal policy more difficult; the impact of globalization; and the growing effects of disruption, which are increasingly creating dislocations across industries.	23.0	110.0
201606	2068	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Examples of actions outside monetary policy include appropriate immigration reform; infrastructure spending; investment in education, particularly with an emphasis on public-private partnerships for vocational training and retraining; and a thorough review and cost-benefit analysis of regulation at the state, local, and national levels.	23.0	110.0
201606	2069	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	All of these need to be considered.	23.0	110.0
201606	2070	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	While paralysis has been prevalent over the past eight years, I believe we are now entering a phase in which policy options must be broadened beyond monetary policy.	23.0	110.0
201606	2071	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	And if I take President Bullard’s approach, to break out of this regime, I think we’re going to need actions beyond just monetary policy.	23.0	110.0
201606	2072	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	We’re going to need to find ways to increase real GDP growth.	23.0	110.0
201606	2073	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	In the meantime, debt is growing faster than nominal GDP, and therefore we are becoming more leveraged in the United States, for sure, and across advanced economies.	23.0	110.0
201606	2074	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	This will ultimately have implications for the future.	23.0	110.0
201606	2075	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Actions beyond monetary policy are going to be necessary to fuel improved GDP growth, and I think it’ll be worth noting that increasingly in the future in our public comments.	23.0	110.0
201606	2076	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201606	2077	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	2078	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23.0	65.0
201606	2079	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201606	2080	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	For today, I support alternative B, but I have to say that my support is largely because the Committee has already so strongly signaled that conditions may seem to be about right for policy renormalization to continue.	23.0	91.0
201606	2081	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	I’m far from confident that this signal is appropriate now, but reversing course would be a very big step.	23.0	91.0
201606	2082	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Still, if conditions deteriorate sufficiently to justify seriously reconsidering the conditions required to resume renormalization, then I’d find alternative A rather attractive.	23.0	91.0
201606	2083	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	I have to say that I’m sympathetic to Governor Tarullo’s communications concerns, his emphasis on the maximum-employment mandate, and his emphasis on data dependence as it relates to inflation.	23.0	91.0
201606	2084	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	I’m also sympathetic to President Bullard’s concern over the effect that our communications risk sort of Delphic interpretations of what we’re doing, and that every time we delay, it indicates that maybe we have less confidence that the economy is recovering as strongly.	23.0	91.0
201606	2085	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Something different might help.	23.0	91.0
201606	2086	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	In particular, I’m drawn to the forward guidance in alternative A that says “The Committee judges that an increase in the target range will not be warranted until the risks to the outlook are more closely balanced and inflation moves closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis.”	23.0	91.0
201606	2087	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	It’s that 2 percent that I find attractive.	23.0	91.0
201606	2088	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	It would be less Delphic.	23.0	91.0
201606	2089	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Let me explain why this seems attractive.	23.0	91.0
201606	2090	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	The Committee has strongly communicated that the timing and size of future adjustments to the federal funds rate will be determined by our confidence in achieving our employment and inflation objectives.	23.0	91.0
201606	2091	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	This is an appropriate outcome-based policy commitment.	23.0	91.0
201606	2092	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	An important question is, how far ahead of actual inflation should we be increasing rates?	23.0	91.0
201606	2093	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Our experience from the 1970s suggests that “falling behind the curve” risks an unacceptable overshooting of our inflation target.	23.0	91.0
201606	2094	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Lags in both the inflation process and the effects of monetary policy on the economy play strong roles in this assessment.	23.0	91.0
201606	2095	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	The 1970s are clearly an important historical lesson we will always remember.	23.0	91.0
201606	2096	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	But failing to account for these lags was probably less critical than was our lack of appreciation for the slowdown in potential output and for the role of expectations in the inflationary process.	23.0	91.0
201606	2097	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Changes in potential output and inflation expectations are key to our policy discussions today as well, but we’re in a much different place now.	23.0	91.0
201606	2098	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Humility is always wise, but we certainly seem well attuned to the likelihood that potential output growth, both in the United States and around the world, has been and will likely continue to be quite weak for some time to come.	23.0	91.0
201606	2099	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	With regard to inflation expectations, instead of being elevated seven years into this business expansion, today we face a strong risk that expectations may persistently fall short of our 2 percent target.	23.0	91.0
201606	2100	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	There also is a sense in which today’s downside risks to inflation expectations are distinctly different than the upside risks in the 1970s.	23.0	91.0
201606	2101	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Back then, the risks probably came from the public’s doubt that we would do the right thing and bring inflation under control.	23.0	91.0
201606	2102	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	The public worried that we lacked the courage to stabilize inflation at a reasonable level.	23.0	91.0
201606	2103	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Today, with the lower bound still staring us in the face, the public may think we lack the ability to stabilize inflation at our target.	23.0	91.0
201606	2104	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	That kind of possibility really worries me.	23.0	91.0
201606	2105	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	So, for me, the language in alternative A has a lot going for it.	23.0	91.0
201606	2106	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	In order to have strong enough confidence that the United States will get to 2 percent inflation, it may be best to hold off raising interest rates until we are at 2 percent on a sustained basis.	23.0	91.0
201606	2107	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	First, the sluggish world economy argues that equilibrium rates are low and likely to rise only slowly.	23.0	91.0
201606	2108	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	With an unchanged federal funds rate target, sustained higher inflation would be one signal that the current low rate has become overly accommodative whenever r* is on the increase.	23.0	91.0
201606	2109	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	If r* increases markedly and inflation rises, policy rates should track these improvements to the degree appropriate.	23.0	91.0
201606	2110	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Second, such a commitment could be necessary to solidify currently low inflation expectations and allow expectations to increase and assert an upward pull on actual inflation.	23.0	91.0
201606	2111	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	As I noted yesterday, if this does not occur, I doubt the upward force from other factors will be adequate to bring inflation back to target over the forecast period.	23.0	91.0
201606	2112	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Third, with downside risks large, losing credibility on the downside would make it all that more difficult to reach our inflation target.	23.0	91.0
201606	2113	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	In view of how close we are to the lower bound, the most effective policy available to counter these risks is forward guidance that powerfully articulates our commitment to hitting our symmetric 2 percent inflation target sooner rather than later.	23.0	91.0
201606	2114	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Language in alt-A does that better.	23.0	91.0
201606	2115	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	As many have also said, on the other side of the ledger, the upside risks on inflation seem much smaller.	23.0	91.0
201606	2116	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Currently, financial market bets on core inflation rising above 2½ percent are minimal, and the odds on 3 or 4 percent are truly small.	23.0	91.0
201606	2117	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Would such upside risks increase substantially under alternative A?	23.0	91.0
201606	2118	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Golly, the purpose would be to move inflation expectations up, so I hope so.	23.0	91.0
201606	2119	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	That’s not currently likely, in view of the shallow path of market expectations today.	23.0	91.0
201606	2120	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	And when inflation does rise more sustainably to 2 percent, we know how to respond.	23.0	91.0
201606	2121	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Where does this leave us?	23.0	91.0
201606	2122	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Asymmetric risks, asymmetric policy tools, and risk management—to me, they all come down to being very patient in our normalization process.	23.0	91.0
201606	2123	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	My alt-B-consistent SEP submission has one 25 basis point increase in the funds rate this year, three next year, and four in 2018.	23.0	91.0
201606	2124	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Although I see the argument for altering my policy-rate assumption, notably along the lines of alternative A, I take this Committee’s previous communications very seriously.	23.0	91.0
201606	2125	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	At the moment, since today I think a funds rate range of 50 to 75 basis points at the end of 2016 may be okay, I wouldn’t dissent over alternative B–like slow and gradual increases, which are not too much steeper than mine, as long as the relevant outcomes are close enough to both mandate responsibilities.	23.0	91.0
201606	2126	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	But if more adverse developments occur than we have assumed in the Tealbook, then I think it would be time to bring something like alternative A onto the table for discussion.	23.0	91.0
201606	2127	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201606	2128	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	2129	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23.0	65.0
201606	2130	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201606	2131	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	I support alternative B as written.	23.0	104.0
201606	2132	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	As to President Harker’s proposed language, I’ll just say that I don’t think it’s unreasonable.	23.0	104.0
201606	2133	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	But to shift in the direction of taking positive signal from a decline in the unemployment rate that is driven entirely by a decline in participation is probably not the right thing.	23.0	104.0
201606	2134	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	I think I would see it as a healthier thing if participation had remained high rather than dropping significantly.	23.0	104.0
201606	2135	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	So I prefer the current language.	23.0	104.0
201606	2136	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	My baseline narrative is still for 2 percent growth and job creation continuing at a healthy pace.	23.0	104.0
201606	2137	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	But the recent weakening in job creation has materially increased uncertainty about the underlying state and momentum of the economy.	23.0	104.0
201606	2138	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	To see a case for moving at the July meeting, I would need some confirming evidence that the April and May employment reports, taken together, are anomalous.	23.0	104.0
201606	2139	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	It would be particularly helpful to see upward revisions for those months as well as a strong labor report for June.	23.0	104.0
201606	2140	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	In addition, polls suggest an increasing chance that the Brexit vote will be in favor of leaving the EU.	23.0	104.0
201606	2141	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	There could well be significant market reaction, and, although I don’t see this as anything like a systemic event, that outcome could be another factor calling for patience in July on the Committee’s part.	23.0	104.0
201606	2142	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	As of now, the market is currently pricing in about a 15 percent possibility of a move at the July meeting, and that feels about right to me.	23.0	104.0
201606	2143	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	To move ahead with a program of gradual tightening, I would want to be confident of continued labor market strength, with an increase in payroll jobs of at least 150,000 or 175,000.	23.0	104.0
201606	2144	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	In view of the uncertainty generated by the apparent break in the level of job creation, I’d be inclined to let the data clarify things for a while before raising the federal funds rate again.	23.0	104.0
201606	2145	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201606	2146	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	2147	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23.0	65.0
201606	2148	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201606	2149	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I’d like to first make my policy round statement and then add a few comments on the discussion we’re also having about our overall strategy.	23.0	108.0
201606	2150	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Our discussion yesterday made it clear that we need to take time to await both the Brexit decision on Thursday, June 23, and further evidence on the significance of the extremely low payroll data we received on June 3.	23.0	108.0
201606	2151	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	The FOMC meeting after this one is on July 26 and 27.	23.0	108.0
201606	2152	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	By then, we’ll have had over a month to absorb and, if necessary, to react to the results of the Brexit vote.	23.0	108.0
201606	2153	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	We’ll have had two and a half weeks to absorb the payrolls data that will be published on Friday, July 8, as well as the other economic and financial information, including data on June retail and motor vehicle sales and data on May capital goods and trade, that we will receive over the intermeeting period.	23.0	108.0
201606	2154	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Although the odds are that we will not have enough evidence by the time of the July meeting to justify a decision to change the interest rate, we should be careful in our communications not to rule out a July decision until we’ve had time to discuss and analyze the incoming data and to make a well-based decision as to whether to move in July or to await additional information on the economic outlook.	23.0	108.0
201606	2155	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	On that score, I’d emphasize that we’re close to our full employment objective, that the underlying pace of inflation is not far from 2 percent, and that our best guess at the value of the equilibrium real federal funds rate is near but above zero.	23.0	108.0
201606	2156	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Depending on the data, it could be appropriate to take another cautious policy step in July.	23.0	108.0
201606	2157	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Now, that’s the statement I prepared for this, and I think it is consistent with what most people have said.	23.0	108.0
201606	2158	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I’d like to take up for a few minutes the discussion that has been developing over the overall strategy, and let me start with the hall-of-mirrors phrase of President Williams, which, when I first heard about that problem, was described as the “monkey in the mirror” problem.	23.0	108.0
201606	2159	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	And you described it very well as an interaction between what the staff says and what we say.	23.0	108.0
201606	2160	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	The staff made, in my mind, one change that we really all noticed and which possibly nearly all took into account—namely, they lowered their r* estimate by ¼ percentage point.	23.0	108.0
201606	2161	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	The SEP median long-run federal funds rate number also went down by ¼ percentage point.	23.0	108.0
201606	2162	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I’m not sure whether we could find out what the influence of the staff’s reduction was on what people wrote down in the SEP, but I suspect there was some influence.	23.0	108.0
201606	2163	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	What I’d like to get to is the issue that we’re on:  What are we looking for?	23.0	108.0
201606	2164	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	There’s a tradition in the United States that you get going on a long path that moves in one direction for a very long time.	23.0	108.0
201606	2165	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	We don’t engage in interest rates that go up, then sometimes go down on the path, and then go up on the path, although we may be in a situation today where, if that was the way we were thinking, we’d be more willing to reduce the rate to deal with a little local disturbance and to see where it takes us than in the mindset we all have.	23.0	108.0
201606	2166	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Are we for raising the rate to 3 percent, or are we for reducing it to the effective lower bound?	23.0	108.0
201606	2167	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	That’s what we implicitly are thinking about when we’re discussing whether we want to raise the rate or whether we don’t.	23.0	108.0
201606	2168	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	And I have some sympathy for what I’ve heard from Governor Tarullo, from President Bullard, and from almost everyone who spoke of the view that this is a situation where, if we were willing to go up and down from time to time along the path we’re taking, we’d possibly do better.	23.0	108.0
201606	2169	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Now, that’s fine-tuning.	23.0	108.0
201606	2170	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Well, for those of us who grew up with radios before they had buttons, fine-tuning is actually something that’s desirable.	23.0	108.0
201606	2171	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	You really want to hit the station on the nose, not approximately.	23.0	108.0
201606	2172	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	So let’s leave the emotional baggage that comes with fine-tuning: “These guys are always trying to get the economy precisely where they want it—terrible guys,” which is the sort of story we’re being told about fine-tuning.	23.0	108.0
201606	2173	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	We know that we will get to the steady state with the feedback rules we’re using now.	23.0	108.0
201606	2174	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	We won’t be doing it by reference to a path that leads in three and a quarter years, or however many years it is, to the steady state that we’re looking for.	23.0	108.0
201606	2175	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	But the steady state of a model that has a monetary feedback rule of the sort we’re using will end up at the steady state that these steady paths take us to.	23.0	108.0
201606	2176	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	So I keep wondering whether we shouldn’t be a little more willing to go up and to go down.	23.0	108.0
201606	2177	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	There’s the same point, incidentally, just as a footnote to a footnote, that you should be willing to move when you’re near the lower bound.	23.0	108.0
201606	2178	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	If you’re willing to go back down after you’ve moved up, then it’s no big deal moving up if that’s what looks like reasonably the right thing to do at the moment.	23.0	108.0
201606	2179	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	If you’re not willing to go down, then you’re in a whole other world in which you’ve got to look all of the way through to the end of the horizon, and I don’t think we need to take that viewpoint.	23.0	108.0
201606	2180	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Now, that would be a reasonably radical change in the way the FOMC has always behaved.	23.0	108.0
201606	2181	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	So I’m talking about it not with the idea of asking anybody to accept that possibility tomorrow morning or at the next meeting, but to put it in people’s heads that we really need to think about whether what we’re doing each time we vote is deciding where we’re going over the next three years or deciding where we’re going over the next two months.	23.0	108.0
201606	2182	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think we need to decide where we’re going over the next three years.	23.0	108.0
201606	2183	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	We’d have to keep the markets informed of what we’re doing—that we’re not going off on these long treks to the steady state—and ask ourselves whether there’s anything wrong with that approach as opposed to the one we’re doing.	23.0	108.0
201606	2184	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	And this has now come back to the hall of mirrors.	23.0	108.0
201606	2185	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Our thinking—well, I have to speak only for myself.	23.0	108.0
201606	2186	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I’m not allowed to refer to what other people on the Committee think.	23.0	108.0
201606	2187	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Is that right, Madam Chair?	23.0	108.0
201606	2188	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	You can in here.	23.0	65.0
201606	2189	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	In here I can do it.	23.0	108.0
201606	2190	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Not outside.	23.0	65.0
201606	2191	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Our thinking is heavily influenced by the nature of the forecast that we get from the staff in the SEP process.	23.0	108.0
201606	2192	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Those forecasts are monotonic approaches to the steady state, and I’m not sure that it’s the best strategy to operate in that way.	23.0	108.0
201606	2193	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	What you’re doing with fine-tuning is a strategy that most of us know is called hill climbing.	23.0	108.0
201606	2194	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Hill climbing says that you change gears when you go up and you change gears when you go down, and what you do depends on what you encounter en route.	23.0	108.0
201606	2195	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Economies get buffeted around, and it doesn’t mean that when we see a—let’s suppose that Brexit was a bigger deal than it is now.	23.0	108.0
201606	2196	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	It would have been rational in facing a big thing like Brexit to say, “Okay, we’re going to take the rate down for a while because we may have to deal with this problem, but we don’t intend to keep it down forever.	23.0	108.0
201606	2197	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	That’s not a sign that we’re heading off in the direction of the effective lower bound.”	23.0	108.0
201606	2198	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	That’s footnote 1.	23.0	108.0
201606	2199	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Footnote 2 is, I had a discussion with Jeremy Rudd yesterday, in which I think I wasn’t accurate enough, and I just want to come back to it.	23.0	108.0
201606	2200	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	See, the trouble is, I took a shower between yesterday and today, and I tend to think in the shower but not elsewhere.	23.0	108.0
201606	2201	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	So here we are.	23.0	108.0
201606	2203	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	This is what I really wanted to say about fixed long-term expectations of inflation and what’s happening in the Michigan survey.	23.0	108.0
201606	2204	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I think that we put far too much emphasis on the fixity of long-run expectations, and that it is not stupid in a model with learning to have the expected inflation rate react to actual inflation.	23.0	108.0
201606	2205	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Now, you could call that adaptive expectations and get all upset because it’s not optimal, but there are models in which it is optimal.	23.0	108.0
201606	2206	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	My view is that people should, after several years, actually begin to pay attention to the environment and say, “My gosh, maybe we’re not actually going back to the target rate now, over the next three years, or over the next five years.”	23.0	108.0
201606	2207	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Furthermore, our world of inflation will not come to an end if the expected inflation rate starts moving.	23.0	108.0
201606	2208	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	We just have to deal with that, and we deal with it by probably making our policy a little more active and a little stronger in relation to what’s going on.	23.0	108.0
201606	2209	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	But it’s not the end of the world.	23.0	108.0
201606	2210	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Models work when people’s expectations change, and we’ve got ourselves into a situation that I think is implausible.	23.0	108.0
201606	2211	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	It requires the public to hold its expectation of the five-year inflation rate fixed.	23.0	108.0
201606	2212	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I think that the expectation may stay fixed only because somebody’s put a number out there and, when asked the question “What is it going to be 10 years from now?” they say, “Well, I don’t know, but those guys say they’re going to keep it at 2 percent, so, well, I’ll write down 2 percent.	23.0	108.0
201606	2213	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Am I certain that the Congress is not going to change the Federal Reserve law?	23.0	108.0
201606	2214	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I’d like to be,” et cetera.	23.0	108.0
201606	2215	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	So there are lots of reasons to think that the 2 percent we write down is not the only number that could be there if we asked people a whole series of other questions.	23.0	108.0
201606	2216	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	What I should have said yesterday was, we shouldn’t be so worried about a move in the expected inflation rate, because that’s how people ought to behave.	23.0	108.0
201606	2217	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	And it’s rational to base your expectations on what’s actually happening, particularly when it’s been going on for a very long time.	23.0	108.0
201606	2218	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Our models should possibly even include that, and we could deal with that.	23.0	108.0
201606	2219	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	It would have some implications for the optimal policies of the moment, and it might tie in with the first footnote I was talking about.	23.0	108.0
201606	2220	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	But I can see, Madam Chair, that I’ve used my spare time from my very short introductory statement to—	23.0	108.0
201606	2221	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Well, fortunately, we have lots of time.	23.0	65.0
201606	2222	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Very good comments.	23.0	65.0
201606	2223	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	23.0	108.0
201606	2224	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201606	2225	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	That gives us a lot to think about.	23.0	65.0
201606	2226	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23.0	65.0
201606	2227	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201606	2228	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	In light of my outlook and the risks, I believe a gradual upward path of interest rates over the forecast horizon remains appropriate.	23.0	999.0
201606	2229	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	In terms of the statement, I prefer alternative C.	23.0	999.0
201606	2230	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	I believe its characterization of economic developments over the intermeeting period is more reflective of my views.	23.0	999.0
201606	2231	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	In my view, alternative B has a more negative tone that places too much weight on the disappointing May employment report.	23.0	999.0
201606	2232	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Also, unlike alternative C, alternative B doesn’t acknowledge the increase in inflation we’ve been seeing over time.	23.0	999.0
201606	2233	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	I also prefer alternative C’s language in paragraph 3 about the anticipated path of the policy rate.	23.0	999.0
201606	2234	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The language does not lock the Committee in.	23.0	999.0
201606	2235	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	It still conveys the message that our policy actions are dependent on how the economy evolves, but it makes it clear that if the data remain consistent with the Committee’s expectations for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, then the Committee will likely make another increase in the federal funds rate target in coming months.	23.0	999.0
201606	2236	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	And this seems to be consistent with the SEP median path.	23.0	999.0
201606	2237	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	More generally, I’m becoming increasingly concerned that the FOMC statements are not providing enough information to help the public understand the Committee’s reaction function— that is, its systematic reaction to incoming information that changes the economic outlook.	23.0	999.0
201606	2238	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	As I’ve said at previous meetings, while the statement’s first paragraph delineates some of the changes in incoming information observed since the preceding meeting, it does little to suggest how that information has affected the outlook or how the Committee is translating that information into action or inaction.	23.0	999.0
201606	2239	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The danger of leaving the statement vague is that it gives the impression that the Committee is acting in a discretionary manner.	23.0	999.0
201606	2240	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Instead, I believe it’s crucial that we react to the data in a systematic and disciplined way, using our models and analytics to decipher incoming information and its implications for the outlook.	23.0	999.0
201606	2241	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	This systematic approach is critical to making the best policy decisions and to effectively communicating to the public our decisions and rationale for those decisions.	23.0	999.0
201606	2242	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The Committee continues to indicate that it views a gradual upward path of rates as appropriate and consistent with our outlook.	23.0	999.0
201606	2243	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The SEP suggests that most participants continue to view such a path as appropriate.	23.0	999.0
201606	2244	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The Committee has acknowledged there are uncertainties, but it has not suggested to the public that its outlook has materially changed.	23.0	999.0
201606	2245	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Yet we are very reluctant, in light of the uncertainties, to take another step on the gradual path.	23.0	999.0
201606	2246	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	How long can we keep the statement and policy in stasis without undermining our credibility?	23.0	999.0
201606	2247	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	If the Committee’s views have changed and the consensus view now is that policy is likely to be on hold for quite some time, then we need to communicate that to the public in a transparent way rather than relying on a vague statement like alternative B.	23.0	999.0
201606	2248	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	And if, as Governor Tarullo says, that delivers more dissent, so be it.	23.0	999.0
201606	2249	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Were it not for the upcoming Brexit vote, with its potential for increased volatility and disruption in financial markets, I would be advocating increasing the rate at this meeting, on the basis of the economic outlook.	23.0	999.0
201606	2250	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	I can go along with holding off at this meeting, but if the data continue to support the current outlook, I believe it will be appropriate to raise the funds rate very soon.	23.0	999.0
201606	2251	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201606	2252	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	2253	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23.0	65.0
201606	2254	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	81.0
201606	2255	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The discussion today occurs under the long shadow cast by the May employment report.	23.0	81.0
201606	2256	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	As I pointed out yesterday, how one interprets the apparent slowdown in employment growth has strong implications for policy and for how our statement should read.	23.0	81.0
201606	2257	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I argued yesterday that the evidence favored the view that job growth is being restrained increasingly by binding labor market constraints rather than an undesired slowdown in demand in the face of continued labor market slack.	23.0	81.0
201606	2258	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Accordingly, I think we should use the statement to communicate to the public that somewhat lower future employment growth is likely to be consistent with achieving our mandate for maximum sustainable employment and does not necessarily call for an easier policy rate path.	23.0	81.0
201606	2259	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	To the extent that lower employment growth reflects tighter resource constraints, then more rapid increases in the funds rate are going to be warranted.	23.0	81.0
201606	2260	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	With this in mind, I have some suggestions.	23.0	81.0
201606	2261	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	When our policy statement refers to improvement in labor market conditions, as it does in paragraphs 1 and 3 of alternative B, it implies that there is still a meaningful employment gap monetary policy can and should counteract.	23.0	81.0
201606	2262	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	But that seems at odds with the SEP, as the median unemployment rate in the SEP is below the median longer-run normal level.	23.0	81.0
201606	2263	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I think it would have been appropriate to back away from this type of language even without the low May employment growth number.	23.0	81.0
201606	2264	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	That number makes the issue more urgent, though, because it suggests that further improvement in labor market conditions may not be desirable or even attainable in the near term.	23.0	81.0
201606	2265	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Alternative C contains some constructive changes along these lines.	23.0	81.0
201606	2266	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Paragraph 2 drops the word “strengthen,” and it states that employment growth “will expand at moderate rates,” instead of “labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.”	23.0	81.0
201606	2267	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	And paragraph 3 of alternative C states that “the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further strengthening in labor market conditions,” instead of “further improvement in labor market conditions.”	23.0	81.0
201606	2268	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The word “strengthening” is better than “improvement,” in my mind, but I think both words imply the existence of a gap relative to some normative benchmark.	23.0	81.0
201606	2269	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	So, as an alternative to the second sentence in alt-B(3), I’d propose that we say “The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting a return to 2 percent inflation in the context of stable labor market conditions.”	23.0	81.0
201606	2270	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Or we could say “in the context of continued employment growth.”	23.0	81.0
201606	2271	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	This formulation would convey that we no longer view ourselves as closing positive labor resource utilization gaps.	23.0	81.0
201606	2272	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	In light of the fact that, for the SEP, all but one participant wrote down longer-run unemployment rates greater than or equal to the current unemployment rate, I think this is a change that almost all of us should support—if not at this meeting, then very soon.	23.0	81.0
201606	2273	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	More broadly, I think there’s a need to pay heed to our most recent intermeeting experience with communication.	23.0	81.0
201606	2274	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	My recollection of our April discussion was that our intention was for the April statement to signal that a June move was clearly on the table, and that it would be appropriate if the data flow was reasonably close to our expectations.	23.0	81.0
201606	2275	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Yet markets came out of that meeting placing very little probability on us moving in June, at least until the release of the April minutes, and my fear is that alternative B as written is likely to have as little effect on market expectations as the April statement and will still leave, again, a sizable gap between market views and the Committee’s expectations.	23.0	81.0
201606	2276	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	So I’d favor communicating more forcefully about our intention to raise rates, as in the language in paragraph 3 of alternative C, which says that “a modest increase in the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate in coming months.”	23.0	81.0
201606	2277	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Alternatively, President Harker’s suggestion is attractive to me.	23.0	81.0
201606	2278	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I recognize Governor Powell’s observation about the decline in the unemployment rate being attributable to a decline in the labor force participation rate.	23.0	81.0
201606	2279	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The other perspective on that confluence is that the upward move in labor force participation in recent months was anomalous itself and we’re back on trend with respect to labor force participation.	23.0	81.0
201606	2280	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	This unemployment rate of 4.7 percent is more consistent with that broad movement.	23.0	81.0
201606	2281	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I again want to follow up on something President Williams said, this time about the staff’s memo on the new policy rule.	23.0	81.0
201606	2282	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I take it that the economy affects policy via the reaction function, and that policy rules and reaction functions affect the economy.	23.0	81.0
201606	2283	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	And outcomes are the joint product of the interaction of the two.	23.0	81.0
201606	2284	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I can understand the staff realigning their assumption about the reaction function and aligning theirs with the Committee’s more closely.	23.0	81.0
201606	2285	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	That makes perfect sense.	23.0	81.0
201606	2286	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	But the staff didn’t alter their forecast.	23.0	81.0
201606	2287	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	They made an offsetting change in their implied assessment of the effect of monetary policy on the economy.	23.0	81.0
201606	2288	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I take as a supposition that they provide us with their own best independent assessment of the effects of alternative monetary policy strategies in the economy.	23.0	81.0
201606	2289	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I know the Committee members are smart, but we’re not that smart, and that’s why we need an outstanding professional staff like the one we have.	23.0	81.0
201606	2290	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	So I hope that they feel as if they can provide us with their own best judgment rather than adopting our implied assessment of the effects of policy on the economy.	23.0	81.0
201606	2291	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	23.0	81.0
201606	2292	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker, would you read again your proposed change in paragraph 3?	23.0	65.0
201606	2293	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	“The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative”—what?	23.0	65.0
201606	2294	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I’d be delighted, Madam Chair.	23.0	81.0
201606	2295	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	“The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting a return to 2 percent inflation in the context of stable labor market conditions.”	23.0	81.0
201606	2296	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	And I also offered a variant.	23.0	81.0
201606	2297	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	We could say “in the context of continued employment growth.”	23.0	81.0
201606	2298	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	Madam Chair, may I clarify one aspect of the handling of the change in the policy rule and its role in the forecast?	23.0	999.0
201606	2299	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, please.	23.0	65.0
201606	2300	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	There were two components.	23.0	999.0
201606	2301	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	One was an adjustment to the long-run r*, and for that one, indeed, we took the long-run r* down by 25 basis points and didn’t allow that to show through in the form of greater strength in aggregate demand, because it was our assessment that that reflected a change in our view about what level of interest rates would be consistent with attainment and maintenance of the dual mandate.	23.0	999.0
201606	2302	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	We did allow the other one, the adjustment to the intercept in the near term, to show through to the forecast.	23.0	999.0
201606	2303	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	Now, it does so in line with FRB/US simulations, and those simulations indicate that the effect on the near-term outlook for economic activity and inflation is very modest.	23.0	999.0
201606	2304	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	But it is there in principle, and I think that’s important to note.	23.0	999.0
201606	2305	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	In fact, we spent a great deal of time thinking as well about the hall of mirrors.	23.0	999.0
201606	2306	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	I think the fact that we have kept track of the influence of the change in the profile of the short rate and reflected that in the economic projection provides some reassurance, although I take the point very seriously that we need to be careful about engaging in sort of a hall of mirrors.	23.0	999.0
201606	2307	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	But if the policy that we use to construct the baseline would, in our judgment, drive economic activity away from attainment of the dual mandate, we’ll do our level best to show that.	23.0	999.0
201606	2308	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	The last point I’d like to make is that the policy rule—very deliberately, I think—has never been meant to have an element of optimality or staff recommendation.	23.0	999.0
201606	2309	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	In fact, we’ve shied away very much from that.	23.0	999.0
201606	2310	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	It’s our view that you’re not looking to us in Tealbook A to recommend an optimal monetary policy but to give you a sensible vehicle to use as a foil for your discussion.	23.0	999.0
201606	2311	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Thank you very much, David.	23.0	81.0
201606	2312	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	That was a really helpful clarification.	23.0	81.0
201606	2313	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I appreciate it.	23.0	81.0
201606	2314	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	23.0	65.0
201606	2315	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	111.0
201606	2316	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	I am comfortable with alternative B, and, like many members of the Committee, I want to see how the labor market evolves—how much of what we recently saw was noise and how much was signal.	23.0	111.0
201606	2317	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	As I mentioned yesterday, I’m also thinking a lot about what we’re seeing in the global economy.	23.0	111.0
201606	2318	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	As others have noted, inflation can be global or it can be local.	23.0	111.0
201606	2319	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	In the 1970s, we saw high global inflation.	23.0	111.0
201606	2320	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Today we’re seeing low global inflation, with many major economies at or below the zero lower bound.	23.0	111.0
201606	2321	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	I’m trying to understand what this global inflation and this global context mean for the risks that we face in our decisions, and I think about four different scenarios.	23.0	111.0
201606	2322	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	One scenario is that the whole world reverses and we see increasing inflation globally in the next few years.	23.0	111.0
201606	2323	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	This strikes me as quite unlikely, though not impossible.	23.0	111.0
201606	2324	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	I think it would be a positive development, and we all agree that central banks have the necessary tools to keep inflation in check.	23.0	111.0
201606	2325	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	A second scenario, which also seems quite unlikely to me, is that the United States experiences increasing inflation while the rest of the world is stuck effectively at zero.	23.0	111.0
201606	2326	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Again, I would argue that this would be a positive development, and we have the tools and the will necessary to keep inflation in check.	23.0	111.0
201606	2327	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	A third scenario would be that the rest of the world experiences high inflation and we’re stuck with low inflation.	23.0	111.0
201606	2328	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	I think this is extremely unlikely.	23.0	111.0
201606	2329	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	But then the final and most likely scenario, in my mind, is that the world continues to experience low inflation globally.	23.0	111.0
201606	2330	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	We all acknowledge that central banks have fewer tools to address this than to address high inflation.	23.0	111.0
201606	2331	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	For me, in light of these scenarios and the asymmetric risks associated with them, I don’t see a compelling reason to “normalize” rates for the sake of normalizing them in the absence of sustained increases in inflation, inflation expectations, or financial-stability risks.	23.0	111.0
201606	2332	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	To me, unless something changes, raising rates in this context wouldn’t be normalizing them.	23.0	111.0
201606	2333	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	It would be “abnormalizing” them.	23.0	111.0
201606	2334	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	111.0
201606	2335	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	2336	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23.0	65.0
201606	2337	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201606	2338	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	I support alternative B, and I’m comfortable with the statement as written.	23.0	88.0
201606	2339	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	While my outlook for the economy has not changed materially since the April meeting, the mixed and sometimes conflicting information received over the intermeeting period definitely leaves me questioning somewhat more the underlying strength of the economy.	23.0	88.0
201606	2340	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	So I think it’s sensible to wait for more information over the coming weeks in hopes of arriving at greater clarity about the true health of the economy.	23.0	88.0
201606	2341	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Given that leaning, the uncertainty regarding the Brexit matter makes it easy for me to support alternative B.	23.0	88.0
201606	2342	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	If the domestic economy was unambiguous and positive—that is, if we had a less concerning May employment report—it would be a harder call, in my opinion, and I would probably support action today, as President Mester suggested.	23.0	88.0
201606	2343	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Looking ahead to the July meeting, I think Governor Tarullo described the situation very well.	23.0	88.0
201606	2344	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	I could even call it something of a dilemma.	23.0	88.0
201606	2345	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	I come out at a little different place, but I very much appreciate the description of the communication issues that we’re facing.	23.0	88.0
201606	2346	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	My starting point is a bias—call that a soft lean—in favor of moving at the July meeting, while I would indicate with that little about any subsequent rate increases.	23.0	88.0
201606	2347	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	I’ll be looking at the second-quarter GDP picture, which will firm up—that is, the confidence interval around the ultimate reading will narrow—as the meeting approaches.	23.0	88.0
201606	2348	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	And I’ll be looking closely at the June employment report, of course.	23.0	88.0
201606	2349	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	A number for the jobs report of 150,000 net of the Verizon effect was mentioned yesterday, and Governor Powell mentioned it a few moments ago, along with some other criteria.	23.0	88.0
201606	2350	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	That strikes me as reasonable.	23.0	88.0
201606	2351	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	It’s above the number required to cover labor force growth.	23.0	88.0
201606	2352	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Since there will be, relatively speaking, a dearth of data before the July meeting, it appears that a lot is going to ride on the June employment report.	23.0	88.0
201606	2353	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	We collectively may have to work hard to position what an acceptable employment report will be.	23.0	88.0
201606	2354	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	How an acceptable employment report is framed in the context of other data, particularly the data that speak to growth momentum, may very well be the factor that swings our decision in July.	23.0	88.0
201606	2355	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	The approach I intend to apply is to look for evidence that invalidates my baseline assumptions about the path of the economy, as opposed to an approach that requires something like building the case for a move from a zero base.	23.0	88.0
201606	2356	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	This may be a somewhat lower bar than that applied by some of my colleagues around the table.	23.0	88.0
201606	2357	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	I’d like to express a broad concern.	23.0	88.0
201606	2358	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m concerned that we’re dealing with economic conditions that will likely be ambiguous, and there will always be data that give some pause.	23.0	88.0
201606	2359	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	So my posture in the next few weeks will be a soft lean in favor of a rate increase in July while watching for evidence that disproves my assumption that the economy is on a steady path.	23.0	88.0
201606	2360	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201606	2361	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	2362	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23.0	65.0
201606	2363	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201606	2364	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	I support alternative B with no changes.	23.0	107.0
201606	2365	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	The mixed data we have in hand to date could plausibly be consistent with very different scenarios for the outlook—one in which resource constraints are binding, one in which we’re seeing the beginning of a downshift in activity, and one in which we continue to make very slow progress.	23.0	107.0
201606	2366	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Each of these scenarios would call for a very different policy response.	23.0	107.0
201606	2367	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	I thus want to be sensitive to the consequences if the economy evolves in a way consistent with a different economic scenario than assumed, as well as the risks.	23.0	107.0
201606	2368	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In determining appropriate policy, we’re going to need to assess not just what scenario best describes the incoming data, but also what risks are associated with that particular path.	23.0	107.0
201606	2369	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	While there are upside risks to inflation in the scenario featuring binding resource constraints, I believe we’re relatively well positioned, relying solely on conventional policy, to deal with this eventuality.	23.0	107.0
201606	2370	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In contrast, I continue to see downside risks to both inflation and activity that would pose greater challenges to sole reliance on conventional policy, due to the asymmetry prevailing near the effective lower bound in the other two scenarios.	23.0	107.0
201606	2371	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Let me spend a moment on each of these.	23.0	107.0
201606	2372	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Suppose the outlook turns out to be best described as increasingly subject to binding resource constraints that imply that inflationary pressures in the period ahead are larger than we currently anticipate while labor market improvement slows notably.	23.0	107.0
201606	2373	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Arguably, we have ample room to adjust to such a contingency using conventional tools that are well calibrated, on the basis of ample historical experience.	23.0	107.0
201606	2374	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Especially in view of the depressed global environment, if markets came to expect a steeper policy rate path here than in other countries, this greater divergence in rates would be expected to have a strong effect on the dollar, which would reinforce our policy rate path.	23.0	107.0
201606	2375	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Indeed, the evidence the staff has presented suggests that, over the past year, dollar exchange rate movements have become considerably greater in response to those kinds of anticipated changes.	23.0	107.0
201606	2376	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, I would expect the policy shift needed to address greater-than-expected inflationary pressures to be relatively moderate.	23.0	107.0
201606	2377	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Even so, a possible danger is that the path of policy needed to respond would be so steep and the policy change so abrupt that it would tip the economy into recession.	23.0	107.0
201606	2378	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	But such a scenario would likely occur only if inflation expectations became unanchored or if the rise in inflation was quite rapid.	23.0	107.0
201606	2379	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	For a variety of reasons that people have spoken about around this table, that seems pretty unlikely.	23.0	107.0
201606	2380	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In contrast, if we think that additional data are likely to validate a downshift in activity or even continued slow progress, when the economy is hit by an adverse shock, such as financial turbulence in response to an unexpected Brexit vote outcome or a reemergence of financial stress associated with China’s exchange rate or financial imbalances, in responding to such events we might need to rely on unconventional policies, which are less tested and themselves likely to be subject to constraints.	23.0	107.0
201606	2381	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, fiscal policy is likely to be constrained.	23.0	107.0
201606	2382	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, the risk the economy faces from negative demand shocks is greater than that faced from positive shocks in the presence of steeply sloped supply curves.	23.0	107.0
201606	2383	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	My sense of the danger of downside risks is informed by the other side of the cautionary- tale spectrum that President Evans was referring to—in particular, the experience of two other major advanced economies, Japan and the euro area.	23.0	107.0
201606	2384	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Most observers would likely conclude in hindsight that monetary policy should have been more forceful earlier on in counteracting weak demand.	23.0	107.0
201606	2385	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	For a variety of reasons, it didn’t happen.	23.0	107.0
201606	2386	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	It could be that some policymakers thought that if the forces holding down demand and inflation were stronger and more persistent than expected, more accommodative policy could be pursued farther down the road.	23.0	107.0
201606	2387	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	But perhaps few anticipated how difficult it would be to move inflation back to target in such a contingency.	23.0	107.0
201606	2388	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Recently, policymakers in both economic areas have been both determined and creative in their efforts.	23.0	107.0
201606	2389	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Yet many observers, including Board staff, expect inflation in the euro area to fall short of its target throughout the medium term, and that inflation in Japan will not even come close to its target.	23.0	107.0
201606	2390	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Such persistent underperformance not only damages the credibility of inflation targets, but also leaves these economies very vulnerable to adverse demand shocks.	23.0	107.0
201606	2391	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	On balance, prudent risk management would argue for waiting until the totality of the data provides greater confidence in a rebound in domestic activity and there’s greater certainty regarding the Brexit vote, especially because of the amplified feedback loop operating through exchange rate and financial market channels.	23.0	107.0
201606	2392	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, the appropriate path to return monetary policy to a neutral stance looks like it could be even more shallow and gradual in the medium term than we may previously have anticipated, because it increasingly appears likely that the medium-term neutral rate may be quite low.	23.0	107.0
201606	2393	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Earlier in the recovery, it seemed likely that the low level of the neutral rate was largely due to temporary factors that we described as cyclical headwinds, such as tight credit, weak consumer confidence, and the loss in household wealth following the crisis.	23.0	107.0
201606	2394	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	However, with the recovery well into its seventh full year, credit in many markets is widely available, and consumer confidence and household net worth are at high levels.	23.0	107.0
201606	2395	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, it appears more likely that much of the decline in the neutral rate is likely to prove quite persistent, consistent with a variety of estimates.	23.0	107.0
201606	2396	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	With productivity running very low, substantial overcapacity and disinflationary pressures abroad, and less favorable demographics, the medium-term neutral rate may be lower and today’s federal funds rate closer to neutral than we previously anticipated.	23.0	107.0
201606	2397	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201606	2398	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	2399	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23.0	65.0
201606	2400	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201606	2401	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B.	23.0	96.0
201606	2402	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t see a good case for tightening monetary policy at this meeting.	23.0	96.0
201606	2403	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think the outlook supports it, in view of the uncertainties raised by the employment report.	23.0	96.0
201606	2404	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Even if the data there were a bit better, risk-management considerations would argue for deferring such a decision until after the Brexit vote next week.	23.0	96.0
201606	2405	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Looking forward, I don’t yet see a compelling narrative pushing for a July rate hike.	23.0	96.0
201606	2406	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, if the forthcoming data were very strong, then I might be willing to move in July.	23.0	96.0
201606	2407	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But it seems to me it will likely take longer to resolve some of the uncertainties about the outlook raised by the recent data.	23.0	96.0
201606	2408	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So what I’m thinking about the next rate hike, if there is going to be a next rate hike, is that September seems more likely, in my mind.	23.0	96.0
201606	2409	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	The statement, along with the SEP, will probably be read that way.	23.0	96.0
201606	2410	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	The probability of July probably will drop a little bit further with the statement and the SEP because the SEP revisions, I think, are going to be bigger downward revisions than what market participants are expecting.	23.0	96.0
201606	2411	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	More broadly, I worry that we may have become a bit biased in terms of how we think about monetary policy right now.	23.0	96.0
201606	2412	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	The goal seems to be to normalize the federal funds rate, and that seems to be the default view.	23.0	96.0
201606	2413	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	By “normalizing,” it means pushing up the federal funds rate methodically in coming quarters to some long-run value that is well above where we are right now.	23.0	96.0
201606	2414	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t accept the notion that we should necessarily be committed to a project to push up the federal funds rate.	23.0	96.0
201606	2415	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we should only do it if it’s consistent with our dual-mandate objectives.	23.0	96.0
201606	2416	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s possible that the current federal funds rate setting is very close to the equilibrium real short-term interest rate, and it’s also possible that the headwinds keeping the equilibrium short- term rate low will not dissipate further.	23.0	96.0
201606	2417	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	We could find that the appropriate monetary policy would be to keep the federal funds rate at the current level for many quarters.	23.0	96.0
201606	2418	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, that’s a depressing thought, perhaps, but maybe the normalization project has been largely completed, at least until Europe and Japan get closer to ending their extraordinary sets of policy.	23.0	96.0
201606	2419	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I think our monetary policy is increasingly going to depend on what happens elsewhere in the world.	23.0	96.0
201606	2420	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	This is reinforcing things that Governor Brainard just said.	23.0	96.0
201606	2421	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think our focus on Taylor rule formulations push us maybe in the wrong direction.	23.0	96.0
201606	2422	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	They reinforce the notion that policy is very accommodative, and that interest rates need to move up in the near future.	23.0	96.0
201606	2423	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, maybe that guidance is right.	23.0	96.0
201606	2424	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But, as I’ve said for many meetings, I think it’s hard to square the Taylor-rule formulations with the data that we’re actually seeing.	23.0	96.0
201606	2425	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	And I worry that using the Taylor rule as our guide to policy introduces a bias in terms of our monetary policy deliberations that could lead to policy error.	23.0	96.0
201606	2426	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I was pleased to see the staff do the realignment to the Taylor rule in the recent Tealbook.	23.0	96.0
201606	2427	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So that brings the staff forecast, I think, more in line with the Committee.	23.0	96.0
201606	2428	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I would argue, though, that the staff isn’t quite there yet, and I’ll just give you an example of this.	23.0	96.0
201606	2429	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	In the Tealbook, there’s a scenario called “Disorderly Brexit,” and in the “Disorderly Brexit” scenario, the economy slows, the unemployment rate rises, and inflation falls.	23.0	96.0
201606	2430	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Yet, because of the inertial Taylor rule, policy continues to tighten.	23.0	96.0
201606	2431	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I would find it bizarre if that scenario unfolded and the Committee was actually tightening during that period.	23.0	96.0
201606	2432	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So there’s still a little bit of a gap, I think, between how the Committee would actually act and what an inertial Taylor rule describes, and we just need to be aware of those differences.	23.0	96.0
201606	2433	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the language that President Harker suggested, I thought his sentence, in my mind, understated the degree of weakness that we actually see in the labor market.	23.0	96.0
201606	2434	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	As I mentioned yesterday, the diffusion indexes are a good example.	23.0	96.0
201606	2435	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	The one- and three-month diffusion indexes for private industry are at the weakest level since early 2010.	23.0	96.0
201606	2436	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	And I also feel like the drop in the unemployment rate—I don’t take that much signal from it, because it was, as Governor Powell mentioned, due to a big drop in the participation rate.	23.0	96.0
201606	2437	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So I feel like it provides a little bit too much confidence in the labor market report weakness being temporary than I would be comfortable with.	23.0	96.0
201606	2438	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201606	2439	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Well, thank you for very thoughtful comments on policy.	23.0	65.0
201606	2440	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Before I turn to the statement and go over the suggestions that have been made, I’d just like to comment briefly on an issue that many of you have raised.	23.0	65.0
201606	2441	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	That’s whether our communications are helpful or even accurate in emphasizing that the federal funds rate is likely to rise gradually over the next two or three years and by an appreciable amount, on the basis of the SEP numbers and our other public communications.	23.0	65.0
201606	2442	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	As many of you have noted, our pace of tightening this year is turning out, for a variety of reasons, to be notably slower than we anticipated back in December.	23.0	65.0
201606	2443	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Most likely, the public doesn’t fully appreciate the conditional and highly uncertain nature of the dot plot, and I think that’s a problem because—and President Bullard has emphasized this—we have only the vaguest notion about how much tightening will eventually be needed to stabilize the economy at full employment and 2 percent inflation.	23.0	65.0
201606	2444	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	To my mind, in light of all of these considerations, there is a question of whether we should think about de-emphasizing expected movements in the federal funds rate over the medium term in our communications.	23.0	65.0
201606	2445	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you have suggested this, and let me say I really think that this is an issue that deserves serious thought in the near future.	23.0	65.0
201606	2446	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	It’s an issue that we will be giving thought to here at the Board, and I would urge others to do likewise.	23.0	65.0
201606	2447	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	If we wanted to revise our communications, how would we go about doing that?	23.0	65.0
201606	2448	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	With those comments, let me turn to the statement and briefly consider the two concrete suggestions that have been made.	24.0	65.0
201606	2449	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I did hear a number of people weigh in with support for alt-B as written, but let’s just spend a moment on the two suggestions.	24.0	65.0
201606	2450	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	In paragraph 1, President Harker suggested a change in the statement about the labor market to “Job gains have diminished, but the unemployment rate has declined and other labor market indicators appear healthy.”	24.0	65.0
201606	2451	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I have heard a number of suggestions.	24.0	65.0
201606	2452	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I myself am concerned about saying that a wide range of other labor market indicators appear healthy, because there are a number that show deterioration.	24.0	65.0
201606	2453	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Our labor market conditions index is actually declining because it is gearing off quite a number of things that are declining, including a Conference Board alternative measure of job openings, a help-wanted index that has really tailed off.	24.0	65.0
201606	2454	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	But let me just see.	24.0	65.0
201606	2455	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Does anybody want to support President Harker’s suggestion, or are you strongly in favor of it?	24.0	65.0
201606	2456	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	24.0	65.0
201606	2457	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	24.0	65.0
201606	2458	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s go on now.	24.0	65.0
201606	2459	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	The second suggestion, from President Lacker, concerns paragraph 3—that instead of constantly talking about further improvement in the labor market, now that we think we’re in the vicinity of the longer-run normal unemployment rate, we change that language.	24.0	65.0
201606	2460	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	And let me see if there is anybody who would like to pursue that.	24.0	65.0
201606	2461	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	We could go over the—	24.0	65.0
201606	2462	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Could I make one point?	24.0	96.0
201606	2463	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I can see doing that at some point.	24.0	96.0
201606	2464	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it would just be a very odd time to do it after a very weak labor market report.	24.0	96.0
201606	2465	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	It would be hard to square that with the labor market report we just saw.	24.0	96.0
201606	2466	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I certainly agree that, at some point, you can imagine that the Committee views that we’re basically where we want to be in terms of the labor market, and then a change like that would be appropriate.	24.0	96.0
201606	2467	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But I think it would be hard to square that with what we just saw.	24.0	96.0
201606	2468	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Can I comment?	24.0	81.0
201606	2469	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The question I have for you is, how does employment gain fit into that?	24.0	81.0
201606	2470	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Can you imagine us getting to that point with lower employment gains if it looks like we’re in sort of a resource-constrained situation?	24.0	81.0
201606	2471	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	That’s kind of the question.	24.0	81.0
201606	2472	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Are we going to hold out employment gains as something we need—150,000 or 200,000 a month?	24.0	81.0
201606	2473	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	No.	24.0	96.0
201606	2474	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	At some point, you would presumably get to full employment—or somewhat below full employment if you actually wanted to push inflation expectations up.	24.0	96.0
201606	2475	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	At that point, you wouldn’t want to see further improvement in labor market conditions.	24.0	96.0
201606	2476	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I think people accept that.	24.0	96.0
201606	2477	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess I think that after a very weak employment report, people would scratch their heads and say, “Well, wait a second.	24.0	96.0
201606	2478	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So you’re really saying that you were at full employment a meeting ago?”	24.0	96.0
201606	2479	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I think they would have trouble interpreting it.	24.0	96.0
201606	2480	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I understand the timing, in view of the widespread interpretation of the employment report.	24.0	81.0
201606	2481	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	But imagine we’re 6 or 12 months down the road or a couple of meetings down the road, and we’ve gotten 100,000 a month for 6 months.	24.0	81.0
201606	2482	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I could see making the change at that time.	24.0	96.0
201606	2483	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	24.0	81.0
201606	2484	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	At some point, we’re going to have to tilt how people perceive low employment growth.	24.0	81.0
201606	2485	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	That’s the point.	24.0	81.0
201606	2486	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I accept the concept.	24.0	96.0
201606	2487	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the Committee will have to come together and decide, are we actually at the place at which we think we could achieve—	24.0	96.0
201606	2488	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	No, I understand.	24.0	81.0
201606	2489	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	On the point about time, I’m totally good.	24.0	81.0
201606	2490	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	I guess this is more of a question.	24.0	110.0
201606	2491	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	I agree with not changing the statement.	24.0	110.0
201606	2492	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m just wondering:  In your press conference today, will you point out that, at this stage, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to see a lower expected breakeven rate of job growth to keep the unemployment rate constant?	24.0	110.0
201606	2493	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Will you comment on that?	24.0	110.0
201606	2494	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Just to restate, it seems to me the public is expecting job growth that is well above, I think, our own forecast and what we’re expecting for a breakeven.	24.0	110.0
201606	2495	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	I wonder if, at some point—if not today, then maybe in one of the future press conferences—maybe that’s the appropriate place to point out that the breakeven level has declined.	24.0	110.0
201606	2496	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	I don’t know if you’re going to comment on that at all.	24.0	110.0
201606	2497	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I think there’s nothing in my statement about it, but if it comes up in Q&A, I will try to make that point.	24.0	65.0
201606	2498	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	24.0	65.0
201606	2499	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	My suggestion, then, is that we vote on alternative B as distributed.	24.0	65.0
201606	2500	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Brian, maybe you can review.	24.0	65.0
201606	2501	2016-06-15	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	24.0	999.0
201606	2502	2016-06-15	meeting	MADIGAN	As you said, this vote will be on the policy statement for alternative B shown on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas’s briefing package and also on the directive to the Desk as included in the implementation note shown on page 10 of that package.	24.0	999.0
201606	2503	2016-06-15	meeting	MADIGAN	Chair Yellen   Yes Vice Chairman Dudley  Yes Governor Brainard   Yes President Bullard   Yes Governor Fischer   Yes President George   Yes President Mester   Yes Governor Powell   Yes President Rosengren  Yes Governor Tarullo   Yes Thank you.	24.0	999.0
201606	2504	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	53.0	65.0
201606	2505	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Well, thanks to everybody.	53.0	65.0
201606	2506	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s see.	53.0	65.0
201606	2507	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I have a couple of things.	53.0	65.0
201606	2508	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	The date of the Committee’s next meeting is Tuesday and Wednesday, July 26 and 27.	53.0	65.0
201606	2509	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I believe that, at this point—just about now or at 10:30—box lunches will be available in the anteroom, and you’re welcome to take them.	53.0	65.0
201606	2510	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	And if anybody is going to stay around and wants to watch me get beaten up at the press conference [laughter], there will be a TV set up in the Special Library.	53.0	65.0
201606	2511	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I think that’s it for today.	53.0	65.0
201606	2512	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks, everybody.	53.0	65.0
201607	0	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	50.0	65.0
201607	1	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We are all a couple of minutes early, but it looks like we’re ready to get going.	50.0	65.0
201607	2	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Today’s meeting, as usual, will be a joint meeting between the FOMC and the Board of Governors.	50.0	65.0
201607	3	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	So I need a motion to close the Board meeting.	50.0	65.0
201607	4	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	50.0	108.0
201607	5	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	50.0	65.0
201607	6	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	50.0	65.0
201607	7	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We’re going to begin with our first topic, “Long- Run Framework for Monetary Policy Implementation,” and let me ask Simon to start us off on this.	93.0	65.0
201607	8	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	999.0
201607	9	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	We will be referring to the materials titled “Long-Run Framework for Monetary Policy Implementation.”	93.0	999.0
201607	10	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	The briefing today summarizes the work of three foundational workgroups on the foreign experience, lessons from the crisis, and money markets that was distributed to the Committee over the past few weeks.	93.0	999.0
201607	11	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	As you know, this is a System-wide effort with important contributions from a number of divisions of the Board and all of the Reserve Banks.	93.0	999.0
201607	12	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Today, in addition to the presenters at the table—Brian Doyle, David Altig, and Beth Klee—we have Patricia Zobel, Ed Nosal, and Susan McLaughlin seated behind us, who were the co-leads for these presenters.	93.0	999.0
201607	13	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	They’ll also be available to answer questions.	93.0	999.0
201607	14	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	In slide 3 of your rather thick presentation package, you can see the key goals of the project that were agreed to almost one year ago.	93.0	999.0
201607	15	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	These goals have obviously been influenced by the experience of advanced-economy central banks over the past 10 years or so.	93.0	999.0
201607	16	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	The foundational workgroups were designed to put this experience into a structure that will feed into the two framework workgroups, which are focused on interest rate targets, operating regimes, and the balance sheet.	93.0	999.0
201607	17	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Our current plan is for the framework workgroups to present their findings at the November meeting.	93.0	999.0
201607	18	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	The feedback that you will provide today and in November will inform the staff’s work on evaluating comprehensive frameworks that will be presented to the Committee further down the road.	93.0	999.0
201607	19	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	The next slide shows an additional set of objectives for alternative operating frameworks.	93.0	999.0
201607	20	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Objective 2 on promoting efficient, effective, and resilient money 1 The materials used by Messrs.	93.0	999.0
201607	21	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Potter, Doyle, and Altig and Mses.	93.0	999.0
201607	22	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Klee and Remache are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). markets will be an important focus of the presentation today.	93.0	999.0
201607	23	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	As also noted on this slide, the Committee’s normalization principles and plans provide an additional set of criteria when it comes to the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio.	93.0	999.0
201607	24	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Brian will now present on the foreign experience.	93.0	999.0
201607	25	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Thank you, Simon.	93.0	999.0
201607	26	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	To start our presentations, I’m going to talk about monetary policy implementation elsewhere in the world.	93.0	999.0
201607	27	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	The foreign experience workgroup, co-led by Patricia Zobel of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, primarily surveyed the experience of nine advanced-economy central banks.	93.0	999.0
201607	28	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	As noted on slide 6, this survey included how central banks implemented policy before the crisis, how the frameworks evolved since then, and some of the rationale for those frameworks.	93.0	999.0
201607	29	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	In my limited time, I will just touch on some of the highlights from the memorandum that was circulated earlier.	93.0	999.0
201607	30	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	As shown in your next slide, there is one finding that is perhaps useful to state right off the bat.	93.0	999.0
201607	31	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	We don’t see dramatic differences in most central banks’ ability to control short-term money market rates or to transmit effects of monetary policy out to longer-term interest rates.	93.0	999.0
201607	32	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	However, the wide variety of frameworks represents choices that central banks have made regarding how to achieve that control.	93.0	999.0
201607	33	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	And a better understanding of these choices may be helpful, as they reflect decisions that these central banks made regarding tradeoffs along other dimensions.	93.0	999.0
201607	34	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	What are the primary differences in these frameworks?	93.0	999.0
201607	35	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	First, as noted in the first row of the table in slide 8, before the crisis, nearly all advanced-economy central banks communicated monetary policy with an overnight interest rate.	93.0	999.0
201607	36	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	But what that rate was varied some.	93.0	999.0
201607	37	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	A few central banks, like the Federal Reserve, used a target for a market rate.	93.0	999.0
201607	38	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Many others used an administered rate—that is, a rate pertaining to some operation that they themselves set.	93.0	999.0
201607	39	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Even in these latter cases, central banks often made reference to a market rate.	93.0	999.0
201607	40	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	The market rates were usually unsecured rates.	93.0	999.0
201607	41	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Inn a couple of cases, however, they were secured rates.	93.0	999.0
201607	42	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	As shown in your next slide, how central banks controlled money market rates also varied.	93.0	999.0
201607	43	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Before the crisis, most used “corridor” regimes, supplying reserves to meet banks’ demand at the policy rate and generally using lending and deposit facilities to create a ceiling and a floor.	93.0	999.0
201607	44	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Within this group, most central banks had some form of reserve requirements to foster a stable demand for reserves.	93.0	999.0
201607	45	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	A few central banks used “floor” regimes, providing sufficient liquidity for market rates to trade near the rate of interest that the central bank pays on deposits or reserves.	93.0	999.0
201607	46	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	After the crisis began, how central banks implemented policy shifted.	93.0	999.0
201607	47	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Unconventional policies, including large-scale asset programs not only of government, but in some cases private-sector assets; long-term funding programs, such as those of the ECB; and, most recently, negative interest rates, in some cases became the primary means of implementing and communicating policy.	93.0	999.0
201607	48	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	And, as indicated by the arrows in the chart, as central banks injected more liquidity under some of these programs, corridor systems in many instances became de facto floor systems.	93.0	999.0
201607	49	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	As shown on the next slide, the distinctions between corridor and floor regimes have become blurred a little in recent years, as central banks changed how they remunerate reserves and gave banks a wider degree of choice over how many reserves to hold.	93.0	999.0
201607	50	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	To encourage interbank trading and reduce banks’ hoarding of reserves, central banks using floors began to pay a lower rate on reserves above some threshold or quota—“tiered remuneration.”	93.0	999.0
201607	51	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	This “tiering” is also similar to what has been seen more recently with negative policy rates at the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of Japan, albeit for a very different reason—that is, to limit the costs for banks of holding reserves.	93.0	999.0
201607	52	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	And, before the crisis, the Bank of England implemented a corridor regime in which banks could choose their own target for reserves—a “voluntary reserves target”—reducing some of the costs associated with reserve requirements.	93.0	999.0
201607	53	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	These regimes influence the nature of activity in money markets, as highlighted on the next slide.	93.0	999.0
201607	54	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Systems characterized by scarce excess reserves generally feature robust interbank trading.	93.0	999.0
201607	55	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	In floor systems that featured quotas, in conditions of still- abundant reserves, money market trading is largely between banks that are above their quotas and banks that are below.	93.0	999.0
201607	56	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Likewise, currently in Japan and the United Kingdom, money market trading is largely between nonbank participants without access to remunerated accounts and banks with access.	93.0	999.0
201607	57	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	In these economies, as shown in the figure, money market rates trade below the rate on reserves, as is the case in the United States (the red line).	93.0	999.0
201607	58	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Some central banks view arbitrage activity created by remuneration systems as meaningful and robust, while others view activity created by reserve scarcity as providing more insight into money market conditions.	93.0	999.0
201607	59	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Turning the page, another observation from the foreign experience is that central banks have added counterparties and accepted a wider range of collateral during the crisis (or already had broad sets of both) and expect to keep those broader sets.	93.0	999.0
201607	60	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	For some central banks, this broadening of counterparties has included nonbank entities, including financial market utilities.	93.0	999.0
201607	61	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	The main reason for the expansion during the crisis was a desire to provide liquidity to parts of the financial system that were “cut off.”	93.0	999.0
201607	62	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	But some foreign central banks also see advantages in reducing competitive distortions created by conferring counterparty status on a narrow group and in the enhanced information that they receive about interacting with a number of institutions.	93.0	999.0
201607	63	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	That said, central banks acknowledge that broader policy comes with costs—increased operational costs, the potential to reduce private market activity— and that accepting a wider set of collateral could create some moral hazard if it encourages banks to hold riskier assets.	93.0	999.0
201607	64	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	The next slide, slide 13, notes that a few central banks see liquidity insurance— the readiness to provide broad-based liquidity in the case of a shock—as distinct from either monetary policy implementation or emergency lending and have different operations to meet those separate objectives.	93.0	999.0
201607	65	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	The Bank of England views liquidity insurance as operations with clear criteria for use and broad access, and its scheme allows financial institutions to obtain reserves or liquid assets for less liquid assets.	93.0	999.0
201607	66	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	They view the clarity about the purpose of these operations as, it is hoped, reducing stigma and clarity about when these facilities would be used as limiting contagion during stress events.	93.0	999.0
201607	67	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	That said, although some central banks provide greater clarity about their plans to employ such operations in stress events, others prefer some ambiguity about the circumstances of when they would use such operations.	93.0	999.0
201607	68	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Turning to your next slide, foreign central banks are still considering other features of their long-run frameworks.	93.0	999.0
201607	69	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	For example, most central banks think that they should be ready to use unconventional policies if needed and expect to maintain some operational preparedness.	93.0	999.0
201607	70	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	And central banks have diverse views about the appropriate size and composition of their balance sheets in the long run.	93.0	999.0
201607	71	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Many central banks that have expanded their balance sheets with asset purchases in recent years hope to return to some form of smaller balance sheet in the future.	93.0	999.0
201607	72	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	But they also acknowledge that higher demand for reserves by banks may leave their balance sheets larger than before the crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	73	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Some have also noted that exceptionally large balance sheets can complicate relationships with fiscal authorities.	93.0	999.0
201607	74	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	As highlighted in the final slide for this portion of the presentation, most central banks are still learning about how they should adapt policy implementation to the effects of new regulations.	93.0	999.0
201607	75	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	But one effect that most central banks do expect is that demand for reserves will increase.	93.0	999.0
201607	76	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Excess reserves qualify as high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) under the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), and getting excess reserves for less liquid collateral (where possible) boosts the LCR.	93.0	999.0
201607	77	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Central banks are split on how they should complement this effect.	93.0	999.0
201607	78	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	The Reserve Bank of Australia introduced a facility to help banks meet this demand in some instances, in part because Australia has a low stock of government debt.	93.0	999.0
201607	79	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Other central banks will only take HQLA as collateral or are considering making changes to the costs of reserves to discourage banks from relying on the central bank to meet the LCR.	93.0	999.0
201607	80	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	I’ll now turn to Dave Altig, who will turn the focus back “stateside” and share some lessons from the crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	81	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Thanks, Brian.	93.0	999.0
201607	82	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The task of the lessons from the financial crisis workgroup was to evaluate the performance of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy implementation framework during the period of the financial crisis, which we defined as running from August 2007 to May 2009.	93.0	999.0
201607	83	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Slide 17 provides several metrics pertaining to stress in various funding markets during this time frame.	93.0	999.0
201607	84	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	There is disagreement among scholars as to the relative roles of illiquidity, counterparty concerns, and asset-risk repricing as drivers of these spreads, and in the memo, we review the research literature devoted to disentangling these effects.	93.0	999.0
201607	85	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Our reading of the literature suggests that all three elements were at play during the crisis, but we emphasize that our analysis was not aimed at evaluating the necessity or the efficacy of specific tools.	93.0	999.0
201607	86	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Our objective was to assess the efficacy of the pre-crisis framework in supporting the implementation of these tools once a policy course was chosen.	93.0	999.0
201607	87	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	As described by slide 18, the pre-crisis framework can be summarized as follows: One, rate control was based on reserve scarcity.	93.0	999.0
201607	88	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The level of excess reserves was minimal, and the banking system operated on the downward-sloping part of its net demand curve.	93.0	999.0
201607	89	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The Desk supplied reserves to meet demand through daily open market operations in order to manage the effective federal funds rate to the FOMC’s target.	93.0	999.0
201607	90	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Two, liquidity was provided through two tools.	93.0	999.0
201607	91	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Daily monetary policy operations provided liquidity to the banking system via repurchase agreements with primary dealers against government securities, and Reserve Banks made discount window, or primary credit, loans to individual depository institutions collateralized by a broad set of assets.	93.0	999.0
201607	92	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	And, three, the portfolio was not a policy tool.	93.0	999.0
201607	93	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The portfolio was simply a byproduct of the various activities the Federal Reserve undertook as part of its implementation framework.	93.0	999.0
201607	94	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	SOMA holdings were sized nearly equal to, and over time grew at the same rate as, the quantity of currency in circulation.	93.0	999.0
201607	95	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The portfolio’s size was maintained by reinvesting the proceeds of maturing securities; portfolio growth occurred through outright purchases of Treasury securities.	93.0	999.0
201607	96	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	It’s worth noting that before the crisis, stress events had been moderate in both the duration and scale of their effect on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and had been managed adequately through the pre-crisis framework’s combination of traditional open market operations and discount window lending.	93.0	999.0
201607	97	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The 2007–09 crisis represented an unprecedented stress test of the pre-crisis framework.	93.0	999.0
201607	98	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The nature of the pain points that were revealed and experience with new tools introduced to address these shortcomings form the foundation of our analysis.	93.0	999.0
201607	99	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	I’ll highlight five key takeaways from our review of the crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	100	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	These lessons, many of which will be quite familiar, were informed by research studies, transcripts of FOMC meetings, archival MarketSource commentary, and the recollections of Federal Reserve staff actively involved in policy implementation during that time.	93.0	999.0
201607	101	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Our list of lessons begins on slide 19 with the observation that, in the absence of IOER and adequate reserve draining tools, the pre-crisis “reserve scarcity” framework set up a tradeoff between interest-rate control and large-scale liquidity provision, a tension that persisted until that framework was effectively abandoned post-Lehman.	93.0	999.0
201607	102	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	As the chart on this slide illustrates, most of the liquidity provision programs implemented over the course of the crisis represented additions to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.	93.0	999.0
201607	103	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	In the absence of the ability to pay interest on reserves, maintaining rate control required the Open Market Desk to keep the level of reserves in a relatively narrow band.	93.0	999.0
201607	104	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	This meant that additions to reserves or liquidity arising from various liquidity programs required offsetting reductions in reserves, or “sterilization.”	93.0	999.0
201607	105	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Reserve draining prior to the crisis relied primarily on redemptions of maturing securities.	93.0	999.0
201607	106	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	This strategy for draining reserves became increasingly inadequate following the collapse of Bear Stearns, as redemption capacity hit its limit and liquidity programs expanded.	93.0	999.0
201607	107	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Our second conclusion, noted on the next slide, is that the two pre-crisis liquidity tools, open market operations and the discount window, were themselves not adequate to provide the type of large-scale liquidity insurance that was needed during the crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	108	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Open market operations and discount window lending were confined to limited sets of counterparties and, particularly in the case of open market operations, collateral types.	93.0	999.0
201607	109	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Other tools had to be created to overcome their limitations—for example, highlighted in green text on this slide, the Term Auction Facility (or TAF) was introduced to circumvent the stigma problem associated with the discount window.	93.0	999.0
201607	110	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	FX swap lines with foreign central banks were activated to address broader global demand for dollar funding in order to contain spillover to domestic markets.	93.0	999.0
201607	111	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The schematic on slide 20 emphasizes that the broadly based 13(3) facilities implemented in 2008, highlighted in blue text, supported policy transmission by reaching counterparties and collateral types beyond our normal monetary policy operating framework of the time.	93.0	999.0
201607	112	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The chart on slide 21 illustrates our third takeaway.	93.0	999.0
201607	113	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Although the federal funds effective rate was successfully managed to the policy target for most of the period before Lehman, intraday rate volatility was elevated throughout the crisis period and posed an ongoing challenge to policy implementation.	93.0	999.0
201607	114	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Intraday volatility emerged early in the crisis as aggressive foreign bank demand in the morning gave way to weak domestic demand in the afternoon.	93.0	999.0
201607	115	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The primary credit rate turned out to be a very “leaky” ceiling; once implemented, the IOER turned out to be a leaky floor.	93.0	999.0
201607	116	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The lack of a firm ceiling or floor complicated the day-to-day task of policy implementation.	93.0	999.0
201607	117	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Our fourth takeaway is spelled out on slide 22:  The System was not well prepared to implement large-scale asset purchases once the funds rate hit the effective lower bound.	93.0	999.0
201607	118	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	In particular, there was a significant degree of “on-the-job learning” in order to develop a purchase program.	93.0	999.0
201607	119	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The learning process and implementation took time, reflecting the lack of preexisting arrangements to support these transactions.	93.0	999.0
201607	120	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Finally, as also noted on slide 22, the pre-crisis framework was not sufficiently robust or flexible in the face of significant liquidity stress and disruptions to the monetary transmission mechanisms.	93.0	999.0
201607	121	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	For example, the growth of offshore intermediation in US dollars shown on slide 23 and the expansion of nonbank intermediation shown on slide 24 introduced new linkages across market segments, which expanded the channels of monetary transmission.	93.0	999.0
201607	122	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The pre-crisis framework was not designed with these secular developments in mind and proved inadequate when these new channels were disrupted.	93.0	999.0
201607	123	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Notably, the FOMC has already decided to retain standing swap arrangements with the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of Japan, the ECB, and the Swiss National Bank and has used them since the crisis period.	93.0	999.0
201607	124	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Swap lines with these central banks have become part of the FOMC’s normal framework and represent an increase in the robustness of offshore market developments.	93.0	999.0
201607	125	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	On slide 25, we summarize the timeline of tools implemented over the course of the crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	126	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	As indicated by the darker bars representing instruments created over the course of the crisis, the Federal Reserve was innovative in designing and implementing new tools to address emerging liquidity problems.	93.0	999.0
201607	127	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	This, however, required venturing well beyond the core framework and investing heavily to overcome gaps in our existing knowledge and infrastructure.	93.0	999.0
201607	128	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The System lacked the flexibility to pull nonstandard tools off the shelf to address unusual market stress.	93.0	999.0
201607	129	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The ad hoc nature of the response to emerging stress prolonged the time it took to implement facilities in response and increased the System’s exposure to operational risks.	93.0	999.0
201607	130	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	I’ll now turn the stage over to Beth Klee, who will summarize the work of the money markets group.	93.0	999.0
201607	131	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Thanks, Dave.	93.0	999.0
201607	132	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	As detailed on slide 27, we now turn our focus to the set of short-term wholesale funding markets often referred to as money markets.	93.0	999.0
201607	133	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Money markets collectively help determine short-term interest rates and are a key link in monetary policy transmission.	93.0	999.0
201607	134	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	These markets were at the center of many of the problems that arose in the financial crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	135	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	To provide some background on the behavior of money markets, the next slide shows that prior to the financial crisis, major overnight money market rates— including those for CP, repo, federal funds, and Eurodollars—were highly correlated.	93.0	999.0
201607	136	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Indeed, a statistical common factor can explain nearly 95 percent of the daily variation in these four interest rates from 2001 to 2006.	93.0	999.0
201607	137	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	In addition, money markets operated in a way that made it fairly easy for the Federal Reserve to implement monetary policy to keep the effective federal funds rate close to its target.	93.0	999.0
201607	138	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	In this way, the Federal Reserve’s ability to influence rates in the federal funds market allowed it to strongly influence rates in these related markets.	93.0	999.0
201607	139	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	As shown on the next slide, post-crisis, measured at high frequencies, money market rates may now be somewhat less tightly connected than in the past, although they still retain a high degree of pass-through.	93.0	999.0
201607	140	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	In particular, the share of daily variation explained by a common factor has declined to about 85 percent from 2010 to 2015, suggesting that there are somewhat looser linkages and greater dispersion across these money market rates than there were in the pre-crisis period.	93.0	999.0
201607	141	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Although it is difficult to identify precisely all of the factors that have led to this change in the behavior of money market rates, the memo focused on three.	93.0	999.0
201607	142	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Specifically, as shown on slide 30, since the crisis, significant changes in the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy implementation framework, the business practices of some market participants, and new regulations have left an imprint on money markets.	93.0	999.0
201607	143	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Today we’ll highlight a few key themes of the memo.	93.0	999.0
201607	144	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	First, as noted on slide 31 and as Dave mentioned earlier, in the wake of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve altered its policy implementation framework in a few key ways:  Asset purchases contributed to a huge expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the volume of excess reserve balances held by the banking system.	93.0	999.0
201607	145	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	The Federal Reserve also implemented IOER, developed supplementary tools to support monetary policy implementation, and expanded the set of counterparties eligible to participate in reverse repurchase agreements.	93.0	999.0
201607	146	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	As noted on the next slide, in part reflecting the increase in reserve balances, the character of trading in the federal funds market changed.	93.0	999.0
201607	147	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Banks no longer needed to trade in the federal funds market to meet reserve requirements and manage payment flows because most banks found themselves flush with reserves.	93.0	999.0
201607	148	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Instead, most federal funds trading today reflects arbitrage activity—that is, lending by FHLBs to banks and DIs, with the latter earning the IOER.	93.0	999.0
201607	149	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Because FHLBs do not earn IOER, virtually all federal funds trades now take place at rates below the IOER rate.	93.0	999.0
201607	150	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Still, the federal funds rate remains linked to other money market rates and has responded to changes in the Federal Reserve’s administered rates.	93.0	999.0
201607	151	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	In particular, increasing the target range for the federal funds rate and raising the IOER and overnight RRP rates proved effective in lifting the constellation of money market rates in December 2015.	93.0	999.0
201607	152	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Nonbank financial institutions are active lenders in money markets, both to banks and to other nonbanks.	93.0	999.0
201607	153	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	As noted on slide 33, the introduction of the overnight RRP operations created an additional direct linkage between FOMC policy actions and nonbank financial institutions.	93.0	999.0
201607	154	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Moreover, market participants suggest the overnight RRP is a relevant “comparator rate”—that is, a rate that provides a reference point for repo market participants.	93.0	999.0
201607	155	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Furthermore, the volatility of triparty and primary-dealer- reported overnight repo rates declined with the introduction of the overnight RRP, and, more generally, the Federal Reserve’s overnight RRP operations have established an effective floor on the level of repo rates.	93.0	999.0
201607	156	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	The next slide highlights the second factor brought up in the memo, which is, namely, how changes in market participants’ business practices have affected money markets.	93.0	999.0
201607	157	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Specifically, many firms have become more cautious in managing credit, interest rate, and liquidity risks since the crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	158	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	For example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ceased their unsecured lending in the federal funds market.	93.0	999.0
201607	159	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Fannie’s and Freddie’s withdrawal occurred amid acute stresses in European peripheral sovereign debt markets and perhaps reflected a desire to minimize these risk exposures.	93.0	999.0
201607	160	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	The next slide notes the third factor that was brought up in the memo that has affected money markets:  regulations.	93.0	999.0
201607	161	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Since the crisis, a global regulatory reform program has put into place important new regulations to limit imprudent risk-taking, intended to increase the safety and resiliency of the financial system.	93.0	999.0
201607	162	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Looking narrowly at money markets, the regulations that should have the greatest effect include the expanded FDIC base, the money market mutual fund reforms, and the Basel III regulatory changes, which include the supplementary leverage ratio, the liquidity coverage ratio, and the net stable funding ratio.	93.0	999.0
201607	163	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Against this backdrop, individual institutions may now find it less attractive to expand their balance sheets without a commensurate rise in capital and liquidity positions.	93.0	999.0
201607	164	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Consistent with this hypothesis, as shown on slide 36, the spread between the Treasury GCF and triparty repo rates has widened considerably since 2014.	93.0	999.0
201607	165	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Absent frictions, arbitrage should ensure that these two rates should be identical.	93.0	999.0
201607	166	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	The wider spread reportedly in part reflects institutional frictions, which could include some tiering of rates for smaller dealers that generally have less access to direct lending from money fund counterparties.	93.0	999.0
201607	167	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Under this scenario, larger dealers borrow from money market funds in the broader triparty market and lend the funds to smaller dealers in the GCF market.	93.0	999.0
201607	168	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Because the initial borrowing expands the larger dealer’s balance sheet, the GCF rate can rise notably above the triparty rate to compensate dealers for that expansion.	93.0	999.0
201607	169	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Slide 37 outlines some open issues regarding the future evolution of money markets and their connection to an implementation framework.	93.0	999.0
201607	170	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Conversations with market participants suggest that the structural demand for reserves likely has increased significantly over the pre-crisis experience, and demand for reserves may also be more variable.	93.0	999.0
201607	171	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	The increased reserve demand stems from both precautionary and regulatory factors as well as changes in business practices.	93.0	999.0
201607	172	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Of course, the effects of these factors on reserve demand are likely to be most pronounced if the Federal Reserve also remunerates excess reserves at rates close to the level of market interest rates.	93.0	999.0
201607	173	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	If underlying demand for reserves is much higher than in the past, there could be upward pressure on the level of short-term interest rates and a resumption of interbank trading in the federal funds market sooner than the point at which the staff’s current projections involve an assumption that scarcity effects set in as a result of SOMA redemptions.	93.0	999.0
201607	174	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	In addition, US money markets may be more stable now than pre-crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	175	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	This year there have been two episodes of stress in financial markets, and in both of these cases, US money markets continued to operate well.	93.0	999.0
201607	176	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Policymakers’ views on the fundamental stability of money markets may inform their judgments about a range of issues associated with the long-run framework, including the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the appropriate level of preparedness to provide liquidity on a large scale.	93.0	999.0
201607	177	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	To summarize, as noted on slide 38, the new regulatory environment and changes in business models are factors that will likely have implications for various designs of the monetary policy framework that best achieves the FOMC’s monetary policy objectives.	93.0	999.0
201607	178	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Some important regulatory changes are not yet in place, and market participants may adjust their business models further in response.	93.0	999.0
201607	179	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	The monetary policy framework can be designed to support and enhance the benefits of the new regulatory approach in fostering a more resilient financial system with the understanding that a central bank’s implementation framework is a critical determinant of behavior in money markets.	93.0	999.0
201607	180	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	I’ll now turn the presentation over to Julie Remache.	93.0	999.0
201607	181	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	Thank you, Beth.	93.0	999.0
201607	182	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	Before turning the session over to your questions and comments and as a way to summarize our work, I’d like to highlight a few significant themes emerging from the work presented today as they relate to the set of key goals for a future implementation framework.	93.0	999.0
201607	183	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	Simon began our presentation with these, and they are repeated for your reference on slide 40.	93.0	999.0
201607	184	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	The first goal highlights the need for the framework to be robust during periods of financial stress and in response to structural changes in the financial system.	93.0	999.0
201607	185	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	The money market work highlighted many of the important regulations that have been put in place in recent years.	93.0	999.0
201607	186	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	As Beth noted, these regulations, which are meant to improve the stability of the financial system, require that financial institutions increase the amount of liquid assets that they hold to provide some measure of self- insurance.	93.0	999.0
201607	187	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	These regulations certainly increase the demand for high-quality liquid assets.	93.0	999.0
201607	188	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	And it’s possible that they may also affect the demand for reserves—as Beth noted, particularly so if they are remunerated at a rate close to market rates.	93.0	999.0
201607	189	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	This may lead to a higher overall level of reserves than in the pre-crisis regime, leading the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to be somewhat larger, even if it were to return to a scarce reserves regime.	93.0	999.0
201607	190	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	The second goal stipulates that the framework should allow the Federal Reserve to achieve its macroeconomic and financial stability objectives at the effective lower bound.	93.0	999.0
201607	191	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	The foreign experience work highlights a range of policy actions undertaken by other central banks, including the use of asset purchases, long-term funding programs, and negative rates.	93.0	999.0
201607	192	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	If the probability of revisiting the effective lower bound, perhaps routinely, in the future is reasonably high, and the duration of those visits is as long as the one we have just experienced, this will have a pronounced effect on the structure of the framework, including the set of tools that are chosen and the structure of the balance sheet.	93.0	999.0
201607	193	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	The third goal stipulates that the framework should support the ability to address liquidity strains in money markets and to support financial stability.	93.0	999.0
201607	194	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	The work presented this morning highlights a range of issues related to the interaction of liquidity insurance and the monetary policy implementation framework.	93.0	999.0
201607	195	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	These included tradeoffs in the pre-crisis framework between providing liquidity to address marketwide stress and maintaining interest rate control, the role that liquidity insurance operations played during the crisis in supporting the transmission of policy rates, and the experience not only in the United States during the crisis, but also at other central banks subsequently, with the benefits of providing liquidity to a broader range of counterparties and against a wider set of collateral to support policy transmission.	93.0	999.0
201607	196	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	Of course, such potential benefits should be weighed against potential costs—which may include increased operational complexity and possible incentives created for counterparties to increase allocation to less liquid assets.	93.0	999.0
201607	197	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	999.0
201607	198	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	That completes our presentation.	93.0	999.0
201607	199	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	200	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Before we turn to Q&A on the presentations and papers, I’d like to take this opportunity to thank our presenters and all of the staff across the System who have contributed to this very extensive project.	93.0	65.0
201607	201	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	The documents we received for today’s meeting come from the foundational workgroups.	93.0	65.0
201607	202	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And I believe they serve the very useful function of helping to establish a common understanding of our implementation framework, its evolution through the crisis, features of frameworks at foreign central banks, and the operation of money markets.	93.0	65.0
201607	203	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	As described in the staff memos, our pre-crisis approach for implementing policy was not adequate for dealing with the severe disruptions caused by the financial crisis.	93.0	65.0
201607	204	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	In response, we made many innovations to provide liquidity to the financial system and to provide additional monetary policy accommodation once the federal funds rate was lowered to the effective lower bound.	93.0	65.0
201607	205	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Some of these innovations remain key elements of our current framework.	93.0	65.0
201607	206	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And, in thinking about our framework in the longer run, it’s useful to recognize how much has changed since before the crisis.	93.0	65.0
201607	207	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	To my mind, perhaps the most significant enhancement to our implementation framework has been the authority granted to us by the Congress to pay interest on reserve balances.	93.0	65.0
201607	208	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	The IOER effectively severed the link between the quantity of reserves in the banking system and the level of short-term interest rates.	93.0	65.0
201607	209	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	As a result, the tensions we faced in the early stages of the crisis between providing liquidity on a large scale and maintaining control of the federal funds rate is largely resolved.	93.0	65.0
201607	210	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	The ability to pay interest on reserves also helped enable us to employ another key policy tool—namely, large-scale asset purchases.	93.0	65.0
201607	211	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	LSAPs are an effective tool for providing monetary stimulus.	93.0	65.0
201607	212	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	But in the absence of a predictable means by which we can subsequently scale back policy accommodation as the economy recovers, of the kind made possible by IOER, LSAPs would carry greater risks—and, therefore, would be less effective.	93.0	65.0
201607	213	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Looking ahead, if the equilibrium federal funds rate remains lower in future decades than in past ones, the effective lower bound may bind more frequently.	93.0	65.0
201607	214	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	It seems likely, then, that LSAPs will remain an important part of our toolkit to respond to the wide range of shocks we face.	93.0	65.0
201607	215	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	A third innovation in our framework has been the establishment of standing swap lines with foreign central banks.	93.0	65.0
201607	216	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	These lines provide an important backstop with which to limit funding strains in offshore dollar funding markets.	93.0	65.0
201607	217	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	As we saw in the crisis, such strains can have material adverse effects on our financial system and the domestic economy.	93.0	65.0
201607	218	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, the key objective of the long-run framework project is to identify changes that could further enhance our implementation framework, and I hope you will mention such areas in your remarks today.	93.0	65.0
201607	219	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	One area I would highlight is the discount window.	93.0	65.0
201607	220	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We have long grappled with the problem of stigma, which interferes with the efficient provision of liquidity to depository institutions and prevents the primary credit facility from serving as an effective ceiling on the federal funds rate.	93.0	65.0
201607	221	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	As the experience of other countries shows, this need not be the case.	93.0	65.0
201607	222	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	This problem is an undesirable feature of our framework, and I believe it merits further attention.	93.0	65.0
201607	223	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Another shortcoming of our current framework is the inability of IOER to provide a firm floor on the federal funds rate.	93.0	65.0
201607	224	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Our supplementary tools—notably, the overnight RRP as well as our term draining tools—may well give us all the control we need over short-term interest rates from a macroeconomic perspective.	93.0	65.0
201607	225	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	But having the market-determined level of the federal funds rate and other overnight rates trade below IOER contributes to the impression that banks are getting a special deal with us.	93.0	65.0
201607	226	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	That impression is amplified by the very large amount of reserves in the banking system and the associated large payments to commercial banks of interest on their reserve balances.	93.0	65.0
201607	227	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	It’s easy to explain why we have such a configuration of interest rates, due to the elevated level of reserves in the banking system.	93.0	65.0
201607	228	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	But it does put us in a defensive position.	93.0	65.0
201607	229	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	So let me stop there.	93.0	65.0
201607	230	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We have allocated plenty of time today for a good discussion, so please feel free to ask a lot of questions and to make comments.	93.0	65.0
201607	231	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I know that the staff would appreciate hearing your thoughts about the direction of future work.	93.0	65.0
201607	232	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	At the November FOMC meeting, we will have an opportunity to discuss the work of the framework workgroups, which are examining interest rate targets, operating regimes, and balance sheet policies.	93.0	65.0
201607	233	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	While I don’t anticipate that we will need to make critical decisions about our longer-run framework anytime soon, I hope that this discussion and our next one will better position us for that eventuality.	93.0	65.0
201607	234	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s now open the floor for questions to the staff, and after the Q&A, we will have an opportunity to comment for anyone who would like to do so.	93.0	65.0
201607	235	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	93.0	65.0
201607	236	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I have a question, and I don’t know that the staff has the answer to it or that I have an answer to it.	93.0	96.0
201607	237	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The framework objectives basically imply that this is about monetary policy implementation, it’s about financial stability, and it implies that financial stability is important in terms of thinking about what the right framework is.	93.0	96.0
201607	238	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But then, when we come down to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, a framework should involve holding “no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.”	93.0	96.0
201607	239	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So one seems narrower than the other, and I just was wondering how the staff was thinking about that.	93.0	96.0
201607	240	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Let’s imagine that we have a monetary policy framework that has huge benefits for financial stability but might require somewhat more securities.	93.0	96.0
201607	241	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Do we think that the policy normalization principles are cast in stone, or could they be potentially modified?	93.0	96.0
201607	242	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I just would like the staff’s view on this.	93.0	96.0
201607	243	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	I’m not sure that’s a question for the staff.	93.0	999.0
201607	244	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	[Laughter]	93.0	999.0
201607	245	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Let me ask it this way:  Is there a tension between these two things?	93.0	96.0
201607	246	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	They do seem a little bit in opposition to one another.	93.0	96.0
201607	247	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think it would be interesting, as we discuss this, to decide:  Do we really believe the framework should be broad and include financial-stability objectives, or should it be narrow and just focused on monetary policy implementation?	93.0	96.0
201607	248	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Madam Chair.	93.0	97.0
201607	249	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	My recollection, Vice Chairman Dudley, is that when we were talking about that stated principle of normalization, there was a little bit of back-and- forth within the Committee, basically saying that’s an issue that does have some tension in it because you could interpret effective monetary policy as meaning:  You don’t want a monetary policy that creates financial instability, because that would require reactions later.	93.0	97.0
201607	250	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But my recollection is, we self-consciously tabled the tensions inherent in that issue, and so my sense was that it’s precisely one of the things that this exercise is going to have to address.	93.0	97.0
201607	251	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes.	93.0	96.0
201607	252	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I just wanted to get that out on the table.	93.0	96.0
201607	253	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for the presenters?	93.0	65.0
201607	254	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me see, President Rosengren.	93.0	65.0
201607	255	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	My question is on the international side, and it relates to one of the things that came out of the crisis, nonbank SIFIs, which wasn’t something that most countries were thinking about before the crisis.	93.0	90.0
201607	256	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	For most countries, those were insurance companies and broker-dealers, depending on whether they were included or not included in commercial banks.	93.0	90.0
201607	257	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Do other countries make liquidity available to anybody classified as a SIFI?	93.0	90.0
201607	258	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Are we unique in that respect, or is that fairly common internationally?	93.0	90.0
201607	259	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	So, for example, we had GE, we have insurance companies, and we’re viewing them as systemically-important institutions, but we’re not giving them access to the discount window, which presumably means that even though they are systemically important, we’re not worried about liquidity problems with those organizations or we’re choosing not to address that.	93.0	90.0
201607	260	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Are we unique among the countries that you interviewed, or perhaps this may be a little too institutional?	93.0	90.0
201607	261	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	No, not at all.	93.0	999.0
201607	262	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	There are some central banks that have extended their counterparties beyond banks, even beyond broker-dealers.	93.0	999.0
201607	263	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	The Bank of England is one example that has, in effect, explicitly said:  Our framework is to give liquidity insurance to anyone we feel is systemically important for liquidity, subject to liquidity shocks, and is adequately regulated.	93.0	999.0
201607	264	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	And so the Bank of England allows, for example, for CCPs.	93.0	999.0
201607	265	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Another case is the Swiss National Bank’s inclusion of insurance companies, although I am not sure whether it is explicitly thinking about SIFIs.	93.0	999.0
201607	266	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	In fact, the Swiss National Bank also includes banks that aren’t actually operating in Switzerland but might be operating in Swiss franc markets.	93.0	999.0
201607	267	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	So it takes regulation in the euro area, regulation in the United Kingdom, as being adequate for its purposes in order to lend to those institutions.	93.0	999.0
201607	268	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	93.0	90.0
201607	269	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	93.0	65.0
201607	270	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	93.0	81.0
201607	271	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	81.0
201607	272	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I have two questions.	93.0	81.0
201607	273	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	One is for Dave Altig.	93.0	81.0
201607	274	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	This has to do with the narrative about the lessons of the crisis.	93.0	81.0
201607	275	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	The paper, I think early, mentions sales of US government securities and the extent to which we resorted to that to sterilize and offset the effect of lending programs on aggregate reserves, in order to avoid driving interest rates down.	93.0	81.0
201607	276	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Then, later on, the paper seems to drop that option and says we didn’t have any way to do that.	93.0	81.0
201607	277	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And my sense from the narrative is that we didn’t sell all the securities we could have, and it wasn’t clear why not.	93.0	81.0
201607	278	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Now, I know some were pledged or lent out in the TSLF, right?	93.0	81.0
201607	279	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But my sense is, not all of them, but I guess I could look that up.	93.0	81.0
201607	280	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Did we sell or encumber all of the US Treasury securities we could have?	93.0	81.0
201607	281	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	If we didn’t, why did we stop short of selling US government securities at the time we did?	93.0	81.0
201607	282	2016-07-27	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	We sold quite a few securities.	93.0	999.0
201607	283	2016-07-27	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Between March and May of 2008, we sold about $8 billion or $9 billion in bills, which is about 45 percent of the holdings at that time.	93.0	999.0
201607	284	2016-07-27	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	That’s actually after we had redeemed a substantial number of securities in the run-up to the Bear Stearns time frame.	93.0	999.0
201607	285	2016-07-27	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	We also sold about $55 billion in coupon securities, which represented about 12 percent of our holdings.	93.0	999.0
201607	286	2016-07-27	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	So we had run down a fair amount of the portfolio, and then in that March and May period, we sold another very sizable chunk.	93.0	999.0
201607	287	2016-07-27	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	It’s true that we didn’t sell all of them, and it’s also true, as you noted, that some of the securities we needed to hold, in part because those securities were serving as collateral or lend-out securities for programs like the TSLF.	93.0	999.0
201607	288	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So there were a couple hundred billion we could have sold?	93.0	81.0
201607	289	2016-07-27	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Yes.	93.0	999.0
201607	290	2016-07-27	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	I don’t have the exact numbers.	93.0	999.0
201607	291	2016-07-27	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	There were some securities.	93.0	999.0
201607	292	2016-07-27	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	They were, I believe, principally long-duration securities.	93.0	999.0
201607	293	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Isn’t the point, though, that we didn’t need to sell them because we hadn’t added sufficient reserves that we had to offset?	93.0	96.0
201607	294	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Well, there’s this point at which we did, right?	93.0	81.0
201607	295	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	No, no.	93.0	96.0
201607	296	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I know, I know.	93.0	96.0
201607	297	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But the point is, at the time, we were basically saying, “Well, we can sell securities, and we can expand our liquidity provisions, but we don’t want to be too aggressive in terms of our liquidity provision, because then we might have to sell a whole lot of securities, and then we’re not sure what the market effect is going to be.”	93.0	96.0
201607	298	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So we basically were very conscious of how the liquidity provisions were going to add reserves to the banking system and our ability to actually offset that by draining.	93.0	96.0
201607	299	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, we did sell securities, because that’s what we had to do to offset the reserves that we added.	93.0	96.0
201607	300	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Right.	93.0	81.0
201607	301	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We didn’t do more because that’s the volume of reserves we essentially had issued.	93.0	96.0
201607	302	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	So I think your point, President Lacker, might be that the Desk could have sold all of the outrights and just run a repo book.	93.0	999.0
201607	303	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	That repo book would have been more flexible, and that would have perhaps given you three or four days in September 2008.	93.0	999.0
201607	304	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We would have had more capacity.	93.0	96.0
201607	305	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So let me see if I get this straight.	93.0	81.0
201607	306	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Before this chart does the hockey- stick thing on page 19, no question, we sold what we did, and we sterilized effectively.	93.0	81.0
201607	307	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I’m not disputing that.	93.0	81.0
201607	308	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But the assessment that comes out—and, Madam Chair, you repeated this—that our crisis framework was inadequate for the liquidity provision.	93.0	81.0
201607	309	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I just want to pinpoint in what way it was.	93.0	81.0
201607	310	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We could have built up more capacity.	93.0	96.0
201607	311	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Is that resting on the notion that we didn’t have enough securities to sell—following what happened after October 2008, in view of the reserve injections that occurred after that, in light of the lending that occurred after that?	93.0	81.0
201607	312	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We didn’t have enough securities to sell—is that the idea?	93.0	81.0
201607	313	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, there is the gap between September and October when the TARP legislation gives us the authority to pay interest on reserves?	93.0	96.0
201607	314	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s really during that month that we were exposed.	93.0	96.0
201607	315	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Right.	93.0	81.0
201607	316	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Well, there’s clearly that.	93.0	999.0
201607	317	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	There is the issue in the spring and the summer of 2008 when the TAF and swaps were there, but they had a limit on the usage.	93.0	999.0
201607	318	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	We’ve had a long discussion on this.	93.0	999.0
201607	319	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	I don’t think this was the first binding constraint in policymakers’ minds, but from the operational perspective, when Vice Chairman Dudley and his staff were thinking through about how to describe for you what we could do, they were constantly thinking at the back of their minds, “We have to be careful here, because there’s only a limited amount we can do if we have a lot of usage of, say, the TAF, or the swaps, to control the federal funds rate.”	93.0	999.0
201607	320	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	And the federal funds rate was well above zero.	93.0	999.0
201607	321	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	It was about 2¼ percent at that time.	93.0	999.0
201607	322	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Well, then we could have sold more securities outright, right?	93.0	81.0
201607	323	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Exactly.	93.0	999.0
201607	324	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	The Desk could have come to you and said, “Over the next few months, we are now going to liquidate all of the Treasury portfolio, run a repo book, and that will give you more flexibility to size up these programs.”	93.0	999.0
201607	325	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But, even short of that, I don’t see what the problem would have been then.	93.0	81.0
201607	326	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Part of the issue is, you don’t have foresight about what’s going to come.	93.0	96.0
201607	327	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	You don’t know that Lehman weekend is coming down the road, right?	93.0	96.0
201607	328	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	You could sell a lot of securities to build up your capacity, but then you have the cost of how that could potentially disrupt the Treasury securities market, and do you want to do that or not?	93.0	96.0
201607	329	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Well, we were lowering rates.	93.0	81.0
201607	330	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Right.	93.0	96.0
201607	331	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Selling bills and short-dated coupon securities is probably not going to have much effect on the Treasury securities market or the Treasury yield curve, but if we had sold a lot of longer-dated Treasur securities, I think there’s a question of what that would do to the market.	93.0	96.0
201607	332	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s a judgment call.	93.0	96.0
201607	333	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	I think if we look back, there are many things we would have done in a different way.	93.0	999.0
201607	334	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Oh, absolutely.	93.0	96.0
201607	335	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	That’s certainly true, but from the interviews that we’ve done, this was a constraint in people’s minds.	93.0	999.0
201607	336	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	I don’t think it was a primary constraint in policymakers’ minds.	93.0	999.0
201607	337	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	For them, there were a lot of issues—moral hazard and dealing with whether we could have such large programs and what that would look like.	93.0	999.0
201607	338	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Optically, that ended in the middle of September 2008.	93.0	999.0
201607	339	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Didn’t the Treasury come along and help us manage this problem substantially by running up its own balances?	93.0	65.0
201607	340	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Correct, and it helped drain reserves by holding more.	93.0	96.0
201607	341	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And that was before October?	93.0	65.0
201607	342	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes.	93.0	96.0
201607	343	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I have a second question.	93.0	81.0
201607	344	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	It’s for Beth Klee.	93.0	81.0
201607	345	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In your presentation, you talked about linkages, and this shows up in the paper, too.	93.0	81.0
201607	346	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	There’s this graph on slide 28 that shows pre-crisis rates are highly correlated, and then on slide 29 it says that rates may be less connected at high frequencies.	93.0	81.0
201607	347	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	On 28, all the rates are really close to each other and the lines kind of overlap, and then on 29, they wiggle around a lot and they’re far apart.	93.0	81.0
201607	348	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But then, the scales are different.	93.0	81.0
201607	349	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	To your credit and in all fairness, you cite, I think, some econometric work, something about what fraction of variance is explained by a common factor.	93.0	81.0
201607	350	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Yes.	93.0	999.0
201607	351	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	That’s just doing a simple principal component analysis.	93.0	999.0
201607	352	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	93.0	81.0
201607	353	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So when I look the one on 28, the pre-crisis, and I think about a common factor there, I’m thinking, that would be us, right, moving interest rates around?	93.0	81.0
201607	354	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Yes.	93.0	999.0
201607	355	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And then in your second sample, we’re not moving interest rates around much at all.	93.0	81.0
201607	356	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We do it once at the end.	93.0	81.0
201607	357	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	You’re not going to get the federal funds rate target or some policy rate as being the common factor.	93.0	81.0
201607	358	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So, you’d expect the fraction of variance explained by the common factor to go down, right, and that would not to really reflect any difference in meaningful linkages or the extent to which market rates would move if we raised rates as much as we did on slide 28.	93.0	81.0
201607	359	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Is that intuition correct, Beth?	93.0	81.0
201607	360	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	I think it is to some degree.	93.0	999.0
201607	361	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	It’s basically a statistical exercise—it’s pretty agnostic.	93.0	999.0
201607	362	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	I think that you’re going to see the rates travel more together if you have the policy rates moving things, and so, therefore, that will explain more.	93.0	999.0
201607	363	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	To be technical about it:  We take out the mean.	93.0	999.0
201607	364	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	We control for these kinds of things, but—	93.0	999.0
201607	365	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	You don’t take out the movement in the funds rate.	93.0	81.0
201607	366	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	No, we don’t take out the movement in the funds rate.	93.0	999.0
201607	367	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	93.0	81.0
201607	368	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	But in terms of the behavior of the constellation of rates when you move, let’s say, either the federal funds rate target or, in this case, the administered rates, in both cases the constellation of money market rates moved up.	93.0	999.0
201607	369	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	And so is 95 percent very different from 85 percent, particularly when you’re at the effective lower bound?	93.0	999.0
201607	370	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	That’s probably a judgment call.	93.0	999.0
201607	371	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	81.0
201607	372	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	373	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fisher.	93.0	65.0
201607	374	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	108.0
201607	375	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Somebody said earlier that they weren’t sure they should raise this issue, and I’m not sure I should raise this issue except that it’s important.	93.0	108.0
201607	376	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	The big thing that happened last time was at the time of the failure of Lehman Brothers.	93.0	108.0
201607	377	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And that made a difference to the entire world.	93.0	108.0
201607	378	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Now, there’s nothing as far as I can see that prevents us coming to a day on which we don’t have a tool to deal with a similar situation.	93.0	108.0
201607	379	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So what are we going to do on that day?	93.0	108.0
201607	380	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Are you waiting for an answer, sir?	93.0	97.0
201607	381	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, the question I’m raising is what are we allowed to do?	93.0	108.0
201607	382	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Do you mean what facilities do we have?	93.0	65.0
201607	383	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Yes,  Are we allowed to go to the FDIC and start putting this institution into bankruptcy or at least into the FDIC’s care, with some hope that we’ve done enough work that will enable us to prevent that having massive repercussions?	93.0	108.0
201607	384	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Under Title 2?	93.0	65.0
201607	385	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Under Title 2.	93.0	108.0
201607	386	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And the FDIC has the ability to tap liquidity and lend to that institution.	93.0	65.0
201607	387	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	93.0	108.0
201607	388	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We still have 13(3) powers to put in place broad-based programs if it’s not a single institution.	93.0	65.0
201607	389	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Yes, well, if we had five Lehmans, we would have had a bigger problem.	93.0	108.0
201607	390	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Five investment banks.	93.0	999.0
201607	391	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	But, Governor Fischer, just to be clear, for the purpose of this project, we decided deliberately—and I believe also with your blessing—that we would actually stay away from the explicit evaluation of, for example, 13(3) facilities, because we felt that they were not part of a normal implementation framework.	93.0	999.0
201607	392	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Now, as you saw from the material, clearly there is a bit of a gray area here, in the sense that you cannot completely exclude the topic of liquidity provision, because it turns out that liquidity provision and the implementation framework are very closely tied.	93.0	999.0
201607	393	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	That said, I think what our work here has primarily focused on are questions such as, If you had to greatly expand the provision of liquidity, how would you still be able to control short-term interest rates in order to implement the particular chosen stance for monetary policy?	93.0	999.0
201607	394	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I’m afraid that it was by design that this project was not intended to address the question that you just raised.	93.0	999.0
201607	395	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	That’s clear, and if I agreed with that some time ago, then I plead guilty.	93.0	108.0
201607	396	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	But, at some point, we’re going to have to look at this issue.	93.0	108.0
201607	397	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’ve got a plan, which is not entirely “fair weather” sailing, but there are things that it doesn’t quite go into in the same depth that it might.	93.0	108.0
201607	398	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’ve got to find a way of doing the best we can to figure out what we would do in similar circumstances because they can quite well arise.	93.0	108.0
201607	399	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	It’s not that we banned them by saying that you got rid of too-big-to-fail.	93.0	108.0
201607	400	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	If somebody eventually says “yes,” then it’s gone, but that hasn’t happened, so we had better come back to it in some way, shape, or form, with the attendant political difficulties being taken into account.	93.0	108.0
201607	401	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	It’s a very tough issue, as I’m sure I don’t have to say.	93.0	108.0
201607	402	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And our powers have been restricted in Dodd-Frank, but we still do have substantial 13(3) powers to create facilities to address strains, and in Dodd-Frank we got the ability, if we deemed it important, to lend to a CCP or a designated financial market utility if it encountered strains, which could be a different kind of problem that afflicts the financial system.	93.0	65.0
201607	403	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We’re not completely without powers, but they’re certainly not as broad as some other countries have and have regularly put into effect.	93.0	65.0
201607	404	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	93.0	108.0
201607	405	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions for the staff?	93.0	65.0
201607	406	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	93.0	65.0
201607	407	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	90.0
201607	408	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Sorry for the second question.	93.0	90.0
201607	409	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Please feel free.	93.0	65.0
201607	410	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We’ve got a lot of time.	93.0	65.0
201607	411	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This is an international question again.	93.0	90.0
201607	412	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’m looking at slide 8 on the policy rates and the distinction between market and administered rates, and it’s striking how many chose administered rates rather than market rates.	93.0	90.0
201607	413	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	When I think of the IOER, it’s a leaky floor, which is, in some sense, by design.	93.0	90.0
201607	414	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It’s a leaky floor because we didn’t give nonbanks access to the administered rate.	93.0	90.0
201607	415	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Are there any other central banks that chose to have a leaky floor by design?	93.0	90.0
201607	416	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In some sense, you could view us as having an administered rate, because it’s really weird that only the GSEs are trading in the federal funds market.	93.0	90.0
201607	417	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	So we’ve created, kind of by design, an artificial market that’s very tied to the administered rate.	93.0	90.0
201607	418	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The arbitrage works through foreign banks, but because of the FDIC, they’re getting arbitrage profits relative to the GSEs, which are government entities.	93.0	90.0
201607	419	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It’s kind of a weird set of constraints that we’ve imposed to make this a market.	93.0	90.0
201607	420	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In some sense, I’d be interested whether anybody else has this kind of characteristic.	93.0	90.0
201607	421	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Are all of these administered rates truly administered rates, or is what they’ve done to avoid leaky floors to allow other people to participate in the administered rate besides depositories?	93.0	90.0
201607	422	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	If you turn to slide 11, I don’t know if they tried to do this by design or not, but you can see in the case of both the Bank of England, which is depicted in the purple line, and the Bank of Japan, shown in the dark blue line, money market rates are trading far below their floor.	93.0	999.0
201607	423	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	And that includes some nonbank participants who are not part of or don’t have access to accounts that get remunerated trading with banks that do have access.	93.0	999.0
201607	424	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	So it is this sort of arbitrage activity.	93.0	999.0
201607	425	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	I don’t know whether it’s by design or not.	93.0	999.0
201607	426	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	So those are administered rates or market rates when they have those examples.	93.0	90.0
201607	427	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	That’s similar to us, right?	93.0	90.0
201607	428	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	In both of these cases, they are administered rates.	93.0	999.0
201607	429	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	I don’t think they have a government-sponsored enterprise that has an account at the central bank that can run transactions through that account but is not eligible to earn that central bank rate.	93.0	999.0
201607	430	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	That is somewhat different, and it affects the federal funds market.	93.0	999.0
201607	431	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	If you paid out to the GSEs, the federal funds rate would likely then trade above the effective rate where the IOER is.	93.0	999.0
201607	432	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Remember, that market is relatively small compared with the Eurodollar market in which the nonbanks, which are the money funds, are much bigger transactors.	93.0	999.0
201607	433	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	You’d still have that wedge, and that’s really what you see in the United Kingdom and Japan.	93.0	999.0
201607	434	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	This is a conjecture.	93.0	999.0
201607	435	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	I also don’t know if the statement is 100 percent true.	93.0	999.0
201607	436	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	It is the case that you see that the rates trade not as below the floor in the case of the BOJ and BOE.	93.0	999.0
201607	437	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	And that may be due to their having a broader set of counterparties, and it may also be due to their having a much smaller nonbank sector.	93.0	999.0
201607	438	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	But, you know, that’s a conjecture.	93.0	999.0
201607	439	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	93.0	90.0
201607	440	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions?	93.0	65.0
201607	441	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	93.0	65.0
201607	442	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	On page 12, there’s a discussion about liquidity provision to a broader range of institutions, and then there’s bullet 4, which is that central banks see advantages to having a more level playing field and to getting information about the institutions to which they are lending, but that we need to be worried about moral hazard.	93.0	108.0
201607	443	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	That’s not written—that was said.	93.0	108.0
201607	444	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	As far as I can see—and I think you said this in the written paper—the Bank of England, for instance, has just tried to get rid of the moral-hazard aspects in the way it has set up these facilities, or something like these facilities.	93.0	108.0
201607	445	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And the question is, should we be saying, well, in essence, moral hazard is a barrier that we can’t overcome, or should we try to think of institutional arrangements like the Bank of England has developed?	93.0	108.0
201607	446	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	One thing that a number of foreign banks expressed was that getting at moral hazard might be more of a supervisory and regulatory issue than an issue for liquidity insurance.	93.0	999.0
201607	447	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But, of course, the Bank of England is the supervisor.	93.0	97.0
201607	448	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Yes.	93.0	999.0
201607	449	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	So they would try to use those powers, although they were not the supervisor, necessarily, in all instances, I guess.	93.0	999.0
201607	450	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	They are the only prudential supervisor.	93.0	97.0
201607	451	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Okay.	93.0	999.0
201607	452	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	They are now.	93.0	999.0
201607	453	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Yes, you’re right, I’m sorry.	93.0	999.0
201607	454	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	That wasn’t the case partly when they designed this, but that’s the situation now.	93.0	999.0
201607	455	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Now.	93.0	999.0
201607	456	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	It’s also true that that’s the change at the ECB.	93.0	999.0
201607	457	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Although, in the case of the ECB, they don’t have the broadest set of counterparties.	93.0	999.0
201607	458	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	93.0	65.0
201607	459	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’ll get to this in the comments, but I gathered in reading all this—which I thought was very well done and obviously very helpful for me—that while you didn’t address some of the sensitivity about what powers we have and don’t have, you laid it out so that part of the guidance we can offer in our comments should be:  What should we have?	93.0	110.0
201607	460	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And then we can have a separate discussion about how to get from here to there?	93.0	110.0
201607	461	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And the BOE is the one that naturally you gravitate toward, because what they have—and we’ll get to this later—seems like a good thing to have.	93.0	110.0
201607	462	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The issue here I gather is:  How do we get to where we actually have the ability to do the same thing the Bank of England does?	93.0	110.0
201607	463	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I take it that’s a little trickier question.	93.0	110.0
201607	464	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	My view is that the law, especially the Federal Reserve Act, is what we take.	93.0	999.0
201607	465	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	It gives the Federal Reserve tremendous power.	93.0	999.0
201607	466	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Before the crisis, the Bank of England operated in a way that was much narrower in terms of the collateral that they would take.	93.0	999.0
201607	467	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	The discount window will take a range of collateral, which is very wide compared with most central banks.	93.0	999.0
201607	468	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So we might actually have the power.	93.0	110.0
201607	469	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	There, you limit the type of counterparties.	93.0	999.0
201607	470	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	With open market operations, if you’re prepared to narrow to a particular type of collateral, you can have a wide range of counterparties.	93.0	999.0
201607	471	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Okay.	93.0	110.0
201607	472	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Within that construction, subject to some really important issues, whatever decisions that you take, you have to think about the incentives you are putting into money markets and about the financial institutions there.	93.0	999.0
201607	473	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	We can’t just be thinking of the case of how would we lend a lot of money at a certain time?	93.0	999.0
201607	474	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	We have to think of how likely we are to get to that situation, because we have incentives in place for those folks to take risks, because they know that the Federal Reserve is there.	93.0	999.0
201607	475	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But that’s why we’re doing this exercise, to think through these things in advance, right?	93.0	110.0
201607	476	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	It’s part of the reason, yes.	93.0	999.0
201607	477	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	I guess I’d only add that part of the reason we cite the Bank of England frequently is that it is a central bank that has done a lot of thinking and enacted a lot of change from where it was pre-2006, even before the crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	478	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	The BOE changed its system before the crisis, and we saw a lot of evolution during the crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	479	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Because they’ve done a lot of thinking, it’s a lot of grist in the mill.	93.0	999.0
201607	480	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	93.0	110.0
201607	481	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	93.0	65.0
201607	482	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Any further questions?	93.0	65.0
201607	483	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair—	93.0	81.0
201607	484	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	93.0	65.0
201607	485	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	93.0	81.0
201607	486	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Let me just add a comment to echo what Thomas Laubach said.	93.0	81.0
201607	487	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We have the luxury now of separating questions of monetary control and interest rate control from credit extension.	93.0	81.0
201607	488	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	When we were founded, the founders made a choice to combine those two, and it was based on the monetary system at the time of the gold standard and the fact that government finance, if it was monetized, tended to be associated with wartime departures from the gold standard and inflation—or, if done in peacetime, associated with inflation.	93.0	81.0
201607	489	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	The founders explicitly chose not to focus on government-debt backing for the money we would issue but instead used the discount window in its mechanism.	93.0	81.0
201607	490	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Very rapidly after that, we got plenty of government securities, and we’ve figured out over the last century how to run central banks with a portfolio in which the money they issue is backed by government securities and without having that be inflationary.	93.0	81.0
201607	491	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	It was for a time in the ’70s, but it isn’t now.	93.0	81.0
201607	492	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But that gives us the luxury of separating granting credit to the private sector from how much liquidity we provide—and I use that word in the sense of our monetary liabilities that we provide to the system.	93.0	81.0
201607	493	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Now, liquidity is also used in these papers—a little sloppily—to refer to credit extension, in which you are lending somebody those assets.	93.0	81.0
201607	494	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	To provide them to the system, people can exchange assets to acquire our liabilities.	93.0	81.0
201607	495	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But that’s not the same as our lending them to them.	93.0	81.0
201607	496	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	That division we can do, and so I think, on Thomas’s point, either we separate thinking about liquidity provision and liquidity extension from monetary control or we don’t.	93.0	81.0
201607	497	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And if we are going to go down the road of combining the two, using credit extension as part of monetary control, opens up a big can of worms.	93.0	81.0
201607	498	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But I would just put in a pitch for keeping those separate in our discussions.	93.0	81.0
201607	499	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	93.0	65.0
201607	500	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I have a follow-up for President Lacker.	93.0	94.0
201607	501	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Could you elaborate on what you mean?	93.0	94.0
201607	502	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Because I took the point of the memos to be that these are not really separable things, and therefore we have to design a system that appropriately balances the ability to provide monetary control and the ability to provide liquidity in a crisis.	93.0	94.0
201607	503	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	And you just said, you could separate these two things.	93.0	94.0
201607	504	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	So, what do you mean?	93.0	94.0
201607	505	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Well, I was going to get to this in my prepared remarks.	93.0	81.0
201607	506	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	At the risk of some perseveration, I’ll just say that what I am proposing is a very simple regime in which we pay interest on reserves and ignore everything else in the world—not ignore it, but don’t adopt an explicit target for the funds rate, just drop that.	93.0	81.0
201607	507	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Our policy rate is our administered rate, and that’s it.	93.0	81.0
201607	508	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And we count on arbitrage, as we do now, to align rates with that.	93.0	81.0
201607	509	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So that’s a crisp, pure polar model, and in that world, you know, our balance sheet can be whatever it is.	93.0	81.0
201607	510	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	93.0	94.0
201607	511	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	So the point would be, it’s an administered rate.	93.0	94.0
201607	512	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Right.	93.0	81.0
201607	513	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In that simple regime there doesn’t seem to be any tension between monetary control and credit extension, right?	93.0	81.0
201607	514	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We can extend credit, and we keep the IOER where it is, and arbitrage presumably keeps everything where it is.	93.0	81.0
201607	515	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So we don’t have to sterilize anything.	93.0	81.0
201607	516	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We just don’t have an issue.	93.0	81.0
201607	517	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So the tension doesn’t arise in that scenario.	93.0	81.0
201607	518	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	93.0	94.0
201607	519	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	So your point would be that a lot hinges on an administered rate versus a market rate?	93.0	94.0
201607	520	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Right.	93.0	81.0
201607	521	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	An administered rate with a floor.	93.0	81.0
201607	522	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	With other systems, like reserve scarcity systems, you have to sterilize things.	93.0	81.0
201607	523	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	You have to deal with this issue.	93.0	81.0
201607	524	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	That was the point—that, if there is going to be a tension, if the staff is going to ask us to consider something in which there is some tradeoff, we haven’t seen a serious ex post review of our credit programs.	93.0	81.0
201607	525	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	They are going to be asking us to make some choice, on the basis of the costs and benefits of preparedness for liquidity provision programs, credit extension programs.	93.0	81.0
201607	526	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I think we would want something about the economic advantages and disadvantages of various levels of preparedness for credit extension by a central bank.	93.0	81.0
201607	527	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So I previewed my comments there.	93.0	81.0
201607	528	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	93.0	94.0
201607	529	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Certainly.	93.0	81.0
201607	530	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	93.0	65.0
201607	531	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	A number of people have asked to comment.	93.0	65.0
201607	532	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	If others who are not on this list wish to be added, just let us know.	93.0	65.0
201607	533	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s begin our comment opportunity with the Vice Chairman.	93.0	65.0
201607	534	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	93.0	96.0
201607	535	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we all have to agree that the staff have given us a lot to digest, and there’s obviously going to be much more to come on this.	93.0	96.0
201607	536	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I thought this round of work was very thorough and thoughtful.	93.0	96.0
201607	537	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So thank you for that.	93.0	96.0
201607	538	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, I do think it’s extraordinarily premature to make any strong assertions about what the long-run framework should look like at this point because I think there’s a lot more work and assessment to do before we reach that point.	93.0	96.0
201607	539	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	As I see it, this is a very big and complex subject, and, speaking for myself, I am going to need some time to get my head fully around the key issues and the potential alternatives and tradeoffs.	93.0	96.0
201607	540	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Nevertheless, I’d like to make a couple of comments at this very early stage.	93.0	96.0
201607	541	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	My first comment, which is consistent with the framework objectives that were laid out for us, is that we need to pick a framework that’s not just best suited for monetary policy execution, but that is also best suited to achieving our financial-stability objectives.	93.0	96.0
201607	542	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I can imagine a framework that had significant financial-stability benefits—because it included a broader set of counterparties, or it had stronger liquidity backstops, or it had liquidity backstops that had less stigma—but it might be a little bit more complex than a simpler system might be in terms of monetary policy execution.	93.0	96.0
201607	543	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I might be willing to accept a little bit more complicated, elaborate monetary policy execution in exchange for those financial stability benefits.	93.0	96.0
201607	544	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think we want to cast the net large and understand that we’re maximizing across both of these regimes, monetary policy implementation and financial stability.	93.0	96.0
201607	545	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The second point is that, as the SOMA manager in 2007 and 2008, I don’t disagree with anything the staff said.	93.0	96.0
201607	546	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I thought the lessons of the financial crisis with respect to monetary policy implementation are pretty clear.	93.0	96.0
201607	547	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The setup then was not well suited for providing liquidity to the system.	93.0	96.0
201607	548	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We did encounter a conflict between the goal of supplying liquidity and maintaining monetary control in 2007 and much of 2008.	93.0	96.0
201607	549	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We didn’t move to particularly large liquidity-assisted programs because we were worried about the consequences of that for reserves.	93.0	96.0
201607	550	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Only quite late in the fall of 2008, with the TARP legislation, did we get the opportunity to move to the interest-on-reserves framework under which, in my mind, we were finally able to establish credible, broad backstops without the risk of losing monetary policy control.	93.0	96.0
201607	551	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And, if you think about it, the crisis might have been less severe if we had been able to put such broad, open-ended backstops in place sooner.	93.0	96.0
201607	552	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We couldn’t do that because we were worried about monetary policy control, but if we had had broad, credible backstops in place, I think there would have been less incentive for counterparties to pull away because they’d know that there would have been a way of getting cash back at the end of the day.	93.0	96.0
201607	553	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, I think there were a number of other problems that I’d like to avoid in the future.	93.0	96.0
201607	554	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the stigma associated with the discount window borrowing, which the Chair talked about, was a huge problem.	93.0	96.0
201607	555	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	To me, another problem that came up during the crisis that we need to consider was that we did supply a lot of liquidity to the banking system, but that was not necessarily lent on to other important parts of the financial system.	93.0	96.0
201607	556	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In a hybrid system like we have—banks, nonbanks, a pretty big capital market—how do we have a system to ensure that the credit actually gets to the people that need it?	93.0	96.0
201607	557	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Getting it to the banks may not be sufficient.	93.0	96.0
201607	558	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The third point I would just make is, although it’s still in the early day to reach firm conclusions, I have to say that my current inclination is not to go back to the corridor system that we had before the crisis.	93.0	96.0
201607	559	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I viewed that as operationally cumbersome and at times ineffective at keeping the federal funds rate where we want it to be.	93.0	96.0
201607	560	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I remember the fact that we had these fluctuations in the federal funds rate within a given day—higher in the morning in Europe and then lower later in the day.	93.0	96.0
201607	561	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	You know, that was probably not a big problem in terms of effective monetary policy, but then in September 2008, it actually got worse.	93.0	96.0
201607	562	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We had difficulty keeping the federal funds rate close to our target right after the Lehman Brothers failure.	93.0	96.0
201607	563	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	At the same time, I don’t think we want or need to operate a regime in which the Federal Reserve has the kind of extraordinary large balance sheet as it does today.	93.0	96.0
201607	564	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the benefits of a floor system can be achieved with a much smaller balance sheet.	93.0	96.0
201607	565	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The fourth point I would make is, I hope we all just remain open minded about where all this is going.	93.0	96.0
201607	566	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	This means being open minded not just about the framework, but also not prematurely ruling out seeking other changes that might make a particular monetary policy originally more effective.	93.0	96.0
201607	567	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, I can imagine that after all the work is done, we can conclude that seeking changes to the leverage ratio requirements that might exempt bank reserve holdings with the Federal Reserve from the leverage-ratio calculation or seeking changes via legislation or via regulation that would change our set of counterparties might result in a more effective monetary policy regime, and I don’t think we should necessarily rule them out ex ante.	93.0	96.0
201607	568	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We should consider them carefully—What’s the benefit of trying to push down these certain avenues against some of the constraints that we face?—and see if that’s worth it or not.	93.0	96.0
201607	569	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think changing our target from the federal funds rate to some other rate is certainly something we should consider.	93.0	96.0
201607	570	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think an interesting open question is:  What are the pros and cons of targeting an administered rate versus a market rate?	93.0	96.0
201607	571	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I frankly don’t see a particular benefit of targeting a market rate.	93.0	96.0
201607	572	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If you target an administered rate and the market rates move consistently with that administered rate, it seem to me like an administered rate works just fine.	93.0	96.0
201607	573	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But I’d like that issue developed a little bit more fully.	93.0	96.0
201607	574	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, I do think there are some important issues that could be more fully developed.	93.0	96.0
201607	575	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	One thing that runs through the memo is this issue of interbank activity in the money markets.	93.0	96.0
201607	576	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess I have a fundamental question:  In and of itself, is interbank activity in the money market a good thing?	93.0	96.0
201607	577	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	When I step back and consider it at a little higher level, we want a financial system that allows efficient intermediation between savers and borrowers.	93.0	96.0
201607	578	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In an ideal system, savers meet borrowers.	93.0	96.0
201607	579	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s no need for anybody in the middle.	93.0	96.0
201607	580	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	They meet, and they exchange.	93.0	96.0
201607	581	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re all done.	93.0	96.0
201607	582	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me that having a view that we want interbank money market activity means we’re actually putting more stuff in the middle, more cost and more complexity, which might not necessarily be a good thing.	93.0	96.0
201607	583	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I’m not sure that interbank activity is necessarily a good thing.	93.0	96.0
201607	584	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I wouldn’t go in a priori thinking that’s a positive, and I’d like to see more work on that.	93.0	96.0
201607	585	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The second issue I thought that would be interesting to explore a little further is whether the issuance of Federal Reserve bills is in scope for this project.	93.0	96.0
201607	586	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me that Federal Reserve bills have a lot of advantages.	93.0	96.0
201607	587	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	You’d have a much broader set of counterparties.	93.0	96.0
201607	588	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It would drain reserves, and we could drain as much of reserves as we want.	93.0	96.0
201607	589	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It would allow us to lean much less heavily on the interest on excess reserves so that you could get away from the idea that we’re favoring banks.	93.0	96.0
201607	590	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So it seems to me that the Federal Reserve bill issuance is probably worth some consideration.	93.0	96.0
201607	591	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And then the final meta questions I have are:  How does the framework influence the size of the banking system versus the nonbank system, and how is that relevant to financial stability?	93.0	96.0
201607	592	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re going to make choices that could either encourage the banking system to grow because we’re providing benefit to being a bank, or we could offer a system that makes being a bank a little bit less attractive, and so banks could shrink.	93.0	96.0
201607	593	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think we need to think about how we treat banks versus nonbanks as we go through this process and how that’s likely to affect the future evolution of the financial system.	93.0	96.0
201607	594	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	93.0	96.0
201607	595	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	596	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	93.0	65.0
201607	597	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	102.0
201607	598	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with your opening remarks that this is very useful material.	93.0	102.0
201607	599	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even though I’ve been in the Federal Reserve throughout this period, it was nice to have all of the documents together, highlighting the key issues and open questions.	93.0	102.0
201607	600	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of open questions, the thing that struck me in reading through the very thorough memos—and I agree here with the Vice Chairman—was the sense that there are still the same open questions today that we had the last time we discussed this.	93.0	102.0
201607	601	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	One example is how regulations—especially in money market funds, in banking—will affect the demand for reserves or affect relative activity in money markets and interest rates and things like that.	93.0	102.0
201607	602	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s still an ongoing process, so I think there’s time for us to learn more from that.	93.0	102.0
201607	603	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Another open question—and I do have a solution for this, but maybe I’ll save it for tomorrow—is that we haven’t really progressed very far on policy normalization.	93.0	102.0
201607	604	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	93.0	102.0
201607	605	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Some of the big questions we had were on the role of the ON RRP and its size:  what the scale of the ON RRP will be as we raise interest rates and how that will affect market conditions.	93.0	102.0
201607	606	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We started with this very open-ended, large approach to the program so that we could have very good interest rate control.	93.0	102.0
201607	607	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s been successful, but I still think we have a lot to learn as we do raise rates about how that will actually function and the pros and cons of that.	93.0	102.0
201607	608	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So like the Vice Chairman commented, I think it is premature to come to conclusions either here or November.	93.0	102.0
201607	609	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, I guess my main point I would like to make is, I’m worried a little bit about the timeline here.	93.0	102.0
201607	610	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s great that we have a discussion today and maybe in November to intellectually think about these issues.	93.0	102.0
201607	611	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In view of some of the uncertainties and questions that will still be open, I’m just not sure whether we’re going to have the information we need even in 2017, which is when, I think, we’re supposed to have the kind of meeting at which we actually try to come to agreement on some of this.	93.0	102.0
201607	612	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I guess my one bit of advice is not to try to hold to some fixed timeline in coming to decisions, but to have that be on the basis of what we’ve learned and the events, say, over the next year.	93.0	102.0
201607	613	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Going back to the issue that Governor Fischer and others have brought up in their questions, I do think, in setting up this new framework, we need to consider seriously what we think the risks are and what the distribution of the risks that we’re worried about is.	93.0	102.0
201607	614	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In normal times, I think any framework works fine.	93.0	102.0
201607	615	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	93.0	102.0
201607	616	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that’s the international experience.	93.0	102.0
201607	617	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It doesn’t matter in normal times how we do monetary policy.	93.0	102.0
201607	618	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s fine.	93.0	102.0
201607	619	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The issues that you really want to think about the situations that are either very stressful from a financial-sector point of view, the zero lower bound, negative interest rates.	93.0	102.0
201607	620	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I think that does force us to actually think about what the likely scenarios are, not specifically about a Lehman Brothers or an AIG kind of scenario, but more generally about what the problem is that we’re trying to solve?	93.0	102.0
201607	621	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Personally, because of my view on the low equilibrium real interest rate or natural rate of interest, I am mostly scared, if you will, about effective lower bounds, and I heard the word “visit.”	93.0	102.0
201607	622	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I feel this was like my son moving back home.	93.0	102.0
201607	623	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The effective-lower-bound episodes are not visits, they’re kind of stay-for-many-years situations.	93.0	102.0
201607	624	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	93.0	102.0
201607	625	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, to me, in thinking about the policy framework, a lot of the important issues come up, as you said, Madam Chair, concerning LSAPs, liquidity insurance, and, obviously, stigma, and I’m not discounting those, but I do think that the effective lower bound is the thing that worries me.	93.0	102.0
201607	626	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I do want to bring up an issue that the Vice Chairman and others brought up, and that’s the issue of the legal restrictions on our ability to conduct monetary policy.	93.0	102.0
201607	627	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m thinking about the types of assets we can buy, whether we can pay negative interest rates, Federal Reserve bills—I was scribbling these down while people were speaking—the various tools that we will have in the future to basically achieve our dual-mandate goals.	93.0	102.0
201607	628	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I recognize that these are legal restrictions.	93.0	102.0
201607	629	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even interest on reserves is a legal restriction.	93.0	102.0
201607	630	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I do think that if we come to the conclusion that we need more powerful monetary policy tools or that we need to be able to use Federal Reserve bills or pay interest to a broader set of institutions, we should, when we come to that view, try our best to convince elected officials that those are the tools that we need.	93.0	102.0
201607	631	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I know we can’t control that, but I do think that should be part of our discussion.	93.0	102.0
201607	632	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t think we should have discussions only about what can we do under the current law, but we should think seriously about, well, if we could have additional tools, what they would be.	93.0	102.0
201607	633	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The last comment is that—and I don’t mean to take up so much time, I apologize for that—I do wonder about stigma.	93.0	102.0
201607	634	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Stigma in this conversation today sounds a little bit like too- big-to-fail.	93.0	102.0
201607	635	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’re all against it, but it’s actually an equilibrium outcome, right?	93.0	102.0
201607	636	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s not about who’s causing the stigma.	93.0	102.0
201607	637	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s us, right?	93.0	102.0
201607	638	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’re the central bank, and the policies that we set and the decisions we make are what cause banks not to want to come to the discount window.	93.0	102.0
201607	639	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So in thinking about stigma, I think we have to go back to what I understand the fundamental issues is: Do we think there is value in telling financial institutions that you should be getting your funding from the markets instead of coming to the central bank, or do we think that, no, in fact, we want the central bank to be your source of funding on a regular basis?	93.0	102.0
201607	640	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I know I’m being very loose in how I talk about that, but I do remember 2007.	93.0	102.0
201607	641	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	When we said, “The discount window is open, and come,” and no one came, I think the issue was really about the fact that banks understood that you weren’t supposed to come to the discount window unless you were in trouble.	93.0	102.0
201607	642	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And so I think that when we say we want to reduce stigma, we might look maybe a little more inwardly and think harder about why it is that we developed that situation in the first place.	93.0	102.0
201607	643	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, I think we had tried to change that through policy changes made before the crisis to reduce the stigma and make it an effective ceiling, but I agree with your point.	93.0	65.0
201607	644	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We hadn’t been successful before that, and that continued to prevail during the crisis.	93.0	65.0
201607	645	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with what you just said, but I remember in 2007, with then- Chairman Bernanke, it was almost like we had an announcement, along with balloons and free hot dogs and soda pop, saying, “Come to the discount window.	93.0	102.0
201607	646	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’re open for business,” right?	93.0	102.0
201607	647	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And then everyone said, “Not so much.”	93.0	102.0
201607	648	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the TAF, I think, was, in a way, successful in creating a different structure that somehow removed the stigma.	93.0	102.0
201607	649	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I’m just bringing out the issue that stigma seems to be something about which you can’t just say, “I want there to be no stigma.”	93.0	102.0
201607	650	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	You have to think about where the stigma came from.	93.0	102.0
201607	651	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	102.0
201607	652	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	93.0	65.0
201607	653	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	81.0
201607	654	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I’ll start by also complimenting the staff for their considerable effort and having a wide range of researchers engaged in the project.	93.0	81.0
201607	655	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I found that really useful.	93.0	81.0
201607	656	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	These memos provide a lot of useful material, particularly the money market field research.	93.0	81.0
201607	657	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I think no matter what we do, the research that’s being done on this is going to be of lasting value for the System.	93.0	81.0
201607	658	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	A little side comment on “stigma” before we go on—I agree very much with President Williams’s observations that it’s an outcome.	93.0	81.0
201607	659	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	If you think about wholly private market transactions, they also are subject to exactly the same thing, that if it’s revealed that Party A borrows at Rate X, that’s going to convey some information about the situation of Party A.	93.0	81.0
201607	660	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We had Citigroup paying exorbitant amounts to raise additional capital in 2008, and that reveals something to the markets about just how dire the situation was at Citi, and I think that’s unavoidable.	93.0	81.0
201607	661	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	It’s part of the market outcome.	93.0	81.0
201607	662	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And the lesson that yields for me is that we are going to have to accommodate ourselves to some amount of stigma.	93.0	81.0
201607	663	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I approached this general subject of the long-range framework with a leaning toward, as I said before, a simple, straightforward floor system, in which the interest rate on reserves is our sole policy instrument.	93.0	81.0
201607	664	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And we supply just enough reserves to satiate the banking system with a fair, high degree of profitability and eschew targeting the federal funds rate or intervening in the RP market.	93.0	81.0
201607	665	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Now, I’m looking forward to the staff’s future work on this, and, as the Vice Chairman implored us, I’m retaining an open mind.	93.0	81.0
201607	666	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	93.0	81.0
201607	667	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I’m open to persuasion.	93.0	81.0
201607	668	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But what I’ve learned so far tilts me toward that preference.	93.0	81.0
201607	669	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Beyond my preference about this, I think that that simple regime is a useful benchmark, and I think the way to approach the analysis of this is to take that and then view any other framework as that plus some stuff.	93.0	81.0
201607	670	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And I’ll get back to this.	93.0	81.0
201607	671	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	At a broad level, what I take away from this is that there are a wide range of considerations in money markets that affect market outcomes—the observed trading volumes and prices for various money market instruments.	93.0	81.0
201607	672	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	The memos do a good job of documenting the array of regulatory factors.	93.0	81.0
201607	673	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I thought that was really useful, sort of a missing element in the overnight RRP discussions we had.	93.0	81.0
201607	674	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I think we had a sense that they were broad and pervasive and complicated, and I think that’s the picture that emerges.	93.0	81.0
201607	675	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In addition, I was struck by the extent to which relationship considerations seem to affect many money market transactions, and I’m not sure I suspected they’d be as pervasive as they are.	93.0	81.0
201607	676	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Apparently, there are some money market funding deals that are bundled together with other financial transactions and occur between parties that establish a relationship and continue it for some time.	93.0	81.0
201607	677	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So there must be some economies of scope across financial transactions or maybe some fixed costs associated with establishing a relationship.	93.0	81.0
201607	678	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Well, in those cases, the observed transactions don’t represent arm’s-length Walrasian spot trades that are popular in our models, so it’s not obvious to me what it means to target a rate in a market governed by sort of relationship trades like that or whether it’s advisable.	93.0	81.0
201607	679	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I was also struck by the importance of counterparty credit risk.	93.0	81.0
201607	680	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In some markets, sometimes credit risk premiums are negligible or relatively stable outside of crisis periods, but some premiums arguably have been quite relevant to the federal funds market because there’s always been a noticeable dispersion of observed transaction rates.	93.0	81.0
201607	681	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	To me, this makes it tricky to think about targeting something like the average interest rate on federal funds when so many of the transactions build in some tiering or differential, what you’d interpret as credit risk premiums.	93.0	81.0
201607	682	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	When counterparty credit risk premiums rise across a broad range of counterparties in that market, which arguably happened in August 2007, then you’d expect the credit risk premiums to rise, right?	93.0	81.0
201607	683	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And if risk-free rates don’t change, then the funds rate will rise.	93.0	81.0
201607	684	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	If we target the funds rate, if we feel as if we have to hold that constant, then we in essence have to lower what’s essentially the risk-free rate.	93.0	81.0
201607	685	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Now, we often do find it appropriate to cut our policy rate at times when credit risk premiums go up, but it’s not obvious that should be automatically one-for-one, and that’s sort of what we imposed on the Desk in August 2007.	93.0	81.0
201607	686	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We were sort of cracking the whip, asking them to keep the average funds rate constant.	93.0	81.0
201607	687	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I remember that.	93.0	96.0
201607	688	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	93.0	96.0
201607	689	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Yes, you do.	93.0	81.0
201607	690	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	You were sitting right over there, getting some heat from the Committee about that in September.	93.0	81.0
201607	691	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And yet the situation was that we had these risk premiums rising, and so you had to drive down what was, in essence, the risk-free rate.	93.0	81.0
201607	692	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So if we worked with an administered rate, then risk premiums do what they do and we make an explicit decision about how much to offset that with a move in the risk-free rate.	93.0	81.0
201607	693	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So, for me, as I said, just the welter of factors that affect various spreads and money markets make the simplicity of adopting an administered rate pretty attractive.	93.0	81.0
201607	694	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	They also make me dubious about targeting any particular market rate or aiming our operations at any particular money market beyond this administered rate we have.	93.0	81.0
201607	695	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We have some experience now away from the lower bound.	93.0	81.0
201607	696	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	It seems pretty clear that arbitrage among various parties does make the interest rate on excess reserves an effective anchor for other market rates.	93.0	81.0
201607	697	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I think the interviews with money market participants confirm that.	93.0	81.0
201607	698	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	If we just relied on our administered rate, we’d avoid the dependence on the funds market, which could dwindle to nothing pretty rapidly.	93.0	81.0
201607	699	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We could avoid the cost of overnight RRP operations and sort of footprint concerns we’ve had.	93.0	81.0
201607	700	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	The information in the staff memos suggests those are superfluous to the degree to which IOER is acting as an effective market anchor already.	93.0	81.0
201607	701	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In addition, with a floor system and a large enough balance sheet to satiate reserves, overnight and intraday lending by us would be fairly minimal.	93.0	81.0
201607	702	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Daylight credit use would be fairly minimal, another advantage I think we need to count.	93.0	81.0
201607	703	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Now, as I said, I prefer that regime, but I’ll just say that I think if the staff brings back a recommendation for anything else, I think the burden of proof should be on demonstrating that going beyond that simple regime has some benefits.	93.0	81.0
201607	704	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Another way to put that as a question for the staff would be:  What would be wrong with that regime?	93.0	81.0
201607	705	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	If we had money market rates configured the way they are, with us just running a simple IOER-based administered rate system, what would be wrong with the funds rate trading we’d see?	93.0	81.0
201607	706	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	What would be wrong with the RP rate?	93.0	81.0
201607	707	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	What would be wrong with money market rates that we’d need to correct by going in and targeting some other rate?	93.0	81.0
201607	708	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And I guess that’s the way to think about it.	93.0	81.0
201607	709	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	There’s one wrinkle that detracts from a simple IOER-based administered rate regime that springs to mind.	93.0	81.0
201607	710	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	The Congress gave the power to set the interest rate on excess reserves to the Board of Governors and not to the FOMC—in hindsight, arguably, a blunder.	93.0	81.0
201607	711	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	93.0	81.0
201607	712	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	It might not be the first by the Congress, but—so I’m okay for now with setting the target rate at the funds rate as an interim arrangement until we can get the Congress to fix the legislation.	93.0	81.0
201607	713	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But in response to President Williams’s point:  I think we shouldn’t be shy about deciding we’re going to seek some changes.	93.0	81.0
201607	714	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In the meantime, this is sort of a messy aspect of the current framework because we really don’t care about the funds market per se, which is the point our Vice Chairman made.	93.0	81.0
201607	715	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But having an announced target for the funds rate kind of makes it seem like we do, and it’s an awkward aspect to the current regime, as I see it.	93.0	81.0
201607	716	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So in their analysis of alternative frameworks, I’d urge the staff to be candid about governance questions as they bring back their work to us.	93.0	81.0
201607	717	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Let me talk about “liquidity programs,” as they’re called.	93.0	81.0
201607	718	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	One memo asks whether the framework should be designed to mitigate the tension between interest rate control and liquidity provision objectives.	93.0	81.0
201607	719	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	As I highlighted in response to President Bullard, in a simple floor system relying on just the interest rate on reserves, there is no tension between our monetary policy framework and liquidity programs.	93.0	81.0
201607	720	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In fact, one of our former Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia colleagues used to oppose floor systems for exactly this reason, because they facilitated credit-market interventions.	93.0	81.0
201607	721	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In case you were wondering, I can assure you that the ease of undertaking credit-market interventions is not the reason I prefer a simple floor system.	93.0	81.0
201607	723	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	This obviously isn’t the time to debate the merits of the various ways we intervened in credit markets during the crisis, but if the staff believes that there is a tension or a tradeoff between the ability to undertake liquidity programs and a monetary policy framework that they’d recommend, they’re going to have to come to us with some sense of the economic benefits and costs of such credit programs, and they haven’t done this in the materials they provide.	93.0	81.0
201607	724	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In fact, the memo on lessons from the crisis simply takes as an unquestioned premise that various credit market interventions were necessary.	93.0	81.0
201607	725	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	They’re referred to as things we had to do in this situation.	93.0	81.0
201607	726	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	This is consistent with some popular narratives that emphasize the inherent dysfunctionality in financial markets, but, as David Altig noted at the beginning of his remarks, scholars differ on the interpretation of the events of the crisis.	93.0	81.0
201607	727	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I’m not aware of any economic analysis comparing this popular narrative with alternatives, including ones that emphasize the extent to which volatility and distress in financial markets in that period were induced by the moral hazard effects of the perceived Federal Reserve stance toward credit provisions, particularly following the August 2007 actions that President Williams so vividly described.	93.0	81.0
201607	728	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We haven’t conducted such an evaluation internally, and I’m not aware of any credible external assessment.	93.0	81.0
201607	729	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And without such a comparative assessment, I think the necessity of the sequence of credit market interventions we undertook in the crisis is far from obvious.	93.0	81.0
201607	730	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So if the staff believes that the merits of liquidity program capability should be taken into account in monetary framework design, it would seem essential that they take the time to conduct an after-action assessment of our policy choices before, during, and after the crisis, even if that means putting the next phase of the work on the long-run framework on hold.	93.0	81.0
201607	731	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In my view, this type of assessment is long overdue.	93.0	81.0
201607	732	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	81.0
201607	733	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	734	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	93.0	65.0
201607	735	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	999.0
201607	736	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Let me start by also adding my sincere thanks to the Federal Reserve System staff for their leadership, insights, and sheer hard work on the implementation framework project.	93.0	999.0
201607	737	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I view the design of the project as focusing on the longer-run framework first, and then, presumably, we’ll consider the appropriate transition path to that framework.	93.0	999.0
201607	738	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Also, as Governor Fischer suggested, we’ll need to really think about how we address times that are not normal, or crisis periods.	93.0	999.0
201607	739	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	We’re going to have this further Committee discussion focusing on framework specifics in November, so I thought today I would just provide four questions I think the Committee participants will need to consider in evaluating specifics.	93.0	999.0
201607	740	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	First, how much volatility are we comfortable in tolerating for the policy instrument we’re targeting in normal times and then in times of stress?	93.0	999.0
201607	741	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Presumably, this is going to be one of the considerations in our preference for choosing an administered rate versus a market rate.	93.0	999.0
201607	742	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	And if the choice is a market rate, which market rate?	93.0	999.0
201607	743	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	President Lacker, I take your discussion as very interesting about the administered rate avoiding some of the problems.	93.0	999.0
201607	744	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	But, presumably, it’s the correlation between that rate and other market rates that is going to matter for what we’re doing.	93.0	999.0
201607	745	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I think we still have to understand how the money markets are going to be affected by our choices.	93.0	999.0
201607	746	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I think our control of some interest rates may be different from the way it was in the past because of the structural and regulatory changes that occurred since the crisis, and I think the memos lay out some of those changes quite well.	93.0	999.0
201607	747	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The bottom line is, I think we have to be focused on:  How much does our control of certain interest rates imply for macro and financial stability?	93.0	999.0
201607	748	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I think that’s something that we need to think about.	93.0	999.0
201607	749	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In crisis times, we may be willing to allow for more volatility, but what about periods when we don’t necessarily realize we’re at the beginning of a crisis?	93.0	999.0
201607	750	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I guess I view the case of 2007 and early 2008 as one in which it wasn’t necessarily clear at the time that the situation would develop into the crisis proportions that we saw ex post.	93.0	999.0
201607	751	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	A lot of this is in hindsight.	93.0	999.0
201607	752	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	But when you’re actually in the moment, I think those tradeoffs between control and liquidity provision loomed large, but we didn’t necessarily know how things would turn out.	93.0	999.0
201607	753	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Second, how should the governance issues and political economy issues be resolved?	93.0	999.0
201607	754	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	And a couple of the commenters have mentioned these.	93.0	999.0
201607	755	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The interest rate on excess reserves is set by the Board of Governors.	93.0	999.0
201607	756	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Monetary policy decisions lie with the FOMC.	93.0	999.0
201607	757	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	So far, in the post-crisis world, we’ve resolved this tension by still using the federal funds rate as our way of communicating about monetary policy.	93.0	999.0
201607	758	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	If we communicate with a market rate, presumably this helps resolve the issue.	93.0	999.0
201607	759	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The ON RRP rate also resolves the issue, because it’s an FOMC decision.	93.0	999.0
201607	760	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I think these kinds of issues also affect the size of the balance sheet we want to operate with.	93.0	999.0
201607	761	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	It does have implications for our relationship with the fiscal authority and perhaps a relationship of rates, like the ON RRP versus the IOER has “appearance” complications if we are going to be paying banks.	93.0	999.0
201607	762	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I think we have to take those kinds of political economy and governance issues head on, and they should factor into our decisions about the long-run framework.	93.0	999.0
201607	763	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Third, what’s our preference about the tradeoff between a framework that is complex enough to handle many possible contingencies versus one that’s similar and presumably less costly that works well in normal times but would need to be augmented in unusual times?	93.0	999.0
201607	764	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	This is related to but somewhat different, I think, from the staff memo’s definition of robust and flexible frameworks.	93.0	999.0
201607	765	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The staff defines a robust framework as one that can provide sufficient liquidity outside of the US banking system at times of market stress, and a flexible framework is one that can be adapted to handle evolving market conditions.	93.0	999.0
201607	766	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I have to say, my own preference is for a simpler framework that can be augmented with supplemental tools in times of crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	767	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	But this simpler framework would need to have aspects of both robustness and flexibility.	93.0	999.0
201607	768	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In other words, the simpler framework is not likely to be the same one we used before the crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	769	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In particular, because of the possibility that the equilibrium interest rate will remain lower than it was before the crisis and the probability of returning to the effective lower bound on the policy rate, which has probably increased, we should have a standard approach to providing more accommodation once the effective lower bound has been reached.	93.0	999.0
201607	770	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	And I do think we’re going to have to deal with the changes that occurred in money markets, although I understand that our choice of framework then could feed back on some of those changes.	93.0	999.0
201607	771	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	So I think we need to really understand some of those issues, and the memo has pointed out quite well the kinds of issues we need to be thinking about.	93.0	999.0
201607	772	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I think that the Desk has undertaken a useful step in expanding counterparties, but expanding the types of institutions to which we routinely provide liquidity directly could have its own effect on the evolution of financial market structure, as pointed out by Vice Chairman Dudley.	93.0	999.0
201607	773	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	It could raise moral hazard problems, and we need to understand those better.	93.0	999.0
201607	774	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	And, of course, we’re going to also have to think about operational readiness.	93.0	999.0
201607	775	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Presumably, even if we decide that our standard framework isn’t going to include a lot of these liquidity facilities or credit facilities or what have you, we’re going to have to maintain expertise in that.	93.0	999.0
201607	776	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	So I would welcome further discussion on the tradeoff between simpler versus complex frameworks.	93.0	999.0
201607	777	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Finally, fourth, which framework design can best maintain the Federal Reserve’s long- standing desire to avoid allocating credit to particular market segments and displacing private- sector financial markets?	93.0	999.0
201607	778	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Maybe I’m channeling my former colleague from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, that an operating framework that puts no limit on the size of the balance sheet might make the Federal Reserve more vulnerable to political pressures that at times would be exerted to get the Federal Reserve to use the balance sheet to support certain markets.	93.0	999.0
201607	779	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	And it also might lead to more structural changes in the financial markets that we are going to have to think about deeply as part of the discussion.	93.0	999.0
201607	780	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	There are lot of interrelated considerations.	93.0	999.0
201607	781	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I look forward to our discussion in November, and let me, once again, thank the staffs of the Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors for their efforts.	93.0	999.0
201607	782	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	999.0
201607	783	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	784	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	93.0	65.0
201607	785	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	90.0
201607	786	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I, too, would like to thank the staff for the thought-provoking memos on a long-run framework.	93.0	90.0
201607	787	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would say the comments that have already been made around the table were more wide ranging than I was expecting, and that’s a very positive attribute.	93.0	90.0
201607	788	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I want to consider several assumptions that I believe are important in considering the long-run framework.	93.0	90.0
201607	789	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The first is whether periods when the federal funds rate reaches its lower bound because of significant slack in the economy will be anomalous or a more common feature of a low inflation environment.	93.0	90.0
201607	790	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	My view is that, as long as we have a low inflation target and a low equilibrium real interest rate, a funds rate at or near its bound will become a regular feature of business cycles.	93.0	90.0
201607	791	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This conclusion echoes comments by President Williams.	93.0	90.0
201607	792	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It’s been seven years since the end of the recession, and we have raised rates only once.	93.0	90.0
201607	793	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Moreover, we have yet to shrink our balance sheet.	93.0	90.0
201607	794	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because few recoveries last a decade, it is quite likely that when the next recession occurs, we will still have a large balance sheet and limited room to reduce the federal funds rate before reaching its lower bound.	93.0	90.0
201607	795	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	One way to reduce the frequency with which we hit the effective lower bound would be to raise the inflation target.	93.0	90.0
201607	796	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	At the time that we set a 2 percent target, few of us would have predicted how many advanced economies would be facing long spells of negative rates, large balance sheets, and inflation rates below target.	93.0	90.0
201607	797	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	We should have a thorough discussion of the long-run implications of central banks around the world setting inflation targets that may result in the policy rate too often pinned at its lower bound.	93.0	90.0
201607	798	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I hope we have such an open discussion at the end of the year and that we revisit the inflation goal on a regular basis—perhaps every five years, as the Bank of Canada does.	93.0	90.0
201607	799	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If it seems likely we choose to maintain a 2 percent inflation target, then we should choose a long-run framework that anticipates the federal funds rate regularly hitting its bound during recessions and allows us to respond flexibly in a manner that best achieves our dual-mandate goals.	93.0	90.0
201607	800	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If the funds rate regularly hits zero during future recessions, my second concern is whether we will augment conventional policy with quantitative easing or with negative interest rates.	93.0	90.0
201607	801	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would prefer expanding the balance sheet and possibly the composition of the balance sheet before resorting to negative interest rates.	93.0	90.0
201607	802	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The early assessment of the costs and efficacy of negative interest rates is quite mixed.	93.0	90.0
201607	803	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Most central banks that have gone negative have taken actions to help insulate banks from some of the collateral effects from that policy.	93.0	90.0
201607	804	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In light of the concern about bailouts of banks in the United States, it’s unlikely that policies that insulate banks will be politically feasible in the United States.	93.0	90.0
201607	805	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think it would be useful to have a fuller discussion of negative interest rates and whether it’s likely to be employed as a policy response to future recessions.	93.0	90.0
201607	806	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Given our reluctance to raise the inflation target, expanded balance sheets are likely to be a regular feature of recessions.	93.0	90.0
201607	807	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, any policy we adopt should flexibly incorporate the need to expand the balance sheet and to change both the duration and composition of holdings.	93.0	90.0
201607	808	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I agree with President Williams that we should consider asking for a broader set of assets that can be held, along lines similar to the practice of other central banks.	93.0	90.0
201607	809	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If an expanded balance sheet is a regular feature of future policy, we may want to expand our thinking on how we use our balance sheet.	93.0	90.0
201607	810	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	For example, if we decide that supervisory policies are unlikely to be effective for addressing bubbles in real estate, we may want to more actively consider whether to use our balance sheet to address such situations.	93.0	90.0
201607	811	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In the face of rising real estate leverage and prices, we might choose to raise rates in this sector by shortening the duration of our holdings and selling some of our MBS.	93.0	90.0
201607	812	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Of course, for this financial stability tool to be possible, we would need to hold long-duration assets and MBS.	93.0	90.0
201607	813	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, I would not assume that in the future we will have a small balance sheet that is limited to short-duration Treasury securities.	93.0	90.0
201607	814	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Many of us now assume that the equilibrium federal funds rate will be around 3 percent.	93.0	90.0
201607	815	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Historically, we have reduced interest rates more than 3 percentage points in response to most recessions.	93.0	90.0
201607	816	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Of course, in those instances, we did not hit the effective lower bound because inflation and the real equilibrium rate were higher.	93.0	90.0
201607	817	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	But, for the future, we should assume that we will likely hit the effective lower bound, that we will resort to some balance sheet expansion, and, thus, we will need to control short-term interest rates for the foreseeable future and during most recessions.	93.0	90.0
201607	818	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I, somewhat surprisingly, agree with President Lacker on one issue.	93.0	90.0
201607	819	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would prefer to focus on the IOER, an administered rate, but I also agree that that rate should be an FOMC decision.	93.0	90.0
201607	820	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Finally, the staff should continue to explore how to be flexible in a situation of a changing structure of our financial system.	93.0	90.0
201607	821	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In particular, the platforms of both political parties are calling for readopting Glass-Steagall restrictions.	93.0	90.0
201607	822	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If that were to occur, we would once again have large standalone broker-dealers that would likely be viewed as SIFIs regulated by the Federal Reserve.	93.0	90.0
201607	823	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Having large standalone broker-dealers implies a greater likelihood of runs on them and calls into question whether the financing system can remain as dependent on repurchase agreements.	93.0	90.0
201607	824	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Second, we are requiring financial institutions to be more liquid, and justifiably so.	93.0	90.0
201607	825	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, there are limited quantities of high-quality liquid assets.	93.0	90.0
201607	826	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Better understanding how our supervisory actions, in trying to increase liquidity in financial institutions, affect demand for short-term money market instruments would be useful.	93.0	90.0
201607	827	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Third, broker-dealers tend to be highly sensitive to economic conditions.	93.0	90.0
201607	828	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Many of the European banks with large broker-dealers operate in the United States and remain troubled to this day.	93.0	90.0
201607	829	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The continued dependence on broker-dealers as counterparties raises the issue of whether the discount window should be available to them to address liquidity issues or whether a more substantive change in their funding model is in order.	93.0	90.0
201607	830	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Fourth, the money market fund industry continues to evolve.	93.0	90.0
201607	831	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This has implications for financial institutions’ ready access to market for short-term liabilities.	93.0	90.0
201607	832	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	With the incentives to shift to government-only funds, the demand for high-quality liquid assets will increase further.	93.0	90.0
201607	833	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The issues raised by the staff were very useful.	93.0	90.0
201607	834	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, I would like to see us and the staff spend more time discussing some of these key issues.	93.0	90.0
201607	835	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	836	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	93.0	65.0
201607	837	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	110.0
201607	838	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you to the team around the System that worked on this project.	93.0	110.0
201607	839	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Let me just make a couple of comments that struck me after reading through the papers, understanding these are early days.	93.0	110.0
201607	840	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Regulatory reform, I think, has certainly reduced the probability of financial crises and limited their potential severity.	93.0	110.0
201607	841	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	However, it also probably has reduced incentives for arbitrage in money markets and may introduce some frictions that make money markets work less smoothly, therefore possibly increasing the need for liquidity actions by the Federal Reserve.	93.0	110.0
201607	842	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	A combination of on-the-shelf liquidity facilities and the ON RRP may be needed to ensure future money market functionality and interest rate control in a potential future crisis.	93.0	110.0
201607	843	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So far, the ON RRP facility has helped limit shortfalls and volatility in money markets, and the risk that it might have exacerbated flights to quality really has not materialized.	93.0	110.0
201607	844	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	For example, we didn’t see it in January and February of this year, and we haven’t seen it following the Brexit vote.	93.0	110.0
201607	845	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Nevertheless, because crises can hit at unexpected times and in unexpected ways—and, by definition, are surprises that you don’t expect—I do feel strongly that we should do more work on having on-the-shelf liquidity facilities that could help limit the severity of market stress episodes and help address one potential downside of an ON RRP facility.	93.0	110.0
201607	846	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In my view, in that crisis it may well be necessary to assist, in particular, the money market industry, dealers, and nonbank financials.	93.0	110.0
201607	847	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	On slide 13 of the briefing materials, the points 2 and 3 that you made are, to me, a couple of the reasons why I would like to have on-the-shelf facilities.	93.0	110.0
201607	848	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Number one, I think if there’s clarity about the purpose of such operations, it does reduce stigma.	93.0	110.0
201607	849	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And, in particular, it’s important to emphasize that this is about the provision of liquidity versus emergency lending to individual firms.	93.0	110.0
201607	850	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I believe that if our communications are well prepared and explain what those facilities are designed for, we won’t eliminate stigma but should help reduce it.	93.0	110.0
201607	851	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Also, your point about clarity on when liquidity insurance operations would be used—to limit contagion during stress events—is a very key one and is another reason to have on-the-shelf facilities.	93.0	110.0
201607	852	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I would add two other reasons for having on-the-shelf facilities.	93.0	110.0
201607	853	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	One, it allows you to move quickly, and, two, when you are in a crisis is not the time to be thinking through and making up provisions and mechanisms to deal with the situation.	93.0	110.0
201607	854	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	That is, I’d rather we did this in advance in the cold light of day rather than on the run.	93.0	110.0
201607	855	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And I think we have the opportunity to do that, so I would encourage you to do more work on this.	93.0	110.0
201607	856	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I understand the risk that it may appear to create or induce an overreliance on the Fed, and there are some political sensitivities associated with that.	93.0	110.0
201607	857	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But this work is very, very important, and I think history has shown that we ought to have these facilities in place with our communication well established in advance.	93.0	110.0
201607	858	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So I encourage you to do more work on this.	93.0	110.0
201607	859	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	93.0	110.0
201607	860	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	93.0	65.0
201607	861	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	93.0	65.0
201607	862	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	91.0
201607	863	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I’d like to thank all of the contributors to the long-run framework working groups who presented here today.	93.0	91.0
201607	864	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	The first installment has been an impressive effort, and I learned a lot from reading the memos and discussing them with my staff.	93.0	91.0
201607	865	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	The presentations clearly point to a number of tradeoffs that will be associated with choosing among alternative implementation structures.	93.0	91.0
201607	866	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Before I forget, I agree with the comments that President Williams and President Rosengren made, that the implications of the probability of hitting the effective lower bound should be considered within the context of our long-run framework discussions.	93.0	91.0
201607	867	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I think it is certainly the case that the choice of our inflation objective is part of that, in terms of how low interest rates will be during normal times and how much capacity we have to lower rates when we need to do so.	93.0	91.0
201607	868	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I’d like to say at this point that I remain open minded, no matter what I say after this.	93.0	91.0
201607	869	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	93.0	91.0
201607	870	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I am not strongly wed to many prior views on the long-run framework, and it’s simply useful for each of us to push, in our own way, harder on all of the framework presentations.	93.0	91.0
201607	871	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	So, in that spirit, I will continue.	93.0	91.0
201607	872	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I’m not sure this isn’t just nostalgia for the old days, but I do confess some sympathies for returning to our pre-crisis framework with a small balance sheet, or at least a smaller balance sheet than we have.	93.0	91.0
201607	873	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	At least during normal times, it served us well and in ways that we probably still don’t fully appreciate, at least I think when it comes to minimizing political risks that we previously never considered.	93.0	91.0
201607	874	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	A fundamental question for me is this:  Do the changes in financial markets that we have experienced over the past several years make it clearly undesirable to return to the “old world”?	93.0	91.0
201607	875	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I’ll describe it that way.	93.0	91.0
201607	876	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I appreciate that there are numerous details that complicate this return to a more conservative, old-style monetary approach.	93.0	91.0
201607	877	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	For example, we will have to determine if changes in regulation and business practices have had a lasting and unalterable effect on reserve demand and overnight funding markets in general.	93.0	91.0
201607	878	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	And, in turn, there are many interactions and interdependencies involved in analyzing this and other important questions.	93.0	91.0
201607	879	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I’m looking forward to hearing more about the strengths and weaknesses across alternative frameworks, both during normal times and during periods of stress.	93.0	91.0
201607	880	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Our ability to achieve our set of macroeconomic outcomes is the most important piece of this decision tree, it seems to me.	93.0	91.0
201607	881	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Maybe it’s the easiest.	93.0	91.0
201607	882	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	The social benefits of reducing deadweight losses in some markets might be more uncertain and controversial with respect to possible unexpected outcomes that I just can’t lay out today, because I don’t know that we know them.	93.0	91.0
201607	883	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Again, here is that caveat.	93.0	91.0
201607	884	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I remain open minded, but I am wondering about the following risk.	93.0	91.0
201607	885	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	It’s not just the economics that are difficult.	93.0	91.0
201607	886	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	The decisions that we make about the implementation framework will be scrutinized from a political economy perspective as well, and I think President Mester touched on a number of these issues.	93.0	91.0
201607	887	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Inevitably, we will need to consider the possibility that not all of our tools will be available in the future.	93.0	91.0
201607	888	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Madam Chair, you mentioned that there are already “optics” concerns related to the IOER rate being above a market rate.	93.0	91.0
201607	889	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	The Congress has wondered whether that is something of a subsidy to certain financial institutions.	93.0	91.0
201607	890	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	For example, large IOER payments to banks may not always be seen as “living the Friedman rule” and reducing regulatory reserve burdens.	93.0	91.0
201607	891	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I worry about the possibility that, when rates increase and get closer to neutral, when we finally do normalize, if we still have a large balance sheet, the size of IOER payments going out to banks may become a political lightning rod.	93.0	91.0
201607	892	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Should we select a best framework or most robust framework, subject to achieving a number of objectives that we specify?	93.0	91.0
201607	893	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I look forward to hearing more about this.	93.0	91.0
201607	894	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Our previous small-balance-sheet approach may seem 20th century, “old school,” and opaque.	93.0	91.0
201607	895	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	But I wonder if those tools and authorities might be more robust to changes in political winds.	93.0	91.0
201607	896	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I’m just wondering.	93.0	91.0
201607	897	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I appreciate the long-run framework project’s commitment to a broad, open, and robust process that considers the issues from many vantage points.	93.0	91.0
201607	898	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	It will help us understand important tradeoffs and move us toward adopting an implementation framework that will serve the institution well in years to come.	93.0	91.0
201607	899	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I expect to learn more, and I remain open minded about selecting the best appropriate framework for the years ahead.	93.0	91.0
201607	900	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	91.0
201607	901	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	902	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	93.0	65.0
201607	903	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	88.0
201607	904	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I, too, would like to add my thanks to the workgroups’ very thorough work products for today’s discussion.	93.0	88.0
201607	905	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	While I think the framework in place today seems to be working well for monetary control purposes, I do support this effort devoting time and resources to thinking ahead, exploring options, and, importantly, anticipating various states of the world in which the Committee might be making policy.	93.0	88.0
201607	906	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I do think we have time to do this exercise in a very deliberate way.	93.0	88.0
201607	907	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I don’t have a lean yet.	93.0	88.0
201607	908	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m processing the information in the memos at a somewhat more basic point of consideration.	93.0	88.0
201607	909	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I found the three memos helpful in teasing out what seemed to me to be the first-order pertinent questions.	93.0	88.0
201607	910	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Some of my questions may suggest further work and attention, so here’s what’s on my mind, informed by the memos.	93.0	88.0
201607	911	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Realistically, can we get back to a corridor system and preserve the federal funds rate as a centerpiece of policy setting?	93.0	88.0
201607	912	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Will reserves be scarce or plentiful down the road?	93.0	88.0
201607	913	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	If we take as a given the fact that depository institutions will want to hold a higher level of reserves, will their target level reserves vary with changing conditions?	93.0	88.0
201607	914	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	And, if so, how?	93.0	88.0
201607	915	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Will the expanded number of counterparties that we now have be a permanent aspect of the operating framework?	93.0	88.0
201607	916	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	And if we were to go further, what classes of institutions would we want to include?	93.0	88.0
201607	917	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	What are the benefits and negatives of expanding the range of collateral instruments?	93.0	88.0
201607	918	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	If we want to preserve a market rate as the policy rate, how viable is the federal funds rate as a policy instrument?	93.0	88.0
201607	919	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Are the overnight interbank funding rate, which is an unsecured instrument, and/or the GC repo rate, a secured instrument, workable alternatives as a market rate?	93.0	88.0
201607	920	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	And do these rates require expanding the number of counterparties?	93.0	88.0
201607	921	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	More generally, what distinguishes one money market rate from another as a potential policy rate?	93.0	88.0
201607	922	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding arbitrage behavior, what can be assumed to be reliable on an ongoing basis?	93.0	88.0
201607	923	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I’d like to understand better what incentives and disincentives are associated with regulation as they affect arbitrage opportunities.	93.0	88.0
201607	924	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	And, finally, a broader question is suggested by commentary that comes on pages 9 and 10 of the memo “Lessons from the Crisis”	93.0	88.0
201607	925	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	: What conclusions can we draw regarding the features of the US environment that will shape implementation practices?	93.0	88.0
201607	926	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I think we might gain from an attempt to work back from the environment or the context of policy to the operating framework options and choices.	93.0	88.0
201607	927	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We tend to think of environment features in terms of the structure of money markets and the regulatory picture.	93.0	88.0
201607	928	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	As others have raised, including President Evans just before me, I’ll suggest that we might also think about the political support for operating in different ways.	93.0	88.0
201607	929	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	As I see it, there is likely to be political pressure on the IOER rate as an instrument.	93.0	88.0
201607	930	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I’d like also to suggest that, as we move this exercise forward, thought be given at some point to the requirements of transition from the current regime to another and to the communications challenges involved.	93.0	88.0
201607	931	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Finally, while these were prepared in advance, I will freelance for just one moment, perhaps responding to Governor Fischer and something that President Williams said, about our regime that will probably work in normal times, with many different versions of it.	93.0	88.0
201607	932	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	But I think the times also call for perhaps thinking well outside the box.	93.0	88.0
201607	933	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	So to borrow from a different discipline—maybe a little bit of a “Herman Kahn” approach to thinking about the unthinkable— we’re in an era in which it’s not unthinkable that a terrorist act or cyberwarfare could severely affect the operating environment of the Federal Reserve.	93.0	88.0
201607	934	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	So I would encourage some work on thinking about scenarios that are really extreme and how we would respond to those scenarios.	93.0	88.0
201607	935	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	88.0
201607	936	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	937	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	93.0	65.0
201607	938	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	97.0
201607	939	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I’m going to begin with a procedural point, which picks up on some of the things John said earlier.	93.0	97.0
201607	940	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think we have to find a way to explore a variety of ideas here, some of which may be pretty innovative and some of which may be pretty far reaching, without committing anybody ex ante to any particular direction.	93.0	97.0
201607	941	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think it is hard to do that in this room because discussions here have a tendency to either acquire a certain direction or acquire a certain oppositional quality whereby it seems as though something is being debated.	93.0	97.0
201607	942	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, like President Williams, I see neither the need nor the desirability of rushing to some sort of answer.	93.0	97.0
201607	943	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think that we’re going to need to figure out a way to have an exploration of both a lot of the substantive issues people have raised as well as a blue-skying of ideas that takes place outside this room but in a way that is accessible to people in the room who are currently in the room and who may be able to participate.	93.0	97.0
201607	944	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	This can happen through the Jackson Hole symposium and other conferences.	93.0	97.0
201607	945	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	It might be able to happen informally.	93.0	97.0
201607	946	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But I do think that’s important, because we don’t want to force the staff to either come back only with incremental ideas because they feel it’s not their place to change things fundamentally or to force them to come back with something that’s quite far-reaching, and then for us to say, “Who are you guys to be coming to us with something far reaching like this?”	93.0	97.0
201607	947	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	So some sort of iterative process in between, I think, is actually important.	93.0	97.0
201607	948	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Let me now just identify, as a number of other people have, some of the issues that I think are particularly useful, interesting, or important, or all three, to pursue during this process.	93.0	97.0
201607	949	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	At the very top of that list I will echo Presidents Evans, Rosengren, and Williams in saying that how to think about accommodation in a low-for-long environment is, I think, essential to this exercise, and if it doesn’t address that question, it probably hasn’t succeeded.	93.0	97.0
201607	950	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Other things I’m going to mention now I think are important, but without that first element, it’s a little hard to see why we would have gone through the whole thing to being with.	93.0	97.0
201607	951	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Next, I would say, how to adjust monetary policy to the better regulation of financial institutions and activities that have been put in place since the crisis is actually very important.	93.0	97.0
201607	952	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And in this respect, I would recommend—I know the staff knows about it, because they’ve read it—to the Committee generally a paper on monetary policy and regulation put out, I think, Vice Chairman Dudley, was it a year ago May, by the Committee on the Global Financial System?	93.0	97.0
201607	953	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes.	93.0	96.0
201607	954	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think it was put out in May 2015.	93.0	97.0
201607	955	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Is that when it was?	93.0	97.0
201607	956	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Yes, last year—“Regulatory Change and Monetary Policy,” paper number 54.	93.0	999.0
201607	957	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Yes.	93.0	97.0
201607	958	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	It was, I thought, a very nuanced assessment of how the necessary changes in regulation will need to be accommodated by monetary policies throughout the world, and it was done principally by people from the monetary policy side of shops.	93.0	97.0
201607	959	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	It wasn’t done by regulators, which I think is one of the things that made it useful.	93.0	97.0
201607	960	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Now, we were lucky that our participant was someone from the Division of Monetary Affairs, but someone who knew a lot about regulation, and I think other central banks were able to do the same, which is why it has a nuanced feel to it.	93.0	97.0
201607	961	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	In that regard, I would note that the maximum lubrication of the policy transmission system that monetary policy people sometimes talk about as desirable is actually, if not quite the same thing, very close to the same thing as the massive amounts of short-term wholesale funding that support unexamined credit positions and runs at the first real signs of trouble.	93.0	97.0
201607	962	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	That’s why the regulation and monetary policy decisions need to be thought of at the same time.	93.0	97.0
201607	963	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	You can’t just think, “Well, we want maximum transmission so that we can get monetary policy through in these very liquid markets” without realizing that it’s those very liquid markets that freeze up when things start to go awry, which leads me to the concept of “liquidity insurance.”	93.0	97.0
201607	964	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I know that is not a term coined by the staff, but it is a pregnant term, which immediately elicited in me the question, “And who exactly is paying the premiums for that liquidity insurance?”	93.0	97.0
201607	965	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And the answer, of course, is not really anybody in some of the countries that the staff was referring to, except insofar as you accept the proposition that being part of a regulatory system is in and of itself a premium, a case pretty hard to make on the basis of the existing state of the financial system.	93.0	97.0
201607	966	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I would note in this regard that the United Kingdom and Switzerland, the two countries correctly cited as having some of the more fulsome liquidity facilities, are also two of the jurisdictions that have what we might term “unusually large” financial systems, given their GDPs.	93.0	97.0
201607	967	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I think it’s difficult to avoid the conclusion that it is necessary for the central bank to be a very generous lender of last resort in order to sustain what some might characterize as outsized financial systems.	93.0	97.0
201607	968	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	This leads to some of the questions that Vice Chairman Dudley was suggesting a moment ago as well about our own financial system, which, although it’s not as outsized relative to our GDP as is the case in either the United Kingdom or certainly the old Switzerland, is still pretty outsized in comparison with the rest of the world.	93.0	97.0
201607	969	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And that does get us thinking, as Vice Chairman Dudley said, about the layers of intermediation that take place, but also the kind of things that we want to be backing up, as it were.	93.0	97.0
201607	970	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Now, I actually was a bit bemused by President Lacker’s suggestion that it was moral hazard that created the problems during the crisis.	93.0	97.0
201607	971	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I would very much agree with the proposition that moral hazard in the years preceding the crisis led to the conditions that created all of these runs.	93.0	97.0
201607	972	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Personally, I subscribe to the view that when you’re in the middle of a crisis is not the time to create bulwarks against moral hazard.	93.0	97.0
201607	973	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	That’s what you do when things have calmed down.	93.0	97.0
201607	974	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But that is something that we need to be thinking about.	93.0	97.0
201607	975	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And it’s the reason why I have been more skeptical than a lot of you—although, judging by today, I have more allies than I might have feared, and I’m glad to hear that—about always wanting more powers in the central banks to be able to create liquidity, because there is a time-consistency problem that is created when you have those powers, and that’s why it’s a difficult set of issues.	93.0	97.0
201607	976	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	That pushes me to the existence, size, and use of the balance sheet, which I think is in the first instance an analytic question.	93.0	97.0
201607	977	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	That is, there’s a positive analysis to be done before the normative analysis comes through.	93.0	97.0
201607	978	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I was in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a week ago Friday and had this very interesting experience in which I had breakfast at Harvard University and lunch at MIT.	93.0	97.0
201607	979	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And so at Harvard University, led by Jeremy Stein, as many of you would have guessed, I very much got the demand for safe assets:  “You know, they’re being privately created right now, so the Federal Reserve should think about creating public safe assets” and all the rest—the full dose of that.	93.0	97.0
201607	980	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And then a mere two stops down the Red Line, in Kendall Square, I got the exact opposite view, which is, “It is a very dangerous thing for the central bank to be creating safe assets.	93.0	97.0
201607	981	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Moreover, a lot of the so-called demand for safe assets will actually dissipate.”	93.0	97.0
201607	982	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	If they could meet in Central Square and have the debate, that would be fun to watch.	93.0	97.0
201607	983	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But, analytically, I do think we need to pay attention to that issue because whatever our normative predispositions, if there is, indeed, a substantial exogenous demand for money like our safe assets that is going to be privately created, we have to take that into account not just for regulatory purposes, but also when thinking about the transmission of monetary policy.	93.0	97.0
201607	984	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And if we come to that analytic conclusion, we may or may not decide that we want to do something with the balance sheet, as Jeremy Stein would have us do to create safe assets, but we at least need to take that into account.	93.0	97.0
201607	985	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And then as President Rosengren said—so I won’t repeat it at any length—it’s conceivable that you’d also use the balance sheet for monetary policy purposes, with a sort of twist–reverse twist kind of mechanism.	93.0	97.0
201607	986	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think that’s worth exploring as well.	93.0	97.0
201607	987	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And finally, an issue that I don’t think anyone has mentioned to this point is that I do think it’s worth paying some attention to the unique role of the dollar in the global economy and thinking about how we fashion our monetary policy framework.	93.0	97.0
201607	988	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	It occurred to me in the first instance as I was reading the memo on foreign central bank frameworks.	93.0	97.0
201607	989	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I said, “Wait a second.	93.0	97.0
201607	990	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	This is very interesting, but, man, oh, man, this would not work for us, because you’ve got people holding dollar assets as currency reserves all around the world.”	93.0	97.0
201607	991	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	So I do think it would be worth specifically addressing the question of the degree to which the role of the dollar as the principal global reserve currency both affects us in the effectiveness of monetary policy decisions that we would make—this is back to global savings kinds of issues—and, in turn, affects other people, which has a kind of feedback effect on the performance of the macroeconomy.	93.0	97.0
201607	992	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	97.0
201607	993	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	994	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	93.0	65.0
201607	995	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	111.0
201607	996	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I’ll just make four quick points.	93.0	111.0
201607	997	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	First, let me add my voice to all those who came before in encouraging the staff to do work looking at the effective lower bound.	93.0	111.0
201607	998	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I think that’s paramount, as others have said.	93.0	111.0
201607	999	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I know you were planning to do it anyway, but I think it’s important.	93.0	111.0
201607	1000	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Second, I’m interested in the staff’s view on some of these on-the-shelf or off-the-shelf tools.	93.0	111.0
201607	1001	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	How often would you expect that we would use them?	93.0	111.0
201607	1002	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	To me this goes right to the core of both stigma and moral hazard.	93.0	111.0
201607	1003	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I view stigma and moral hazard as closely linked.	93.0	111.0
201607	1004	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	If we have tools that are used frequently, they’re going to have low stigma and potentially increase moral hazard.	93.0	111.0
201607	1005	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Tools that are used infrequently, the opposite.	93.0	111.0
201607	1006	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Would you envision us using these tools in the ordinary course of events every year, every 10 years, every 100 years?	93.0	111.0
201607	1007	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I’m just interested in getting your perspective on that.	93.0	111.0
201607	1008	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And this is linked to something that Vice Chairman Dudley said, which was, “Would the crisis have been less severe if we had more of these tools ready to go?”	93.0	111.0
201607	1009	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I’m not sure.	93.0	111.0
201607	1010	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	When I think back to my experience during the crisis, when people asked me to reflect on our performance, let’s say, the government entirely—the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, et cetera— the criticism that I offer is that we were always late because, in connection with Loretta’s point, we didn’t know how bad the crisis was, and we were reluctant interveners.	93.0	111.0
201607	1011	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I’ll give you one example.	93.0	111.0
201607	1012	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Just take the TARP, as the most extreme example.	93.0	111.0
201607	1013	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	When the Congress passed the TARP, it was about two weeks to when we announced the capital injections, and about a month later we actually had money going into banks.	93.0	111.0
201607	1014	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	But it had been sitting on the shelf as a concept for eight months until Bernanke and Paulson said, “Now we finally have to go to the Congress.”	93.0	111.0
201607	1015	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So the delay was not the implementation.	93.0	111.0
201607	1016	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The biggest delay was us having the will to say “We need to do this.”	93.0	111.0
201607	1017	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So it affects, for me, how I think about tools on the shelf.	93.0	111.0
201607	1018	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Is it the time to implement the tool or the time to make the decision to use the tool that ultimately is the delay?	93.0	111.0
201607	1019	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And then the last point I’ll make, because I think we should be humble about our ability to forecast the future, is that if we had gone back 20 or 30 years ago and asked the Federal Reserve System to design tools that would have been useful in 2008, there’s no chance they would have come up with the right set of tools that ended up being implemented in 2008 because the markets evolved.	93.0	111.0
201607	1020	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	That tells me that we should err toward simplicity but flexibility to give future participants the tools they need to design tools in the moment, because we’re probably not going to be able to design them right now.	93.0	111.0
201607	1021	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	93.0	111.0
201607	1022	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	1023	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	93.0	65.0
201607	1024	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	104.0
201607	1025	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I want to join others in complimenting the staff on this very interesting set of memos.	93.0	104.0
201607	1026	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	These are tremendously interesting and important questions.	93.0	104.0
201607	1027	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Of course, for those of us who were here, it takes us back to a set of discussions we had in 2013 and 2014, which led up to the adoption of those principles in September 2014, which I’ll come back to in a second.	93.0	104.0
201607	1028	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I think we’re in a different situation now.	93.0	104.0
201607	1029	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The questions we’re asking now really don’t need to be answered.	93.0	104.0
201607	1030	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	It’s a great discussion to have, but I don’t see the wisdom in driving this to conclusions at this point.	93.0	104.0
201607	1031	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I think we have a lot to learn over years to come and reasons to gain from that experience.	93.0	104.0
201607	1032	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The Policy Normalization Principles and Plans were published by the Committee in September 2014, and it’s a reasonably detailed, if not fully worked out, formulation, nor could it have been fully worked out.	93.0	104.0
201607	1033	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I’d say that that framework works pretty well, and, on the basis of the one rate increase we’ve executed so far, we have decent rate control.	93.0	104.0
201607	1034	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	But I do think it’s likely to prove vulnerable over time and not just in times of crisis.	93.0	104.0
201607	1035	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The September 2014 principles were wise enough to conclude with the observation that “the Committee is prepared to adjust the details of its approach to policy normalization in light of economic and financial developments,” and that is one principle that I suggest it would be wise to honor.	93.0	104.0
201607	1036	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The note on foreign experience does show that other central banks have used a range of different frameworks to control policy rates:  floor and corridor systems, targeting secured and unsecured rates using administered rates, as well as market rates.	93.0	104.0
201607	1037	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	So I think we do have plenty of flexibility in choosing our own long-run framework—and should feel free to pick one that is tailored to our own institutional setting and that will work in different conditions, particularly at the effective lower bound, both for administering monetary policy and for providing liquidity.	93.0	104.0
201607	1038	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The arbitrage trade that currently sets the federal funds rate, as we all know, is between the Federal Home Loan Banks and the foreign banks, essentially, and that trade could easily go away—for example, if the Federal Home Loan Banks exit the market like Fannie and Freddie did or if regulation or some other factor makes the trade less profitable for FBOs.	93.0	104.0
201607	1039	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	More broadly, unsecured borrowing between financial institutions is in secular decline.	93.0	104.0
201607	1040	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	So if we were choosing a reference rate to last for a long time, which happens to be exactly what we’re doing on the LIBOR project, the federal funds rate would probably fail the fundamental design criterion of sustainability.	93.0	104.0
201607	1041	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The money market memo points out that there may be a secular increase in reserve demand due to heightened liquidity expectations for banks.	93.0	104.0
201607	1042	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	If that is so, reserves could become scarcer than expected.	93.0	104.0
201607	1043	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I still suspect that scarcity is a very, very long way off.	93.0	104.0
201607	1044	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Also, higher demands for reserves may or may not translate into higher trading volumes in interbank markets.	93.0	104.0
201607	1045	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	And let me add that I don’t see higher trading volumes between banks in federal funds as something that we need to have.	93.0	104.0
201607	1046	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	For these reasons, I have growing doubts, actually, that the best long-run solution will be to return to a corridor system targeting the federal funds rate as set through scarcity trades between banks.	93.0	104.0
201607	1047	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	We’ve really been in a floor system for eight years now.	93.0	104.0
201607	1048	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	It’s, to me, very likely that it will remain so for some years.	93.0	104.0
201607	1049	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	That system has worked.	93.0	104.0
201607	1050	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Markets are now used to it, and it may well be that the better long-run approach will be to continue with a floor system, albeit with a much smaller balance sheet, which can be done if only because markets will have known nothing else for probably well over a decade.	93.0	104.0
201607	1051	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	It may also be appropriate to target a secured rate, as secured borrowing does not appear to be in secular decline, and it involves a much wider set of participants.	93.0	104.0
201607	1052	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The overnight bank funding rate is an unsecured rate that represents a middle ground and captures a broader range of transactions and counterparties, and it’s an improvement over the federal funds rate, but it’s still subject to the secular decline in unsecured interbank borrowing.	93.0	104.0
201607	1053	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I will add that I’m also among the open minded when it comes to deciding whether to choose an administered rate versus a market rate.	93.0	104.0
201607	1054	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Turning to liquidity for a second, the memos show clearly, in my view, that the pre-crisis toolkit did not contemplate, and was not designed to address, the run dynamics that arose during the crisis.	93.0	104.0
201607	1055	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Policymakers improvised, acted on the fly.	93.0	104.0
201607	1056	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	And I believe history will judge those efforts as a success achieved under extremely trying conditions.	93.0	104.0
201607	1057	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	There is an understandable desire to avoid having to live through all of that improvisation again and, in that spirit, to keep some or all of the crisis liquidity programs close at hand and in working order.	93.0	104.0
201607	1058	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	For now, most of the crisis-era liquidity programs have been wound down.	93.0	104.0
201607	1059	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	One could think of them as being unplugged and in dry storage, except for the swap lines with the five other central banks.	93.0	104.0
201607	1060	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The memos ask whether these programs should be active parts of the framework or instead on the shelf.	93.0	104.0
201607	1061	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I feel like I have a lot to learn on that and, again, am open minded.	93.0	104.0
201607	1062	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I guess, for the most part, I lean toward the idea of keeping them off the shelf rather than right at the edge of the game or part of the framework, which might require investing a lot of resources to keep them operational, but there could be exceptions to that.	93.0	104.0
201607	1063	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	In particular, I could imagine a role for the TAF, which would be to provide liquidity to a range of banks in the ordinary course and over time perhaps reduce the stigma associated with the use of the discount window.	93.0	104.0
201607	1064	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I believe we continue to do a good job over time of explaining and defending our traditional lender-of-last-resort role—not so much expanding it but sustaining it—and that role needs to work in the context of financial markets that continue to evolve ever further from the traditional bank-based model.	93.0	104.0
201607	1065	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	A wider set of counterparties would provide a more resilient framework and money market system.	93.0	104.0
201607	1066	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	As the financial crisis gradually recedes into memory, I hope that we’ll find more receptive external audiences for that view.	93.0	104.0
201607	1067	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I do also recognize the tradeoff with moral hazard and look forward to hearing more on that.	93.0	104.0
201607	1068	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	To wrap up, while this exercise is a worthwhile one, there’s no need to make decisions that will be better made several years down the road.	93.0	104.0
201607	1069	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	And there will be a benefit in not making decisions until we see how markets evolve over time—in particular, adapting to the new regulatory regime.	93.0	104.0
201607	1070	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	104.0
201607	1071	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	1072	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	93.0	65.0
201607	1073	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	107.0
201607	1074	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I appreciate the very high-quality and voluminous material [laughter] that the staff is developing to help inform these policy deliberations, and I’m guessing that all of the comments that we’re making today will lead to even more voluminous material.	93.0	107.0
201607	1075	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I think it’s always tempting as policymakers to hark back to an era of greater simplicity with fewer tools.	93.0	107.0
201607	1076	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	But I think it would be a mistake if we succumbed prematurely to that temptation without carefully assessing the complex nature of the challenges we are facing today and are likely to face in the future in order to fulfill our statutory responsibilities.	93.0	107.0
201607	1077	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I think the financial markets in particular have evolved considerably and are likely to continue doing so.	93.0	107.0
201607	1078	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The staff’s analysis highlights the role of regulation.	93.0	107.0
201607	1079	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And I think this needs to be further explored.	93.0	107.0
201607	1080	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	But I also want to make sure that we’re taking into account the role of technology, which is already affecting the wholesale financial markets and changing market structure and is likely to do more of that.	93.0	107.0
201607	1081	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	We certainly saw that in the Treasury securities markets in October 2014, and we’re likely to see more disintermediation and changes in market structure associated with technology.	93.0	107.0
201607	1082	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I also would highlight, as others have done, that it’s important to take into account the likelihood that we find ourselves in a lower neutral rate environment for a protracted period of time.	93.0	107.0
201607	1083	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	This is an environment in which the same frequency and size of shocks that we have seen historically would lead us back down to the effective lower bound with greater frequency, which surely needs to be taken into account in our policy framework, and one in which we might see greater international transmission than we have previously.	93.0	107.0
201607	1084	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The analysis, to me at least, suggests that the complicated nature of the challenges we’re likely to face may, in fact, require greater complexity in our implementation framework to achieve in the most effective and compelling way the clear objectives the Congress set out for us.	93.0	107.0
201607	1085	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In my own view, it’s very important to think about provision of liquidity in the wholesale financial markets at times of stress as part of our critical responsibility for financial stability in parallel to our monetary policy objectives.	93.0	107.0
201607	1086	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And I do believe that I would like to see some explicit consideration of the demand for safe assets and what our role is likely to be or should be in the future.	93.0	107.0
201607	1087	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It seems particularly important for us as the central bank that has the deepest, most liquid, largest wholesale financial markets in the world and a currency that is viewed globally as the most important reserve currency.	93.0	107.0
201607	1088	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	This is not something we chose, it may not be something we wished for, but it is something that I think matters in terms of our role in the system and the ways that financial stresses spill over into our markets.	93.0	107.0
201607	1089	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	So I agree that it should be taken explicitly into account.	93.0	107.0
201607	1090	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	That said, I’m certainly keeping a very open mind, and others around the table, I hear, are doing the same.	93.0	107.0
201607	1091	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I think it’s quite premature to draw any firm conclusions until we’re better able to assess possible tradeoffs.	93.0	107.0
201607	1092	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I do believe that at some juncture we would benefit from a broader public discussion of these issues—not just with expert communities, but also with nonexpert communities who may not fully understand the kinds of tradeoffs that we faced during the crisis and may well face.	93.0	107.0
201607	1093	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And it’s better to have those discussions ex ante than to try to defend actions ex post.	93.0	107.0
201607	1094	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	So, against the background of those considerations, I do think this is a very important set of analyses.	93.0	107.0
201607	1095	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And I hope we’ll have a lot of time before we need to actually draw conclusions about tools and the framework.	93.0	107.0
201607	1096	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	107.0
201607	1097	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	1098	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	93.0	65.0
201607	1099	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	108.0
201607	1100	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’m not sure whether I missed something that Governor Tarullo said, but I heard him talking about the interaction between the need to plan the system to take account of both the regulatory system that you’re changing and the financial system.	93.0	108.0
201607	1101	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And I think we ought to remind ourselves that we missed that in a big way in 2006, ’07, and ’08, when the supervisory system did not carry out the functions as well as it should have, and that those two elements of our job as the central bank, which are supervision and regulation of the financial system and the provision of a lender-of-last-resort facility, are very intimately connected.	93.0	108.0
201607	1102	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	They are connected in the sense that any intelligent human being faced with the choice between creating a recession of the depth that we had in 2008 to prevent moral hazard on some future occasion—which it wouldn’t do anyway, because the people who created that crisis won’t be around for the next one—will, in the end, succumb to what we call “moral hazard”— and what I call “common sense”	93.0	108.0
201607	1103	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So we will not get to that point, and that means we have to make sure that through all the tools that we have at our command, we minimize the probability of being put in such a situation.	93.0	108.0
201607	1104	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	But we should never believe that we understand the world and the random events that happen well enough that our successors will not be put in that situation again.	93.0	108.0
201607	1105	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’re not going to end too-big-to-fail, and we need to take that into account.	93.0	108.0
201607	1106	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We just have to make absolutely sure that we have done everything that we can to minimize the probability that we are put in that situation at some future date.	93.0	108.0
201607	1107	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And I think that has to be part of the discussions.	93.0	108.0
201607	1108	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think several people have already said they would like those issues discussed in the next round of this very, very critical discussion.	93.0	108.0
201607	1109	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	108.0
201607	1110	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	1111	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Anybody else?	93.0	65.0
201607	1112	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	93.0	65.0
201607	1113	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	93.0	65.0
201607	1114	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, let me end by again thanking the staff for their fantastic work.	93.0	65.0
201607	1115	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think the input that you’ve heard will be useful as we prepare for further discussion in November.	93.0	65.0
201607	1116	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we take a break at this point to have lunch and resume at, say, 1:15.	52.0	65.0
201607	1118	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, folks.	52.0	65.0
201607	1119	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Will this group come to order?	52.0	65.0
201607	1120	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We’re ready to begin with the Desk briefing, and let me turn things over to Lorie Logan.	61.0	65.0
201607	1121	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201607	1122	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The UK referendum vote to leave the European Union dominated market attention over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201607	1123	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The top-left panel of your first exhibit shows the changes in domestic asset prices over various windows during the period, with red indicating declines in risk-asset prices and increases in safe-haven asset prices and blue indicating the reverse.	61.0	999.0
201607	1124	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As you can see from the first two columns, financial markets were highly volatile in the first few days following the UK referendum, though asset prices have largely retraced since.	61.0	999.0
201607	1125	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the third column, on net over the intermeeting period, short-dated Treasury yields and the US dollar were little changed, while the S&P 500 increased about 5 percent and high-yield option-adjusted spreads narrowed roughly 60 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201607	1126	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	In explaining the shifts in domestic asset prices over the period, market participants suggested that the Brexit vote outcome increased downside risks to the outlook for global growth, especially for the United Kingdom and the euro area.	61.0	999.0
201607	1127	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	This in turn fueled expectations of easier monetary policy across advanced economies and prompted investors to “reach for yield,”	61.0	999.0
201607	1128	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Along with the better-than-expected US economic data, this prompted a reversal of the immediate effects of Brexit on domestic asset prices.	61.0	999.0
201607	1129	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The top-right panel focuses on the changes in expectations regarding monetary policy in advanced foreign economies.	61.0	999.0
201607	1130	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As you’d expect, the shift in policy expectations was biggest for the United Kingdom, the red line in the top-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201607	1131	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	While the Bank of England left its key policy rate unchanged last week, interest rate futures in the United Kingdom are currently pricing in a full 25 basis point cut at the upcoming meeting, with some also expecting an expansion of the Funding for Lending Scheme or additional asset purchases or both.	61.0	999.0
201607	1132	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	In the euro area, market-implied rates, the dark blue line, also shifted down, although market participants view the most likely form of additional easing this year to be a six- to nine-month extension of the ECB’s asset purchase program beyond the current soft end date of March 2017.	61.0	999.0
201607	1133	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	In Japan, money market rates, the light blue line, are relatively little changed since Brexit.	61.0	999.0
201607	1134	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	However, surveys show expectations for an expansion of the BOJ’s asset purchase program, which may include a doubling of ETF purchases as well as a marginal increase in JGB purchases.	61.0	999.0
201607	1135	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	In addition, expectations for Japanese fiscal stimulus increased over the period on the back of Prime Minister Abe’s current ruling coalition winning a supermajority in the Japanese upper house.	61.0	999.0
201607	1136	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	In the United States, the path of the target federal funds rate implied by market prices was little changed, on net.	61.0	999.0
201607	1137	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	In contrast, the most recent Desk surveys reveal a notable shift in expectations regarding FOMC policy.	61.0	999.0
201607	1138	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-left panel, expectations for the most likely number of rate hikes over the remainder of 2016 moved lower.	61.0	999.0
201607	1139	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Roughly one-fourth of respondents now think that the most likely outcome is for no hikes this year, and no respondents view two hikes as most likely.	61.0	999.0
201607	1140	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Survey expectations for the target rate beyond 2016 also moved lower, with a decline of about 20 basis points in the mean expectation for the target federal funds rate at year-end 2017 and 2018.	61.0	999.0
201607	1141	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The decline in expectations was most pronounced among dealer respondents and, as shown in the middle-right panel, resulted in a narrowing in the gap between survey- and market-implied rates.	61.0	999.0
201607	1142	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Commentary by survey respondents suggests these revisions to expectations of FOMC policy were driven primarily by the Brexit outcome.	61.0	999.0
201607	1143	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Alongside the shifts in rate expectations, the median expectation for the timing of a change to the Committee’s reinvestment policy also pushed out notably, from the end of 2017 to the second quarter of 2018.	61.0	999.0
201607	1144	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Expectations for more accommodative global monetary policy reportedly contributed to the declines in longer-term US interest rates over the period.	61.0	999.0
201607	1145	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the bottom-left panel, the 5-year nominal Treasury rate 5 years forward reached a historic low in the aftermath of Brexit, and the 10-year yield traded below 1.35 percent.	61.0	999.0
201607	1146	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The declines were driven almost entirely by real rates, as measures of inflation compensation were little changed.	61.0	999.0
201607	1147	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	To better understand the moves in longer-term rates, a new Desk survey question asked respondents to rate the importance of various factors in explaining the declines in the 5-year nominal Treasury rate 5 years forward over two time horizons:  first, over the intermeeting period, and, second, from the start of the year to the June FOMC.	61.0	999.0
201607	1148	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown by the blue diamonds in the bottom-right panel, the highest-rated factors for the intermeeting period were spillover from low or declining yields abroad and safe-haven demand, although conversations with market participants suggest that the effect of safe-haven demand was limited to the immediate aftermath of the UK referendum.	61.0	999.0
201607	1149	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	These spillovers, driven by the relative attractiveness of US fixed- income instruments amid a dearth of yield globally, appear to be a continuation of a trend seen since the beginning of the year.	61.0	999.0
201607	1150	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	In fact, as shown by the red diamonds, spillover from global yields was also rated the most important factor contributing to the declines earlier this year, followed by changes in the outlook for US economic growth.	61.0	999.0
201607	1151	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	For context on the low global yields, the top-left panel of your next exhibit shows the portion of sovereign debt in Japan and the euro area with negative yields.	61.0	999.0
201607	1152	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	In these markets, most sovereign debt out to the 10- to 15-year maturity range is trading in negative territory and, as a result, roughly 40 percent of all G-4 sovereign bonds yield below zero.	61.0	999.0
201607	1153	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The low yields, driven by weak economic growth prospects, negative policy rates, and expectations for further central bank easing measures, have reportedly prompted many investors to rebalance their portfolios toward higher- yielding assets.	61.0	999.0
201607	1154	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	In addition to driving longer-term US yields lower, this “reach for yield” has reportedly served to boost global risk asset prices.	61.0	999.0
201607	1155	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-right panel, the S&P 500 increased roughly 4 percent to an all-time high, while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index gained more than 8 percent over the period and month-over- month inflows into EM equity funds accelerated to year-to-date highs.	61.0	999.0
201607	1156	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Despite the strong performance of global risk assets and the relative resilience of financial markets in the wake of the Brexit decision, market participants continue to highlight several medium-term risks.	61.0	999.0
201607	1157	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The first relates to Brexit itself.	61.0	999.0
201607	1158	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Brexit-related uncertainty is expected to persist for the foreseeable future, and as I noted at the outset, the outcome increased perceived downside risks to economic growth.	61.0	999.0
201607	1159	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants are focused in particular on how political cohesion in the EU will evolve.	61.0	999.0
201607	1160	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Thus far, there have been few signs of contagion, although in the wake of Brexit, sentiment toward the European banking sector soured further.	61.0	999.0
201607	1161	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-left panel, the Euro Stoxx Banks Index, the light blue line, has declined more than 10 percent since the referendum and more than 20 percent since the start of the year, as sluggish economic growth and low net interest margins are expected to weigh on profitability.	61.0	999.0
201607	1162	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As Steve will discuss, the Italian banking sector, the red line, has been a notable underperformer.	61.0	999.0
201607	1163	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	A second point of investor concern in Europe as well as globally is the persistently low levels of inflation compensation.	61.0	999.0
201607	1164	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Five-year, five-year-forward inflation swap rates in the United States and euro area have increased a bit from the lows reached post-Brexit.	61.0	999.0
201607	1165	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-right panel, however, they remain near historically low levels, perhaps reflecting the effects of constraints on monetary policy at the zero bound.	61.0	999.0
201607	1166	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	A third risk relates to the possibility of renewed US dollar appreciation.	61.0	999.0
201607	1167	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	While the broad dollar index, the light blue line in the bottom-left panel, was little changed over the period, this masks a notable appreciation against developed market currencies, the red line.	61.0	999.0
201607	1168	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants continue to view a substantial dollar appreciation and the capital flows that could result as a significant risk to markets.	61.0	999.0
201607	1169	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The most salient concerns regarding dollar appreciation appear to be the risks it poses to Chinese FX and financial markets and, in particular, whether it could accelerate the need to delink the RMB from the dollar and lead to less perceived transparency as Chinese authorities attempt to manage that process.	61.0	999.0
201607	1170	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The RMB reached its weakest level against the dollar since 2010 over the intermeeting period, as shown by the dark blue line in the bottom-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201607	1171	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Additionally, the CFETS renminbi index has now depreciated more than 5 percent since the start of the year, as shown by the light blue line.	61.0	999.0
201607	1172	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Thus far, investors appear to be taking the gradual weakening of the RMB in stride but are quick to recall the volatility that the RMB’s depreciation against the dollar last summer and earlier this year appeared to produce.	61.0	999.0
201607	1173	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Your final two panels focus on money markets and Desk operations.	61.0	999.0
201607	1174	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel of your third exhibit, money market rates, particularly repo rates, increased over the intermeeting period, as dealers sought to secure funding ahead of the Brexit vote and the June quarter-end.	61.0	999.0
201607	1175	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The rise in secured rates put upward pressure on unsecured rates, with the effective federal funds rate averaging 39 basis points, 2 basis points above the previous period’s average.	61.0	999.0
201607	1176	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Despite higher market rates relative to the overnight RRP rate, average daily overnight RRP participation increased, as shown in the top-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201607	1177	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in red, Freddie Mac’s participation rose from an average of about $1 billion per day in earlier periods to $12 billion per day, as part of its cash management strategy ahead of planned buyback and reissuance of longer-term debt.	61.0	999.0
201607	1178	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	More notably, government funds’ overnight RRP usage, shown as the dark blue area, also increased.	61.0	999.0
201607	1179	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	This increase in usage came alongside a movement in assets under management from prime funds to government funds ahead of the October implementation date for SEC money market fund reforms.	61.0	999.0
201607	1180	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in dark blue in the middle-left panel, approximately $105 billion left prime funds this intermeeting period, while the AUM of funds that invest in government and agency securities, the light blue area, increased $100 billion.	61.0	999.0
201607	1181	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants expect this trend to accelerate in August and September.	61.0	999.0
201607	1182	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Money funds we surveyed in June expected investor flows to generate a migration of about $320 billion from prime to government funds, shown in light blue in the middle-right panel, though estimates ranged widely across respondents.	61.0	999.0
201607	1183	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The realized and expected investor flows come on top of the roughly $350 billion in prime funds that have either converted or are in the process of converting to government funds, the dark blue column in the panel.	61.0	999.0
201607	1184	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Altogether, this would leave roughly $850 billion in AUM in prime funds, the red portion of the bar to the right.	61.0	999.0
201607	1185	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Despite the increase in government fund AUM over the intermeeting period, usage of the overnight RRP facility as a proportion of the overall assets under management for RRP counterparties increased only modestly, as shown in the bottom-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201607	1186	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	This suggests that to date these funds have been able to successfully allocate most of the new cash to private-market investments.	61.0	999.0
201607	1187	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	In anticipation of further investor outflows, prime funds have shifted their investments toward shorter-term assets.	61.0	999.0
201607	1188	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the bottom-right panel, the decline in prime fund holdings of commercial paper and time deposits has accelerated, particularly as the three-month tenor recently crossed the reform implementation date.	61.0	999.0
201607	1189	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Increased reluctance by prime funds to hold three-month investments reportedly contributed to the widening over the intermeeting period in the spread between three-month LIBOR and OIS rates, the red line.	61.0	999.0
201607	1190	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	While not shown here, the increase in LIBOR also contributed to the recent increase in US interest rate swap rates, which settle to three-month LIBOR.	61.0	999.0
201607	1191	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants suggested that the effect of money fund reform also contributed to an increase in offshore dollar-funding costs, including the three-month US dollar cross-currency swap bases shown in the top-left panel of your final exhibit.	61.0	999.0
201607	1192	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Recall that the basis measures the cost of borrowing US dollars offshore through the FX market relative to the costs of borrowing dollars directly.	61.0	999.0
201607	1193	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Some contacts have noted that a reduction in prime funds’ lending to foreign banks could have increased demand for funding through the FX swap market, and that this may have pushed FX bases wider.	61.0	999.0
201607	1194	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The upward pressure on offshore dollar costs also pushed the implied cost of one- week offshore borrowing, shown in the top-right panel, above the rate on foreign central banks’ one-week US dollar auctions.	61.0	999.0
201607	1195	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Amid the shift in market pricing, we observed higher demand at the BOJ and the ECB dollar auctions over the June quarter-end and some modest usage in the operations that have followed, as shown in the middle-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201607	1196	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Turning to organizational matters, the middle-right panel summarizes the staff’s work to modernize the documents governing foreign currency operations.	61.0	999.0
201607	1197	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The staff had three objectives in conducting this work:  first, to have the documents reflect the current operating environment; second, to clarify policymaker guidance to the Selected Bank; and, third, to improve the documents’ organization.	61.0	999.0
201607	1198	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	To achieve these objectives, the staff has undertaken a substantial rewrite of the documents, with the proposed updates reflecting a significant number of changes to the existing governance of the foreign currency operations.	61.0	999.0
201607	1199	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	In view of the number of changes proposed, we want to ensure that you have enough time to review them before you’re asked for a vote.	61.0	999.0
201607	1200	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	We plan to send you the updated documents and an accompanying memorandum within the next few weeks and to request a vote to approve these documents at the September meeting.	61.0	999.0
201607	1201	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Pending approval of the governing documents in September, the Desk staff plans to begin implementing the new investment framework for the management of the foreign reserves portfolio shortly thereafter.	61.0	999.0
201607	1202	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As discussed at the April meeting, key features of this new framework include establishing a process for assessing policymakers’ investment preferences for the period aheadand using a more robust risk–return methodology that incorporates those preferences.	61.0	999.0
201607	1203	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Lastly, I want to mention two operational developments.	61.0	999.0
201607	1204	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	First, last week JPMorgan Chase announced its plans to exit the provision of settlement services for OMO-eligible assets by mid-2018.	61.0	999.0
201607	1205	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	At that time, Bank of New York Mellon is expected to become the sole service provider supporting the clearing and settlement of our domestic open market operations.	61.0	999.0
201607	1206	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	JPMorgan’s announcement will not affect the services it provides as custodian for SOMA agency MBS holdings.	61.0	999.0
201607	1207	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Second, the staff conducted one small value operational test over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201607	1208	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Information on this test, along with a list of upcoming exercises, is summarized in the appendix.	61.0	999.0
201607	1209	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you.	61.0	999.0
201607	1210	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	That concludes my prepared remarks.	61.0	999.0
201607	1211	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	61.0	65.0
201607	1212	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Lorie?	62.0	65.0
201607	1213	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62.0	65.0
201607	1214	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Hearing no questions, we need a motion to ratify domestic open market operations.	63.0	65.0
201607	1215	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	63.0	108.0
201607	1216	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And without objection.	63.0	65.0
201607	1217	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63.0	65.0
201607	1218	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s move along then to the economic and financial situation, and Steve Kamin is going to start us off.	11.0	65.0
201607	1219	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11.0	999.0
201607	1220	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	I’ll be referring to the materials titled “The International Outlook.”	11.0	999.0
201607	1221	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Let me say at the outset that if I never hear the word “Brexit” again, it will be way too soon.	11.0	999.0
201607	1222	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	If you are of the same mind, we are in for much disappointment, because like campaign robocalls, Pokemon Go, and, as always, the Kardashians, we’re going to be hearing a lot more about Brexit than we’d like in the coming months.	11.0	999.0
201607	1223	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	In fact, newly installed Prime Minister Theresa May has stated that she is not even going to initiate the formal process of pulling Britain out of the EU until early 2017, and after that, talks on a new trade deal will drone on for at least two years.	11.0	999.0
201607	1224	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Once the bureaucrats start hashing out the details, the best we can hope for is that the negotiations will be excruciatingly boring.	11.0	999.0
201607	1225	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	At worst, well, I’ll get to that shortly.	11.0	999.0
201607	1226	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	It is still early days, of course, but at least for now, Brexit has turned out about as well as we might have expected.	11.0	999.0
201607	1227	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	As Lorie has described, outside of Europe, global financial markets have largely reversed their earlier losses, and the dollar—which is a key channel through which foreign events affect the US economy—is up only about 1 percent since your June meeting.	11.0	999.0
201607	1228	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	So, with financial and confidence spillovers from Brexit largely contained, we see the main effect of Brexit on our baseline foreign outlook being the hit to the economies of the United Kingdom and the euro area, with some fairly small knock-on effects on other foreign economies operating mainly through trade channels.	11.0	999.0
201607	1229	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Given that we’ve never seen an event like Brexit, how do we calculate its effects on economic growth in the United Kingdom and the euro area?	11.0	999.0
201607	1230	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	The reduction of trade in goods and financial services should exert some long-term depressive effect on productivity and output, but we believe the more immediate and tangible effects will come through Brexit’s effect on uncertainty, confidence, and financial conditions.	11.0	999.0
201607	1231	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	As indicated in panel 1, the Baker, Bloom, and Davis measure of economic policy uncertainty has ratcheted up this year in both the United Kingdom and the euro area, as have measures of financial stress, shown in panel 2.	11.0	999.0
201607	1232	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	To get some sense of the economic effect of these developments, we estimated a vector autoregression model that includes the uncertainty index, financial stress, GDP, and several other variables.	11.0	999.0
201607	1233	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Drawing on this model, we estimate that heightened uncertainty and financial stress should depress UK economic growth quite noticeably over the next year relative to our June projection, as shown by the red solid and dashed lines in panel 3, while euro-area growth, the blue lines, also slows, albeit to a smaller extent.	11.0	999.0
201607	1234	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Later in the forecast period, as progress in Brexit negotiations leads to greater clarity about the economic outlook and thus revived confidence and spending, our new growth projections converge toward those we wrote down in the June Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201607	1235	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Notwithstanding Brexit’s significant hit to European growth, the effect on the global economy should be relatively muted.	11.0	999.0
201607	1236	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	As shown in panel 4, the United Kingdom accounts for only about 3½ percent of US merchandise exports, while the euro area amounts to about 15 percent.	11.0	999.0
201607	1237	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	And outside of Europe, the outlook is little changed from the June Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201607	1238	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, as shown by the black solid line in panel 5, we have revised down our trade-weighted aggregate of foreign GDP growth only about ¼ percentage point in the second half of this year and 0.1 percentage point next year.	11.0	999.0
201607	1239	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	As Brexit effects wane by the end of the forecast period, economic growth in both the EMEs and AFEs should be running at roughly their trend paces.	11.0	999.0
201607	1240	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Although the effect of Brexit on our baseline projection is relatively muted, Brexit has revived some serious downside risks for the euro area.	11.0	999.0
201607	1241	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	First, there is some chance that the result of the UK referendum will provide the impetus for anti-EU groups elsewhere in Europe, which already have been gaining political ground in many countries, to either seek similar votes or to restrain the power of EU institutions in other ways.	11.0	999.0
201607	1242	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	As shown in panel 6, a survey of EU residents conducted in November 2015 indicated that, outside of the United Kingdom, people generally favored staying in the EU, but sizable minorities favored leaving and the UK vote could boost those numbers.	11.0	999.0
201607	1243	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	The threat of a withdrawal by a continental European economy would create serious concerns about the viability of the euro area and likely trigger a return of the financial stresses seen during the euro zone crisis in 2011 and 2012.	11.0	999.0
201607	1244	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Now besides that, Brexit has revived worries of a crisis in European banking.	11.0	999.0
201607	1245	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	For several years, European banks have struggled with low capitalization and poor profitability, reflecting—to varying degrees—a weak economic environment, shallow yield curves, low-to-negative interest rates, inadequate cost containment, and, as shown in panel 7 on your next exhibit, elevated nonperforming loans.	11.0	999.0
201607	1246	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	As Lorie has described, following the Brexit vote, stock prices of European banks fell especially sharply.	11.0	999.0
201607	1247	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	For the most part, these declines reflected concerns about profitability rather than solvency, as investors worried that lower economic growth and lower interest rates would further depress bank returns.	11.0	999.0
201607	1248	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	However, Brexit has also shone the spotlight on banks in serious need of recapitalization.	11.0	999.0
201607	1249	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	This spotlight is all the brighter because in three days, the European Banking Authority will be publishing the results of its EU-wide stress test, and banks viewed as having inadequate capital will likely come under additional pressure.	11.0	999.0
201607	1250	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Some of the banks likely to fare poorly in the stress test are in Italy, where NPLs amount to 18 percent of loans and loan loss provisions are inadequate.	11.0	999.0
201607	1251	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Weaker-than- expected results for a major Italian bank could create funding problems for Italian banks in general if markets came to believe that the problems faced by Italian banks were not going to be addressed.	11.0	999.0
201607	1252	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Such tensions could, in principle, lead to heightened financial stresses in other peripheral economies, renewed pressures on peripheral government finances, and, in the worst-case scenario, a return of the euro-area debt crisis.	11.0	999.0
201607	1253	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	However, for this to happen, many policy missteps would have to occur.	11.0	999.0
201607	1254	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Estimates of the cost of a credible recapitalization of all Italian banks start at about €45 billion.	11.0	999.0
201607	1255	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	This is a manageable figure, amounting to less than 3 percent of Italian GDP, and well below the European Stability Mechanism’s remaining lending capacity of €370 billion.	11.0	999.0
201607	1256	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	The key stumbling block so far has been that the EU’s new bank resolution rules require any public recapitalization be accompanied by the bail- in of a wide range of claimants, including unsecured bondholders and uninsured depositors.	11.0	999.0
201607	1257	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	This is a particular problem for Italy, where many unsecured bonds were sold to retail customers as if they were safe deposit accounts, and forcing those customers to take losses would be politically dangerous.	11.0	999.0
201607	1258	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	At present, the Italian authorities are working with EU officials on a solution to the problem.	11.0	999.0
201607	1259	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	The solution will likely involve less ambitious recapitalization, targeting just a few banks, probably involving some private funds, and perhaps exploiting existing exceptions in the bank resolution rules.	11.0	999.0
201607	1260	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	A strategy along these lines will probably suffice to keep a lid on Italy’s banking problems for the time being, but the pot could certainly boil over at some future point.	11.0	999.0
201607	1261	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Besides depressing growth and posing downside risks to the European economy, Brexit appears to have triggered a further notch downward in global interest rates, as shown in panel 8.	11.0	999.0
201607	1262	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	We now expect that in response to weaker economic prospects, the Bank of England soon will cut its policy rate 25 basis points to ¼ percent and resume asset purchases, and the ECB will both cut its deposit rate an additional 10 basis points to negative ½ percent and extend its asset purchase program by an additional quarter to mid-2017.	11.0	999.0
201607	1263	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	With Japanese economic growth and inflation also flagging, we think it likely that the BOJ will also bolster its accommodation, probably through a rate cut and stepped-up asset purchases.	11.0	999.0
201607	1264	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Not surprisingly, the value of the dollar against the AFEs has risen over the intermeeting period, as shown by the green line in panel 9, and we have accordingly revised up our forecast path for the dollar against those currencies.	11.0	999.0
201607	1265	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	What is more surprising is that the value of the dollar against EMEs, the blue line, is down slightly over the period.	11.0	999.0
201607	1266	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	In fact, as shown in panel 10, since the Brexit vote, EME assets have been experiencing a boom, with flows into emerging market funds soaring and credit spreads narrowing sharply.	11.0	999.0
201607	1267	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	The source of the recent strength in EME assets has important implications for the outlook for the dollar.	11.0	999.0
201607	1268	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	If this strength largely reflects a relief rally following the passing of the Brexit risk event, coupled with some impetus from further declines in interest rates in Europe and Japan, gains in EME currencies might persist, consistent with the path of the dollar against EMEs, shown in panel 9.	11.0	999.0
201607	1269	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Conversely, if the boom in EME assets and, in fact, risk assets more generally is being supported by investor expectations of easier US monetary policy, as Lorie discussed, then investor surprise at FOMC tightening could boost the dollar much more sharply than in our forecast against both the AFEs and EMEs.	11.0	999.0
201607	1270	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	To be sure, we already are anticipating some rise in the dollar as markets discover that the FOMC is tightening by more than they expected.	11.0	999.0
201607	1271	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	That is why the dollar rises against AFE currencies in our forecast.	11.0	999.0
201607	1272	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	This Federal Reserve surprise effect is offset for the EMEs by our assumption that the Chinese RMB will end up rising against the dollar over the forecast period.	11.0	999.0
201607	1273	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	But as indicated by panel 11, the sensitivity of the dollar to changes in interest rates may now be higher than we are assuming.	11.0	999.0
201607	1274	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	The blue dots and blue regression line show that over the period from January 2010 to April 2014, following FOMC announcements, increases of 1 percentage point in interest rate differentials were associated with a 2.1 percent rise in the dollar against AFE currencies.	11.0	999.0
201607	1275	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	We are currently assuming a dollar sensitivity of 2.5 percent in our forecast.	11.0	999.0
201607	1276	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	But, as indicated by the red dots and regression line, from 2014 to the present, the sensitivity of the dollar to interest rate surprises has risen to about 4.5 percent.	11.0	999.0
201607	1277	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, the dollar may rise by more in response to a US monetary policy tightening than we are currently assuming.	11.0	999.0
201607	1278	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Another upside risk to the dollar forecast is posed by China.	11.0	999.0
201607	1279	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	As indicated in panel 12, we are currently assuming that the RMB will stabilize over the next year before appreciating thereafter, consistent with China’s still-high productivity growth and mounting trade surpluses.	11.0	999.0
201607	1280	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	However, with China apparently content to let the RMB depreciate to support growth and with markets continuing to fret that growing corporate debt could lead to a hard landing, there is some chance that a reemergence of heavy capital outflows could keep the RMB moving downward.	11.0	999.0
201607	1281	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	To conclude, both the normalization of Fed policy and prospects for China pose upside risks to our dollar forecast.	11.0	999.0
201607	1282	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Over the coming intermeeting period, we will be considering how much of this upside might be worth incorporating into our baseline projection.	11.0	999.0
201607	1283	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	David will now continue our presentation.	11.0	999.0
201607	1284	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	I’ll be referring to the packet titled “The US Outlook.”	11.0	999.0
201607	1285	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	The biggest surprise regarding the baseline outlook for the US economy may be how little it has changed since June despite—among other developments—the event that Steve Kamin would prefer shall not be named.	11.0	999.0
201607	1286	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Accordingly, I will be relatively brief in my coverage of the usual forecast update and instead provide a broader review of the recent contour of the recovery.	11.0	999.0
201607	1287	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	The first panel of your forecast summary exhibit shows how various nowcasts of second-quarter real GDP growth have evolved since the time of the June Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201607	1288	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Generally speaking, the nowcasting operations maintained at the Reserve Banks, which are shown by the dashed lines, like the Board’s judgmental forecast (in black), saw the incoming data during the intermeeting period as continuing to point to second-quarter GDP growth in the neighborhood of 2 percent.	11.0	999.0
201607	1289	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	On the basis of our own track record over the past decade, we estimate that there’s a 70 percent probability that the BEA’s first estimate, which it will publish this Friday, will lie between about 1½ percent and 2½ percent.	11.0	999.0
201607	1290	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Of course, the BEA’s first estimate will then be revised over time, so uncertainty about the true rate of growth of real GDP in the second quarter is much greater than that.	11.0	999.0
201607	1291	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	As for the labor market, the June employment report substantially alleviated the concern we had at the time of the June meeting that a broader deterioration in real activity might have been in train.	11.0	999.0
201607	1292	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Welcome as that report was, I would hasten to note that what one report delivered in terms of reassurance about the vitality of the recovery, another report could just as easily take away.	11.0	999.0
201607	1293	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Taking a longer-term perspective, the pace of improvement in the cyclical position of the economy does seem to have slowed in recent quarters.	11.0	999.0
201607	1294	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	The clearest window onto this slowing is given in panel 2, which shows the Board staff’s judgmental estimate of the output gap—the broadest measure of resource utilization in our framework.	11.0	999.0
201607	1295	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	After having narrowed reasonably rapidly during the preceding couple of years, the output gap by our reckoning has been roughly flat since the middle of 2015.	11.0	999.0
201607	1296	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Assuming that our characterization of recent history survives the upcoming annual revision to the national accounts, which is also scheduled to be released on Friday, two questions immediately arise, as we noted in the Tealbook:  First, why did the slowing occur?	11.0	999.0
201607	1297	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	And, second, what does it portend for the future?	11.0	999.0
201607	1298	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Regarding why it happened, one important cause of the slowdown has probably been the appreciation of the exchange value of the dollar since mid-2014, and the associated deeper factors that gave rise to that appreciation.	11.0	999.0
201607	1299	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from panel 3, the broad real dollar is currently more than 16 percent stronger than we thought it would be as of the July 2014 Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201607	1300	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	As Glenn Follette emphasized in his briefing yesterday, business fixed investment has been unexpectedly weak recently and inventory investment has slowed from its rapid pace of a year ago.	11.0	999.0
201607	1301	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	These developments may themselves partly reflect the appreciation of the dollar rather than be additional to it.	11.0	999.0
201607	1302	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	In our assessment, the dollar effect helps to explain why the pace of cyclical improvement slowed as much as it did during a period when you increased the target range for the federal funds rate only 25 basis points and the size of the SOMA portfolio relative to GDP didn’t change very much.	11.0	999.0
201607	1303	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Indeed, one can even argue— given the downward adjustment in market expectations for the trajectory of the funds rate over the next few years—that the overall stance of monetary policy actually has eased since mid-2014.	11.0	999.0
201607	1304	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	A natural interpretation of all of this is that the appreciation of the dollar since 2014 and all the factors that gave rise to that appreciation put a substantial restraint on domestic economic activity—a restraint that we estimate to be in the neighborhood of about 1 percentage point off the growth of real GDP both last year and this year.	11.0	999.0
201607	1305	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Thus, the dollar and the other factors that gave rise to dollar appreciation plausibly substituted, in effect, for tightening that you might have otherwise had to provide in the form of more aggressive increases in the funds rate.	11.0	999.0
201607	1306	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	The FRB/US model can give one rough estimate of the magnitude of the substitution.	11.0	999.0
201607	1307	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	According to the model, the unanticipated rise in the dollar’s exchange value over the past two years was equivalent, in terms of its effect on the output gap, to an increase in the federal funds rate of something like 150 to 200 basis points.	11.0	999.0
201607	1308	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Turning to the second question that I posed earlier, if the stronger dollar played an important role in generating the recent cyclical slowing, what does that portend for the future?	11.0	999.0
201607	1309	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	In particular, does it make sense that, in the baseline forecast, we have the pace of resource tightening picking up steam again even as the funds rate moves up more decisively?	11.0	999.0
201607	1310	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	The answer is that, with dollar and other associated effects waning, there is room both for the pace of resource tightening to pick back up to a slightly more vigorous pace and for you to resume a program of gradually bringing the funds rate up to its neutral level over the next several years.	11.0	999.0
201607	1311	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Panels 5 and 6 show the evolution of two key indicators of labor market conditions broken out by race or ethnicity.	11.0	999.0
201607	1312	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Broadly speaking, as shown in panel 5, the unemployment rates for Hispanics or Latinos and for blacks or African- Americans historically have tended to follow the main contours of the unemployment rate for whites, but with a higher intercept and a larger cyclical sensitivity.	11.0	999.0
201607	1313	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	An ocular regression suggests that there may have been some modest improvement in the relative experience of Hispanics over the past decade but not of blacks, and an actual computer-based simple linear regression—albeit one that makes no attempt to control for changes in age, education, or other relevant characteristics—corroborates that ocular impression.	11.0	999.0
201607	1314	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Panel 6 presents similar estimates for the so-called U-6 rate, which includes marginally attached persons and people working part time for economic reasons.	11.0	999.0
201607	1315	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	These estimates were prepared by the staff here at the Board using microdata from the CPS.	11.0	999.0
201607	1316	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	This measure tells roughly the same story.	11.0	999.0
201607	1317	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	It is certainly discouraging that neither the black–white nor the Hispanic–white differential in either measure is materially smaller than it was a decade or two ago.	11.0	999.0
201607	1318	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Although our baseline assessment of the outlook for real activity isn’t much different from June, our perception of the risks to that outlook has been torqued in different directions on the basis of domestic and foreign considerations.	11.0	999.0
201607	1319	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	On the one hand, the most recent labor market report provided welcome reassurance that the labor market continues to improve, and this suggests that near-term domestic risks have receded.	11.0	999.0
201607	1320	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	On the other hand, I would note that at the time of your June meeting, the UK vote was still seen through the windshield, not in the rearview mirror.	11.0	999.0
201607	1321	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	While the relatively calm response of financial markets in the short amount of time that has transpired since then is also reassuring, I would argue that the vote to leave, which we and others certainly didn’t expect, opens up a range of possibilities that we would have dismissed if the vote had come out the other way, and none of those possibilities look appealing.	11.0	999.0
201607	1322	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	The exhibits on the next page summarize the inflation outlook.	11.0	999.0
201607	1323	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Our projections of both headline PCE inflation—panel 7—and core PCE inflation—panel 8—are essentially unrevised from June, reflecting both incoming data that have been unusually cooperative and revisions to the medium-term determinants of core inflation that have been quite small.	11.0	999.0
201607	1324	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	We continue to expect core PCE inflation to step down modestly over the second half of this year.	11.0	999.0
201607	1325	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	As we have noted before, this pattern is partly attributable to the residual seasonality that the BEA has thus far not succeeded in expunging from the PCE price index.	11.0	999.0
201607	1326	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	In addition, we think that first- quarter core inflation was temporarily boosted by some outsized gains in a few erratic components.	11.0	999.0
201607	1327	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	The next two panels reproduce the Tealbook’s inflation monitor exhibits, which show the cumulative revisions since December of last year to our projections for total and core PCE inflation and take a first cut at parsing out the sources of those revisions.	11.0	999.0
201607	1328	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see, the revisions have been mixed but, generally speaking, not very large in either direction thus far.	11.0	999.0
201607	1329	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Focusing on the outlook for core inflation, reported in panel 10, the bulk of the upward revision to our forecast of core inflation this year reflects an upward surprise in the first quarter that we have mostly interpreted as noise.	11.0	999.0
201607	1330	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	On the other hand, we’ve shaved a cumulative tenth out of our forecast of core inflation in 2017 and 2018, reflecting, as you can see, a variety of very small factors.	11.0	999.0
201607	1331	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Panel 11 shows three of the measures of labor compensation that we follow.	11.0	999.0
201607	1332	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	In recent years, nominal labor compensation growth has been relatively subdued in the face of a steady reduction in labor market slack, although there are signs of a pickup more recently in some measures.	11.0	999.0
201607	1333	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	As Glenn Follette also discussed in his pre-FOMC briefing, we think that the recent evolution of compensation can be reasonably well explained by the behavior of trend real wage growth (which is itself related to the growth rate of structural productivity), trend price inflation, and the staff’s estimate of the unemployment gap.	11.0	999.0
201607	1334	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Panel 12 uses one of our models to decompose movements in the ECI into the contributions of these various factors.	11.0	999.0
201607	1335	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from the red portion of the bars, the model does view the reduction in labor market slack that has occurred since the beginning of the recovery as a source of upward pressure on compensation growth.	11.0	999.0
201607	1336	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	However, that effect has been largely offset by a reduced contribution of trend real wage growth—the green portion of the bars—that in turn reflects a slowdown in structural productivity growth.	11.0	999.0
201607	1337	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Overall, this model isn’t particularly puzzled by the recent behavior of either the ECI or the productivity and cost measure of compensation per hour.	11.0	999.0
201607	1338	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	At this point, I’ll turn it over to Michael.	11.0	999.0
201607	1339	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	I’ll be referring to your handout on “Financial Stability Developments.”	11.0	999.0
201607	1340	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	My briefing will review developments since our last readout in April, drawing on the quarterly quantitative surveillance report you received last week.	11.0	999.0
201607	1341	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	As we highlighted in the report, we continue to see the overall vulnerabilities in the United States as moderate, primarily due to the strong capital and liquidity positions in the banking sector, moderate growth of nonfinancial credit, and lack of widespread valuation pressures.	11.0	999.0
201607	1342	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	The period since our last assessment included the decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union.	11.0	999.0
201607	1343	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Note that I avoided the “B word” to spare Steve, but I might not be able to keep it up.	11.0	999.0
201607	1344	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	As Lorie and Steve have already discussed, the outcome of the referendum led to sharp declines in risk asset prices and volatility in financial markets that quickly receded.	11.0	999.0
201607	1345	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	The first two panels of exhibit 1 illustrate some developments in market functioning.	11.0	999.0
201607	1346	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Foreign exchange markets experienced large volumes and some temporary modest strains, with bid-asked spreads (illustrated for the euro in chart 1) briefly widening to levels far above intraday norms.	11.0	999.0
201607	1347	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Turning to fixed-income markets, our recent assessments have highlighted the concerns expressed by some market participants and others regarding reductions in liquidity.	11.0	999.0
201607	1348	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	As can be seen in chart 2, bid-asked spreads for investment- grade corporate bonds, the black line, widened around Brexit but not to an unusual extent.	11.0	999.0
201607	1349	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Stepping back from specific developments, the Brexit experience was a significant real-time, albeit anticipated, stress test of the global financial system.	11.0	999.0
201607	1350	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Reports indicate that trading remained generally orderly and liquidity across markets held up reasonably well.	11.0	999.0
201607	1351	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	In addition, supervisory data suggest that unscheduled margin calls were substantial in the immediate aftermath of Brexit but were met without any significant incidents.	11.0	999.0
201607	1352	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Financial markets and institutions have been resilient to the shock to date, which may in part reflect early preparations by a wide range of market participants, reduced leverage in the system, and communications from central banks that they would take the steps necessary to provide liquidity to support the orderly functioning of markets.	11.0	999.0
201607	1353	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	While the prices of many risk assets have more than fully recovered from their post-Brexit lows, this is not true of European bank stock prices, as Steve and Lorie already highlighted.	11.0	999.0
201607	1354	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Equity prices of large European banks, shown in chart 3, fell substantially, and the prices for Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, and Barclays have recently been near or even below the lows hit during the worst of the European debt crisis in 2011 and 2012.	11.0	999.0
201607	1355	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	In contrast, the stock prices for US banks have largely recovered from their post-Brexit decline and remain notably above their 2011 low.	11.0	999.0
201607	1356	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	The relative outperformance of US banks undoubtedly is due importantly to the relative strength of the US economic recovery, although the improvement in loss- absorbing capacity at US banks likely also plays a role.	11.0	999.0
201607	1357	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	As shown in chart 4, the largest US banks all met their fully phased-in Basel III common equity tier 1 ratio as of early this year; moreover, all of the US banks participating in this year’s CCAR received nonobjections to their capital plans after demonstrating that their capital levels were sufficient to withstand a severely adverse global recession.	11.0	999.0
201607	1358	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	The underperformance of European banks reflects a number of factors, including the weaker outlook for economic growth in Europe, the further drag on already thin net interest margins from low—indeed, negative—interest rates, and greater concerns about the quality of their loan books.	11.0	999.0
201607	1359	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	As Steve just mentioned, Italian banks have been under particular pressure recently, and the results of the EBA’s stress tests—to be released this Friday—and any related policy actions bear close watching.	11.0	999.0
201607	1360	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	An important link between European financial institutions and domestic financial stability comes from the sizable exposures of prime money market funds to Europe, illustrated in chart 5.	11.0	999.0
201607	1361	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Overall exposures were more than $500 billion, on average, in recent months.	11.0	999.0
201607	1362	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Much of this exposure consisted of certificates of deposit and commercial paper from financial institutions.	11.0	999.0
201607	1363	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Looking forward, on October 14, new SEC regulations governing money market funds take effect.	11.0	999.0
201607	1364	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Under the new rules, prime institutional funds will be required to float their daily net asset values and have the ability to impose fees and, indeed, outright restrictions, or “gates,” on redemptions.	11.0	999.0
201607	1365	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	In response, and as discussed earlier by Lorie, a number of funds have converted to types less influenced by the reforms, with the most common adjustment involving conversion to a government-only fund.	11.0	999.0
201607	1366	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	In addition, money fund managers are preparing for potential withdrawals by investors who want to avoid the new regulations and, as shown in chart 6, have shortened maturities and built liquidity buffers in response.	11.0	999.0
201607	1367	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	A survey of money fund managers conducted by the Desk reported projected additional redemptions from prime funds could be on the order of several hundreds of billions of dollars.	11.0	999.0
201607	1368	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	While the reforms should improve the stability of money market funds, there could be some short-term disruptions to wholesale funding markets if large unexpected withdrawals were to occur.	11.0	999.0
201607	1369	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	In particular, some foreign banks could experience difficulties in obtaining dollar funding.	11.0	999.0
201607	1370	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Your next exhibit presents developments in nonfinancial credit and asset valuations.	11.0	999.0
201607	1371	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Overall, nonfinancial credit has grown at a rate roughly in line with nominal GDP (not shown), and we continue to see vulnerabilities stemming from nonfinancial borrowing as moderate overall.	11.0	999.0
201607	1372	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	In the nonfinancial corporate business sector, leverage continued to increase, as shown in chart 1, and leverage among speculative-grade and unrated firms—so-called high-risk firms—is now quite elevated.	11.0	999.0
201607	1373	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	High leverage among risky firms leaves them vulnerable to shocks.	11.0	999.0
201607	1374	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	That said, the pace of borrowing by such firms has slowed over the past year, as shown in chart 2, in response to the increase in borrowing spreads (chart 3) and tightening in lending conditions seen since 2014.	11.0	999.0
201607	1375	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Credit spreads have remained on the high side of historical averages this year, although they have clearly moved down from the levels seen early in the year.	11.0	999.0
201607	1376	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Anecdotal reports hint at some pickup in valuation pressures in risk assets from a view that extremely low (if not negative) yields in Europe and Japan leave the United States as the only game in town for investors reaching for yield.	11.0	999.0
201607	1377	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	It remains too early to call a significant uptick in valuation pressures in the United States, and, for example, the required return to equity (chart 4) remains near a historically typical level and the equity premium (the difference between the black and red lines in chart 4) remains relatively high.	11.0	999.0
201607	1378	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Of course, one reason that the equity premium has widened this year is the decline in Treasury yields, highlighting the potential dependence of asset prices on continued low longer-term Treasury rates.	11.0	999.0
201607	1379	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	The final two panels provide an update on developments in commercial real estate, in which rapid price appreciation recently has led us to highlight the notable valuation pressures emerging in this sector.	11.0	999.0
201607	1380	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Data through June point to continued price gains and declines in capitalization rates, as shown in the lower-left chart.	11.0	999.0
201607	1381	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	As with equity valuation metrics, these capitalization rates do not suggest unusually low expected returns relative to Treasury yields, but their steady decline highlights the momentum in this sector.	11.0	999.0
201607	1382	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Nonetheless, there have been some indications of slowing investor appetite for commercial real estate.	11.0	999.0
201607	1383	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	For example, the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices reported a significant fraction of banks tightening lending standards for CRE, shown on the chart to the right, in the first and second quarters of this year.	11.0	999.0
201607	1384	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	The last page of your handout presents our summary heat map of financial-sector vulnerabilities.	11.0	999.0
201607	1385	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	As in previous assessments, valuation pressures, private nonfinancial- sector leverage, and maturity transformation all remain at the midpoint of our scale, while we judge vulnerabilities from financial leverage to be low.	11.0	999.0
201607	1386	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	That concludes our set of remarks.	11.0	999.0
201607	1387	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	The floor is now open for questions for any of our presenters.	12.0	65.0
201607	1388	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	12.0	65.0
201607	1389	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	94.0
201607	1390	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I have a question on “The International Outlook”—exhibit 2, box 9, “Real Dollar Indexes.”	12.0	94.0
201607	1391	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	You’ve got the dollar appreciating over the forecast horizon.	12.0	94.0
201607	1392	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	One question you might ask is:  Wouldn’t markets already have integrated all of the information that’s available, and, therefore, it wouldn’t really be very predictable where the trade-weighted value of the dollar was going to go?	12.0	94.0
201607	1393	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	That insight is exactly right, and that is an important part of the way we forecast the dollar, which is to assume that everything the markets know or anticipate now is already incorporated into the current level of the dollar.	12.0	999.0
201607	1394	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	The only reason why we would predict changes in the dollar—particularly the exchange rate against the advanced economies, whose exchange rates are determined by the market—is if we thought the market was going to learn something later that it does not know now.	12.0	999.0
201607	1395	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	In general, of course, we don’t think we have any greater insight into future events than the market does.	12.0	999.0
201607	1396	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	However, there is one area in which we think we might have some insight, and that’s the assumption in our forecast that the federal funds rate will rise at a steeper gradient over the course of the forecast period than the market expects.	12.0	999.0
201607	1397	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	So the market expects a relatively small amount of tightening over the next few years.	12.0	999.0
201607	1398	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	We have built into our forecast a greater amount of tightening, so we assumed that as the market learns about that and is surprised by the upward shift in the federal funds rate, it will accordingly bid the dollar up, and that’s the rationale for the upward tilt in our exchange rate.	12.0	999.0
201607	1399	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I see.	12.0	94.0
201607	1400	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	But, actually, my own forecasts don’t have that policy upswing.	12.0	94.0
201607	1401	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	So I guess if you’re applying this to what I have, then you’d say that maybe the dollar would even depreciate, or at least you would make no forecast about the dollar.	12.0	94.0
201607	1402	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	That could well be.	12.0	999.0
201607	1403	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Our forecast regarding the dollar is part of the overall staff forecast of the US economy and depends on the assumptions about US monetary policy that are incorporated into our staff forecast.	12.0	999.0
201607	1404	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	12.0	94.0
201607	1405	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions?	12.0	65.0
201607	1406	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	12.0	65.0
201607	1407	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have a question, diving deep into the Tealbook forecast, and that’s specifically about housing.	12.0	102.0
201607	1408	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	You highlight in the Tealbook that the incoming data on residential construction suggest lower growth over the near term, but I’m a little bit puzzled by that.	12.0	102.0
201607	1409	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, I’m thinking ahead to the wording in the draft statement that residential investment is “soft.”	12.0	102.0
201607	1410	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Real residential investment increased at a rate of more than 15 percent in the first quarter.	12.0	102.0
201607	1411	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Outside commentators would describe housing—and this is how my own staff described it when we discussed it—as a sector in which housing starts, permits, and existing home sales have been strong and have been in fact above expectations, and that any slowing that we’ve seen in the data may be just some weather effects, which have affected the timing of activity between Q1 and Q2.	12.0	102.0
201607	1412	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I guess I’m asking for your help in thinking this through:  If you have a really strong Q1, partly boosted by weather, and then a little bit of a takeaway in Q2, how do you view that?	12.0	102.0
201607	1413	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And why would that make your forecast more negative about Q3 and Q4?	12.0	102.0
201607	1414	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	By our lights, starts and permits data have been disappointing over the past couple of months.	12.0	999.0
201607	1415	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	And, basically, the permits numbers, which give a much higher signal-to- noise ratio reading on the underlying pace of activity, have been about flat since December of last year.	12.0	999.0
201607	1416	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	So we marked down our near-term forecast of single-family permits from the June Tealbook to now.	12.0	999.0
201607	1417	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Now, part of the reason why the residential investment figure in the national income and product accounts is so strong in the first quarter was that there looks to have been a very large spike in single-family starts in February; the series for single-family starts is pretty noisy.	12.0	999.0
201607	1418	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	We think that most of that is just statistical noise around a much steadier trend that’s formed by the adjusted single-family permits.	12.0	999.0
201607	1419	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	The starts number does feed mechanically through in a distributed moving lag into the residential investment, but what we think basically is going on there is that the BEA is feeding through a distributed moving lag of noise into the national income and product accounts, and the permits numbers—which are not based on a sample but are essentially a census of permits issued across the country—just give a much smoother picture.	12.0	999.0
201607	1420	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	And those numbers continue to disappoint.	12.0	999.0
201607	1421	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	We’ve been steadily marking down our assessment.	12.0	999.0
201607	1422	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	We still think that the pace of construction is significantly below the demographically indicated pace of units to be added to the capital stock.	12.0	999.0
201607	1423	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with the latter point.	12.0	102.0
201607	1424	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I guess I’m going back to this characterization of residential construction as being soft when it’s been growing, whether there is statistical noise or not.	12.0	102.0
201607	1425	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	If it’s been growing very rapidly and it just doesn’t keep growing or it declines a little bit, that just seems a funny way to characterize residential construction.	12.0	102.0
201607	1426	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Permits have been basically moving sideways since the beginning of the year, and we think that’s just a much better gauge on the pace of activity.	12.0	999.0
201607	1427	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	John, is your concern that it’s an untrue statement, or is your concern that because it’s included in the statement, it suggests that the Committee is putting too much weight on it?	12.0	96.0
201607	1428	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course it’s the latter, right?	12.0	102.0
201607	1429	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Otherwise, I wouldn’t be talking about this.	12.0	102.0
201607	1430	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So if you look at business investment, that has been slow, negative for quarter after quarter—there’s no question that’s been a negative.	12.0	102.0
201607	1431	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But right after, we get a torrid—a term we used back in the ’90s—rate of growth in a category, 15.6 percent, and then it falls by—I think we’re writing down minus 3 percent for Q2, something like that—it just seems a little funny to describe that as a “soft” sector, as opposed to business investment, which has clearly has shown ongoing weakness rather than a big movement up and a little movement down.	12.0	102.0
201607	1432	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even though you’re saying permits are roughly flat, starts have moved up and then they’ve moved down, and it just seems it’s harder to describe to the public why something that has been growing very rapidly is “soft.”	12.0	102.0
201607	1433	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Of course, paragraph 1 is almost always characterized as something like “data received since the previous meeting,” so we’re not stretching back over to the beginning of the year.	12.0	96.0
201607	1434	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Right, but it’s the level—“soft” is a level in a way, I think.	12.0	102.0
201607	1435	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Look, I have some sympathy for your point, in the sense that I’m not putting a lot of weight on that softness,  But I agree with the staff that it is soft over that interval.	12.0	96.0
201607	1436	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	So is “soft” a relative or absolute term?	12.0	97.0
201607	1437	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Well, I would like to go back to what David said.	12.0	102.0
201607	1438	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The first-quarter growth rate was 15.6.	12.0	102.0
201607	1439	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So you said some of that is “noise.”	12.0	102.0
201607	1440	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even if we take that at face value, then you’re really just saying that you’re taking that noise out of Q2, right?	12.0	102.0
201607	1441	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	You’re saying that the level over the two quarters is going to be up by—I’m going to have to do this math in my head—15.6 minus 3.2 divided by 2.	12.0	102.0
201607	1442	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	12.0	102.0
201607	1443	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So the level is up quite a bit.	12.0	102.0
201607	1444	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Say there’s a little bit of noise that pushed up that Q1 number, and you’re taking that away in Q2.	12.0	102.0
201607	1445	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s still not soft, in my view.	12.0	102.0
201607	1446	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s really about quarterly growth rates having some ups and downs—a theme I’m going to come back to tomorrow—overemphasis on quarterly ups and downs in some of these data series.	12.0	102.0
201607	1447	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And we know that residential investment has a lot of quarterly volatility in it.	12.0	102.0
201607	1448	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	I really don’t want to go to the mat over this issue that’s worth a few basis points in terms of its contribution to GDP.	12.0	999.0
201607	1449	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	If we’re going to get out the number two pencil and put a really fine point on it, we were disappointed by the most recent data on starts and permits.	12.0	999.0
201607	1450	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	We’ve marked down our near-term trajectory for single-family permits—it’s a little lower, it’s a little flatter than what it has been before.	12.0	999.0
201607	1451	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	The trajectory of single-family permits is essentially flat since the beginning of the year.	12.0	999.0
201607	1452	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	To use Governor Tarullo’s typology, I guess my answer would be “yes,” it’s soft in relative terms and in absolute terms.	12.0	999.0
201607	1453	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	We’re significantly below where we think the demographically indicated or neutral level of construction is.	12.0	999.0
201607	1454	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	We’re not going to get there for years, and the most recent tranche of data was a little disappointing.	12.0	999.0
201607	1455	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, again, I’m going to drop it too—but in a moment.	12.0	102.0
201607	1456	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	12.0	102.0
201607	1457	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I will have an open mind.	12.0	102.0
201607	1458	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Our June statement said, “Since the beginning of the year, the housing sector has continued to improve.”	12.0	102.0
201607	1459	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So you would say, “That’s no longer as true as it used to be,” and you could just kill that sentence.	12.0	102.0
201607	1460	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But what we’ve done instead is to say, “Let’s kill the ‘has continued to improve’ and say ‘is soft.’ ”	12.0	102.0
201607	1461	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s two notches down.	12.0	102.0
201607	1462	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s all.	12.0	102.0
201607	1463	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m done.	12.0	102.0
201607	1464	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	12.0	102.0
201607	1465	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	102.0
201607	1466	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12.0	65.0
201607	1467	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions?	12.0	65.0
201607	1468	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	12.0	65.0
201607	1469	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think this probably goes to Steve.	12.0	108.0
201607	1470	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	On the broad real exchange rate, we talk about the massive appreciation of the dollar.	12.0	108.0
201607	1471	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’m looking at the Wilcox presentation, page 1, chart 3.	12.0	108.0
201607	1472	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	That shows that from the middle of 2014 to now, we went up from 93 or thereabouts to 110, and that the increase took place, in essence, over two years.	12.0	108.0
201607	1473	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Then we’ve basically got it just staying flat here.	12.0	108.0
201607	1474	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’m kind of puzzled, because whenever I listen to what we’re told about what the exchange rate has done, the story varies—“recent changes in the exchange rate reduced GDP growth 1½ percentage points, or ½ percentage point, or something.”	12.0	108.0
201607	1475	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And then I listen the next time, and that number has been changed because something else happened.	12.0	108.0
201607	1476	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So do we have a reliable set of data on what has happened to imports or exports because of the exchange rate, particularly imports?	12.0	108.0
201607	1477	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	I don’t have that off the top of my head, but I could certainly calculate that for you.	12.0	999.0
201607	1478	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	I will say that a couple of things are worth pointing out.	12.0	999.0
201607	1479	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Broadly speaking, our exports over the past year or so have been flat.	12.0	999.0
201607	1480	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	And that would compare in some kind of steady state—normal conditions—with export growth of 3 to 5 percent.	12.0	999.0
201607	1481	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	So, very clearly, the rise in the dollar has depressed the growth of exports.	12.0	999.0
201607	1482	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Now, the rise in the dollar should have also led, given normal GDP growth in the United States, to strong increases in imports.	12.0	999.0
201607	1483	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	And as a result of that, we should have seen pretty substantial subtractions from GDP growth from net exports.	12.0	999.0
201607	1484	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	We actually have not seen that in the past few quarters.	12.0	999.0
201607	1485	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	In the first quarter, net exports actually contributed 0.1 percentage point to US GDP growth.	12.0	999.0
201607	1486	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	In the second, we estimate that it subtracted about one-tenth, and there were similarly smaller numbers in the last quarters of 2015.	12.0	999.0
201607	1487	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	With the dollar depressing exports pretty much as we would expect, the mystery in some sense is why imports have been so weak.	12.0	999.0
201607	1488	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	And one possibility, of course, is that somehow exchange rates no longer are a relative price that would affect the choice between domestic and imported goods.	12.0	999.0
201607	1489	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	We have no reason to believe that is the case, although we are certainly exploring that.	12.0	999.0
201607	1490	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Our best hypothesis as to what’s going on is that some components of US domestic spending that are particularly intensive in imports, particularly consumer durables and equipment investment, have been quite weak, and that has been exerting a downward effect on imports.	12.0	999.0
201607	1491	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	That hypothesis is substantiated, or at least given support by, the fact that models that we’ve estimated in which imports rely not on aggregate GDP growth but rather on the growth of those particular expenditure components I just mentioned do a better job of explaining the weakness of imports recently.	12.0	999.0
201607	1492	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	By that metric, the reason that net exports are not taking away as much from GDP growth as we might imagine is not because the exchange rate appreciation has had no effect, but rather because other shocks to domestic spending have offset.	12.0	999.0
201607	1493	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	So, by and large, we think the exchange rate mechanism still works.	12.0	999.0
201607	1494	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Appreciation of the dollar has, indeed, cooled exports, but other developments in domestic spending have offset the exchange rate effect and depressed imports and have thus led to a smaller net exports drag than we might have anticipated.	12.0	999.0
201607	1495	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	And that the dollar appreciation probably plays some role in explaining why investment has been as weak as it has been.	12.0	999.0
201607	1496	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Oh, absolutely.	12.0	999.0
201607	1497	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Right.	12.0	999.0
201607	1498	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	That’s a good point because that would be a knock-on effect that would not be captured just by the net exports components.	12.0	999.0
201607	1499	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	In other words, if manufacturers and exporters more generally were very chagrined about their future profitability prospects, and they reduced investment, that would not show up in net exports, exactly, but it would still be a drag on US GDP growth attributable to the appreciation of the dollar.	12.0	999.0
201607	1500	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	12.0	108.0
201607	1501	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	12.0	108.0
201607	1502	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	So just to put our dirty laundry out a little further, it’s not unusual for us to be unable to trace dollar effects in the neat way to net exports so that the arithmetic lines up.	12.0	999.0
201607	1503	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Nonetheless, when we take more of a top-line view of real GDP overall, the model estimates are loose and imprecise, but they are rules of thumb, which were the basis for the figures that I cited.	12.0	999.0
201607	1504	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	They continue to point to magnitudes of overall GDP effects that are in line with what we’ve got built in.	12.0	999.0
201607	1505	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	It’s an uncomfortable fact that tracing it through only to exports and imports doesn’t work very well.	12.0	999.0
201607	1506	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks.	12.0	108.0
201607	1507	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions?	12.0	65.0
201607	1508	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	12.0	65.0
201607	1509	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	12.0	81.0
201607	1510	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I was wondering what you know about why you now expect such a large drop in defense in the second quarter—the revision happened over just one meeting.	12.0	81.0
201607	1511	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Also, is there payback?	12.0	81.0
201607	1512	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And do you spread out the payback?	12.0	81.0
201607	1513	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	We’ve been surprised by how weak defense spending has been.	12.0	999.0
201607	1514	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Glenn Follette is here and can provide more details.	12.0	999.0
201607	1515	2016-07-27	meeting	FOLLETTE	Yes, we’ve been surprised at how weak defense spending has been.	12.0	999.0
201607	1516	2016-07-27	meeting	FOLLETTE	[Laughter]	12.0	999.0
201607	1517	2016-07-27	meeting	FOLLETTE	That’s the reason for the large downswing in our Q2 forecast.	12.0	999.0
201607	1518	2016-07-27	meeting	FOLLETTE	We expect that spending should come back, but it’s not guaranteed to come back next quarter and could be spread out over time.	12.0	999.0
201607	1519	2016-07-27	meeting	FOLLETTE	And so in the forecast we have defense spending coming back over the next couple of years.	12.0	999.0
201607	1520	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	One way to put it, in sort of Washington-area lingo, is that—Glenn, help me out here—there’s been no surprise in defense appropriations, but for reasons not particularly apparent to us the spend-out from the appropriations has just been slower than expected.	12.0	999.0
201607	1521	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	However, it’s going to be in the pipeline.	12.0	999.0
201607	1522	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	We haven’t, as Glenn mentioned, built an immediate snapback in the level, but they will get those authorizations spent eventually.	12.0	999.0
201607	1523	2016-07-27	meeting	FOLLETTE	So the appropriations that they approved last December are for a fiscal year, but those typically get spent out over a period of four or five years—about 60 percent in the first year and the rest after that.	12.0	999.0
201607	1524	2016-07-27	meeting	FOLLETTE	But it’s not always 60 percent—55, 65, whatever—so there’s some noise in the series.	12.0	999.0
201607	1525	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	12.0	81.0
201607	1526	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	For what it’s worth, a contact of ours, a director in a large defense contracting firm, when asked about this, cited some large contracts whose awards were delayed.	12.0	81.0
201607	1527	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Our contact also suggested that at this time of the year—in an election year, with a change of administration—typically, a lot of the workforce who do the contract awards leave, so there are sometimes some delays from that as well, but it could come back in a couple of quarters after that.	12.0	81.0
201607	1528	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So I’ll have to wait and see.	12.0	81.0
201607	1529	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Thanks.	12.0	81.0
201607	1530	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions?	12.0	65.0
201607	1531	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	12.0	65.0
201607	1532	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12.0	65.0
201607	1533	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	There’s an opportunity now to comment on financial stability issues, and I’ve got two people on the list.	94.0	65.0
201607	1534	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Anybody else who wishes to comment is welcome to do so as well.	94.0	65.0
201607	1535	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	94.0	65.0
201607	1536	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	90.0
201607	1537	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The QS report highlights the fact that CRE overvaluation remains a concern.	94.0	90.0
201607	1538	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It concludes that the effects of a sizable decline in CRE prices on financial stability are likely to be small.	94.0	90.0
201607	1539	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I remain concerned that the financial-stability risks associated with CRE are elevated.	94.0	90.0
201607	1540	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Out of the $3.6 trillion total commercial mortgages and multifamily residential mortgages, $1.8 trillion are held by the banking system.	94.0	90.0
201607	1541	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Among asset classes held by leveraged institutions, it is large, although not concentrated in particularly large institutions.	94.0	90.0
201607	1542	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is also true that a significant decline in the CRE market is unlikely to occur in isolation.	94.0	90.0
201607	1543	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, if the economy does weaken, I expect that a large decline in CRE collateral value risks significantly reducing access to credit to all but the most creditworthy borrowers.	94.0	90.0
201607	1544	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Such conditions conform well to the classic determinants of financial-stability problems—collateral values fall, and payment streams are interrupted.	94.0	90.0
201607	1545	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Commercial and residential price declines account for most of the significant international financial problems in the postwar period in advanced countries.	94.0	90.0
201607	1546	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Once prices fall, it is obviously too late to act preemptively.	94.0	90.0
201607	1547	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, now is a great time to test the effectiveness of our preventive actions—a time when persistently low interest rates are encouraging “reach-for-yield” behavior that may eventually be disruptive.	94.0	90.0
201607	1548	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	One simple anecdote illustrates my concern.	94.0	90.0
201607	1549	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In the third quarter of 2014, my staff produced a table of banks with the highest ratios of total CRE to risk-based capital.	94.0	90.0
201607	1550	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Among those 50 institutions, 11 have already failed.	94.0	90.0
201607	1551	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	My concern is particularly heightened because these banks have been unable to survive despite an improving economy, low interest rates, and generally rising commercial real estate prices.	94.0	90.0
201607	1552	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	These 11 banks with high CRE concentration levels represent the preponderance of the total 15 bank failures that have occurred recently.	94.0	90.0
201607	1553	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	While failing in the current environment is likely illustrative of problems well beyond just commercial real estate exposure, there would seem to be an exposure level that is sufficiently high that it reflects poorly on management decisions and results in an unsafe and unsound practice that should be limited.	94.0	90.0
201607	1554	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	90.0
201607	1555	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201607	1556	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	94.0	65.0
201607	1557	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	91.0
201607	1558	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Over the past several weeks, we have heard a good deal of talk about investors reaching for yield.	94.0	91.0
201607	1559	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	In using the word “reach,” this terminology presupposes elements of exuberance.	94.0	91.0
201607	1560	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	But when you dig into some details, the recent commentary seems different than the kind of reach-for-yield behavior that often flashes red with respect to financial instability concerns.	94.0	91.0
201607	1561	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	That kind of behavior represents short-term, speculative hot money—chasing nickels in front of steamrollers—with an eye toward a quick and seemingly costless exit through rapidly closing doors when all rates begin to rise.	94.0	91.0
201607	1562	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Yikes.	94.0	97.0
201607	1563	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	94.0	97.0
201607	1564	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’ll keep an open mind.	94.0	108.0
201607	1565	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	94.0	108.0
201607	1566	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	It’s the kind of stuff that gave us the 2013 taper tantrum.	94.0	91.0
201607	1567	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	At the moment, I don’t see this kind of activity as being behind recent market moves.	94.0	91.0
201607	1568	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Rather, to me, the recent behavior looks more like a capitulation to permanently low yields.	94.0	91.0
201607	1569	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	For example, our bank’s insurance financial monitoring team recently hosted a meeting for President Lockhart and me with seven life insurance executives.	94.0	91.0
201607	1570	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	We heard about some substantial reassessments by real money managers with long investment horizons, and, of course, insurance companies are one big piece of this group.	94.0	91.0
201607	1571	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Many of these long-duration asset managers seem to be coming around to the view that persistently slow potential output growth here and abroad will keep real interest rates low for a long time—longer than they likely acknowledged one, two, or even three years ago.	94.0	91.0
201607	1572	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	These investors now seem resigned to locking in the yields they currently can get on safe longer-term fixed-income instruments.	94.0	91.0
201607	1573	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	This investment behavior also seems consistent with what we’re hearing from issuers of highly rated corporate debt.	94.0	91.0
201607	1574	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	For instance, a contact at Ford referred to an astonishing fixed-income market in which high-quality debt is routinely oversubscribed.	94.0	91.0
201607	1575	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I think the capitulation hypothesis has implications for our thinking about financial vulnerability surrounding potential future monetary policy moves.	94.0	91.0
201607	1576	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Real money investors resigned to lower rates in the long run seem less likely to think that an unexpected tightening will lead to substantially higher longer-term rates.	94.0	91.0
201607	1577	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Rather, such tightening would simply flatten the yield curve.	94.0	91.0
201607	1578	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	This implies a reduced risk of outsized and persistent increases in longer-term interest rates if we have to raise policy rates somewhat more quickly than what is currently envisioned in the SEPs.	94.0	91.0
201607	1579	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Put another way, perhaps it is more the case that the decline in longer- term interest rates we’ve seen in the past year or so reflects lower expected policy rates over the longer term as opposed to the large declines in term premium, such as those estimated by our stationary mean-reverting affine finance models.	94.0	91.0
201607	1580	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	91.0
201607	1581	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201607	1582	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Is there anybody else who would like to comment on financial stability issues?	94.0	65.0
201607	1583	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	You’re welcome to weigh in.	94.0	65.0
201607	1584	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	94.0	65.0
201607	1585	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	94.0	65.0
201607	1586	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing no takers, I suggest we begin our go-round on the economy, starting with President Rosengren.	13.0	65.0
201607	1587	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201607	1588	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Since our previous FOMC meeting, stock prices are up, the 10-year Treasury yield has declined, credit spreads have narrowed, the VIX is below average, and the trade-weighted exchange rate is little changed.	13.0	90.0
201607	1589	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	While the Brexit vote is likely to have negative economic ramifications for the United Kingdom and possibly for Europe, to date the effect on US financial data has been quite benign.	13.0	90.0
201607	1590	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In addition, while we do not have much real data that reflect the post-Brexit period, the data just before Brexit were positive.	13.0	90.0
201607	1591	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	For example, employment rebounded strongly in June, allaying many of the concerns raised by the weak May employment report.	13.0	90.0
201607	1592	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Not surprisingly, in light of the generally positive news, my forecast has changed little.	13.0	90.0
201607	1593	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It remains slightly more positive than the Tealbook forecast for the end of 2016, with real GDP slightly higher, core PCE inflation slightly higher, and the unemployment rate slightly lower.	13.0	90.0
201607	1594	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In essence, it looks quite similar to the July Blue Chip forecasts of these variables.	13.0	90.0
201607	1595	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Specifically, my forecast for the end of the year has an unemployment rate of 4.7 percent and core PCE only somewhat below 2 percent.	13.0	90.0
201607	1596	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, I expect us to be quite close to achieving our dual mandate by the end of the year.	13.0	90.0
201607	1597	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Hence, it is not surprising that my forecast includes two increases in the funds rate this year, in September and December.	13.0	90.0
201607	1598	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is notable that the Tealbook expects the unemployment rate to fall to 4.3 percent by 2018.	13.0	90.0
201607	1599	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is also notable that all of the scenarios modeled in the Tealbook result in an unemployment rate of 4.3 percent or lower, with the exception of the “Severe Financial Stress in Europe” scenario.	13.0	90.0
201607	1600	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I am comfortable probing to determine how low the natural rate of unemployment may be, I view 4.3 percent as more of a plunge than a probe.	13.0	90.0
201607	1601	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is not that tight labor markets have no benefits.	13.0	90.0
201607	1602	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would like somewhat tighter labor markets than what we have now to offset some of the labor scarring that occurred in the Great Recession.	13.0	90.0
201607	1603	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, history shows that when the unemployment rate gets as low as 4.3 percent, monetary policy tightens in an attempt to raise the unemployment rate back to full employment.	13.0	90.0
201607	1604	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	But, almost always, our attempt to achieve a smooth landing ends poorly, as the unemployment rate responds much more than intended, resulting in a recession.	13.0	90.0
201607	1605	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	What is striking when looking at unemployment over time is how rarely we are able to keep unemployment rates near anyone’s estimate of full employment for an extended period.	13.0	90.0
201607	1606	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Put differently, part of achieving maximum employment is avoiding significant overshooting of full employment and the recession that typically follows.	13.0	90.0
201607	1607	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	One possibility for caution in continuing the normalization of the funds rate might be heightened uncertainty.	13.0	90.0
201607	1608	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The buoyant stock market suggests that this uncertainty is not weighing heavily on market participants.	13.0	90.0
201607	1609	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The widely used VIX measure of uncertainty is currently well below its norm.	13.0	90.0
201607	1610	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	A new, broader measure of uncertainty is the news-based Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, which is available daily.	13.0	90.0
201607	1611	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	After being low for most of the year, it spiked for a day or two on the Brexit news and is once again at relatively low levels.	13.0	90.0
201607	1612	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	One might think that greater uncertainty would lead some forecasters to predict more dire economic outcomes.	13.0	90.0
201607	1613	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Instead, the Blue Chip’s July survey of forecasters reported the average of the 10 highest forecasts of unemployment at the end of 2016 and 2017 at 4.9 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively.	13.0	90.0
201607	1614	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Perhaps the greatest tail risk right now is the one modeled in the Tealbook as “Severe Financial Stress in Europe.”	13.0	90.0
201607	1615	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In that scenario, the unemployment rate peaks at 5.1 percent in 2017.	13.0	90.0
201607	1616	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Even so, we continue to raise the federal funds rate but at a slower rate than in the baseline and still noticeably faster than markets currently expect.	13.0	90.0
201607	1617	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In summary, I expect that we are likely to be close to both elements of our dual mandate by the end of the year, and I do not see the risks to the economy as being particularly elevated.	13.0	90.0
201607	1618	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I will discuss tomorrow what that implies for policy.	13.0	90.0
201607	1619	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201607	1620	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	1621	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13.0	65.0
201607	1622	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	81.0
201607	1623	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Both of the Fifth District surveys, just released this morning, improved in July and are now in positive territory.	13.0	81.0
201607	1624	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	On the manufacturing side, the composite index swung from minus 10 to plus 10, and the new orders component swung from minus 17 to plus 15.	13.0	81.0
201607	1625	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	On the services side, the overall revenue index rose from plus 2 to plus 8.	13.0	81.0
201607	1626	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	The wage indexes are strongly positive across all sectors.	13.0	81.0
201607	1627	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	At the national level, in my mind, the overall outlook has not changed appreciably since the June meeting.	13.0	81.0
201607	1628	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Consumer spending gains are likely to account for most of the growth in real GDP this year, and the June retail sales report increased my confidence in the outlook for consumption.	13.0	81.0
201607	1629	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Other sectors are likely to contribute less to overall economic growth.	13.0	81.0
201607	1630	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Recent data suggest that homebuilding may have flattened out.	13.0	81.0
201607	1631	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We continue to hear frequent reports of residential construction being limited by shortages of buildable lots and skilled workers, so supply-side factors rather than softer demand may be what’s limiting residential investment.	13.0	81.0
201607	1632	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	This view is consistent with the home price inflation that we see in the CoreLogic repeat sales index and would point toward “soft” not quite the right adjective for the housing market.	13.0	81.0
201607	1633	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Although business investment remains weak overall, there’s been at least some positive news.	13.0	81.0
201607	1634	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In the latest estimate of first-quarter GDP, the growth rate for real intellectual property investment was revised from basically zero to more than 4 percent.	13.0	81.0
201607	1635	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And with the price of petroleum now above $40 per barrel, the rig count has ticked up, suggesting that spending on new oil and gas wells has bottomed out.	13.0	81.0
201607	1636	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Along with the Tealbook, I expect investment in nonresidential structures to begin to grow again in the third quarter.	13.0	81.0
201607	1637	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	There are even some signs of near-term firming in equipment.	13.0	81.0
201607	1638	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	For example, one of our roundtable members from the trade association representing what we used to call “machine tools”—they call themselves the Association for Manufacturing Technology now—reported a substantial increase in requests for price quotations in recent months.	13.0	81.0
201607	1639	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	At the end of each quarter, he surveys, a couple of dozen contacts within the industry.	13.0	81.0
201607	1640	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	He expects the price quotations to lead to increased orders later this year and bases that on the rate at which these are converted.	13.0	81.0
201607	1641	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	They’re expecting a good finish to 2016 and things to pick up in 2017 by10 to 20 percent.	13.0	81.0
201607	1642	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	This seems consistent with the Tealbook outlook for investment in equipment.	13.0	81.0
201607	1643	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	My overall outlook, then, is for strong growth in consumer spending and improving growth in business investment to offset a slowdown in housing and yield 2 percent real GDP growth for the next few quarters.	13.0	81.0
201607	1644	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In the labor market, I think we should see falling employment growth this year and very little further decline in the unemployment rate.	13.0	81.0
201607	1645	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	With the benefit of the June employment report, it now seems clear that the May payroll number was a fluke.	13.0	81.0
201607	1646	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	That said, employment growth has averaged 147,000 jobs per month in the second quarter compared with 229,000 jobs per month last year.	13.0	81.0
201607	1647	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So it’s pretty clear that we’ve seen some step-down in employment growth.	13.0	81.0
201607	1648	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But even at the current pace, the employment-to-population ratio would continue to rise, and that seems unlikely to go on for much longer.	13.0	81.0
201607	1649	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	As I’ve been arguing since the beginning of the year, I think we should be prepared to see monthly job growth continue to fall, consistent with convergence to a more sustainable steady-state trajectory, notwithstanding President Rosengren’s caution about actually being able to achieve that.	13.0	81.0
201607	1650	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	On inflation, I would note that in December, the Tealbook was forecasting 1.4 percent core PCE inflation for both Q1 and Q2 of this year.	13.0	81.0
201607	1651	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Now the forecast is for 1.9 percent for the first half, but the forecast for the second half is basically unchanged.	13.0	81.0
201607	1652	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Some of that first-half miss can plausibly be attributed to one-time factors and residual seasonality.	13.0	81.0
201607	1653	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But I doubt that all of the pickup in core inflation in the first half is going to prove short lived, so I’m expecting core inflation in the second half to come in close to 2 percent as well.	13.0	81.0
201607	1654	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	13.0	81.0
201607	1655	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	1656	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13.0	65.0
201607	1657	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201607	1658	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	If we remember where we were six to seven weeks ago, that’s when we decided that the situation was significantly unclear.	13.0	108.0
201607	1659	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	First, we had the May hiring figure, which we then thought was 70,000—and now know to be 11,000—and we were worried that something bad was going on in the labor market.	13.0	108.0
201607	1660	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And then we had the UK referendum just a little less than a week after the meeting, and there was no good reason whatever to make a decision before we knew what happened there.	13.0	108.0
201607	1661	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So we had two reasons.	13.0	108.0
201607	1662	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Now we have come through both those reasons pretty well.	13.0	108.0
201607	1663	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	The employment number came out at 287,000 for June, as you know, and a little bit of arithmetic made that to be 147,000 per month over the previous three months, which was less than we had forecast four months ago but well above the estimates we have of how much hiring you need in order to keep the unemployment rate from rising.	13.0	108.0
201607	1664	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So that looked okay.	13.0	108.0
201607	1665	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And then we had to think about Brexit, if you’ll excuse the expression.	13.0	108.0
201607	1666	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I happened to be near the scene of the crime and woke up at about 2:30 in the morning and turned on the TV, and it was clear it was going to be a disaster, so I went back to sleep.	13.0	108.0
201607	1667	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	13.0	108.0
201607	1668	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	At 5:30 or so you got the truth.	13.0	108.0
201607	1669	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	That Friday morning there were quite a few people from the UK in the seminar we were in, and they and we all were feeling very unhappy, and we could imagine terrible scenarios of the breakup of the European Union and all sorts of things that were going to happen.	13.0	108.0
201607	1670	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, where are we now?	13.0	108.0
201607	1671	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We shouldn’t, I think, delude ourselves that the United Kingdom is in for an easy time.	13.0	108.0
201607	1672	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	They have got a lot of negotiating to do.	13.0	108.0
201607	1673	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We always want structural change in Europe.	13.0	108.0
201607	1674	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, the British are undertaking a massive structural change.	13.0	108.0
201607	1675	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	They are going to have to renegotiate their entire set of external relations.	13.0	108.0
201607	1676	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	That’s a lot of work.	13.0	108.0
201607	1677	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And then they’re going to have to actually implement what they negotiated.	13.0	108.0
201607	1678	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So this is going to take a long time.	13.0	108.0
201607	1679	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	It’s going to be complicated and probably take five years until they have done most of what they need to do.	13.0	108.0
201607	1680	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And during that time we will get bumped around from time to time.	13.0	108.0
201607	1681	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	In negotiations like that there are always crisis points, and there are late-night negotiations and concern that the thing is about to break down, and at three o’clock in the morning it transpires that they got a compromise, and so forth.	13.0	108.0
201607	1682	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’re going to see those things coming our way from time to time, and they’re going to make our environment a little bit more bumpy than we would have wanted, but they will make it a lot more bumpy for the United Kingdom, and they could make it more bumpy for the rest of Europe.	13.0	108.0
201607	1683	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	There are very worrying scenarios about the future of the European Union.	13.0	108.0
201607	1684	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	According to people I speak to and read about, the reaction in Europe actually, at this stage, is, “Gosh, we don’t want to be in the situation like the British are in at the moment.”	13.0	108.0
201607	1685	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So they think it strengthened the European Union.	13.0	108.0
201607	1686	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	However this is after a month- plus, and the actual events are going to play out over several years.	13.0	108.0
201607	1687	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We know very little about what’s actually going to happen.	13.0	108.0
201607	1688	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think that in terms of the United States, the United Kingdom is relatively small from our perspective, with the exception of the financial side, and that the effect on us will come in part through whether our banks stay in London and what happens to London as a great financial center.	13.0	108.0
201607	1689	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	At this moment, the Europeans think they are going to attract it all to Europe.	13.0	108.0
201607	1690	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	That’s not entirely clear, but one hears stories about our banks planning their moves or moves of part of their corporations.	13.0	108.0
201607	1691	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	The first political news in the United Kingdom was the public opinion poll taken earlier this week, which showed people being very shocked and expectations being very negative.	13.0	108.0
201607	1692	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	The Bank of England has made it clear it’s going to do something at its August decision, and the ECB has been a little less clear that it’s going to do something.	13.0	108.0
201607	1693	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	But both of them seem to think they’re going to do packages—that is, that it won’t be just an interest rate reduction, but an interest rate reduction and some other elements of QE or possibly forward guidance or whatever there is in the bag of tricks at that point.	13.0	108.0
201607	1694	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So something positive will come out of all that, but we’re fairly ignorant.	13.0	108.0
201607	1695	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	There hasn’t been a great deal of evidence of difficulty in the capital markets.	13.0	108.0
201607	1696	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	In the case of the United Kingdom, the pound depreciated, as one would have expected.	13.0	108.0
201607	1697	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Interest rates are down significantly, as one would have expected.	13.0	108.0
201607	1698	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Bank share prices are down a long way, and there were rumors of liquidity difficulties in the first days after the referendum, and then there were those real estate mutual funds that had to suspend withdrawals.	13.0	108.0
201607	1699	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	But it wasn’t a huge thing.	13.0	108.0
201607	1700	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	For the United States, aside from our banks, there hasn’t been a whole lot of the share market that’s been very affected.	13.0	108.0
201607	1701	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So it hasn’t been big for us and probably won’t be big for us, provided we continue to manage ourselves well.	13.0	108.0
201607	1702	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	But what about conditions in our economy?	13.0	108.0
201607	1703	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’m impressed by the robustness of what has been happening.	13.0	108.0
201607	1704	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I keep thinking of the fact that we’ve just had a series of negative shocks.	13.0	108.0
201607	1705	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I feel very guilty about this, because when I arrived at the IMF in 1994, my arrival was followed three months later by the Mexican crisis, and there was a crisis every few months until the Argentine crisis when I left, and then nothing happened for three or four years.	13.0	108.0
201607	1706	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	13.0	108.0
201607	1707	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	They were worried about having a crisis without you there, Stan.	13.0	97.0
201607	1708	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	That’s right.	13.0	108.0
201607	1709	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So I feel a little bit guilty about all of these things that have happened to us.	13.0	108.0
201607	1710	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	But after the things that have happened to us over the past year or so, including the Chinese letting their exchange rate go—which they seem to be continuing to do in a very controlled manner at the moment as well—and then Brexit and a succession of things that worried us, the economy looks quite similar to what it looked like before except that we’re on a lower path.	13.0	108.0
201607	1711	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Economic growth has been down a little bit, but we’re expecting a catch-up.	13.0	108.0
201607	1712	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And somewhere in this economy and in the labor market, in ways we, or at least I, don’t understand there’s something very robust that’s been happening for a lot of years as employment growth continues, except for that terrible month that worried us.	13.0	108.0
201607	1713	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	If you look at the components of aggregate demand, PCE growth has contributed in a major way to GDP growth.	13.0	108.0
201607	1714	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Investment continues to be weak.	13.0	108.0
201607	1715	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t know if we can call investment performance “weak.”	13.0	108.0
201607	1716	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Investment has been weak for a long time, and I think we may just be at a new normal on investment, although there are some stories now about US oil production beginning to come back, and that would presumably bring with it some of the associated investment whose disappearance helped reduce aggregate investment for the US economy.	13.0	108.0
201607	1717	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	If you look at the rest of the world, Europe is very unknowable.	13.0	108.0
201607	1718	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	The Chinese are somewhere around 6 percent, which is fairly good.	13.0	108.0
201607	1719	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	But the nature of Chinese economic growth has changed, and it’s less investment intensive, so they’re importing less from the rest of the world than they used to.	13.0	108.0
201607	1720	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	It seems that what they were importing was based more on an acceleration model than on a straightforward multiplier model, and so that’s a slowdown.	13.0	108.0
201607	1721	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And then Latin America is just changing disaster places.	13.0	108.0
201607	1722	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Now we’ve got Venezuela instead of Argentina and so forth, but there are some positive signs there.	13.0	108.0
201607	1723	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Africa doesn’t look very good.	13.0	108.0
201607	1724	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	India does look very good.	13.0	108.0
201607	1725	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So the rest of the world is not terrible, but it’s not great.	13.0	108.0
201607	1726	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	If we look at other things that might happen here, the money market mutual fund reforms that are coming seem to me to be bothersome, but they’re all anticipated, so maybe they’re not going to be a bother.	13.0	108.0
201607	1727	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think we can take some comfort in the fiscal policies we’re going to get whoever wins the elections, because, as far as I can see, both candidates are going to raise spending.	13.0	108.0
201607	1728	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	One’s going to cut taxes—that’s expansionary.	13.0	108.0
201607	1729	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	The other’s going to raise spending.	13.0	108.0
201607	1730	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So a year from now we could have a fiscally driven expansion, if all works out, and that will be good for us.	13.0	108.0
201607	1731	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	But, unfortunately, I don’t know if we’re going to have that.	13.0	108.0
201607	1732	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I won’t make any policy recommendations until tomorrow, but we’re in a situation that is way better than we feared it might be at our previous meeting, and we’re just probably going to wait a little while to see if the situation continues to strengthen.	13.0	108.0
201607	1733	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you very much, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201607	1734	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	1735	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13.0	65.0
201607	1736	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201607	1737	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I read the incoming data as largely consistent with the view of the economy summarized as follows:  continuing moderate economic growth, near full employment but with some absorbable slack remaining, and signs of gradually rising price pressures with associated movement toward the Committee’s target.	13.0	88.0
201607	1738	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	My Bank’s tracking estimate for the second quarter now rests at a 2.4 percent annualized rate, a little stronger than the number in the Tealbook.	13.0	88.0
201607	1739	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In terms of the composition of GDP growth in the second quarter, distinctions between our assessment of the second quarter and the Tealbook are minor.	13.0	88.0
201607	1740	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Business investment remains soft, and that softness is broad based.	13.0	88.0
201607	1741	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The current strength of the economy is largely based on the strength of consumer activity.	13.0	88.0
201607	1742	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Reports from our retail contacts in my District this cycle confirm the strength in consumer spending.	13.0	88.0
201607	1743	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Most retailers reported healthy sales levels and a relatively optimistic outlook for the remainder of 2016.	13.0	88.0
201607	1744	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Tourism remains solid, and we heard of a shift in the composition of demand away from international visitors and toward domestic travelers.	13.0	88.0
201607	1745	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In recent meetings, I’ve passed along reports of our director who heads the nation’s largest auto retailer.	13.0	88.0
201607	1746	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	He continues to report very high sales volumes but cautions that high fleet sales are in the mix, and consumer sales are being maintained by substantial discounts and incentives.	13.0	88.0
201607	1747	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Whereas, after the May employment report, there seemed to me to be some disconnect between data and anecdote, recent reports from our business contacts in the Sixth District are mostly consistent with my read of the incoming data.	13.0	88.0
201607	1748	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	My outlook for the economy remains unchanged from the June meeting and from my last SEP submission.	13.0	88.0
201607	1749	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	My outlook resembles this meeting’s Tealbook, with the only exception being that my forecast anticipates a slightly faster closing to the inflation target.	13.0	88.0
201607	1750	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Recent retail price reports are broadly in line with my assumption of firming inflation readings.	13.0	88.0
201607	1751	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	These reports have been encouraging but not definitive.	13.0	88.0
201607	1752	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	My staff cautions that recent component price movements underlying the inflation reports exhibit unusual disparity.	13.0	88.0
201607	1753	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	A key assumption in my outlook is an improvement in the pace of business investment.	13.0	88.0
201607	1754	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	This assumption carries some risk.	13.0	88.0
201607	1755	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In the most recent contact cycle, my team took every opportunity to probe thinking on capital spending.	13.0	88.0
201607	1756	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	While most of our conversations suggested some longer-term optimism about prospects for expansionary, capacity-building cap-ex, we heard little that would suggest a near-term resurgence in spending.	13.0	88.0
201607	1757	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Current capital investment is depicted mostly as replacement, oriented toward productivity improvement, or focused on cost takeout.	13.0	88.0
201607	1758	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Some contacts mentioned their excess capacity; we also heard comments on new foreign-sourced product competition responding to global capacity and the stronger dollar.	13.0	88.0
201607	1759	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	A number of companies repeated that M&A is their preferred growth strategy.	13.0	88.0
201607	1760	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Acquisitions bring their own incremental revenues and demand.	13.0	88.0
201607	1761	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Firms continue to be cautious about assumptions of organic growth.	13.0	88.0
201607	1762	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Businesses continue to report little in the way of direct pricing power.	13.0	88.0
201607	1763	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I would note, however, that some retailers indicated that price promotions had eased.	13.0	88.0
201607	1764	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Other firms indicated that they have been able to capture and retain commodity cost reductions in their margins.	13.0	88.0
201607	1765	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Finally, a number of public companies noted greater pressure coming from investors to justify capital investments and, implicitly, higher return hurdles and shorter payback horizons.	13.0	88.0
201607	1766	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	So business fixed investment is a sphere of activity in which anecdotal feedback is not currently lining up well with my forecast assumption.	13.0	88.0
201607	1767	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	At this time, I’m prepared to treat business fixed investment as a risk—the risk being a failure to realize an assumed upside.	13.0	88.0
201607	1768	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	If improved business investment does not materialize, the outlook on which I’m premising further policy rate increases cannot easily rely on personal consumption in isolation.	13.0	88.0
201607	1769	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Investment, enhanced productivity growth, wage growth, and rising business and consumer confidence must be part of the picture.	13.0	88.0
201607	1770	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Others have commented on the uncertainty factors associated with Brexit.	13.0	88.0
201607	1771	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The outcome of the July 23 Brexit referendum seems to have affected business confidence in the immediate aftermath, but recent soundings suggest that concern among business leaders in my District is modest.	13.0	88.0
201607	1772	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In the week following the referendum, we got 244 responses to a survey of CEOs and CFOs, and roughly one-third indicated Brexit had introduced some uncertainty into their individual business outlooks.	13.0	88.0
201607	1773	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In a second survey a week later of nearly 400 CEOs and CFOs, the portion of firms reporting Brexit affecting their sales had dropped sharply to only about 15 percent.	13.0	88.0
201607	1774	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	So I’m satisfied that we’ve gotten beyond the immediate uncertainty that drove the Committee’s caution at the June meeting, and I see the appropriate focus in coming weeks being mostly on domestic economic performance.	13.0	88.0
201607	1775	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201607	1776	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	1777	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13.0	65.0
201607	1778	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201607	1779	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	At the time of the June meeting, three factors raised concerns about the economy’s underlying momentum.	13.0	104.0
201607	1780	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	First, economic growth appeared to have downshifted from its long-time post-crisis path of about 2 percent.	13.0	104.0
201607	1781	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Second, payroll growth seemed to be slowing, possibly quite sharply.	13.0	104.0
201607	1782	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	A third factor was the impending referendum, to use the Kamin-friendly term.	13.0	104.0
201607	1783	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Since the June meeting, incoming data have provided some reassurance on all three fronts.	13.0	104.0
201607	1784	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Most forecasts show second-quarter GDP rebounding nicely to the mid-2s, although, at 1.8 percent, our Tealbook forecast is lower than that and at the low end of the estimates.	13.0	104.0
201607	1785	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	And the BEA, of course, will provide a first official estimate for second-quarter GDP growth later this week.	13.0	104.0
201607	1786	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The June payroll report was surprisingly strong, as has been noted.	13.0	104.0
201607	1787	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	And the referendum vote, while a surprise, seems likely to have little near-term implications for the US outlook.	13.0	104.0
201607	1788	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Turning to economic growth, GDP growth has now been only 1.6 percent over the past four quarters ending in the second quarter, taking the staff forecast for the second quarter.	13.0	104.0
201607	1789	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The same figure for the four quarters ending in the second quarter of 2015, as Glenn Follette pointed out yesterday, was 1 full percentage point higher.	13.0	104.0
201607	1790	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	A good part of that downshift has been in business investment, which goes well beyond the energy sector, for which low oil prices provide a sufficient explanation for the decline.	13.0	104.0
201607	1791	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	And, of course, a lower path for cap-ex reduces the likelihood that we will see a near-term rebound from the awful productivity growth we have had.	13.0	104.0
201607	1792	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	It’s also a signal perhaps that businesses’ expectations for further growth have moved down, as a Tealbook box indicated.	13.0	104.0
201607	1793	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	And then, echoing what President Lockhart just said, it’s hard to see, as a matter of arithmetic, how we get back to sustainable 2 percent GDP growth without higher investment as another engine of demand.	13.0	104.0
201607	1794	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Consumption alone is not likely to be a strong enough engine.	13.0	104.0
201607	1795	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The 15 percent or so appreciation of the dollar since mid-2014 has been weighing on demand through net exports, including some that is counted as E&I spending.	13.0	104.0
201607	1796	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	If the dollar remains broadly stable, that effect should wane over the next year or two.	13.0	104.0
201607	1797	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Like many others, I have thought of the outsized appreciation of the dollar as a tightening in overall financial conditions, which David Wilcox estimated earlier, if I followed him correctly, in the range of 150 to 200 basis points.	13.0	104.0
201607	1798	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	But 2016 has actually been a time of significant loosening in financial conditions.	13.0	104.0
201607	1799	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Since the beginning of the year, the dollar is about flat on a trade-weighted basis, stock prices are up, and the 10-year Treasury is down 70 basis points.	13.0	104.0
201607	1800	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	And the implied federal funds rate path has flattened significantly.	13.0	104.0
201607	1801	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	So the tightening cycle that began in December 2015 with a single rate hike has actually so far been a period of significant loosening.	13.0	104.0
201607	1802	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Perhaps others on the Committee are still taking on board the full extent of the decline in the neutral rate of interest.	13.0	104.0
201607	1803	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	That has certainly been the case for me.	13.0	104.0
201607	1804	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	In any case, it is notable to me that the apparent weakening in demand and in job growth is happening even as anticipated policy is becoming materially more accommodative.	13.0	104.0
201607	1805	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	In effect, monetary policy has had to work harder and harder just to sustain a fairly weak economic growth forecast.	13.0	104.0
201607	1806	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	To me, this argues for patience and a bit of caution, not panic.	13.0	104.0
201607	1807	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Some of the apparent slowdown in demand probably reflects transitory factors or statistical noise.	13.0	104.0
201607	1808	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The fundamentals driving household and business spending still seem quite supportive of economic growth, including solid increases in real income, accommodative financial conditions, low gas prices, and healthy levels of business and household confidence.	13.0	104.0
201607	1809	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	In addition, this easing of financial conditions should add a bit of momentum in the second half.	13.0	104.0
201607	1810	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Accordingly, despite the lackluster first-half performance, I still see 2 percent GDP growth or thereabouts for 2016, although I would say there is some modest downside risk to that.	13.0	104.0
201607	1811	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Turning briefly to the labor market, the pace of job growth is far from clear, with 11,000 new payroll jobs in May and 287,000 in June.	13.0	104.0
201607	1812	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	We’re going to need a couple more readings to assess the new trend.	13.0	104.0
201607	1813	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	It does seem likely that the pace of job gains is slowing, down to an average rate of about 150,000 in the second quarter.	13.0	104.0
201607	1814	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	That is enough to drive further declines in unemployment or increases in participation or both, albeit at a slower pace.	13.0	104.0
201607	1815	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I don’t see this downshift as desirable or necessary to avoid overheating.	13.0	104.0
201607	1816	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Desirable or not, though, the downshift has probably arrived, and it is tolerable as long as payrolls are increasing faster than the breakeven rate.	13.0	104.0
201607	1817	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Core PCE inflation was 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in May, up from 1.3 percent a year earlier, still being held down by the indirect effects of lower oil prices and the stronger dollar.	13.0	104.0
201607	1818	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Looking through those transient factors, I see the underlying inflation rate as close to 2 percent, suggesting that inflation should move up to our target as these influences fade.	13.0	104.0
201607	1819	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Low inflation expectations remain a concern.	13.0	104.0
201607	1820	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Downside risks to the outlook have diminished, although the risks in the international arena remain substantial.	13.0	104.0
201607	1821	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The referendum is probably not an important near-term risk for us, but, as Stan indicated, the coming period of negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union could well involve risk-off episodes, and we could feel those here in the United States.	13.0	104.0
201607	1822	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	In addition, the weaker condition of the European banking system will restrain European economic growth while also creating some tail risk of broader financial turmoil.	13.0	104.0
201607	1823	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	More generally, European and Japanese authorities have limited remaining scope to address ongoing weakness and any new shocks.	13.0	104.0
201607	1824	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	And while data regarding China have been positive, the need for its authorities to turn to stimulus measures suggests that the risks are concentrated on the downside there as well.	13.0	104.0
201607	1825	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	In sum, I expect both spending and labor market data to remain solid for the next few quarters, with inflation still quiescent.	13.0	104.0
201607	1826	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	It is to our advantage to see more data to get a better assessment of the underlying strength of the economy.	13.0	104.0
201607	1827	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	More on that tomorrow.	13.0	104.0
201607	1828	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201607	1829	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	1830	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13.0	65.0
201607	1831	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	107.0
201607	1832	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The most noteworthy event of the intermeeting period was the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the EU.	13.0	107.0
201607	1833	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s reassuring that financial markets proved resilient in the wake of the vote, although this development increases uncertainty in the global outlook.	13.0	107.0
201607	1834	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In parallel, reassuring reports on real activity in the United States, in particular the June reports on employment and retail sales, have reduced concerns about an abrupt slowing in domestic demand growth.	13.0	107.0
201607	1835	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Even so, reductions in the pace of job gains and GDP growth over the past few quarters suggest a notable slowing in economic momentum.	13.0	107.0
201607	1836	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Let me take each of these developments in turn.	13.0	107.0
201607	1837	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	First, recent developments have reduced some near-term uncertainty that weighed on the outlook at our previous meeting.	13.0	107.0
201607	1838	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Most importantly, financial markets have appeared resilient in the face of the “leave” vote.	13.0	107.0
201607	1839	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	After an initial selloff in risky assets US financial conditions appear little changed, on net, apart from a modest increase in the exchange rate.	13.0	107.0
201607	1840	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Although the Brexit vote outcome surprised many, it’s important to note that policymakers were well aware of the possibility in advance and took precautionary steps.	13.0	107.0
201607	1841	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, the market reaction appears to reflect, in part, expectations of additional policy support in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the euro area.	13.0	107.0
201607	1842	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Here at home, we’ve had some reassuring data on the labor market and aggregate spending.	13.0	107.0
201607	1843	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Employment growth bounced back sharply in June after registering essentially no gain in May.	13.0	107.0
201607	1844	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The intermeeting data on wages have been consistent with previous signs of a moderate step-up in wage growth.	13.0	107.0
201607	1845	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And the labor force participation rate ticked back up last month and appears to have been about flat over the past two years, consistent with continued moderate cyclical improvement.	13.0	107.0
201607	1846	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Consumption has also proven robust.	13.0	107.0
201607	1847	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	After weak first-quarter growth, consumption likely increased strongly last quarter and looks to have advanced at close to a 3 percent pace over the first half of the year, a value similar to the average pace over the past two years.	13.0	107.0
201607	1848	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, it’s important to note that consumption accounted for virtually all of GDP growth over the past two years and continues to be the main driver of aggregate demand.	13.0	107.0
201607	1849	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Buoyant sentiment, further gains in equity and home prices, and continued growth in jobs and wages should continue to provide support.	13.0	107.0
201607	1850	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, we see a notable slowing in economic momentum in other components.	13.0	107.0
201607	1851	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Taking the staff’s Q2 forecast as given, GDP has risen at an average annual rate of about 1½ percent over the past three quarters compared with growth of 2 percent last year and 2½ percent in the preceding two years.	13.0	107.0
201607	1852	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Business investment, as has been noted, has been a particular drag.	13.0	107.0
201607	1853	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	This likely reflects the earlier depressing effects of a higher dollar and lower oil prices.	13.0	107.0
201607	1854	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In the period ahead, it may be that uncertainty associated with the weak global outlook, an election year, and now Brexit, may be restraining investment.	13.0	107.0
201607	1855	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, it appears that the credit cycle may be turning.	13.0	107.0
201607	1856	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Data from the SLOOS point to a marked tightening in standards for CRE loans as well as a modest tightening in C&I loan standards.	13.0	107.0
201607	1857	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Residential investment has also slowed as single-family building permits have flattened out.	13.0	107.0
201607	1858	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	We might expect housing activity to strengthen in coming months as house prices continue to increase, as they did today.	13.0	107.0
201607	1859	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Mortgage rates are extremely low, and credit conditions for well- qualified borrowers have eased further, according to the SLOOS, but it’s also possible that the sluggish recovery and recent flattening out in residential investment could reflect a lasting change that will continue to hold the growth in new units below levels suggested by demographics.	13.0	107.0
201607	1860	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Employment growth has also slowed in recent quarters, as has been noted.	13.0	107.0
201607	1861	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Monthly payroll gains averaged about 150,000 over the previous quarter, a notable step-down from 200,000 in the first quarter and 230,000 last year, and it appears that this has happened despite the fact that some slack in the labor market remains.	13.0	107.0
201607	1862	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The prime-age employment-to-population ratio is still 1¾ percentage points below its pre-crisis level, and the number of workers working part time for economic reasons is still elevated.	13.0	107.0
201607	1863	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	More broadly, recent data on price inflation suggest little evidence that resource constraints are starting to bind, and the greater concern may be soft inflation expectations.	13.0	107.0
201607	1864	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The most recent 12-month change in core PCE, at 1.6 percent, remains below our target, and core inflation has now been below the target for 88 of the past 92 months.	13.0	107.0
201607	1865	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I’m concerned by any signs that inflation expectations will remain soft.	13.0	107.0
201607	1866	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent changes in survey measures of inflation expectations from Michigan and the New York Federal Reserve were positive, but they still remain below their pre-crisis norms, and inflation compensation remains stubbornly mired at an extremely low level.	13.0	107.0
201607	1867	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Despite the limited near-term fallout from the leave vote, the associated medium-term risks, I think, are still weighed to the downside.	13.0	107.0
201607	1868	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s still too early to know what the macroeconomic reaction to the process of redefining the relationship with the EU will be, but both staff forecasts and the IMF do project a materially slower growth rate in the United Kingdom and somewhat slower growth in the euro area.	13.0	107.0
201607	1869	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	July’s PMI reading for the United Kingdom was consistent with that outcome.	13.0	107.0
201607	1870	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Unfortunately, this expected slowing occurs at a time when weak European growth was already a concern, and the ECB is not in a great position to respond to it.	13.0	107.0
201607	1871	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The step-down in demand will pose challenges to European banks, which have struggled with low capital ratios and stagnant earnings, and to the ECB’s attainment of its inflation target.	13.0	107.0
201607	1872	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Italian banks, as has been noted earlier, are a particular concern, as a decade and a half of poor macroeconomic performance has led to a large rise in nonperforming loans.	13.0	107.0
201607	1873	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The combination of EU requirements of private debt bail-ins and a significant and vocal number of retail investors in the Italian bank debt makes the recapitalization process very complicated.	13.0	107.0
201607	1874	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Prior to the leave vote, the ECB was already struggling to meet its inflation target, and the fragile position of European banks appears to be limiting the ECB’s policy options by reducing the attractiveness of further reductions in short rates or further flattening of the yield curve.	13.0	107.0
201607	1875	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Beyond the immediate hit to economic growth, the leave vote also ushers in a period of uncertainty that could see bouts of financial volatility associated with the negotiations or political events in other European countries.	13.0	107.0
201607	1876	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s also worth noting that China remains another prominent locus of global downside risks.	13.0	107.0
201607	1877	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	While the recent data provide reassurance on near-term economic growth and capital outflows, risks over the medium term are likely continuing to build.	13.0	107.0
201607	1878	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Much of the near-term boost to the economy appears to have been provided by a large policy-induced jump in debt growth, which is a worrying development in an economy with an uncomfortably high corporate debt-to-GDP ratio.	13.0	107.0
201607	1879	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	There has also been little coherence in plans to reduce capacity in state- owned enterprises, which is necessary for successful rebalancing.	13.0	107.0
201607	1880	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And China’s monetary policy and exchange rate framework remain extremely opaque and subject to considerable discretion, with the currency recently depreciating noticeably against both the dollar and the designated basket of currencies despite a stated commitment that targets stability against the basket.	13.0	107.0
201607	1881	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Together, negative surprises in China and Europe pose risks to the United States through weaker demand, heightened volatility, and exchange rate appreciation.	13.0	107.0
201607	1882	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And, as was highlighted in two presentations earlier, dollar movements and reactions to surprises have been quite elevated in recent months, and the feed-through to the US outlook has been very material.	13.0	107.0
201607	1883	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Pulling all of these pieces together, I, like Governor Powell, believe that additional data will be very important in assessing how much slack remains and how responsive inflation is likely to be to rising resource utilization as we also assess how resilient our economy is to downside risks beyond our borders.	13.0	107.0
201607	1884	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	When uncertainty about the cyclical position of the economy is relatively large, as it appears to be at present, the chances of policy settings being either too accommodative or too tight are higher, which puts a high premium on being attentive to the balance of risks.	13.0	107.0
201607	1885	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	With risks skewed to the downside and with less conventional policy space to deal with adverse shocks than with upside shocks, the costs of adjusting policy in anticipation of favorable data are likely greater than waiting to remove the accommodation until the data provide a higher level of certainty that such a policy adjustment is warranted.	13.0	107.0
201607	1886	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Of course, we will return to this topic tomorrow.	13.0	107.0
201607	1887	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	107.0
201607	1888	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	1889	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13.0	65.0
201607	1890	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	103.0
201607	1891	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Soft commodity prices have weighed on the 10th District economy, with both employment and wage growth slowing over the past year.	13.0	103.0
201607	1892	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	In energy-intensive states, the downturn in the energy sector has spread to other segments of the local economy.	13.0	103.0
201607	1893	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	State budgets are making substantial adjustments in response to falling tax revenue, particularly in states like Wyoming, Oklahoma, and New Mexico.	13.0	103.0
201607	1894	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	In the ag sector, corn futures prices have fallen sharply, and cattle prices have continued to decline.	13.0	103.0
201607	1895	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	The persistent downturn in the farm economy has continued to drive demand for agricultural loans, and our recent Agricultural Finance Databook shows past-due farm loans are starting to trend modestly higher.	13.0	103.0
201607	1896	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Despite these areas of weakness, the District economy overall continues to grow modestly.	13.0	103.0
201607	1897	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Layoff announcements have abated.	13.0	103.0
201607	1898	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Residential construction activity is picking up outside of energy states, and both our services and manufacturing surveys indicate expanding activity in June.	13.0	103.0
201607	1899	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	For the national economy, incoming data since the previous meeting have largely supported my economic outlook.	13.0	103.0
201607	1900	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	The employment report for June suggested that the soft May number was more noise than signal, and the burst of market uncertainty following the UK referendum vote has largely subsided, even with significant questions remaining.	13.0	103.0
201607	1901	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	In general, I continue to expect moderate economic growth and an inflation rate rising toward 2 percent.	13.0	103.0
201607	1902	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Consumers appear well positioned to continue to move the economy forward.	13.0	103.0
201607	1903	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Growth in consumer spending is expected to exceed 4 percent in the second quarter, and consumer confidence readings for current conditions have remained high in July.	13.0	103.0
201607	1904	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Continued improvement in the labor market should support the consumer, although I do expect some deceleration in the pace of employment growth that is consistent with an economy at or near full employment.	13.0	103.0
201607	1905	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	My staff projects employment growth to average about 150,000 per month for the remainder of the year, well above the pace of labor force growth.	13.0	103.0
201607	1906	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	This projection is supported by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s Labor Market Conditions indicator, which shows that although labor market momentum has eased from a high level at the beginning of the year, the current reading remains well above the historical average.	13.0	103.0
201607	1907	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	While the outlook for consumption remains solid, as others have noted, weakness in business fixed investment persists, and in that regard I appreciated the analysis in the Tealbook box on this topic.	13.0	103.0
201607	1908	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	As I look at the categories of equipment investment, two things stand out to me.	13.0	103.0
201607	1909	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	First are the influences related to the energy and agricultural sectors as well as the headwinds faced by the manufacturing sector that have weighed on equipment investment the past two years.	13.0	103.0
201607	1910	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	This shows up clearly in falling equipment investment in mining and oil field machinery, agricultural machinery, and railroad equipment.	13.0	103.0
201607	1911	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	The second factor is the notable slowing in the pace of growth for computer and peripheral equipment.	13.0	103.0
201607	1912	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Spending in the remaining equipment categories, however, is increasing at a pace roughly consistent with past expansions.	13.0	103.0
201607	1913	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	This suggests to me that the softness in equipment investment is not broad based but may instead reflect special factors in those areas.	13.0	103.0
201607	1914	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	A weaker path of residential investment is highlighted in the Tealbook’s near-term outlook, and although I would agree that growth in this category is likely to decelerate, I would not have categorized the sector as being soft.	13.0	103.0
201607	1915	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Residential investment has been the fastest- growing NIPA component since late 2014.	13.0	103.0
201607	1916	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Some recent slowing in single-family permitting could well reflect a limited amount of land for new development in desired locations, and steady increases in housing prices suggest demand remains relatively strong.	13.0	103.0
201607	1917	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	CoreLogic house prices have increased in the past six months at a pace similar to that in 2015.	13.0	103.0
201607	1918	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, home renovations have been increasing, which is a category that accounts for a large share of residential investment.	13.0	103.0
201607	1919	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Overall, I expect this sector to continue making positive contributions to GDP growth with ongoing home renovations and steady home sales, which support brokers’ commissions, another substantial component of residential investment.	13.0	103.0
201607	1920	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, I see inflation as consistent with our statutory goal of price stability.	13.0	103.0
201607	1921	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Year-over- year, core PCE inflation has increased to 1.6 percent in May, and the core CPI index has increased 2.3 percent over the past year.	13.0	103.0
201607	1922	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, longer-term expectations look consistent with our goal.	13.0	103.0
201607	1923	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	I took note of the special question in the recent Survey of Professional Forecasters, which asked, “Is your long-run forecast of PCE inflation different from 2 percent by an amount you consider economically meaningful?”	13.0	103.0
201607	1924	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	And its follow-up was, if so, explain why.	13.0	103.0
201607	1925	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Responses indicate that 24 of 32 forecasters have a long-run inflation forecast in the vicinity of 2 percent.	13.0	103.0
201607	1926	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	The 8 forecasters who submitted long-run expectations meaningfully different from 2 percent all had expectations above it and not below.	13.0	103.0
201607	1927	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	And 6 of those 8 pointed to monetary policy as the reason for their above-target long-run inflation forecast.	13.0	103.0
201607	1928	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	I also found the recent release of the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations reassuring, as the median inflation expectations at the three-year-ahead horizon increased from 2.7 percent in May to 2.9 percent in June.	13.0	103.0
201607	1929	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	13.0	103.0
201607	1930	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	1931	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	13.0	65.0
201607	1932	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201607	1933	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This year has been a challenging one for the 11th District primarily because of weak oil prices, particularly in the first quarter, as well as a strong dollar.	13.0	110.0
201607	1934	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Job growth during the first quarter was revised down by the Texas Workforce Commission, which now estimates that it was negative 1.3 percent, annualized.	13.0	110.0
201607	1935	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Consistent with that, we have changed our overall forecast for 2016 job growth for Texas to just ½ percent versus 1.3 percent last year and 3.7 percent in 2014.	13.0	110.0
201607	1936	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Our most recent Texas outlook surveys show some stability in the manufacturing sector after several months of declines and continued growth in the services sector.	13.0	110.0
201607	1937	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Home sales and prices continue to firm for most major Texas metro areas except Houston.	13.0	110.0
201607	1938	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Texas exports through May year-to-date are down approximately 4 percent, year over year.	13.0	110.0
201607	1939	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This is primarily due to, again, the strong dollar and weak global growth outlook.	13.0	110.0
201607	1940	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We think our exports will remain weak for the remainder of 2016, which is very significant for Texas.	13.0	110.0
201607	1941	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We are a large exporter; exports are about 16 percent of the state’s GDP, so the weakness is a significant drag.	13.0	110.0
201607	1942	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Contacts report little evidence of wage pressure, at least in our District, other than, as we’ve said before, in skilled trades, high-tech manufacturing, legal services, construction trades, IT, and so on.	13.0	110.0
201607	1943	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In the energy sector, with substantial cuts to rig count and capital spending over the past two years, US oil production is estimated at approximately 8½ million barrels per day in the month of July.	13.0	110.0
201607	1944	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This is down approximately 10 percent from a year earlier.	13.0	110.0
201607	1945	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Despite that decline, global oil production actually is going to be modestly higher for 2016, because OPEC production is expected to rise due, importantly, to increases in production in Iran and Iraq.	13.0	110.0
201607	1946	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So 2016 will be up over 2015, but the rate of increase has slowed.	13.0	110.0
201607	1947	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We continue to expect global supply and demand to move into rough balance during the first half of 2017, on the basis of our expectation of increasing demand of approximately 1.3 million barrels a day, on average, in 2016.	13.0	110.0
201607	1948	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It’s been our view that the recent uptick in prices may have been overdone because of temporary production outages in Nigeria and Canada.	13.0	110.0
201607	1949	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Those outages have now been substantially restored, so we’re not surprised by the recent reduction in oil prices.	13.0	110.0
201607	1950	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	However, on the basis of the expected trend toward balance in terms of global supply and demand, we do continue to expect oil prices to firm as we head into year-end and into next year.	13.0	110.0
201607	1951	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	With this firming, we’ve now been seeing in the past few months, for the first time in 18 months, some very modest oil rig count increases.	13.0	110.0
201607	1952	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This activity is primarily in the Permian Basin, in which breakeven costs are the most attractive.	13.0	110.0
201607	1953	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We still expect, though, that rig increases will be very limited over the next several months because, on the basis of our discussions with our contacts and our new energy survey, we continue to think that breakeven prices for new drilling still range between $50 to $60 per barrel in the most attractive fields in the Permian and higher in other fields.	13.0	110.0
201607	1954	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So we still are not yet at a market price that allows people to drill and make a profit.	13.0	110.0
201607	1955	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	As a result of this and the fact that many industry participants are highly leveraged, we continue to expect to see more mergers, bankruptcies, and restructurings in this industry for the remainder of the year.	13.0	110.0
201607	1956	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And, in the service sector, we wouldn’t be surprised to continue to see more job losses.	13.0	110.0
201607	1957	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	For the next few years, because of very high levels of capacity utilization in OPEC, the US shale industry is likely to provide the short-cycle supply increases needed to meet growing global demand, mainly because, as we’ve said before, long-lived project investments have been relatively dormant for the past two, two and a half years.	13.0	110.0
201607	1958	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So we’re more optimistic that we will have some tailwind as we head into 2017 and beyond.	13.0	110.0
201607	1959	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Turning to the national forecast, we do believe we’re making progress toward reaching our dual-mandate objectives.	13.0	110.0
201607	1960	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Labor market slack has continued to be reduced, and we believe we are making gradual progress toward meeting our inflation objective.	13.0	110.0
201607	1961	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas trimmed mean 12-month reading is holding steady at 1.8 percent versus approximately 1.65 percent a year ago, which to us is consistent with gradual, although modest, increases in core inflation.	13.0	110.0
201607	1962	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We believe the recent deceleration in the pace of job growth is consistent with a labor market approaching full employment.	13.0	110.0
201607	1963	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So we see the average of 150,000 per month that we’ve experienced the past few months as not surprising and still, as has been said, consistent with continuing reductions to the unemployment rate.	13.0	110.0
201607	1964	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Our own forecast is that the unemployment rate is going to reach approximately 4.6 percent by the second quarter of 2017.	13.0	110.0
201607	1965	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We continue to estimate 2016 real GDP growth in the United States at approximately 2 percent.	13.0	110.0
201607	1966	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	For us, the risk in our forecast is actually modestly to the upside.	13.0	110.0
201607	1967	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Although Brexit may have muddied the waters for the United Kingdom and the euro area, and it will take time to assess the ultimate effects, our working assumption is that the effect on the United States is going to be very limited.	13.0	110.0
201607	1968	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Discussions we had with our industry contacts in the United States suggest that the consumer is solid and stable—not better than that, but certainly solid and stable.	13.0	110.0
201607	1969	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We note, by the way, that despite Brexit, junk-bond spreads have narrowed in the intermeeting period, and, in fact, real household wealth likely turned up in the second quarter, all things netted out.	13.0	110.0
201607	1970	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	As has been mentioned, we keep a close eye on and do our own models of the neutral rate.	13.0	110.0
201607	1971	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We note that slower five-year economic growth expectations as well as growing demand for safe assets around the world are drivers of recent declines in world interest rates, which are consistent with declines in our internal estimates of the real neutral rate.	13.0	110.0
201607	1972	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	As a result, we believe that the FOMC is less accommodative, even at 25 to 50 basis points than is widely believed.	13.0	110.0
201607	1973	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’d like to make one more comment on business investment.	13.0	110.0
201607	1974	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	On the basis of extensive discussions with our contacts, we assess that while people are pleased with their debt borrowing costs—and, if they are public companies, with their stock prices—most business leaders we speak to fear that we are in for a prolonged period of sluggish GDP growth both in the United States and across advanced economies.	13.0	110.0
201607	1975	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In addition, they see, as I’ve said before, very high levels of disruption in their respective industries—either new entrants that are threatening their model or, at a minimum, consumers having greater leverage that is limiting their pricing power and lowering margins.	13.0	110.0
201607	1976	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The result of this is that CEOs are very hesitant to make major additions to capital spending plans or capacity additions until they see some greater clarity regarding their future growth prospects.	13.0	110.0
201607	1977	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And, we are finding this pretty broadly across contacts in our District.	13.0	110.0
201607	1978	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201607	1979	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	1980	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	13.0	65.0
201607	1981	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201607	1982	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Overall economic activity in the Third District is little changed from June.	13.0	999.0
201607	1983	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	But looking ahead, things appear to be on the upswing.	13.0	999.0
201607	1984	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Employment growth has slowed a bit, and the unemployment rate ticked up to 5.3 percent in May.	13.0	999.0
201607	1985	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Comparing labor force developments in my region with those of the nation, the Third District continues to grow a bit more slowly than the nation, but that’s not unusual.	13.0	999.0
201607	1986	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	We typically do.	13.0	999.0
201607	1987	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	The manufacturing sector continues to struggle a bit, but expectations in the business community remain fairly upbeat:  Of the firms surveyed in our latest Business Outlook Survey, 46 percent expect an increase in activity over the next six months, while only 12 percent anticipate a decline.	13.0	999.0
201607	1988	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Also, a large majority of firms reported stable employment in July.	13.0	999.0
201607	1989	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Now, a contact with broad exposure in manufacturing indicated that a number of lines of business are beginning to see profits turn positive, with July being the best month of his year.	13.0	999.0
201607	1990	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Growth is strong in transportation, health care, and areas associated with construction.	13.0	999.0
201607	1991	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	And he reports there have been no negative effects from “the Kamin,” we’ll call it, as he walks out of the room [laughter], formerly known as “the Brexit.”	13.0	999.0
201607	1992	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Even in his businesses that deal heavily with Europe, he’s not seeing any real effect.	13.0	999.0
201607	1993	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Another contact indicated that the British arm of a major flooring company is reporting stronger growth as a result of the Brexit vote.	13.0	999.0
201607	1994	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	However, one of our bankers indicated that a major multinational firm in our District is starting to lay people off, and the excuse it gave was that, because of the Brexit result, it started to see some slowdown in its business.	13.0	999.0
201607	1995	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Who knows whether that is true, but that’s what it is reporting.	13.0	999.0
201607	1996	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Bankers in our region are experiencing strong loan growth and high profitability as well as a continued decline in delinquencies.	13.0	999.0
201607	1997	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Residential investment is strong in the Philadelphia area, and the Jersey Shore is absolutely booming.	13.0	999.0
201607	1998	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Although these numbers will not excite President Williams, beachfront property on Long Beach Island, New Jersey, is going for upward of $4 million to $5 million.	13.0	999.0
201607	1999	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	I know, that’s a condo in San Francisco.	13.0	999.0
201607	2000	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	A lean-to.	13.0	102.0
201607	2001	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13.0	102.0
201607	2002	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	A supplier of homebuilding materials has seen a 60 percent increase in business during the second quarter.	13.0	999.0
201607	2003	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	And, as others have reported, for difficult-to-find workers such as truck drivers, this one contact says his firm has raised wages three times this year alone to try to find truck drivers.	13.0	999.0
201607	2004	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	That said, a number of contacts did mention that the uncertainty arising from this year’s presidential election was damping their capital spending for the second half of this year and possibly into 2017.	13.0	999.0
201607	2005	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Nonmanufacturing activity in the District continues to grow modestly at a somewhat slower-than-historical rate.	13.0	999.0
201607	2006	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Readings are a bit mixed, as we are seeing declining activities at malls but very strong growth in tourism and hospitality.	13.0	999.0
201607	2007	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	The DNC helped that, by the way, this week.	13.0	999.0
201607	2008	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Like our manufacturers, area service providers remain relatively optimistic with respect to future activity.	13.0	999.0
201607	2009	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Further, commercial construction has begun to pick up in the region, which makes us an outlier nationally.	13.0	999.0
201607	2010	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Also, the value of residential contracts continues on a steady upward trend, although permits continue to fall, mostly as a result of weakness in the multifamily sector of the market.	13.0	999.0
201607	2011	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	House prices are appreciating at a modest pace, growing at less than half the US average.	13.0	999.0
201607	2012	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	So, overall, the Third District should see steady, if unspectacular, economic growth, and contacts are generally upbeat about the future.	13.0	999.0
201607	2013	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Turning to the nation as a whole, the latest employment report greatly allayed my concerns over the underlying strength in the labor market.	13.0	999.0
201607	2014	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Averaging through the past few months indicates that job growth has decelerated from earlier in the year, but that the economy is still creating jobs at a healthy clip.	13.0	999.0
201607	2015	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	In light of the tightness in the labor market, I also believe that a gradual slowdown in job creation is, as many have said, to be expected.	13.0	999.0
201607	2016	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	My other concern over the potential destabilizing influence of Brexit, as others have noted, has not materialized.	13.0	999.0
201607	2017	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	If anything, financial markets have shown amazing resiliency, and it is still not clear if and when actual Brexit will occur.	13.0	999.0
201607	2018	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Overall, I view the data we have received since we last met as reassuring.	13.0	999.0
201607	2019	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Consumer spending and residential real estate are contributing to economic growth, the job market has retained its dynamism, and core inflation numbers appear to be heading toward our target.	13.0	999.0
201607	2020	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	I anticipate that headline inflation will follow and that the economy will grow at or slightly above trend.	13.0	999.0
201607	2021	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	In that regard, I’m a bit more optimistic than the staff in the Tealbook.	13.0	999.0
201607	2022	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Now, some of my optimism is informed by my greater reliance on GDPplus rather than expenditure GDP, or simply GDP, as a measure of underlying economic activity.	13.0	999.0
201607	2023	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	This latent variable is calculated by the staff at the Philadelphia Fed and combines GDP and GDI using a Kalman filter.	13.0	999.0
201607	2024	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Interestingly, the staff finds that GDPplus does not suffer from the residual seasonality problem and is a better predictor of GDP than GDP itself.	13.0	999.0
201607	2025	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Further, real-time forecasts of GDPplus are more informative about future GDP than our current real-time estimates of GDP itself.	13.0	999.0
201607	2026	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	This suggests that current GDPplus contains valuable information about underlying economic activity as well as about future revised BEA estimates of GDP.	13.0	999.0
201607	2027	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	The current estimate we have for first- quarter GDPplus growth is 2.7 percent, and this measure indicates that there was no fourth- quarter economic slowdown.	13.0	999.0
201607	2028	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Also, using GDPplus as a gauge of first-quarter economic activity substantially attenuates the puzzling weakness in labor productivity.	13.0	999.0
201607	2029	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	My somewhat optimistic outlook will inform my view on policy tomorrow.	13.0	999.0
201607	2030	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201607	2031	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	2032	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me suggest at this point, for good behavior, we take a short break—maybe 20 minutes.	52.0	65.0
201607	2033	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think coffee and refreshments are available outside.	52.0	65.0
201607	2035	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, let’s get started.	52.0	65.0
201607	2036	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Our next speaker is Governor Tarullo.	13.0	65.0
201607	2037	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201607	2038	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	As everybody has pointed out, the significant short-term downside risks that loomed over the June meeting have largely dissipated, although I don’t think that means that we’ve reverted to the situation we were in, say, in mid-May.	13.0	97.0
201607	2039	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think Jay did a very nice job of identifying several of the reasons why that’s the case.	13.0	97.0
201607	2040	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	First, there’s been a slowing in the job creation numbers.	13.0	97.0
201607	2041	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t know why we think that necessarily we’ve slowed and now plateaued at 150,000.	13.0	97.0
201607	2042	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	It seems to me there’s at least an open question as to whether that trend line will continue to be down or whether it will plateau at 150,000.	13.0	97.0
201607	2043	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Second, while longer-term Treasury securities have retraced some of the decline in the immediate aftermath of Brexit, they didn’t get all the way back.	13.0	97.0
201607	2044	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	This may be due, at least in part—as I think people have already suggested—to changes in the expected path of monetary policy both here and abroad, which is in turn associated with somewhat less-sanguine expectations for economic growth.	13.0	97.0
201607	2045	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Those anticipated changes probably have also contributed to the rebound in asset prices.	13.0	97.0
201607	2046	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And third, Governor Powell mentioned Brexit, but I want to invoke David Wilcox’s formulation here, which seems to me the right way to look at it.	13.0	97.0
201607	2047	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Back in June we regarded Brexit, depending on the individual, as a somewhat unlikely outcome, but that if there was such an outcome, bad things could happen from it.	13.0	97.0
201607	2048	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	We were implicitly putting a discount factor on the likelihood that there would be Brexit.	13.0	97.0
201607	2049	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But now Brexit is probably a reality, and so those potential bad things coming out of Brexit now have to be evaluated as real risks rather than one of the different layers of contingencies.	13.0	97.0
201607	2050	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	We don’t know what the magnitude of the negative effects will be, but I think it’s hard to argue that the sign is going to be anything but negative.	13.0	97.0
201607	2051	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	With the dissipation of the immediate downside risks, I thought it was a good moment to reflect on the risks associated with the policy approach that I personally have been taking.	13.0	97.0
201607	2052	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	This is on the theme of having an open mind.	13.0	97.0
201607	2053	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Obviously, none of us, I hope, has an entirely open mind, meaning no priors, no ways of looking at things.	13.0	97.0
201607	2054	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But I think that we all have to be careful not to fall into defending positions that we’ve taken, like a debater or a litigator, using whatever evidence is available to defend that position—as if you’re just trying to get a particular outcome for a client or in front of bunch of judges in a debating tournament—and to think more about being a policymaker who is trying to absorb changes and, thus, change one’s own position.	13.0	97.0
201607	2055	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, in all honesty, I actually think the Committee structure we’ve got makes it harder to do that because it pushes us a little bit into staking out positions that we then defend.	13.0	97.0
201607	2056	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	So I thought I would try, with myself, to think through what the risks may be to the approach that I’ve been taking when thinking about monetary policy decisions.	13.0	97.0
201607	2057	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	It won’t be surprising to anticipate the conclusion that I don’t currently find those risks significant—and I’ll explain why in a minute— but at least it helped me think about what things might change that should, in turn, force me to change the position I’ve been taking on monetary policy.	13.0	97.0
201607	2058	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, thus, it was a useful exercise.	13.0	97.0
201607	2059	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Plus, by explaining it, it gives people an opportunity to explain why they think the risks are actually somewhat greater.	13.0	97.0
201607	2060	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	To recapitulate what I’ve said before, my basic approach is that I would prefer to wait for more convincing evidence that inflation will get to, and then remain around, the 2 percent target before we raise rates further.	13.0	97.0
201607	2061	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Basically, I have three reasons for taking this approach.	13.0	97.0
201607	2062	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	First, so long as the price-stability side of the dual mandate is not in danger of being breached on the upside, it’s important to take to heart the statutory injunction that we seek maximum employment, not some sort of constructed view of full employment.	13.0	97.0
201607	2063	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Second, due to the asymmetry of the policy tools currently available to us for tightening and for loosening, we should err on the side of an accommodative policy to avoid increasing—even if only incrementally—the vulnerability of the economy to some shock, anticipated or unanticipated, that would be effected by an additional rate increase.	13.0	97.0
201607	2064	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, third, in light of recent experience of persistently below-target inflation and the possibility that secular forces will make it more difficult to reach and maintain inflation of around 2 percent, it seems reasonable to wait for clearer evidence that the target will be reached.	13.0	97.0
201607	2065	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	So at least the first and second of these reasons rest on the expectation that we’ll have ample time to react if and as inflation were to move upward in a way that threatened the target on the upside.	13.0	97.0
201607	2066	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I want to focus in particular on the risk that this expectation may prove to be ill founded.	13.0	97.0
201607	2067	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But, first, I wanted to address financial-stability risks briefly.	13.0	97.0
201607	2068	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	As I made clear in our previous discussions, I’m not opposed in principle to the notion that, in some relatively unusual circumstances, short-term rates may need to be raised in order to diminish risks to financial stability that may be associated with a broad range of asset prices moving well above historical averages due to increasing amounts of leverage.	13.0	97.0
201607	2069	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, as I noted earlier, I hope that in thinking through possible longer-range frameworks for monetary policy, we will at least explore the development of other financial stability tools.	13.0	97.0
201607	2070	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	For the present, though, a rate increase is the most obvious such tool that can be used among monetary policy tools to try to stave off adverse financial stability effects.	13.0	97.0
201607	2071	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I agree that the conditions in which one would worry about financial stability are more likely to develop in an environment in which interest rates have remained very low for a long time.	13.0	97.0
201607	2072	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But even if these conditions were to occur, one would want to do a careful assessment of the relative risk to the economy of tightening versus the risk to the economy stemming from a painful and possibly rapid deleveraging if prices and leverage continue to rise well above sustainable levels.	13.0	97.0
201607	2073	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, more to the immediate point, I don’t think the conditions that I hypothesized a moment ago are with us today.	13.0	97.0
201607	2074	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	It is true that CRE markets in six or seven so- called gateway cities do present grounds for concern.	13.0	97.0
201607	2075	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	It’s also true that the inventory of leveraged loans held by a variety of financial intermediaries may yet return significant losses and have some negative macroeconomic effects.	13.0	97.0
201607	2076	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And one might argue the case that equity markets are overvalued.	13.0	97.0
201607	2077	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But I think it’s very hard to make a case, looking at the economy as a whole, that we have a wide range of unusually high asset prices supported by large amounts of leverage, which would present an appropriate case for a monetary policy rate increase as opposed to either supervisory actions, regulatory actions, seeing if markets calm down, and engaging in that risk– reward assessment I suggested a moment ago.	13.0	97.0
201607	2078	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Moreover, the greatest risks that may be present are more weighted in smaller banks and nonbank intermediaries rather than in the large banks, whose strength or weakness is still an important determinant of the overall stability of the financial system as a whole.	13.0	97.0
201607	2079	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	So, again, I agree with the proposition that we ought to keep financial stability considerations in front of us, but I also agree with those who have said the threshold should be pretty high for a policy rate increase.	13.0	97.0
201607	2080	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I think one would need to see a much broader range of asset price concerns than those in a couple of discrete areas.	13.0	97.0
201607	2081	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Turning now to inflation, for the purposes of my remarks today I don’t want to focus on the likelihood that, in the absence of interest rate increases, core PCE inflation does get back to and stay around 2 percent.	13.0	97.0
201607	2082	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	As I noted earlier, that’s an important question, and no matter where we began, I think we’re all having to give a little bit more credence to secular stagnation arguments than maybe we did 6 or 12 or 18 months ago.	13.0	97.0
201607	2083	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But whatever answer you give to that question really doesn’t implicate the riskiness of the overall approach to monetary policy I suggested a moment ago.	13.0	97.0
201607	2084	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	A steady and apparently sustainable move of inflation upward would allow even the most patient of us time to react.	13.0	97.0
201607	2085	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And because it seems unlikely that r* is very large right now, we wouldn’t have to go very far before reaching a neutral or even a contractionary rate.	13.0	97.0
201607	2086	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	The risk that’s most salient to the monetary policy approach that I’ve been taking is that inflation would start moving up sufficiently rapidly as to put the Committee “behind the curve.”	13.0	97.0
201607	2087	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, as I understand the position of some on the Committee, the real fear is that it would force us to raise rates so sharply as to induce a recession.	13.0	97.0
201607	2088	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	The scenario that seems to lie behind that fear is that we undershoot the natural rate by so much that inflation either jumps well above 2 percent fairly quickly or that it’s put on a trajectory in that direction.	13.0	97.0
201607	2089	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	In either case, the concern is that significant, fairly rapid increases in rates would be necessary to bring it back down to 2 percent.	13.0	97.0
201607	2090	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Now, I’d note in passing, I think this scenario must also embed a hypothesis that inflation expectations either don’t play the role that the majority of this Committee has assigned them or that those expectations become unanchored to the upside very quickly, despite the fact that recent experience suggests that the risk of expectations becoming unanchored have been toward the downside.	13.0	97.0
201607	2091	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	One of the reasons I’ve resisted the policy implications of this scenario, at least at the present time, is that I think the natural rate may be lower than estimated by the staff, in which case even if the dynamic of the scenario has validity, it wouldn’t kick in until unemployment was lower than would be suggested under current assumptions.	13.0	97.0
201607	2092	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	This gets us back to the question of how much slack remains in the labor market, how much trend labor force participation is sensitive to overall luck, labor market conditions, and related issues.	13.0	97.0
201607	2093	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I suspect that differences in views among the Committee on these matters will persist, based probably on everybody’s own priors, well beyond the time that we have to act or not act.	13.0	97.0
201607	2094	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	So I’m not sure that that’s going to be a convincing argument one way or the other.	13.0	97.0
201607	2095	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	A second reason I haven’t found this scenario compelling is that for it to play out, the Phillips curve would not only have to be somewhat steeper than the slope it has maintained for the past 20 or so years, but it would also probably have to be notably nonlinear so that the move through full employment resulted in a fairly quick, fairly sizable increase in price inflation.	13.0	97.0
201607	2096	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	While this is, of course, possible, and there is at least some empirical work suggesting the possibility of nonlinearity of the Phillips curve in some circumstances, there don’t seem to be compelling reasons to believe that it would suddenly and significantly steepen in the circumstances of an economy running, at most, moderately above trend and with the increasing evidence that the flat slope of the Phillips curve has been persistent across time in the United States and has been similarly flat in most of the world’s major economies.	13.0	97.0
201607	2097	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Third, I am not sure that there really are a lot of precedents for the negative scenario that people have in mind in wanting to raise rates, if I can put it this way, a little bit preemptively, although I know that’s not the way people would put it themselves.	13.0	97.0
201607	2098	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	First off, the problems of the 1960s and 1970s—which almost present the classic case of the FOMC slamming on the brakes and not being able to engineer a soft landing but, instead, inducing a recession—didn’t just spring up overnight.	13.0	97.0
201607	2099	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	They were years in the making.	13.0	97.0
201607	2100	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	For the more recent experiences, in the 2000s, although the Federal Reseve may bear some of the blame for the financial crisis and the Great Recession, I don’t think you can make the case that the financial crisis and the Great Recession were catalyzed by FOMC funds rate increases because of waiting around too long to act.	13.0	97.0
201607	2101	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	There are obviously, as President Lacker would suggest, debates we should have, and we can all have debates, but I think it’s hard to make that case.	13.0	97.0
201607	2102	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	It was surely not the classic kind of central bank-induced recession.	13.0	97.0
201607	2103	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I also think the recession of the early 2000s is a murkier picture.	13.0	97.0
201607	2104	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	First, it was a very mild recession.	13.0	97.0
201607	2105	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Second, I think you can make a pretty good case that it was a byproduct of the bursting of the tech bubble, which may have had something to do with preexisting monetary policy, I would acknowledge.	13.0	97.0
201607	2106	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But, again, it doesn’t present that classic case.	13.0	97.0
201607	2107	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	So I think those precedents are limited in their applicability to where we are now.	13.0	97.0
201607	2108	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Finally, as I noted in the previous meeting, the unemployment rate has been more or less steady for nearly a year now, during which time the economy has continued to create jobs well above even a generous estimate of the number of new entrants in the labor force.	13.0	97.0
201607	2109	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	So, stipulating for a moment that we should act before we undershoot by too much the natural rate—which, again, for purposes of argument, I’ll stipulate is at about the current level—right now we’re clearly not racing past the natural rate.	13.0	97.0
201607	2110	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	If the unemployment rate were to begin moving down again in a nontransitory fashion, the reasoning that lies behind this scenario would, at least in my judgment, be stronger whether or not I became completely convinced after taking account of the Phillips curve and some of the other factors that I mentioned a moment ago.	13.0	97.0
201607	2111	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	In conclusion, I don’t want to suggest, now or at any time, that there’s no risk in the monetary policy approach that I’ve been taking.	13.0	97.0
201607	2112	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Indeed, anyone who thinks his or her policy preference carries no risks or costs is almost surely wrong.	13.0	97.0
201607	2113	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, in the current circumstances, I think it’s particularly incumbent on those of us subscribing to a more patient approach to continue to evaluate how changing conditions might increase those risks and, thus, might affect the calculus of when the right time for another rate increase has come about.	13.0	97.0
201607	2114	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	For the moment, though, it seems to me, at least, that the risk of a rapid, significant undershoot of the natural rate taking place before we can react and leading to nontransitory, above-target inflation seems quite modest.	13.0	97.0
201607	2115	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And financial stability vulnerabilities also seem to me well short of the kind of pervasiveness that would warrant a monetary policy action.	13.0	97.0
201607	2116	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I have a feeling there’s not going to be too much doubt about what I’ll say about my preferred monetary policy stance tomorrow, but I will leave that until tomorrow, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201607	2117	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	13.0	97.0
201607	2118	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	2119	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	13.0	65.0
201607	2120	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201607	2121	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	You may have heard a loud cacophony coming from the Cleveland District in the intermeeting period.	13.0	999.0
201607	2122	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	[Laughter]	13.0	999.0
201607	2123	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	It was actually a big sigh of relief.	13.0	999.0
201607	2124	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The Cavaliers finally won the NBA championship, Cleveland’s first national sports championship in 52 years; national employment rebounded strongly in June; financial markets calmed down fairly quickly after the vote of the UK referendum; and the political conventioneers finally got out of Dodge.	13.0	999.0
201607	2125	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Overall, economic conditions in the Fourth District have changed little during this intermeeting period, save for indications of building price pressures.	13.0	999.0
201607	2126	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The Bank’s diffusion index of business contacts reporting better versus worse conditions rose from plus 9 at the time of our previous meeting to plus 18, a reading consistent with the moderate pace of economic growth we’ve been seeing.	13.0	999.0
201607	2127	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In a special staff survey, the vast majority of District contacts reported that they don’t expect any consequential effect on their firms from the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union, and even among exporters, fewer than 20 percent expect any effect.	13.0	999.0
201607	2128	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Labor markets in the District remain healthy, with further signs of tightening.	13.0	999.0
201607	2129	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Firms increasing employment outnumber those reducing it, and the Cleveland Federal Reserve staff estimates that year-over-year growth in payrolls remained at 1.2 percent in June, the same as in April.	13.0	999.0
201607	2130	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The District’s unemployment rate has remained low and stable, estimated at 5.1 percent in June.	13.0	999.0
201607	2131	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Nearly all District contacts reported some upward pressure on wages.	13.0	999.0
201607	2132	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Notably, this was reported even in some sectors, like manufacturing, in which job growth has not been particularly strong.	13.0	999.0
201607	2133	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Higher wages are increasingly being reported for entry-level positions.	13.0	999.0
201607	2134	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland staff’s diffusion index for prices received had been gradually moving up since the beginning of the year, but it more than doubled over this intermeeting period to its highest reading in two years, since the start of the survey.	13.0	999.0
201607	2135	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In the survey, 43 percent of respondents across a set of industries that includes construction, retail, and energy reported increasing prices, all at least modestly.	13.0	999.0
201607	2136	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Turning to the national economy, my outlook for the US economy over the medium run is little changed since our previous meeting.	13.0	999.0
201607	2137	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Once again, the resiliency of the US economy stands out for me.	13.0	999.0
201607	2138	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	At the time of our previous meeting, the upcoming vote on the UK referendum loomed large, and we had a very weak May employment report in hand.	13.0	999.0
201607	2139	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The outcome of the UK vote was a surprise and generated considerable volatility in financial markets.	13.0	999.0
201607	2140	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Since the vote, financial markets have calmed, and financial conditions are now more accommodative than they were at the time of our June meeting.	13.0	999.0
201607	2141	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Of course, we will be living with heightened political and economic uncertainty for a while as the United Kingdom and Europe establish the terms of their new relationship, but it’s gratifying to see that the worst-case scenarios that had been contemplated have, so far, been avoided.	13.0	999.0
201607	2142	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The jobs report showed a sizable rebound for May, which was even more disappointing than originally estimated.	13.0	999.0
201607	2143	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The rebound allayed concerns among some that we were at the start of a reversal of the considerable progress that has been made in labor markets, and it was another reminder that monthly data can be volatile.	13.0	999.0
201607	2144	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I’m not saying we should ignore the monthly reports, only that we need to be somewhat careful not to read too much into any one report, and we have to assess conditions on the basis of a broad set of indicators.	13.0	999.0
201607	2145	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	For labor markets, those include claims for unemployment insurance and the unemployment rate, which are low, and the rates of job openings, hiring, and quits, which are high.	13.0	999.0
201607	2146	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Averaging through the past three months, as many people have indicated, monthly payroll gains have averaged 147,000 per month.	13.0	999.0
201607	2147	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	This is a deceleration from the 200,000 monthly average seen in the first quarter, but it’s above current estimates of the pace of job growth consistent with stable labor utilization.	13.0	999.0
201607	2148	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The Tealbook estimates this to be roughly 85,000 jobs per month.	13.0	999.0
201607	2149	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Across several models that take into account the aging of the population and other demographic factors affecting labor force participation, the estimates range from about 75,000 to 120,000 per month, with the most recent estimates in the lower part of or even below that range.	13.0	999.0
201607	2150	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	For example, in the Cleveland staff model, the estimated trend pace of job gains is about 120,000 per month.	13.0	999.0
201607	2151	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The CBO currently estimates average monthly payroll growth of 75,000 over 2021 to 2026.	13.0	999.0
201607	2152	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Some relatively recent research done by Cleveland Federal Reserve economists puts it between 50,000 and 85,000, and a more recent study by Chicago Federal Reserve economists estimates trend monthly payroll employment growth to be about 50,000 now and rising to about 70,000 by 2020.	13.0	999.0
201607	2153	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In any case, the current pace of job growth, though slower than earlier in the year, is sufficient to generate further increases in labor utilization, provided labor force participation behaves roughly as anticipated.	13.0	999.0
201607	2154	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I think this is a point worth emphasizing.	13.0	999.0
201607	2155	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	We’ll have two employment reports before our next meeting.	13.0	999.0
201607	2156	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	It seems fairly likely that the next report won’t match June’s outsized increase of 287,000 jobs.	13.0	999.0
201607	2157	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	It could be quite a bit lower and below analysts’ estimates.	13.0	999.0
201607	2158	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	This poses a communications issue for us.	13.0	999.0
201607	2159	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Without the context, the headlines could be quite negative when in fact the pace is consistent with further improvement in the labor market.	13.0	999.0
201607	2160	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Current estimates indicate a rebound in GDP growth in the second quarter, back to a pace at or slightly above trend, with consumers leading the way but business investment remaining weak.	13.0	999.0
201607	2161	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The increase in oil prices has started to bring some investment activity in the energy sector back online.	13.0	999.0
201607	2162	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	However, the slowdown in investment has been broader, and it does pose a risk to longer-run potential economic growth.	13.0	999.0
201607	2163	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Like President Williams and President Lacker, I noticed that the Board staff had made a fairly large downward revision to their forecast of residential investment growth for this year.	13.0	999.0
201607	2164	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In contrast, I haven’t revised my outlook for the housing sector since the previous meeting.	13.0	999.0
201607	2165	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I continue to expect moderate growth in residential investment.	13.0	999.0
201607	2166	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	This is consistent with other private-sector forecasters.	13.0	999.0
201607	2167	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Single-family building permits rose in June and are moderately higher than a year ago.	13.0	999.0
201607	2168	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Sales of both new and existing homes have been moving higher, and we’ve been receiving positive reports on current and future housing activity from a District contact who is a large provider of coating materials to the national housing market.	13.0	999.0
201607	2169	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Mortgage rates are expected to remain low.	13.0	999.0
201607	2170	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicated a pickup in mortgage loan demand.	13.0	999.0
201607	2171	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	And while residential real estate lending standards remain tight, standards for GSE-eligible loans are easier than they’ve been, on average, since 2005.	13.0	999.0
201607	2172	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In addition, the Board staff estimates the annual NIPA revisions will show a higher level of residential investment last year than originally estimated.	13.0	999.0
201607	2173	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Perhaps this will result in a higher growth rate for last year, too, offsetting a slower rate this year.	13.0	999.0
201607	2174	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I view the inflation outlook as largely unchanged since our previous meeting and consistent with inflation gradually rising back to our 2 percent goal over time, with some ups and downs along that path.	13.0	999.0
201607	2175	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	This seems like a reasonable forecast, reflecting my expectation that economic growth will continue to be at or slightly above trend, that the unemployment rate will fall below estimates of this longer-run trend, and that inflation expectations have been and will continue to be reasonably stable.	13.0	999.0
201607	2176	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I note that the troubling dip in inflation expectations seen in the preliminary June Michigan survey was revised away in the final numbers.	13.0	999.0
201607	2177	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	We might see headline inflation move down in the immediate term, due to the drop in food prices and residual seasonality, but a gradual upward climb back to our goal seems reasonable to me, conditional on the outlook.	13.0	999.0
201607	2178	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	When you look at the trajectory of inflation over the past year, you see that we have indeed made progress as the earlier declines in energy prices and the effects of the sharp dollar appreciation have been passing through.	13.0	999.0
201607	2179	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Both headline and core measures of inflation have gradually moved up since last fall.	13.0	999.0
201607	2180	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I think we should take some comfort in that trajectory.	13.0	999.0
201607	2181	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In thinking about appropriate monetary policy, I’m guided by the medium-run outlook and risks associated with that, as well as the progress we have made and future progress we anticipate making on our two monetary policy goals.	13.0	999.0
201607	2182	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I think we’re basically at our goal of maximum employment from the standpoint of what we can do with monetary policy.	13.0	999.0
201607	2183	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	And even if there’s some uncertainty associated with that, I think it’s pretty clear that we’re close to that goal.	13.0	999.0
201607	2184	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Inflation remains below our goal, but here, too, we’ve been moving in the right direction.	13.0	999.0
201607	2185	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Forecasts, including the Tealbook and the Cleveland Federal Reserve staff model, show the unemployment rate moving down and inflation moving up, even as the federal funds rate rises gradually over the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201607	2186	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	While there are downside risks to the forecast, those have subsided somewhat since our previous meeting.	13.0	999.0
201607	2187	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The worst-case scenarios after the UK referendum were not realized, and fears about employment were allayed after the June report.	13.0	999.0
201607	2188	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	There are also upside risks to the forecast.	13.0	999.0
201607	2189	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I found the alternative scenario “Weaker Productivity with Higher Inflation” a good illustration of the type of upside risk we should not ignore.	13.0	999.0
201607	2190	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In this simulation, the policy rate path needs to be considerably steeper than the one we are anticipating.	13.0	999.0
201607	2191	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In addition longer-term yields on Treasuries are down since the start of the year, but the Board staff estimates about two- thirds of the decline reflects lower term premiums, while one-third represents lower average expected future short rates.	13.0	999.0
201607	2192	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The lower term premiums represent an easing in financial conditions that should be supportive of economic activity and, if sustained, is an upside risk to the forecast.	13.0	999.0
201607	2193	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	That said, I don’t believe we are “behind the curve” yet with respect to monetary policy.	13.0	999.0
201607	2194	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In my view, the gradual upward path of policy, as indicated in our FOMC communications and in the June SEPs, continues to be appropriate.	13.0	999.0
201607	2195	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	No one’s talking about the need to sharply raise interest rates.	13.0	999.0
201607	2196	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	What’s left to talk about is timing.	13.0	999.0
201607	2197	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	It reminds me of that old joke that ends: “We’ve established what you are, Madam, now it’s just a matter of haggling over the price.”	13.0	999.0
201607	2198	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	So if we continue to communicate that a gradual upward path is appropriate, then at some point we will need to take another step on the path.	13.0	999.0
201607	2199	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Of course, if we no longer think such a path is appropriate, then it’s incumbent on us to say that.	13.0	999.0
201607	2200	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Now, it could very well be that we are in a new economic environment with low equilibrium real rates that will last for a long time, meaning that the same level of the funds rate is less accommodative than in the past.	13.0	999.0
201607	2201	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	And the policy trajectory may need to be even more shallow than we think.	13.0	999.0
201607	2202	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	But the anticipated gradual policy rate path takes this possibility into account and allows for recalibration along the way.	13.0	999.0
201607	2203	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	It recognizes that there are large error bands around the SEP forecasts regarding the economy and the policy rate path, even if we, as a Committee, can’t agree to show those confidence bands to the public.	13.0	999.0
201607	2204	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	But even if r* is low, it isn’t a situation that supports maintaining the funds rate at 25 to 50 basis points indefinitely, even as we continue to make progress on our goals.	13.0	999.0
201607	2205	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I continue to believe monetary policy should be forward looking.	13.0	999.0
201607	2206	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Trying to purposely drive the economy to overheat in an attempt to generate a faster return to 2 percent inflation and a cyclical rebound in labor force participation seems ill advised and risky.	13.0	999.0
201607	2207	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I can’t point to any historical examples of central banks pursuing this strategy that have ended well.	13.0	999.0
201607	2208	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I think it overestimates our ability to control things, and it seems inconsistent with a gradual policy rate path.	13.0	999.0
201607	2209	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	It seems more likely that it would require an L-shaped path, low for long and then steeper thereafter.	13.0	999.0
201607	2210	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	So I really couldn’t support pursuing that strategy.	13.0	999.0
201607	2211	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	At some point, conditional on the outlook and associated risks, we will need to raise the funds rate.	13.0	999.0
201607	2212	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	And then, consistent with the gradual path, we can take some time to assess the situation.	13.0	999.0
201607	2213	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The gradual path doesn’t anticipate increases at each FOMC meeting.	13.0	999.0
201607	2214	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Indeed, I recall we settled on the language of “gradual path” to dissuade the public from thinking that once we started, we expected to move at every meeting.	13.0	999.0
201607	2215	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	If the medium-run outlook changes significantly, then we can hold rates there for a while or even reverse course.	13.0	999.0
201607	2216	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I wouldn’t view that as an error, just as I don’t view December’s increase as an error, even though we haven’t raised the rate since then.	13.0	999.0
201607	2217	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The exact timing and ultimate policy rate path are data dependent, meaning they depend on how economic conditions, the outlook, and the risks to the outlook are evolving.	13.0	999.0
201607	2218	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	This is the nature of policymaking when the future is uncertain.	13.0	999.0
201607	2219	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	But that’s nothing new—the future is always uncertain.	13.0	999.0
201607	2220	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201607	2221	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	2222	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13.0	65.0
201607	2223	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201607	2224	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	On balance, the reports from my directors and other business contacts were somewhat more upbeat this round.	13.0	91.0
201607	2225	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	The commentary still seemed in line with the roughly 2 percent economic growth we’ve seen for some time.	13.0	91.0
201607	2226	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	But whereas my contacts before were only hopeful that they would achieve their 2016 business plans, now they have more confidence that they will actually meet these goals.	13.0	91.0
201607	2227	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Among the positive reports this round, my director who heads Motorola Solutions reported an increase in his order backlog and a better outlook from a variety of customers.	13.0	91.0
201607	2228	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Regarding President Williams’s comments on housing, several other directors pointed to improved residential construction, with one noting a change in the composition of activity from multifamily to single-family units.	13.0	91.0
201607	2229	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	My director from Commonwealth Edison reported stronger usage across its customer base and noted that it was hiring to meet increased demand for new connections, and residential is a large part of that.	13.0	91.0
201607	2230	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	More generally, my contact at Manpower Employment Services described increasing labor demand and a modest pickup in nominal wage growth, consistent with a tightening labor market.	13.0	91.0
201607	2231	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	He noted that the pickup in wages extended beyond just high-skilled workers.	13.0	91.0
201607	2232	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Firms in the services sector have been doing quite well, which is bolstering demand for lower-skilled and entry-level workers as well.	13.0	91.0
201607	2233	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	None of my contacts expressed serious concerns about Brexit, although some said it was too early to tell.	13.0	91.0
201607	2234	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	To be sure, not all reports were positive.	13.0	91.0
201607	2235	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	In particular, most manufacturing firms are still struggling, and I found President Lacker’s positive comments from the Machine Technology Association to be very interesting.	13.0	91.0
201607	2236	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I look forward to learning more about that.	13.0	91.0
201607	2237	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Caterpillar and Deere continue to note challenges.	13.0	91.0
201607	2238	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Business lines related to natural resource extraction and construction remain soft.	13.0	91.0
201607	2239	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	It was also noted that their earlier projections for increases in state and local government infrastructure spending had been slower to materialize than expected.	13.0	91.0
201607	2240	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Other manufacturers had similar stories.	13.0	91.0
201607	2241	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Turning to my macroeconomic outlook, our GDP forecast is a tad stronger than the Tealbook’s.	13.0	91.0
201607	2242	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	We see GDP growth at about 2 percent this year and then a bit stronger in 2017.	13.0	91.0
201607	2243	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Another difference is that we currently think that there’s a little more slack in labor markets than indicated in the Tealbook.	13.0	91.0
201607	2244	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Still, under our forecast, slack is essentially gone by early next year.	13.0	91.0
201607	2245	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	The June labor market report and incoming consumer spending data increased our confidence in this outlook.	13.0	91.0
201607	2246	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	We also see somewhat stronger investment growth than the Tealbook, although it’s not gangbusters.	13.0	91.0
201607	2247	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	This, in part, reflects analysis of a new data source by my staff.	13.0	91.0
201607	2248	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	We’ve obtained data from a local firm, Textura, that processes commercial construction contract payments and budgets.	13.0	91.0
201607	2249	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	This is one of those new high technologies being brought to bear on business procedure today.	13.0	91.0
201607	2250	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	It basically is working with an old construction payments mechanism in which people put liens on the building every time they finish part of it, then get paid and take the lien back, and then put another lien on so that somebody won’t fail to pay you when you’ve done something for them.	13.0	91.0
201607	2251	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	They now do this digitally and as a clearinghouse for people, and that’s basically the value proposition.	13.0	91.0
201607	2252	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	The contracts represent about 4 percent of total US construction spending, but have a national reach.	13.0	91.0
201607	2253	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Our experimental indicator, on the basis of the budgeting data, appears to provide a six-month lead for predicting total US construction spending.	13.0	91.0
201607	2254	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Right now, on the basis of the data we have, it is pointing to a modest pickup in construction spending in the second half of the year.	13.0	91.0
201607	2255	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	While I’m feeling somewhat better about my projection of economic growth, I still see the balance of risks as weighted somewhat to the downside, and I remain concerned that the international situation could deteriorate with attendant movements in the dollar and financial conditions weighing on spending.	13.0	91.0
201607	2256	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I thought Governor Brainard covered that territory extremely well.	13.0	91.0
201607	2257	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Also, if, for some reason, the US consumer were to falter, I don’t see the other components of domestic demand picking up the slack.	13.0	91.0
201607	2258	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Turning to inflation, my outlook, again, is close to the Tealbook.	13.0	91.0
201607	2259	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I’m projecting 2016 core inflation to be 1.6 percent.	13.0	91.0
201607	2260	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Further ahead, I see both core and total inflation moving up gradually but still falling a bit short of our 2 percent target at the end of 2018.	13.0	91.0
201607	2261	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Furthermore, as I discussed at our previous meeting, I see meaningful downside risks to this forecast.	13.0	91.0
201607	2262	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Most important, inflation compensation in financial markets and survey measures of inflation expectations continue to bounce along at extremely low levels, and my business contacts still report no significant inflationary pressures or pricing power to pass along any cost pressures they actually do face.	13.0	91.0
201607	2263	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	If we were really going to see a quick return to 2 percent core inflation, I would expect to see something more bubbling up with these indicators.	13.0	91.0
201607	2264	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I hope that these will turn around as we move through the year, but I remain skeptical.	13.0	91.0
201607	2265	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	And I agree with Governor Tarullo’s risk-management assessment regarding upward inflation realizations relative to our expectations as well as the financial stability risk responses.	13.0	91.0
201607	2266	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201607	2267	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	2268	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13.0	65.0
201607	2269	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201607	2270	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	At the June FOMC meeting, I discussed the St Louis Fed’s new approach to the macroeconomic outlook.	13.0	94.0
201607	2271	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	In my remarks today, I plan to compare that outlook with the July Tealbook to try to better illustrate what the differences may be.	13.0	94.0
201607	2272	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	As you may recall, the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis’ new approach is based on a regime conceptualization that does not rely on convergence properties of an economy returning to a long-run steady state.	13.0	94.0
201607	2273	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	There are three parts to the current regime, as we view it:  number one, low productivity growth; number two, a very low real return on short-term government debt, which we labeled r†; and, three, no recession.	13.0	94.0
201607	2274	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	To see r†, the staff has kindly provided in Michael Kiley’s report, exhibit 2, chart 4, the expected real equity return.	13.0	94.0
201607	2275	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This shows the staff’s estimate of the expected 10-year real equity return as well as the expected real yield on the 10- year Treasury, with a substantial difference between the two.	13.0	94.0
201607	2276	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The expected real return on the Treasury is negative, as it has been for the past several years on and off.	13.0	94.0
201607	2277	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	What we’re talking about is short-term debt, so this would be even lower than the red line in this figure.	13.0	94.0
201607	2278	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	That’s a big part of our regime.	13.0	94.0
201607	2279	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Also, very helpfully, this picture shows the long-term decline in the red line from the 1980s.	13.0	94.0
201607	2280	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Because this thing’s been declining secularly for a long time, we see no reason to predict that this is going to suddenly turn up and go to a higher value.	13.0	94.0
201607	2281	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Or, if you want to look at related evidence, I think it would give you the same story here.	13.0	94.0
201607	2282	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	As of today, we see no evidence that we have or are likely to switch out of any of the three elements of the current regime.	13.0	94.0
201607	2283	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Real returns to government debt remain exceptionally low, productivity growth remains exceptionally low, and recession probabilities are low as well.	13.0	94.0
201607	2284	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	We therefore think the most appropriate forecast, as most cyclical adjustment is likely over, is that the US economy will remain in the current regime for the foreseeable future.	13.0	94.0
201607	2285	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Anecdotal evidence from around the Eighth District seems to corroborate this judgment.	13.0	94.0
201607	2286	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Accordingly, we continue to forecast real GDP growth of 2 percent for 2016, 2017, and 2018; fourth-quarter average unemployment of 4.7 percent for all three years; and trimmed mean inflation of 2 percent for all three years.	13.0	94.0
201607	2287	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Given the regime, the appropriate policy rate supporting this outcome is just 63 basis points over the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201607	2288	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Essentially, because there’s no concept of a long-run steady state, there’s no requirement that the policy rate begin a long march back to its longer-run average level.	13.0	94.0
201607	2289	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is true so long as the current regime remains the best description of the macroeconomic environment.	13.0	94.0
201607	2290	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The July Tealbook, in contrast, has 1.7 percent real GDP growth for 2016, somewhat lower than us, accelerating to 2½ percent for 2017.	13.0	94.0
201607	2291	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Faster growth is just around the corner.	13.0	94.0
201607	2292	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	But if you average these two figures, you will get 2.1 percent, approximately the same as the St Louis forecast with a bit of difference in timing.	13.0	94.0
201607	2293	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Unemployment falls, according to the Tealbook, but only to 4.6 percent at the end of 2017, almost the same as the St Louis forecast.	13.0	94.0
201607	2294	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	In the Tealbook forecast, inflation rises toward 2 percent only slowly.	13.0	94.0
201607	2295	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The Tealbook baseline uses the new version of the Taylor (1999) policy rule and forecasts a 200-plus basis point increase in the policy rate to support these outcomes through the end of 2018.	13.0	94.0
201607	2296	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is just a little less than one move per quarter.	13.0	94.0
201607	2297	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	In reality, since the end of quantitative easing, we are moving at a pace closer to once per year.	13.0	94.0
201607	2298	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Markets think we may go even slower than this.	13.0	94.0
201607	2299	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	In my view, this mismatch is hurting our credibility.	13.0	94.0
201607	2300	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is the main difference between the Tealbook forecast and the new St Louis Federal Reserve approach.	13.0	94.0
201607	2301	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	In the Tealbook, there’s a long-run steady state to which the economy must converge.	13.0	94.0
201607	2302	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	As gaps are closed, the policy rate essentially has to return to its long-run normal level.	13.0	94.0
201607	2303	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This leads to a 200-plus basis point increase in the policy rate over the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201607	2304	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	In the regime-based approach, the policy rate can be set for the regime.	13.0	94.0
201607	2305	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Gaps can be zero, but the policy rate can remain low because the regime does not require a high value of the policy rate in order to remain consistent with the inflation target.	13.0	94.0
201607	2306	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Which approach is better?	13.0	94.0
201607	2307	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	At this juncture, I think the regime’s [laughter], with low unemployment, allows for a better match between the policy choices and the policy environment.	13.0	94.0
201607	2308	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	What are the risks to this outlook?	13.0	94.0
201607	2309	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Although the comments on Brexit have been extensive, I’m going to comment, nevertheless.	13.0	94.0
201607	2310	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I was actually in Europe as Brexit passed, including in London for part of that trip.	13.0	94.0
201607	2311	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	My judgment is that the ultimate effects on the United States are negligible.	13.0	94.0
201607	2312	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is a trade negotiation that will likely take many years.	13.0	94.0
201607	2313	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	In my opinion, the incentives are for both sides to reach a deal eventually.	13.0	94.0
201607	2314	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This deal will not be that different from current arrangements.	13.0	94.0
201607	2315	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	On the basis of conversations that I had in Europe, it seems that contagion to other EU members in the east or south of the EU is unlikely.	13.0	94.0
201607	2316	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Many of those countries have their own reasons for wanting to be in the EU and would not likely vote to get out.	13.0	94.0
201607	2317	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Trade negotiations are going on all around the world all the time.	13.0	94.0
201607	2318	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	One recent example is Canada, which was in a seven-year negotiation with the EU.	13.0	94.0
201607	2319	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I never saw it come up here as a concern one way or the other or as a positive upside.	13.0	94.0
201607	2320	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	So I don’t think that this is the kind of thing that’s going to affect US monetary policy over the near term or in the medium term.	13.0	94.0
201607	2321	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	There’s a question of another risk, which would be a stronger dollar post-Brexit.	13.0	94.0
201607	2322	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The current dollar move is relatively small compared with the big dollar move in the second half of 2014.	13.0	94.0
201607	2323	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The dollar is actually lower today than it was earlier this year.	13.0	94.0
201607	2324	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	And, furthermore, I think the dollar gets overemphasized around this table.	13.0	94.0
201607	2325	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The contribution of net exports to the US real GDP growth, which was discussed earlier, has actually been close to zero over the past four quarters for which we have data—that is, from 2015:Q2 to 2016:Q1.	13.0	94.0
201607	2326	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	That zero contribution over those four quarters is actually stronger than the net export contribution to GDP growth during 2001 to 2007 or during the 1990s expansion.	13.0	94.0
201607	2327	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	So in terms of contributions to GDP growth, we’re actually doing better over the past year than we did during the entire 1990s expansion or the 2000s expansion.	13.0	94.0
201607	2328	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The zero number is despite the very large trade-weighted dollar move in the second half of 2014, which was significant, on the order of 15 to 20 percent, and persistent.	13.0	94.0
201607	2329	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	You got a big move up and it leveled out, so it was just the kind of experiment that you’d like to see if you wanted to see a large effect from the exchange rate.	13.0	94.0
201607	2330	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	There was an effect of the dollar move, I think, on net exports, but it looks like it was mostly in 2014:Q4 and 2015:Q1.	13.0	94.0
201607	2331	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	In those two quarters, we did get outsized negative contributions of net exports to GDP growth.	13.0	94.0
201607	2332	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	That period seems to have borne the brunt.	13.0	94.0
201607	2333	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	My anecdotal reports from manufacturers around the Eighth District seem to suggest that the big dollar move at that point was a big surprise.	13.0	94.0
201607	2334	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	It did affect their businesses.	13.0	94.0
201607	2335	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	They did have to reorganize internationally.	13.0	94.0
201607	2336	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	But it’s not like they hadn’t thought about this before.	13.0	94.0
201607	2337	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	They knew how to go about it.	13.0	94.0
201607	2338	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	It takes about a year to make adjustments, and it sounds to me like all of these adjustments have now been made, so you wouldn’t expect further effects from that particular move in the dollar.	13.0	94.0
201607	2339	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	As far as a stronger dollar post-Brexit, I don’t see that as a risk.	13.0	94.0
201607	2340	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Furthermore, I think future monetary policy is already priced in, both for the US central bank and for other major central banks, so I doubt dollar moves are predictable, and I would not count on them as part of the outlook.	13.0	94.0
201607	2341	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Now, other risks to the regime conceptualization of the US macroeconomy:  One is Phillips curve effects.	13.0	94.0
201607	2342	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	We’re downplaying Phillips-curve effects.	13.0	94.0
201607	2343	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	There’s no question about it.	13.0	94.0
201607	2344	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	We have a relatively strong labor market over the past couple of years, and yet this doesn’t create any inflation.	13.0	94.0
201607	2345	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	It’s very possible that the Phillips curve would reassert itself, but we’re listing that as a risk to the outlook, not as something that we’re putting into the baseline case.	13.0	94.0
201607	2346	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Also, as several people have mentioned tangentially here, that market-based measures of inflation expectations are extremely low is a concern.	13.0	94.0
201607	2347	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Right now, I’m listing it as a risk to the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis forecast.	13.0	94.0
201607	2348	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	And, finally, several people here have discussed asset bubbles.	13.0	94.0
201607	2349	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Our approach, frankly, has little to say about this, so we’re just listing that as something that is outside the model and something that we will have to make a judgment about at some point in the future.	13.0	94.0
201607	2350	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t see asset bubble risk as being heightened at this juncture, but it is something I may be concerned about at some point in the future.	13.0	94.0
201607	2351	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	But the approach that we’ve written down really has very little to say to help us make a judgment on that dimension.	13.0	94.0
201607	2352	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201607	2353	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201607	2354	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	13.0	65.0
201607	2355	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	111.0
201607	2356	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The Ninth District economy continues to perform well.	13.0	111.0
201607	2357	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Employment has been growing modestly overall, hampered by anecdotes of ongoing poor labor availability.	13.0	111.0
201607	2358	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We often hear that worker scarcity is a problem, that employers can’t find workers with the skills that they need.	13.0	111.0
201607	2359	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And then usually I turn around and ask them, “Okay.	13.0	111.0
201607	2360	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Are you raising wages?”	13.0	111.0
201607	2361	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	“No.	13.0	111.0
201607	2362	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We’re not in a position to do that.”	13.0	111.0
201607	2363	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So I take these anecdotes with a grain of salt.	13.0	111.0
201607	2364	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Until we see them raising wages, I don’t take much information from them.	13.0	111.0
201607	2365	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The national economy continues to grow at a modest pace.	13.0	111.0
201607	2366	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The labor market is in good health overall, but I don’t see any signs of overheating.	13.0	111.0
201607	2367	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Rather, on balance, when I look at all of the data over the past year, it seems to be moving more or less sideways—not huge wage growth, not employment cost growth, et cetera.	13.0	111.0
201607	2368	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I think we’re going to be lucky if we see overall 2 percent GDP growth for 2016 as a whole.	13.0	111.0
201607	2369	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	On the inflation front, inflation continues to run below target.	13.0	111.0
201607	2370	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I don’t see clear evidence of a sustained move upward toward our 2 percent target.	13.0	111.0
201607	2371	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And, as others have noted, some measures of inflation expectations are worryingly low.	13.0	111.0
201607	2372	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Internationally, I have more concerns.	13.0	111.0
201607	2373	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	If I just think objectively, developments since our previous meeting have not been positive.	13.0	111.0
201607	2374	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Our base case was “No Brexit.”	13.0	111.0
201607	2375	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We had the Brexit, so that’s a negative even if it wasn’t as bad as we’d feared.	13.0	111.0
201607	2376	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We’ve seen fresh strains in global banks, especially in Italian banks.	13.0	111.0
201607	2377	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We saw a potential coup in Turkey.	13.0	111.0
201607	2378	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We’ve seen repeated terrorist attacks.	13.0	111.0
201607	2379	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Some of these are not economic events, but they nonetheless affect confidence, and they’re all tilted to the negative.	13.0	111.0
201607	2380	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Now, I hope that the US economy will mostly escape these headwinds coming from abroad, but, like the Tealbook, I do continue to see the risks to the outlook for the real economy and for inflation as tilted to the downside.	13.0	111.0
201607	2381	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I don’t see these risks as having materially diminished since we last met in June.	13.0	111.0
201607	2382	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	One other comment I’ll make is that this discussion today makes me think about the optimal control exercise in Tealbook B.	13.0	111.0
201607	2383	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And I struggle with this notion.	13.0	111.0
201607	2384	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	No one is suggesting this today, but I struggle with the notion that there may come a time when inflation is low but we need to get the unemployment rate up.	13.0	111.0
201607	2385	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I just struggle with that as not being credible, that we need to get the unemployment rate up when there’s no inflation immediately on the horizon.	13.0	111.0
201607	2386	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I think that that runs afoul of, really, the mandate that we have been given.	13.0	111.0
201607	2387	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So, for me, the optimal control exercise with the asymmetric weight on the unemployment rate gap is the one that I found compelling.	13.0	111.0
201607	2388	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We say that 2 percent is a target, not a ceiling.	13.0	111.0
201607	2389	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	If we really mean that, then we should be as concerned about inflation under target as we are over target.	13.0	111.0
201607	2390	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So that’s what’s governing my thinking as I think through these various options.	13.0	111.0
201607	2391	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	13.0	111.0
201607	2392	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	2393	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13.0	65.0
201607	2394	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	102.0
201607	2395	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The data since our June meeting confirmed that the economic expansion is on track.	13.0	102.0
201607	2396	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Consumer spending has been notably strong, supported by a healthy labor market, improving household balance sheets, and still-low gas prices.	13.0	102.0
201607	2397	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	More broadly, my forecast is not much different than it was last month, or, for that matter, from last December when we lifted off.	13.0	102.0
201607	2398	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ve seen an easing in domestic headwinds that have been weighing on the economy.	13.0	102.0
201607	2399	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Household deleveraging appears to have largely run its course, and fiscal policy has now turned to being modestly stimulative.	13.0	102.0
201607	2400	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In this regard, I think I’d like to make a comment about the discussion concerning r* and the increase in the value of the dollar.	13.0	102.0
201607	2401	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t disagree with any of the things that are said about whether a higher value of the US dollar versus other currencies is like an increase in the fed funds rate, but let’s be careful not to double-count.	13.0	102.0
201607	2402	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	My own view that r*, for example, is very low is in part because of the increase of the dollar.	13.0	102.0
201607	2403	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The higher dollar is one of the factors pushing r* down, at least in the short run, to the levels around zero that Thomas and I estimate.	13.0	102.0
201607	2404	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I just warn against using both the low-r* story and the story that attributes it to “the increase in the dollar,” as if we had already raised the funds rate 150 basis points.	13.0	102.0
201607	2405	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think I would just be cautious that we’re not double-counting.	13.0	102.0
201607	2406	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	At our June meeting, uncertainty from the looming Brexit vote was a significant factor arguing for keeping policy on hold.	13.0	102.0
201607	2407	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Although the vote was a surprise, the lasting fallout for the US economy is likely to be minimal.	13.0	102.0
201607	2408	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, US financial conditions, as many have noted, are, on balance, more favorable than they were before our June meeting, when they were already notably more favorable than they were back in December.	13.0	102.0
201607	2409	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Short- and longer-term interest rates have moved lower since our June meeting.	13.0	102.0
201607	2410	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Mortgage lending standards are reported to have eased further for many borrowers, and equity prices have risen to all-time highs.	13.0	102.0
201607	2411	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the broad trade-weighted dollar is little changed.	13.0	102.0
201607	2412	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of the Brexit risk, I’m going to respond a little bit to what President Kashkari said.	13.0	102.0
201607	2413	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	When I thought about the risk, I thought there was maybe a 50–50 chance of Brexit.	13.0	102.0
201607	2414	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m sorry, I’m going to keep saying “Brexit” just to drive Steve crazy.	13.0	102.0
201607	2415	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13.0	102.0
201607	2416	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I thought that there was a risk of it happening, and then an uncertainty or huge distribution of what would happen after that.	13.0	102.0
201607	2417	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So when I think of the overall risks, in my mind it was 50–50, and it went 52– 48, voting for “yes.”	13.0	102.0
201607	2418	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It is important to say, “Well, what’s happened since then?”	13.0	102.0
201607	2419	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, personally, I have always viewed the biggest risk as being the political risks regarding Brexit.	13.0	102.0
201607	2420	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	There I view the immediate aftermath—when basically every leader in Britain stepped down, and there was talk in Europe about rapid activation of Article 50, and all that—as looking like a bad political risk.	13.0	102.0
201607	2421	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But since then, we’ve seen the British government actually quickly form again, and the leadership, I think, lay out a position of a slow walk in terms of Brexit.	13.0	102.0
201607	2422	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I think calmer heads have prevailed on the continent politically regarding Brexit, specifically the chancellor in Germany, who’s made it clear that they want to see this process go more slowly.	13.0	102.0
201607	2423	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So although I’m not going to pretend that the risks aren’t still there, I do think that in a way—so far, as least—what we’ve seen has been in the less-bad set of possible outcomes.	13.0	102.0
201607	2424	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Although my GDP growth forecast for this year remains close to 2 percent, I think what’s important, at least from my view, is how to think about what 2 percent means in terms of characterizing that both in our internal discussions and our external communications.	13.0	102.0
201607	2425	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In this regard, a lot of what I’m about to say is very close to what President Mester said about employment, but let me start with GDP.	13.0	102.0
201607	2426	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	As I mentioned last meeting, my own estimate of potential growth is 1.6 percent, which is basically what the Tealbook has currently, but that’s also my view on the basis of analysis by our staff of what the longer-run potential growth for the US economy is, in view of the demographic trends and the slow productivity trend that we seem to be on.	13.0	102.0
201607	2427	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I did test-run this idea that we’re on a slower path of economic growth with our business contacts, and, in fact, I got very little pushback to this notion.	13.0	102.0
201607	2428	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	By and large, our business contacts have seen relatively small productivity gains in recent years.	13.0	102.0
201607	2429	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	None of them were predicting a resurgence, and although they all highlight the use of new technologies and are looking for new ways to increase productivity, the examples they give and the way they talk about it is about incremental gains in productivity.	13.0	102.0
201607	2430	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, of course, they do argue that productivity gains are held back by barriers such as compliance, complexity, cybersecurity, and those kinds of issues.	13.0	102.0
201607	2431	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Given this assessment of potential—1.6 percent potential growth—in my lexicon, “moderate growth” is the sustainable trend increase that we should look for, and it’s on the order of 1½ percent.	13.0	102.0
201607	2432	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, like the Tealbook, I expect 2 percent growth in the second half of this year, and that’s an above-trend pace that exceeds my estimate of long-run growth as well as the Tealbook’s.	13.0	102.0
201607	2433	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So to my mind, 2 percent growth is a solid pace of economic growth, and the economy is on track to exceed potential by a significant amount over the next couple of years.	13.0	102.0
201607	2434	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Similarly, it’s important to recalibrate our thinking and our language regarding employment growth.	13.0	102.0
201607	2435	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I know a number of people have mentioned this, but I just want to reiterate it.	13.0	102.0
201607	2436	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Job gains have continued to be at a well above their steady-state trend.	13.0	102.0
201607	2437	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In 2014 and 2015, the economy added nearly 3 million jobs a year, and this year we are on track to add another 2 million, according to the Tealbook.	13.0	102.0
201607	2438	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	According to the Tealbook’s estimates—there are a range of estimates out there, and we’ve already heard about a few of them—trend employment is only 85,000 jobs a month, and that’s about 1 million jobs a year.	13.0	102.0
201607	2439	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The excellent staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, in their recent reexamination of this study, suggested that trend number may be as low as 50,000 jobs per month, or 600,000 per year.	13.0	102.0
201607	2440	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Over the first half of this year, we’ve seen monthly job gains of 172,000 per month, which is double—I’m going to do the doubling and tripling rule—what the Tealbook thinks of as trend and more than triple that of the Chicago Fed’s estimate.	13.0	102.0
201607	2441	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I view 170,000 job gains not as “moderate” but as “strong” or even “robust.”	13.0	102.0
201607	2442	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, in fact, it’s unsustainable, because, due to the limited remaining slack in labor markets, we should expect the pace of job gains to slow down.	13.0	102.0
201607	2443	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And if we don’t see the pace of job gains slowing down, we will need to raise rates faster than the Committee currently anticipates.	13.0	102.0
201607	2444	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, there have been notable month-to-month fluctuations in job gains, with June bouncing back from a weak report in May, but this rebound was largely predictable.	13.0	102.0
201607	2445	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Not only were the May gains out of line with the other indicators—and we talked about that at our previous meeting—but identifiable transitory factors held down the May number.	13.0	102.0
201607	2446	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Those included the Verizon strike and weather.	13.0	102.0
201607	2447	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	As I reported last month, my staff looked at county- level data and found that weather affects employment patterns and had a significant effect, especially, on May.	13.0	102.0
201607	2448	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	According to their model, good weather earlier in the spring pulled forward job gains for May, and when you adjust it for the Verizon strike, job gains in May were about in the 150,000 range.	13.0	102.0
201607	2449	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So this same analysis finds that weather effects had very small effects on the June employment numbers.	13.0	102.0
201607	2450	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Finally, in terms of inflation, we remain on course to return to 2 percent inflation.	13.0	102.0
201607	2451	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Core inflation was only one- or two-tenths below our objective in the first half of this year, and I’m now going to respond to something that President Evans said.	13.0	102.0
201607	2452	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Obviously, in the first half of the year there were transitory factors pushing up core inflation.	13.0	102.0
201607	2453	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I recognize that.	13.0	102.0
201607	2454	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But it is interesting that we essentially had core inflation of 2 percent, but the anecdotal stories aren’t saying that inflation is high.	13.0	102.0
201607	2455	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I’m guessing that when we’re at 2 percent underlying inflation, maybe we would not be hearing about that anecdotally, but, again, I’m not taking a very strong signal in the first half.	13.0	102.0
201607	2456	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think there are transitory factors.	13.0	102.0
201607	2457	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But my overall outlook continues to be one in which a strong labor market will increase inflationary pressures and bring inflation back to 2 percent.	13.0	102.0
201607	2458	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	One of the things that I do regularly to gauge how much confidence I should have in different measures of inflation is to look at all of the different measures of inflation—we talk a lot about the trimmed mean and PCE; we talk about CPI.	13.0	102.0
201607	2459	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	For each of them, we do a process in which we basically try to adjust for the different means or trends in the series to make them comparable.	13.0	102.0
201607	2460	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	When you look through May at all the different inflation indicators that are published, adjusted to have the same mean as the core PCE price index, they’re all running about 1½ to 1.8 percent, with 1.6 and 1.7 being right there in the median.	13.0	102.0
201607	2461	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So what I find interesting is that all the inflation measures are telling us the same thing.	13.0	102.0
201607	2462	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	There doesn’t seem to be a lot of, shall we say, uncertainty associated with that, and they all have been showing an increase over the past year.	13.0	102.0
201607	2463	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The last thing I’ll just mention on risks is that I view them as fundamentally balanced.	13.0	102.0
201607	2464	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do want to comment that, as I think has already been mentioned, perhaps by President Mester, there are always risks, and I think it’s very hard to find the upside risks in the news.	13.0	102.0
201607	2465	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	President Kashkari, the headlines don’t say there wasn’t a bad thing happening today.	13.0	102.0
201607	2466	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	They’re always going to say there’s a bad thing happening.	13.0	102.0
201607	2467	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I know we live in a world in which there’s a lot of tragedy and a lot of news on killings or the coup or things like that, but I don’t know whether that particularly tells us the risks are greater or less than normal.	13.0	102.0
201607	2468	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	My own assessment is, we’re basically at about the normal over the past 20 years, when there’s been a lot of events that happened during that time, too.	13.0	102.0
201607	2469	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13.0	102.0
201607	2470	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Maybe I’m spending too much time on Twitter.	13.0	111.0
201607	2471	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	[Laughter.]	13.0	111.0
201607	2472	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	2473	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13.0	65.0
201607	2474	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I could make a comment.	13.0	96.0
201607	2475	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It wouldn’t be politic.	13.0	96.0
201607	2476	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201607	2477	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	As has been the case for some time, my baseline forecast hasn’t changed much.	13.0	96.0
201607	2478	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think I’m pretty much along with everybody else, expecting the economy to grow at about a 2 percent pace over the next year or two and that this will lead to payroll employment gains sufficient to produce a gradual further tightening in the labor market.	13.0	96.0
201607	2479	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	This, in turn, should eventually push inflation back up toward our 2 percent objective.	13.0	96.0
201607	2480	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the economic growth, I was cheered by the sharp step-up in payroll employment that we saw in June because it did remove a question mark that existed because of the weakness in May.	13.0	96.0
201607	2481	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, I think the pickup in consumer spending growth in the second quarter is welcome because it confirms our expectation that the high real income gains we saw in the first quarter were actually going to provide more support for consumer spending.	13.0	96.0
201607	2482	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It got spread out over a little bit longer period.	13.0	96.0
201607	2483	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Nevertheless, I think it’s important not to get too excited about all of this.	13.0	96.0
201607	2484	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	First, employment growth and real income growth do appear to be slowing, so the supports that we have to consumer spending will likely be less positive.	13.0	96.0
201607	2485	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And, second, when you look at the rest of the economy, all the other sectors still have issues.	13.0	96.0
201607	2486	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Investment spending has been very soft.	13.0	96.0
201607	2487	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Trade and inventories are likely to be drags on economic growth.	13.0	96.0
201607	2488	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And we can debate about whether the recovery in housing is slowing down, but I think you can generally say it’s been disappointing—it’s been upward but slow and choppy.	13.0	96.0
201607	2489	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Moreover, I do think there’s some risk that election-year uncertainty could have some negative effects on economic activity this year.	13.0	96.0
201607	2490	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I’m of the view, more in the “Kashkari camp” than the “Williams camp,” that I think it’s unlikely that the economy will surprise us on the upside over the next several months, and I do see some downside risks to growth.	13.0	96.0
201607	2491	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I agree that the initial negative reaction to the Brexit vote evident in the financial markets was very short lived, but there are still a number of channels by which Brexit could still hurt the US economy.	13.0	96.0
201607	2492	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We obviously know that UK growth will slow as a consequence, and I agree that the direct effect of slower UK growth on US trade will almost certainly be very small because total US exports to the United Kingdom are only about 0.7 percent of US GDP.	13.0	96.0
201607	2493	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But it seems to me that there are a number of other channels that could amplify the effect of the Brexit decision on US economic activity, such as the effects on European economic activity and the perceived health of the global banking system and, potentially, on global financial conditions.	13.0	96.0
201607	2494	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If you remember, as we went through the financial crisis, we had good days, we had good weeks, and we had good months.	13.0	96.0
201607	2495	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And just because the reaction to the Brexit vote outcome has turned out a little bit more favorably recently, I would not conclude that the story is over yet, especially when we haven’t really gotten any good evidence about what’s actually happening to UK economic growth.	13.0	96.0
201607	2496	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	One potentially detrimental dynamic I see is the effect of lower interest rates and flatter yield curves on bank profits and equity prices and how this could potentially feed into the availability of credit.	13.0	96.0
201607	2497	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Another is that if we do get more economic weakness than we expect, this could lead to a loss in business and consumer confidence, reflecting in part the perception that policymakers may have limited policy options to address that weakness.	13.0	96.0
201607	2498	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s just a vulnerability.	13.0	96.0
201607	2499	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Weakness could beget more weakness because of a view that authorities around the world don’t have much in the way of ability to respond.	13.0	96.0
201607	2500	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And, as many people mentioned, the Brexit vote could also increase political uncertainty not just in the United Kingdom, but elsewhere.	13.0	96.0
201607	2501	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think some of the socioeconomic issues that led to the Brexit vote outcome, such as fears about immigration and job security, are also very relevant elsewhere.	13.0	96.0
201607	2502	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So, in my view, it’s too soon to say whether any of these dynamics will materialize, or, if they do, how consequential that will be.	13.0	96.0
201607	2503	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I certainly agree that the situation since the Brexit vote has evolved in a way better than feared, but at the same time, we can’t forget that the Brexit vote result nevertheless is a negative shock that I think most of us didn’t really expect to be realized.	13.0	96.0
201607	2504	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In the statement language, we sort of imply an answer to the question:  Are the near-term risks lower since the previous meeting?	13.0	96.0
201607	2505	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think that really depends in part on how you weight the domestic economic news since the previous meeting versus the negative news associated with Brexit.	13.0	96.0
201607	2506	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the risks to the outlook have diminished somewhat since the Brexit vote—in other words, the Brexit effect has been less than anticipated—but I’m not sure the risks have really diminished meaningfully since the June FOMC meeting.	13.0	96.0
201607	2507	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to inflation, I think the outlook hasn’t changed much either.	13.0	96.0
201607	2508	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Headline inflation, as anticipated, has climbed a bit this year as some of the earlier energy price declines have fallen out of the calculations.	13.0	96.0
201607	2509	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think core inflation has been broadly stable if we adjust for the seasonal adjustment problems in the core inflation statistics.	13.0	96.0
201607	2510	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And I take some signal from the fact that core inflation has stayed broadly stable over the past year and a half, even as you had this downward pressure that you would have thought would be manifesting itself through the strength of the dollar and lower energy prices.	13.0	96.0
201607	2511	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So my view is, inflation will be fine in terms of moving back toward the 2 percent objective as long as the economic growth that we expect actually materializes.	13.0	96.0
201607	2512	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the inflation expectations issue that I’ve highlighted before in past comments, I think in general I’m a little bit less worried now than I was earlier.	13.0	96.0
201607	2513	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The University of Michigan measure has stabilized, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York three-year-ahead inflation measure has been gradually increasing since January and has actually reversed much of the decline that we saw in the second half of 2015.	13.0	96.0
201607	2514	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the market-based measures of inflation compensation, I continue to think it’s mostly about term premium and the relative liquidity characteristics of nominal versus inflation-protected Treasury securities, so I don’t really take much signal from that.	13.0	96.0
201607	2515	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	What does this all mean for monetary policy?	13.0	96.0
201607	2516	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, I think it argues for a cautious approach at this meeting, and although I can support another increase or two in the federal funds rate this year, I also can imagine that economic growth might be sufficiently soft and the outlook could be sufficiently uncertain that it would make sense to hold off for a while longer.	13.0	96.0
201607	2517	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So while the economy is growing at only about a 2 percent annual rate, what that means is, we’re using up the excess slack in the US labor market only very slowly.	13.0	96.0
201607	2518	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this can be seen, for example, in the trajectory of the unemployment rate this year, which has essentially been sideways.	13.0	96.0
201607	2519	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	With inflation below rather than above our target and monetary policy not far from a neutral setting, I don’t really see the need to rush.	13.0	96.0
201607	2520	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this is also reinforced by what I see as asymmetric risk of raising interest rates too early versus too late.	13.0	96.0
201607	2521	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If the economy turns out to be stronger than expected, necessitating a tighter monetary policy, I don’t think it will be that difficult to catch up, but if the economy turns out to be weaker than expected, our toolkit just isn’t as robust.	13.0	96.0
201607	2522	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Moreover, the fact that that asymmetry is widely known means that economic weakness could have a more negative effect on household and business confidence than usual, potentially reinforcing the downward pressure on economic activity.	13.0	96.0
201607	2523	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, tomorrow—I’m going to foreshadow this—we are going to be essentially debating how much of a forward lean to put into the statement language about September.	13.0	96.0
201607	2524	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s really what tomorrow’s about, or what Thomas is going to get into in a few minutes.	13.0	96.0
201607	2525	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m going to be arguing for only a very slight lean, which I think is embodied in the alternative B language, for two reasons.	13.0	96.0
201607	2526	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	First, we said our monetary policy decisions are data dependent.	13.0	96.0
201607	2527	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think if we strongly foreshadow that we’re going to move in September, it contradicts that.	13.0	96.0
201607	2528	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s just too much time, too much data, and too much uncertainty about where we’ll be in September.	13.0	96.0
201607	2529	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, I think we are losing credibility by foreshadowing future tightening moves and then not following through on them.	13.0	96.0
201607	2530	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think the mistake here is that we haven’t followed through.	13.0	96.0
201607	2531	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there have been good reasons for it.	13.0	96.0
201607	2532	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think, instead, the error has been that we’ve foreshadowed prematurely before we knew we were actually going to move.	13.0	96.0
201607	2533	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If it turns out that we want to move in September, there’s plenty of time between now and then to alter monetary policy expectations.	13.0	96.0
201607	2534	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	What I don’t want to do is alter those expectations prematurely before I or we have a firm grasp on whether we actually want to move in September.	13.0	96.0
201607	2535	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201607	2536	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, and thanks to everybody for an interesting discussion of the outlook and the risks associated with it.	13.0	65.0
201607	2537	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I’d just like to add a couple of brief comments of my own.	13.0	65.0
201607	2538	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	As many of you have already noted, we were confronted with two key uncertainties at the June meeting:  first, the outcome of the Brexit vote and its global consequences and, second, the implications of the remarkably weak May labor market report.	13.0	65.0
201607	2539	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	In the case of Brexit, I admit that I really didn’t expect the “leave” side to prevail, but I was even more surprised by how quickly financial markets recovered from the initial shock.	13.0	65.0
201607	2540	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	As a result, it now seems likely that the decision to exit will have only a minor effect on the US economy in the near term.	13.0	65.0
201607	2541	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	That said, the Brexit decision has highlighted and perhaps exacerbated the vulnerability of European banks.	13.0	65.0
201607	2542	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	The longer-run political and economic consequences of the vote, as many of you have noted, remain murky for both the United Kingdom and Europe, and those may well pose problems for us down the road.	13.0	65.0
201607	2543	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	The recent news on the labor front has been even more reassuring.	13.0	65.0
201607	2544	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	At the time of our June meeting, one couldn’t rule out the possibility that the May report signaled the start of a pronounced slowdown in the labor market.	13.0	65.0
201607	2545	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Since then, however, we’ve learned that payroll gains rebounded sharply in June to 287,000.	13.0	65.0
201607	2546	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, labor force participation rose; involuntary part-time employment more than reversed its May spike; and the broader U-6 measure of labor utilization continued to decline.	13.0	65.0
201607	2547	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	On balance, these and other indicators confirm that labor market conditions remain healthy and that slack has continued to diminish.	13.0	65.0
201607	2548	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, I anticipate that labor utilization is likely to tighten somewhat further in coming months, as overall economic activity appears to be expanding at a moderate pace, with solid growth in consumer outlays compensating for softness in most other categories of spending.	13.0	65.0
201607	2549	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	These developments might seem to suggest that economic conditions, despite some bumps along the way, have ended up about as we anticipated back in late May, when I and several of you said that another increase in the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate in coming months if the labor market continued to improve.	13.0	65.0
201607	2550	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	But I don’t think that’s quite right.	13.0	65.0
201607	2551	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Back in May, the latest three months of labor market data showed average payroll gains of 200,000 per month, which implied that employment was continuing to expand at a fairly rapid clip that would likely lead to appreciably tighter labor market conditions later in the year.	13.0	65.0
201607	2552	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	However, average payroll gains on a three-month basis are now running at less than 150,000 per month, a more subdued, albeit still respectable, pace.	13.0	65.0
201607	2553	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Other indicators also support the view that the pace of labor market improvement, while still proceeding, has slowed somewhat in recent quarters.	13.0	65.0
201607	2554	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	The unemployment rate is essentially unchanged since last fall, as is the share of workers involuntarily working part time.	13.0	65.0
201607	2555	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Initial claims and layoffs have flattened out this year, as have hires and quits in the JOLTS data Finally, business and household surveys of expected labor market conditions either show no improvement or have softened in recent months.	13.0	65.0
201607	2556	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	This slowing is not especially worrisome, as it may simply reflect the lackluster GDP growth seen around the turn of the year.	13.0	65.0
201607	2557	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	If so, then average payroll gains may move back up fairly soon in response to the pickup in economic growth that we’ve seen recently and the further strengthening that the staff projects.	13.0	65.0
201607	2558	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Under those conditions, increasing the federal funds rate in coming months would likely be appropriate to keep resource utilization from tightening too quickly.	13.0	65.0
201607	2559	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	After all, employment growth, as many of you have noted, eventually has to slow by enough to bring it in line with its sustainable longer- run trend.	13.0	65.0
201607	2560	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	But the modest cooling of the labor market that we’ve seen recently could instead turn out to be persistent, perhaps because trend productivity growth has picked up some after several years of exceptional weakness.	13.0	65.0
201607	2561	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And, of course, the pace of employment gains could slow further.	13.0	65.0
201607	2562	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	If so, the case for raising the federal funds rate in the near term strikes me as less compelling.	13.0	65.0
201607	2563	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	For example, suppose that, absent another rate hike, payrolls continue to expand at an average pace of 150,000 per month and the participation rate remains flat.	13.0	65.0
201607	2564	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Then, by the end of the year, the unemployment rate will likely edge down to only 4.8 percent.	13.0	65.0
201607	2565	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Such an outcome would hardly indicate that monetary policy had fallen “behind the curve” as long as inflation is still running well below 2 percent, as the staff projects.	13.0	65.0
201607	2566	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	In contrast, average payroll gains of 200,000 per month over the second half of this year, especially if accompanied by falling labor force participation, would put the unemployment rate on a much steeper downward trajectory, thus necessitating a policy response.	13.0	65.0
201607	2567	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	In contrast to the labor market situation, the outlook for inflation seems to have changed very little since the spring, with the price data coming in about as expected in recent months.	13.0	65.0
201607	2568	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Importantly, the downward pressure from past dollar appreciation on the rate of change of import prices has largely dissipated since the turn of the year, thereby adding a couple of tenths to PCE inflation.	13.0	65.0
201607	2569	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, the disinflationary effects of past declines in oil prices have decreased substantially, although they’re unlikely to disappear completely until early 2017.	13.0	65.0
201607	2570	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Accordingly, it still looks like headline and core inflation will remain close to 1 percent and 1½ percent, respectively, on a 12-month basis through the end of the year.	13.0	65.0
201607	2571	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thereafter, I continue to expect that inflation will move gradually back to 2 percent in the context of a moderately tight labor market.	13.0	65.0
201607	2572	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	In anticipation of tomorrow morning’s policy round, what does all of this imply for our decision at this meeting?	13.0	65.0
201607	2573	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Once again, I think it’s appropriate for us to take a wait-and-see approach with regard to adjusting the funds rate.	13.0	65.0
201607	2574	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	In view of the erratic swings in the recent labor market indicators, I believe that we should collect more data in order to get a better sense of the underlying momentum in the labor market.	13.0	65.0
201607	2575	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	If the next couple of labor market reports show reasonably strong average payroll gains and the overall outlook remains favorable, then raising the target range would likely be appropriate.	13.0	65.0
201607	2576	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	But if the evidence suggests that the labor market really has cooled, then I would be inclined to wait, particularly if the price data continue to come in as expected.	13.0	65.0
201607	2577	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there.	13.0	65.0
201607	2578	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We have dinner tonight, and it’s still early relative to that, so I think we’ve got time for Thomas to give us his monetary policy briefing.	21.0	65.0
201607	2579	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201607	2580	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I’ll be referring to the handout labeled “Material for the Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21.0	999.0
201607	2581	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	As noted in your earlier briefings, US financial conditions appear to have become, on balance, more accommodative during the intermeeting period.	21.0	999.0
201607	2582	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The top-left panel summarizes two mechanisms that could explain some of the recent movement in asset prices.	21.0	999.0
201607	2583	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The first works through market participants’ expectations for US monetary policy—that is, the easing in US financial conditions since the June meeting could reflect market participants’ expectations of a more accommodative path of US monetary policy than previously thought.	21.0	999.0
201607	2584	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	In the wake of the Brexit vote, greater US monetary policy accommodation would provide a more substantial cushion against downside risks coming from abroad and, as a result, boost asset prices in the United States.	21.0	999.0
201607	2585	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The second mechanism focuses on the prospect of greater-than-previously- anticipated monetary policy accommodation abroad.	21.0	999.0
201607	2586	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	That additional accommodation may have had an effect on US financial markets that went well beyond that associated with exchange rates.	21.0	999.0
201607	2587	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	For instance, global investors may have responded to lower yields in Europe by rebalancing their portfolios toward equities and other higher-yielding assets, including dollar-denominated assets.	21.0	999.0
201607	2588	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Of course, the two mechanisms highlighted here are not mutually exclusive.	21.0	999.0
201607	2589	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Indeed, both may have contributed to the easing of US financial conditions since the June meeting.	21.0	999.0
201607	2590	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Nonetheless, their relative importance may matter a great deal for your assessment of the appropriate stance of US monetary policy and, therefore, for your deliberations on the policy statement.	21.0	999.0
201607	2591	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	For instance, to the extent that changes in asset prices since the June meeting primarily reflect expectations of greater monetary policy accommodation in the United States than previously anticipated—the first mechanism—financial conditions could be especially sensitive to your communications.	21.0	999.0
201607	2592	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	That is, the improvement could prove quite ephemeral if your words or actions were to go significantly counter to market expectations, leading asset prices to make an abrupt U-turn.	21.0	999.0
201607	2593	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Accordingly, you might be reluctant to adopt either the first version of paragraph 3 in alternative C—which would greatly surprise the market by announcing an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate—or the second version of that paragraph— which states that the Committee “sees the case for an increase in the federal funds rate as having strengthened since its June meeting.”	21.0	999.0
201607	2594	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Instead, you might decide to maintain a wait-and-see approach that likely would leave market expectations for the policy rate path little changed, as in alternative B, or even adopt the language in alternative A, which notes that “the Committee sees the risks to the US economic outlook as tilted somewhat to the downside.”	21.0	999.0
201607	2595	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Turning to the second possible mechanism, the intermeeting changes in asset prices may primarily reflect portfolio rebalancing and search-for-yield behavior on the part of global investors.	21.0	999.0
201607	2596	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	If so, we may now be importing monetary accommodation.	21.0	999.0
201607	2597	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	For instance, expectations of a longer period of ultralow interest rates and additional QE in Europe post-Brexit may have kept sovereign yields and term premiums low and boosted the prices of stocks and corporate bonds not just in Europe, but also elsewhere, including in the United States.	21.0	999.0
201607	2598	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	As a result, movements in US asset prices since the June meeting may well reflect an easing of financial conditions that is not directly associated with anticipated changes in US monetary policy.	21.0	999.0
201607	2599	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Again, this raises the question of how the Committee might want to respond.	21.0	999.0
201607	2600	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	At this juncture, the staff and most outside forecasters do not appear to anticipate that the change in US financial conditions to date has been sufficient to significantly alter the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation.	21.0	999.0
201607	2601	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Indeed, the Committee might see the easing in financial conditions as a welcome development that—together with the employment report for June—increased its confidence that the economy is likely to remain on track with the Committee’s modal outlook.	21.0	999.0
201607	2602	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Accordingly, the Committee might choose to indicate, as in alternative B, that “near-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished” but leave its policy message otherwise unchanged.	21.0	999.0
201607	2603	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	In contrast, if the Committee viewed the recent easing in financial conditions as adding more stimulus than warranted by the current state of the US economy, the Committee might decide to offset that additional stimulus by adopting or signaling a less accommodative stance of monetary policy, as in alternative C.	21.0	999.0
201607	2604	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	What does the incoming information since the June meeting tell us about the relative importance of the two mechanisms discussed thus far?	21.0	999.0
201607	2605	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The evidence pointing to changes in US monetary policy expectations as the primary mechanism underlying the recent easing of US financial conditions is not all that compelling.	21.0	999.0
201607	2606	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Although respondents to the latest Desk surveys generally have marked down their funds rate expectations for longer projection horizons—a revision that may well have been influenced by the results of the June SEP—the expected federal funds rate path implied by overnight index swap quotes—the solid lines in the upper-right panel—is virtually unchanged, on net, since the June FOMC meeting.	21.0	999.0
201607	2607	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Similarly, the two-year Treasury yield (not shown), which tends to be very sensitive to market views on the funds rate outlook, is little changed.	21.0	999.0
201607	2608	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	And, as shown in the middle-left panel, quotes from federal funds futures options imply that the probability distribution is now more concentrated around “one or none” for the rest of the year, but its center has shifted only slightly to the left.	21.0	999.0
201607	2609	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The remaining charts in my handout summarize information that you may find useful in assessing the relative importance of the second mechanism, the notion that portfolio rebalancing and “reach-for-yield” behavior on the part of global investors may underlie the recent easing of domestic financial conditions  The chart in the lower-left panel shows that downward moves in longer-dated Treasury yields in the roughly two-week period that followed the Brexit vote were largely concentrated at the beginning of the London and Tokyo trading sessions.	21.0	999.0
201607	2610	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	This pattern would seem to suggest that global investors indeed may have been engaging in efforts to rebalance their portfolios toward longer-term US Treasury securities and possibly toward other dollar-denominated assets such as corporate bonds.	21.0	999.0
201607	2611	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Consistent with this view of the relative importance of global factors in explaining recent changes in US Treasury yields, the middle-right panel shows the ratio of two measures of volatility in the Treasury securities market:  volatility of the 10-year Treasury yield during the overnight trading session—which is dominated by trading in Tokyo and London—and volatility during the New York City daytime trading session (which is 8:00 am to 5:00 pm local time).	21.0	999.0
201607	2612	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	It is quite evident that, relative to the daytime session, Treasury market volatility in the overnight session has risen appreciably post-Brexit.	21.0	999.0
201607	2613	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Lastly, as Lorie discussed in her briefing and as shown in the bottom-right panel, respondents to the latest Open Market Desk survey have overwhelmingly pointed to spillovers from low or declining yields abroad as a main factor explaining the recent decline in the five-year, five-year-forward nominal Treasury yield.	21.0	999.0
201607	2614	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Thus far, I have focused on the potential implications of recent financial developments for your deliberations on the draft statements included in your handout.	21.0	999.0
201607	2615	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	More broadly, the draft statements differ importantly in their assessments of other information received over the intermeeting period.	21.0	999.0
201607	2616	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Specifically, alternative B would acknowledge the strong June labor market report and the further increase in labor utilization while leaving the Committee’s modal outlook essentially unchanged.	21.0	999.0
201607	2617	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Compared with the June statement, the key innovation in alternative B is the assessment that near-term risks to the outlook have diminished.	21.0	999.0
201607	2618	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative C offers a more sanguine view of inflation developments than alternative B and notes that the Committee now “sees the near-term risks to the US economic outlook as nearly balanced.”	21.0	999.0
201607	2619	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	In contrast, alternative A projects greater pessimism regarding the inflation outlook.	21.0	999.0
201607	2620	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	It would state that the risks to the US economic outlook are “tilted somewhat to the downside” and would signal that a near-term increase in the target range for the federal funds rate is unlikely.	21.0	999.0
201607	2621	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201607	2622	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	This concludes my prepared remarks.	21.0	999.0
201607	2623	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	21.0	65.0
201607	2624	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Thomas?	22.0	65.0
201607	2625	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes, I have a question for Thomas.	22.0	96.0
201607	2626	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	22.0	65.0
201607	2627	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Couldn’t you interpret the ratio of overnight to trading- hour volatility differently as just an indication of where the information arises in the world that affects people’s outlook of global economic growth and the  market for US Treasury securities?	22.0	96.0
201607	2628	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, couldn’t you get this spike because the Brexit moves occurred over there?	22.0	96.0
201607	2629	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Normally, the volatility is below 1 because most of the news relevant to Treasury securities happens here in US time.	22.0	96.0
201607	2630	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So it might not be anything having to do with global portfolio rebalancing.	22.0	96.0
201607	2631	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It might just be due to where the distribution of the important news falls.	22.0	96.0
201607	2632	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If our news is boring and their news is really interesting, then I would expect that the volatility during overnight sessions would go up relative to the volatility in US sessions.	22.0	96.0
201607	2633	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	That’s right.	22.0	999.0
201607	2634	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	One concern here could well be that because the big event was Brexit and it clearly showed up during overnight hours, that’s what’s driving the result.	22.0	999.0
201607	2635	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes, because it is a one-month rolling volatility, the Brexit event is a tremendous pull.	22.0	96.0
201607	2636	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes, that’s right.	22.0	999.0
201607	2637	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Now, that said, the lower-left panel actually excludes the Brexit date itself.	22.0	999.0
201607	2638	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Those data start only on June 26, so you do see that even after the Brexit event had passed you still have this development.	22.0	999.0
201607	2639	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I find the lower-left one more compelling.	22.0	96.0
201607	2640	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I guess we agree.	22.0	96.0
201607	2641	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	22.0	96.0
201607	2642	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there other questions for Thomas?	22.0	65.0
201607	2643	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	22.0	65.0
201607	2644	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	22.0	65.0
201607	2645	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, why don’t we adjourn for now?	52.0	65.0
201607	2646	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We have a reception and dinner, as usual, across the street, and we will reconvene at 9:00 am tomorrow.	52.0	65.0
201607	2648	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	July 27 Session .	52.0	65.0
201607	2649	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	52.0	65.0
201607	2650	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	52.0	65.0
201607	2651	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s get started.	11.0	65.0
201607	2652	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We have a data release this morning.	11.0	65.0
201607	2653	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me ask David Wilcox if he’d like to comment on that.	11.0	65.0
201607	2654	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t have a detailed readout.	11.0	999.0
201607	2655	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	I did just speak with our sector specialists, and they’re still processing the data.	11.0	999.0
201607	2656	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	It’s clear that the release is weaker than we had anticipated.	11.0	999.0
201607	2657	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	This is the advance report on orders and shipments of durable goods, which feeds into the BEA’s estimate of equipment and intangibles investment.	11.0	999.0
201607	2658	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	This release, probably more than any other, is very opaque to read.	11.0	999.0
201607	2659	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Translating the orders and shipments data into estimates of equipment investment is not straightforward.	11.0	999.0
201607	2660	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	It’s clear, though, that this will take our estimate down into negative territory.	11.0	999.0
201607	2661	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	We’d had real equipment and intangible investment about flat in the second quarter.	11.0	999.0
201607	2662	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	This will take it down by about 1 percentage point.	11.0	999.0
201607	2663	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	That’s probably worth about one-tenth on the growth of GDP in the second quarter—we were at 1.8 in the Tealbook, and we’re probably down at about 1.7 now—and another one-tenth out of the third quarter, give or take.	11.0	999.0
201607	2664	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	So that would put us at about 1.8 in the third quarter.	11.0	999.0
201607	2665	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any questions for David?	12.0	65.0
201607	2666	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	12.0	65.0
201607	2667	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12.0	65.0
201607	2668	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I guess we’re ready to begin our policy round.	23.0	65.0
201607	2669	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We already do have one suggestion on the table for an edit to the statement pertaining to residential investment.	23.0	65.0
201607	2670	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	So let me tee that up, and I will ask you as we go around if you would like to comment on your views about this change.	23.0	65.0
201607	2671	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams—and I did hear some support from others—suggests that in alternative B, we simply delete any reference to residential investment rather than saying that it, along with business fixed investment, has been soft.	23.0	65.0
201607	2672	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	So the sentence would read “Household spending has been growing strongly but business fixed investment has been soft,” and that would be an alternative to the wording that’s currently in alternative B.	23.0	65.0
201607	2673	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	As we go around, I would appreciate it if you would comment briefly on that change.	23.0	65.0
201607	2674	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23.0	65.0
201607	2675	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We’re going to begin our go-round with Governor Tarullo.	23.0	65.0
201607	2676	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201607	2677	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I support alternative B, even though I find some of the language of alternative A to be more compatible with my views.	23.0	97.0
201607	2678	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	The additional sentence in paragraph 2 of alternative B on the diminution of near-term risks is in itself correct, though by not mentioning the admittedly hard-to-quantify medium-term risks to the global economy associated with the Brexit vote result and its aftermath, the sentence perhaps leaves a marginally more upbeat message than might be strictly accurate, at least with respect to international risks.	23.0	97.0
201607	2679	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But I’m willing to accept the sentence as it is.	23.0	97.0
201607	2680	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	The inclusion of this sentence obviously reflects at least some shift in the Committee’s risk assessment and thus some reorientation of its monetary policy stance, but the statement wisely omits any language suggesting some lean of the Committee toward raising rates at an upcoming meeting.	23.0	97.0
201607	2681	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Of course, conditional on my current assessment of economic conditions, I would oppose any such language on substantive grounds, but I think that, no matter what one’s policy view, institutional considerations—namely, the Committee’s credibility—argue against inclusion of any such language.	23.0	97.0
201607	2682	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	We don’t want another instance in which language that raises the prospect of a rate increase in an upcoming meeting is interpreted by markets as perhaps less conditional than it was actually intended by the Committee or its participants.	23.0	97.0
201607	2683	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Market expectations of the path of the federal funds rate and of the likelihood of an increase at specific upcoming meetings have indeed adjusted in response to the ups and downs of recent economic data and developments.	23.0	97.0
201607	2684	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Because a good bit can happen between now and the remainder of this year’s meetings, and on account of the propensity of markets to overread any suggestion by the Committee of an increase at a particular meeting or in a particular time frame, we should let the economic data do more of the talking for us.	23.0	97.0
201607	2685	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Should market expectations vary too substantially in either direction, the Chair, at her discretion and depending on her assessment of where the Committee stands, could use her public speaking opportunities, including but not limited to her Jackson Hole speech, to affect these expectations.	23.0	97.0
201607	2686	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201607	2687	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	2688	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23.0	65.0
201607	2689	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	102.0
201607	2690	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I support alternative C.	23.0	102.0
201607	2691	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The uncertainties that argued for a delay at our June meeting have largely been resolved, with a favorable baseline economic outlook intact.	23.0	102.0
201607	2692	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	A broad range of labor market indicators continue to point to conditions consistent with full employment, while inflation remains on a gradual upward trend toward 2 percent.	23.0	102.0
201607	2693	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Continued delay in raising the funds rate risks putting us “behind the curve” and creates the risk of greater fallout if we have to hike rates quickly to get back on track.	23.0	102.0
201607	2694	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I know it’s popular to describe the glacial pace of policy adjustment as cautious, but, to my eye, this approach is becoming increasingly risky in terms of raising future potential risks to financial stability and the economy.	23.0	102.0
201607	2695	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	This echoes remarks that Presidents Rosengren and Mester made yesterday.	23.0	102.0
201607	2696	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In principle, I would support a rate increase today, but that would be highly confusing and disruptive against the background of our prior communications.	23.0	102.0
201607	2697	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I strongly prefer alternative C with paragraph 3′, which indicates that the case for an increase in the funds rate has strengthened over the intermeeting period.	23.0	102.0
201607	2698	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Short of alternative C, we should at least explicitly acknowledge in alternative B that the case for raising rates has increased and certainly hasn’t diminished.	23.0	102.0
201607	2699	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	This optionality allows for data-dependent adjustments as we go forward, but with the modal federal funds rate path of the June SEP still on the table.	23.0	102.0
201607	2700	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In contrast, alternative B as written will likely be understood as indicating that a September increase is unlikely, thus precluding the possibility of two rate hikes this year.	23.0	102.0
201607	2701	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	This would be viewed as a downward revision to the near-term funds rate path relative to our median and modal June SEP numbers.	23.0	102.0
201607	2702	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	As conditions since June have stayed on track or even improved relative to expectations in some respects, such a shift to lower rates and greater monetary accommodation seems out of tune with our strategy and with our communications up to this point.	23.0	102.0
201607	2703	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have a couple of comments on the statement language, which I found problematic in a number of respects.	23.0	102.0
201607	2704	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	First, in all three alternatives, paragraph 1 refers to the swing in job gains in May and June.	23.0	102.0
201607	2705	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	This specificity about the monthly data releases may strengthen market perceptions that our actions are—in the apt phrasing of Governor Brainard—data point dependent.	23.0	102.0
201607	2706	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Our communications should not foster a fixation on the monthly ups and downs of the data.	23.0	102.0
201607	2707	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I would simply delete the sentence in alternatives B and C that says “job gains were strong in June following weak growth in May.”	23.0	102.0
201607	2708	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Second, as I’ve already talked about and as the Chair mentioned, I would strike the phrase “and residential investment” in paragraph 1.	23.0	102.0
201607	2709	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I just want to remind us that real residential investment jumped at an annual pace of 15 percent in the first quarter.	23.0	102.0
201607	2710	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Although recent indicators suggest some slowing of residential investment, this is only a partial payback for the torrid pace of growth early in the year.	23.0	102.0
201607	2711	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I think it would misrepresent the situation to characterize homebuilding as soft and would be especially misleading to lump residential investment together with business investment, as the latter has been on a notable downtrend for quite some time.	23.0	102.0
201607	2712	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23.0	102.0
201607	2713	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23.0	65.0
201607	2714	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I’d just ask a question—perhaps of Thomas—because we hadn’t had any discussion about omitting the phrase about residential investment.	23.0	91.0
201607	2715	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Last time, it was referred to.	23.0	91.0
201607	2716	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	If you take it out, is there any mention of residential investment?	23.0	91.0
201607	2717	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	How do market watchers generally respond to some complete omission?	23.0	91.0
201607	2718	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Is it going to get more prominence or less prominence?	23.0	91.0
201607	2719	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	You’re also taking out the reference to trade.	23.0	96.0
201607	2720	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, the reference to net exports is going, too.	23.0	65.0
201607	2721	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	23.0	91.0
201607	2722	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Could I just ask the staff their opinion on this?	23.0	91.0
201607	2723	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes.	23.0	999.0
201607	2724	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	To be upfront, I have a very hard time making good guesses about how market watchers might respond to changes.	23.0	999.0
201607	2725	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I understand that.	23.0	91.0
201607	2726	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	That’s okay.	23.0	91.0
201607	2727	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	But, that said, one interpretation is that there’s no news.	23.0	999.0
201607	2728	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	That is certainly what we intended with the striking of the reference to net exports, because there was really nothing new to report.	23.0	999.0
201607	2729	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Now, I have to confess that I don’t know exactly when the reference to residential investment was added to the statement.	23.0	999.0
201607	2730	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I would have to look that up.	23.0	999.0
201607	2731	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	It’s certainly been in there for a number of rounds, but it hasn’t always been there.	23.0	999.0
201607	2732	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I would think that it will be noticed as a downgrade, because if you no longer say that it’s improving, it seems to imply it’s doing less, and that would be consistent with the recent data flow.	23.0	999.0
201607	2733	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	So my guess would be that it would be interpreted as a soft downgrading.	23.0	999.0
201607	2734	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	23.0	91.0
201607	2735	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	23.0	91.0
201607	2736	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23.0	65.0
201607	2737	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	81.0
201607	2738	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In my mind, the most useful benchmarks for evaluating the stance of monetary policy are the policy rules that seem to capture the way we’ve behaved in past periods during which we were relatively successful.	23.0	81.0
201607	2739	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	One can argue about the details of particular rules, but just about every one that makes it to our desk has the policy rate deviating from normal in response to an inflation gap and some measure of a real-activity gap.	23.0	81.0
201607	2740	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Because these gaps are small now, we should be returning our policy rate to more normal settings, with an adjustment for the possibility, of course, of a lower natural real rate.	23.0	81.0
201607	2741	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Tealbook B puts the prescribed policy rate for either Taylor rule at about 2.4 percent, and that’s 200 basis points away from our current policy setting.	23.0	81.0
201607	2742	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	A departure from our benchmark of that magnitude is fairly large.	23.0	81.0
201607	2743	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	One might argue that the natural real rate is lower than the 1 percent value assumed by the Tealbook staff.	23.0	81.0
201607	2744	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	For example, the current estimate using the Laubach-Williams procedure is around zero, and the Lubik-Matthes estimates are very similar.	23.0	81.0
201607	2745	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Even in this case, though, the prescribed policy rate would be 1½ percent, more than 100 basis points higher than the current rate, and I think that’s still a large gap by historical standards.	23.0	81.0
201607	2746	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We’ve occasionally been 100 basis points away from the Taylor rule in the past, but never for a sustained stretch.	23.0	81.0
201607	2747	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	On top of that, it’s worth pointing out something about the Laubach-Williams procedure.	23.0	81.0
201607	2748	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Their procedure produces a joint estimate of the natural real rate and the output gap, the two latent variables in their set-up.	23.0	81.0
201607	2749	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Their current estimate of the output gap is large and positive, about 140 basis points.	23.0	81.0
201607	2750	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	The natural, internally consistent way is to apply both their natural real rate and their output gap estimates at the same time, and the net effect of doing that results in a Taylor rule policy prescription of 2¼ or 3 percent, depending on whether you use Taylor (1993) or Taylor (1999).	23.0	81.0
201607	2751	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	This again implies that the funds rate is now very far below where it should be by those prescriptions.	23.0	81.0
201607	2752	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Some would say that the real-activity gap might still be negative, as opposed to the staff’s calculation of an essentially zero output gap.	23.0	81.0
201607	2753	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	This would imply a lower Taylor rule prescription.	23.0	81.0
201607	2754	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	For example, a natural unemployment rate of 4 percent or lower would justify the current policy rate.	23.0	81.0
201607	2755	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Now, 4 percent is well below all of our estimates of the natural rate, but those estimates, of course, are notoriously imprecise.	23.0	81.0
201607	2756	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So I can understand the motivation for delaying an increase in rates.	23.0	81.0
201607	2757	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We’d all like to see more employment opportunities for as many Americans as possible.	23.0	81.0
201607	2758	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But theory and experience tell us that there are risks on both sides.	23.0	81.0
201607	2759	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Waiting too long to raise rates can leave us with a higher unemployment rate later on as we fight against an increase in inflation.	23.0	81.0
201607	2760	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	There’s an argument that we’re perfectly capable of responding effectively if inflation should surge, but our ability to do so depends on inflation expectations remaining anchored or, if they start to drift, on our ability to manage and contain them.	23.0	81.0
201607	2761	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	At present, our understanding of the formation and evolution of expectations is fairly limited.	23.0	81.0
201607	2762	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	They may seem anchored now, but they’ve been quite variable at times in the past, and I don’t think we have much of an analytical basis for predicting how or when they might become unanchored.	23.0	81.0
201607	2763	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But I think we do know that unstable expectations in the past have been associated with departures from good benchmark policy rules.	23.0	81.0
201607	2764	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	If expectations become unanchored, then it would surely reflect beliefs that we are departing from those past patterns of behavior.	23.0	81.0
201607	2765	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And, surely, if expectations are anchored, it reflects a sense that we’re going to continue in a way that’s relatively consistent with those past patterns of behavior.	23.0	81.0
201607	2766	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I think it should be evident that the further we deviate from those benchmarks, the greater the risk that inflation and inflation expectations break away.	23.0	81.0
201607	2767	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So I think that there are serious risks associated with probing, as the phrase is, to see if the natural rate of unemployment might be below where we are right now.	23.0	81.0
201607	2768	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We’ve delayed raising rates this year in part because of events that have caused uncertainty arise.	23.0	81.0
201607	2769	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	When uncertainty subsides, as it clearly has now, we should seize the moment and get on with it rather than continue to fall further behind our benchmarks.	23.0	81.0
201607	2770	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I think now is one of those times, a time for opportunistic normalization.	23.0	81.0
201607	2771	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So I support alternative C and paragraph 3.	23.0	81.0
201607	2772	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	2773	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	23.0	65.0
201607	2774	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201607	2775	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B for this meeting, although I could have also been supportive of some of the stronger language in alternative C.	23.0	90.0
201607	2776	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	My preference for this meeting is for a statement tilting more strongly toward indicating an increase in the federal funds rate at the next meeting.	23.0	90.0
201607	2777	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I view the statement as leaving open the possibility of an increase in September, but I think it is unlikely to raise the market probability of a September increase as much as I view is warranted.	23.0	90.0
201607	2778	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I am not arguing for calendar-dependent promises in the statement.	23.0	90.0
201607	2779	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The volatility in payroll employment over the past two months, as well as the surprise Brexit vote, highlights risks in such a strategy.	23.0	90.0
201607	2780	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	But the relatively modest changes in the statement outside of the first paragraph are likely to leave many outside of this room expecting no change in September.	23.0	90.0
201607	2781	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If incoming data are consistent with my forecast, which I see as requiring a rate increase in September, we may need to use speeches and other opportunities to communicate to the public the increased probability of a September move.	23.0	90.0
201607	2782	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Stepping aside from the near-term tactical decisions, I think it’s important to reframe how we have been thinking about policy normalization.	23.0	90.0
201607	2783	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because we have been extremely and justifiably patient to date in ensuring the economy gets very near our dual-mandate goals before raising the funds rate, we should not view our decisions as balancing on a knife’s edge between action and inaction.	23.0	90.0
201607	2784	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	At this point, I believe that we should change from a default of no action unless everything is perfect in the next six-week period to a default of a plan to take action unless circumstances significantly alter our outlook.	23.0	90.0
201607	2785	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	That is, my preference would be that unless incoming data and events suggest a material change to the forecast, we should tighten in September.	23.0	90.0
201607	2786	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	My estimate of the natural rate is 4.7 percent.	23.0	90.0
201607	2787	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	As a result, I believe that a baseline forecast that results in a 4.3 percent unemployment rate implies that we will need to tighten more rapidly.	23.0	90.0
201607	2788	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we receive evidence that suggests that the natural rate is in the low 4s, we can slow down the rate of increase in the funds rate increase later on in the normalization process.	23.0	90.0
201607	2789	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Further, there remain some upside risks relative to our baseline outlook, and were those risks to materialize, we would, of course, need to tighten even more quickly.	23.0	90.0
201607	2790	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	But such rapid rate adjustments run an even greater risk of jeopardizing the attainment of full employment.	23.0	90.0
201607	2791	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Finally, uncertainty regarding the estimate of the equilibrium interest rate further bolsters the argument for gradual tightening, as a gradual increase affords us the time to gauge whether we have gone too far or not far enough.	23.0	90.0
201607	2792	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	For all of these reasons, I am concerned that we may be waiting too long to remove accommodation, with a consequence of having to raise rates more rapidly later in the normalization process, placing the attainment of full employment and price stability at greater risk than is warranted.	23.0	90.0
201607	2793	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	And I would remove the reference to residential investment.	23.0	90.0
201607	2794	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	2795	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23.0	65.0
201607	2796	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201607	2797	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	In making my decision as to which of the three alternatives to support, I found the material on pages 30 to 35 of Tealbook B very useful.	23.0	108.0
201607	2798	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	That’s the material that makes the case for supporting each of the potential decisions.	23.0	108.0
201607	2799	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	On the basis of the arguments set out in those pages and other evidence and considerations—including the comments I made at our previous meeting, which was only six weeks ago—I support alternative B.	23.0	108.0
201607	2800	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Alternative B makes a case for leaving the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting and avoiding “signaling the timing of the next policy move.”	23.0	108.0
201607	2801	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I would, nonetheless, like to comment on some of the statements made in “The Case for Alternative B” on pages 30 and 31 of Tealbook B and to say that there’s a difference between signaling the precise timing and signaling an approximate timing or signaling that the next policy move has come closer.	23.0	108.0
201607	2802	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	All right.	23.0	108.0
201607	2803	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Here are my comments on the arguments in Tealbook B.	23.0	108.0
201607	2804	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	There are two statements in the Economic Outlook section on page 30 of Tealbook B.	23.0	108.0
201607	2805	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	One says “Policymakers may view the information they have received about the labor market and real activity as consistent, on balance, with their modal forecasts at the time of the June FOMC meeting.”	23.0	108.0
201607	2806	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And the second says “Policymakers may judge that near-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished.”	23.0	108.0
201607	2807	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I disagree with the first statement.	23.0	108.0
201607	2808	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I believe the data we received on June payrolls and the effects of Brexit are better than my forecasts in June would have been had I made one.	23.0	108.0
201607	2809	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I do believe that near-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished.	23.0	108.0
201607	2810	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	With regard to longer- term risks, I believe that the Brexit decision will result in more uncertainty about political and economic developments in the United Kingdom—or at least in what is now the United Kingdom—and the European Union, but that this will have relatively little effect on the United States unless it leads to major changes in the structure of the EU.	23.0	108.0
201607	2811	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	The analysis of the labor market in this section of Tealbook B says that “a range of labor market indicators points to increasing utilization; however, the unemployment rate, at 4.9 percent in June, is unchanged, on net, since the beginning of the year.”	23.0	108.0
201607	2812	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	When the unemployment rate was well above 5 percent, we began to say that to raise the interest rate, we’d need to see continuing improvements in the labor market and an increase in inflation.	23.0	108.0
201607	2813	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I believe we’ve seen improvements in the labor market in recent months, particularly including in increases in the participation rate.	23.0	108.0
201607	2814	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	But, at some point, we’ll have to say that maintenance of strong conditions in the labor market is the situation we want to sustain.	23.0	108.0
201607	2815	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And I believe that an unemployment rate of 4.9 percent is near enough to most people’s measure of full employment to say that we’re close to having a strong conditions in the labor market, although no doubt we would all be happy to discover that a lower unemployment rate, somewhere around 4.5 percent, is consistent with maximum employment, stable prices, and the maintenance of strong conditions in the labor market.	23.0	108.0
201607	2816	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	My next comment is that we need at some point to take a closer look at what behavior we demand of the inflation rate.	23.0	108.0
201607	2817	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Over the past year, we have allowed ourselves to imply that inflation is too low if it is less than 2 percent, without recognizing that there’s a difference between an inflation rate of 1.6 percent and one of 1.2 percent.	23.0	108.0
201607	2818	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We have accepted that we’ll treat divergences from the inflation target symmetrically.	23.0	108.0
201607	2819	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Is there anyone here who will fight to reduce the inflation rate from 2.2 percent to 2 percent when we reach 2.2 percent?	23.0	108.0
201607	2820	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Next, the Policy Strategy section states that “the rebound in job gains represents only one month of data.	23.0	108.0
201607	2821	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	By the time of the September FOMC meeting, policymakers will have seen two more employment reports and may have a better sense of the underlying trend in employment growth.”	23.0	108.0
201607	2822	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I agree with that.	23.0	108.0
201607	2823	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	But I believe that September should not be ruled out as being too soon to raise the rate if the incoming data are very positive, and I do not think we’re far from making such a decision.	23.0	108.0
201607	2824	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	The final argument in “The Case for Alternative B” in Tealbook B is that “a decision to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would be in line with the expectations of financial market participants.”	23.0	108.0
201607	2825	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	In our discussions, we should recognize that what financial market participants believe is heavily influenced by what we say, and that nothing we have said of late would cause them to think that the decision will be anything other than to keep the interest rate unchanged.	23.0	108.0
201607	2826	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And we know that if we were to send a different signal about future interest rates than that implied by alternative B, financial market participants would have different expectations.	23.0	108.0
201607	2827	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So I find some conflict, to some extent, between what is said at the beginning in this discussion about how we think that the data we’ve received is better and the fact that we take comfort that the markets agree with us.	23.0	108.0
201607	2828	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	The markets should have raised their expectations a little bit, and they haven’t because we’re sending a very clear message, one that I think is too strong.	23.0	108.0
201607	2829	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Let me conclude.	23.0	108.0
201607	2830	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’re close to our full employment objective.	23.0	108.0
201607	2831	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	The underlying pace of inflation is not far from 2 percent, and our best guess at the value of the equilibrium real federal funds rate is near but above zero, and we’re below it.	23.0	108.0
201607	2832	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Now, depending on the data, it could be appropriate to take another cautious policy step in September.	23.0	108.0
201607	2833	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Aside from the last word of the statement, which in June was “July” and has now become “September,” this is what I said and believed six weeks ago.	23.0	108.0
201607	2834	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And I hope that one of these months, one of these six-week periods, what I hope and believe will happen in the next meeting will happen.	23.0	108.0
201607	2835	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	23.0	108.0
201607	2836	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	2837	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23.0	65.0
201607	2838	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201607	2839	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I do not think the normalization process is going well.	23.0	94.0
201607	2840	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	We ended QE in the fall of 2014.	23.0	94.0
201607	2841	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	We said we would begin normalizing rates in 2015.	23.0	94.0
201607	2842	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	We made only one move that year, at the last meeting of the year.	23.0	94.0
201607	2843	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	We have made no further moves during 2016.	23.0	94.0
201607	2844	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is against a backdrop of an economy that has not behaved very differently from forecasts of a few years ago, especially on inflation and unemployment.	23.0	94.0
201607	2845	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Unemployment has tended to surprise to the downside for us, and inflation has actually been very consistent with the forecast that it would remain below 2 percent.	23.0	94.0
201607	2846	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is in contrast to our narrative for normalization embodied in the Tealbook and in the Summary of Economic Projections.	23.0	94.0
201607	2847	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	As I discussed yesterday, the Tealbook narrative suggests that we are on the precipice of a 200-plus basis point increase in the policy rate over the forecast horizon.	23.0	94.0
201607	2848	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is a little less than once per quarter.	23.0	94.0
201607	2849	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This comes from using the updated Taylor (1999) rule, which also informs many others and has historically informed many judgments among the Committee about the pace of rate increases.	23.0	94.0
201607	2850	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	According to the Tealbook, these increases are going to take place against a backdrop of relatively weak economic growth in the near term, an unemployment rate that is just three-tenths lower at the end of 2017 than it is today, and an inflation rate that remains below target.	23.0	94.0
201607	2851	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I do not think that this is a realistic narrative.	23.0	94.0
201607	2852	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think it forces us to draw on increasingly tenuous excuses as to why we are not following through on our announced plans.	23.0	94.0
201607	2853	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is hurting our credibility.	23.0	94.0
201607	2854	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Markets discounted this narrative long ago, and our actions this year are ratifying their expectations.	23.0	94.0
201607	2855	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The St Louis Fed’s new narrative improves on this situation.	23.0	94.0
201607	2856	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	It suggests a relatively flat policy rate path with some upside risk, depending on how the data evolve.	23.0	94.0
201607	2857	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	It does not leave a 200-plus basis point policy move lingering over the market.	23.0	94.0
201607	2858	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	It suggests that r† is minus 140 basis points, which is the ex post real return on one-year Treasury securities over the past three years.	23.0	94.0
201607	2859	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Real returns on short-term government debt are unlikely to switch to higher values any time soon, nor is mean reversion a good prediction.	23.0	94.0
201607	2860	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The best guess is that this situation will simply persist, at least over a period of two to two-and-a-half years.	23.0	94.0
201607	2861	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The St Louis Federal Reserve narrative realistically suggests that the current slow-growth environment is likely to continue.	23.0	94.0
201607	2862	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	It suggests that the labor market is essentially at full employment and perhaps will not improve further, in a situation of relatively slow growth.	23.0	94.0
201607	2863	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	It also suggests that inflation does not look set to increase very far above our 2 percent target.	23.0	94.0
201607	2864	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The conclusion is that a relatively low policy rate is consistent with achieving our inflation target and full employment over the next two and a half years.	23.0	94.0
201607	2865	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Adoption of the St Louis approach would, in my view, improve the alignment of market expectations with the likely future path of policy.	23.0	94.0
201607	2866	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	For today, I support alternative B.	23.0	94.0
201607	2867	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The Federal Reserve Bank of St.	23.0	94.0
201607	2868	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Louis approach does call for one more rate increase, and I would be happy to make this move at the September meeting, provided the data cooperate.	23.0	94.0
201607	2869	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I do prefer to move on good news about the economy.	23.0	94.0
201607	2870	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I would also support President Williams’s suggestion on residential investment.	23.0	94.0
201607	2871	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201607	2872	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	2873	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	23.0	65.0
201607	2874	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair. in light of my fairly upbeat outlook for the economy and the slow but persistent march of inflation to target, the language in alternative B seems a bit too equivocal even after the most recent changes.	23.0	999.0
201607	2875	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	The two matters we talked about yesterday, the two most pressing concerns at our June meeting, have dissolved.	23.0	999.0
201607	2876	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	In June, 287,000 net new jobs were added, and financial markets were generally unfazed by the Brexit vote after the initial shock wore off.	23.0	999.0
201607	2877	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	I welcome the recent change to paragraph 2 stating that the “near-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished.”	23.0	999.0
201607	2878	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	That said, the message in alternative B is only modestly changed from June, and I fear that the reaction will be similar, taking the next meeting off the table.	23.0	999.0
201607	2879	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	It could also very well indicate that our policy is insufficiently sensitive to events on the upside.	23.0	999.0
201607	2880	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	That insensitivity may, in turn, serve to confuse markets on exactly what types of data will be sufficient for normalization to proceed.	23.0	999.0
201607	2881	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	If we are delaying normalization because we need much greater evidence that inflation is indeed trending upward, then perhaps we should make that point more explicitly.	23.0	999.0
201607	2882	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Or if uncertainty over the level of the natural real rate leads to the belief that policy is not overly accommodative, that point should be articulated.	23.0	999.0
201607	2883	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	But whatever is driving the unresponsiveness of policy needs to be stated clearly.	23.0	999.0
201607	2884	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Communicating a very similar message either in the statement or in public comments under what I perceive to be clearly improved economic circumstances does not seem to represent a strategy that will allow a September rate increase to be a realistic option.	23.0	999.0
201607	2885	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	So what can we do?	23.0	999.0
201607	2886	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	While I can live with alternative B as is today, one possible improvement is to add language, like that in alternative C, stating that the near-term risks to the economy are nearly balanced or have become more balanced, instead of saying that they have diminished.	23.0	999.0
201607	2887	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	This more positive tone in the language would send a clearer signal that September is a possibility without overpromising that a move would indeed occur.	23.0	999.0
201607	2888	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	And on residential investment, I also support President Williams’s view.	23.0	999.0
201607	2889	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201607	2890	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	2891	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	23.0	65.0
201607	2892	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201607	2893	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I support alternative B with both proposed amendments by President Williams.	23.0	110.0
201607	2894	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	That includes the one on job gains in June versus May for the reasons he articulated.	23.0	110.0
201607	2895	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So I support both of those edits.	23.0	110.0
201607	2896	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I do think the case for removing some amount of accommodation has strengthened since June.	23.0	110.0
201607	2897	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	First, on the pro side, I believe we are making progress in achieving our dual-mandate objectives.	23.0	110.0
201607	2898	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In particular, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas trimmed mean as well as other, similar measures of core inflation are gradually moving in a direction that suggests we will reach our inflation target in the medium term.	23.0	110.0
201607	2899	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I think labor market slack is declining and we are moving toward full employment, and I hope that upcoming data will give us an opportunity to confirm this.	23.0	110.0
201607	2900	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Second, I believe excesses are building, although not to the point at which I’m alarmed.	23.0	110.0
201607	2901	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	As has been discussed, I am concerned about commercial real estate.	23.0	110.0
201607	2902	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m also—I must say, maybe colored by my background—concerned about what I see in stock market valuation.	23.0	110.0
201607	2903	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	By my measure—and I’m using a per-share number of $115— market P/E is getting close to 19 times earnings in a period when corporate earnings are actually declining.	23.0	110.0
201607	2904	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m concerned about where the markets are going to go from here.	23.0	110.0
201607	2905	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	My experience is, when stock market valuations become excessive, there may be imbalances building up outside the banking system, particularly in the nonbank financial markets, some of which we, at the Federal Reserve, are not able to see.	23.0	110.0
201607	2906	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m slightly concerned about the buildup in nonbank financial debt—that is, on the corporate side—although I think that’s still manageable.	23.0	110.0
201607	2907	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And I do worry about distortions in asset allocation—disincentives for savers as the population ages and people tend to live off their incomes—and I’m worried overall about a rise in risk-taking, particularly as we move from here.	23.0	110.0
201607	2908	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In terms of the cons, I do believe the market is certainly unprepared today for us to raise rates, as we know, and they seem to be not quite prepared for September, either.	23.0	110.0
201607	2909	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I do think the uncertainties of Brexit as well as China—which, to me, is a significant risk—are unlikely to be resolved any time soon.	23.0	110.0
201607	2910	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Between now and September, though, we’ll get a little bit better clarity on the Italian bank situation, which I do think is worth watching.	23.0	110.0
201607	2911	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And, obviously, we’ll get two additional job reports, which will help in confirming the trend on the labor markets.	23.0	110.0
201607	2912	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We’ll also get a chance to more clearly see if the recent strength in new home sales translates into a pickup in permits for single-family homes.	23.0	110.0
201607	2913	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m also persuaded by our work and the comments made here regarding the neutral rate that it is lower than widely recognized.	23.0	110.0
201607	2914	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I agree with President Harker that we have not clearly communicated this.	23.0	110.0
201607	2915	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I do think that we are not as accommodative as is widely believed, and, on the margin, that reduces the urgency for us to move or, to say it another way, allows us to be patient.	23.0	110.0
201607	2916	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But in light of all of this, as I said, I favor alternative B as amended, although I am forward leaning in us gradually and patiently moving toward removal of accommodation.	23.0	110.0
201607	2917	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	As we approach our September meeting, I would hope that if incoming data warrant, FOMC communication, potentially from the Chair at Jackson Hole or some other venues, will, as has been suggested, begin to signal to the market that we believe removal of some accommodation is warranted in the near future.	23.0	110.0
201607	2918	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201607	2919	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	2920	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23.0	65.0
201607	2921	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201607	2922	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I have no objection to the change in language with regard to housing.	23.0	91.0
201607	2923	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I would think it would be better to come up with a characterization of what it is rather than just deleting it entirely.	23.0	91.0
201607	2924	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I think what happens in this case is that people probably think, “Oh, they mentioned housing last time.	23.0	91.0
201607	2925	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Let me go see what the latest data were.	23.0	91.0
201607	2926	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I can’t remember.”	23.0	91.0
201607	2927	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	And if they see that the data were kind of soft, they’re going to have to come up with their own interpretation.	23.0	91.0
201607	2928	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	But I don’t have any objection to omitting it.	23.0	91.0
201607	2929	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	On the basis of my outlook and my expectations for continued data confirmations, I support alternative B as written.	23.0	91.0
201607	2930	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	As I mentioned yesterday, my economic growth outlook has not changed materially since June, though I do think the downside risks have diminished some.	23.0	91.0
201607	2931	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I’ve also made no changes to my inflation outlook or my readings of the downside risks to it.	23.0	91.0
201607	2932	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I think alternative B captures these sentiments for me.	23.0	91.0
201607	2933	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Clearly, more of the focus today is on what we’re going to be doing in September and beyond.	23.0	91.0
201607	2934	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	If there were no material changes to my baseline forecast or risk assessments, then I could see the case for a rate increase in September.	23.0	91.0
201607	2935	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	It’s not my preferred course, and it would be a close call.	23.0	91.0
201607	2936	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	However, I would not support a September move if our communications led markets to think that a second increase in December was highly likely in the absence of very strong data.	23.0	91.0
201607	2937	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I think it’s important that we allow adequate time to assess the economic reactions to our next policy move before taking the next step after that.	23.0	91.0
201607	2938	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Maybe conditions would improve enough to justify another move in December, but my base case is, they will not.	23.0	91.0
201607	2939	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Either way, in my opinion, there’s just too much uncertainty to precondition markets to expect an end-of-year funds rate target in the range of 75 to 100 basis points.	23.0	91.0
201607	2940	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	As I mentioned last round, I continue to be attracted to the forward-guidance language in alternative A.	23.0	91.0
201607	2941	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	It says “The Committee judges that an increase in the target range will not be warranted until the risks to the outlook are more closely balanced and inflation moves closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis.”	23.0	91.0
201607	2942	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Frankly, I would wait until core PCE is 2 percent and projected to be at least 2 percent over the forecast horizon.	23.0	91.0
201607	2943	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	This is a strong commitment to our symmetric 2 percent inflation target, one that would likely provide much needed support to private inflation expectations.	23.0	91.0
201607	2944	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Our inflation projections would benefit more from an increase in inflation expectations than from a lower unemployment rate.	23.0	91.0
201607	2945	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I disagree with President Lacker on this issue, because I think the evidence favors viewing inflation expectations as moving lower than our inflation objective and not the case that he was worried about in terms of them being unstable on the upside.	23.0	91.0
201607	2946	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Regarding Governor Fischer’s question as to whether Committee members would fight inflation of 2.2 percent if it was above 2 percent, I actually have no evidence on that.	23.0	91.0
201607	2947	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	After seven years, I have no data points to answer that, because we haven’t had inflation above 2 percent.	23.0	91.0
201607	2948	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	In the spirit of something a bit more like alternative A, I would feel much more comfortable increasing rates in September if by then core inflation appeared clearly positioned to come in higher than my 2016 forecast, which, like the Tealbook’s, is 1.6 percent.	23.0	91.0
201607	2949	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	President Williams suggested yesterday that recent core inflation has been 2 percent, and others have made sympathetic comments about that as well.	23.0	91.0
201607	2950	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I hope that continues in the coming months and years even if the most recent monthly averages are like that.	23.0	91.0
201607	2951	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Finally, policy asymmetries continue to argue for our communication that a very shallow expected path for normalization is appropriate, as our SEP submissions display.	23.0	91.0
201607	2952	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	We’re still only a modest negative shock away from returning to the effective lower bound, while, on the other side, if an inflation shock occurs, the inflation process is inertial enough that we most likely can avoid any meaningful overshooting of 2 percent with modest increases in rates and the low r* we expect into the indefinite future, at least according to the most recent Laubach-Williams update that I saw.	23.0	91.0
201607	2953	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Also, as I discussed yesterday following the QS report, I see the apparent changes in long-duration investor attitudes as diminishing potential financial instability concerns that might be associated with a modestly steeper tightening than our recent SEP displays.	23.0	91.0
201607	2954	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	If real-money investors have come to believe that low equilibrium interest rates are a fixture of this economy, then we face a lower chance of experiencing a taper tantrum–like fillip in financial conditions if we have to pull policy normalization forward in time.	23.0	91.0
201607	2955	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	In sum, I remain on the fence about a move in September, but whatever we do then, I think we should continue to communicate our basic policy strategy for slow, gradual rate increases dependent on the Committee’s confidence in achieving its dual-mandate goals in as timely a fashion as possible.	23.0	91.0
201607	2956	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201607	2957	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	2958	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	23.0	65.0
201607	2959	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	111.0
201607	2960	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	As a Committee, we continue to debate whether we are approaching a point when further rate increases are appropriate.	23.0	111.0
201607	2961	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Because we can’t perfectly foresee the future path of the economy, as many others have said, I’m in favor of taking a risk-management approach and avoiding policy choices that could lead to especially poor outcomes.	23.0	111.0
201607	2962	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	In my view, the costs associated with a monetary policy stance that, after the fact, turns out to be too tight are likely much larger than the costs of a stance that, after the fact, turns out to have been too loose.	23.0	111.0
201607	2963	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Many others have made these comments as well.	23.0	111.0
201607	2964	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Regarding the alternatives presented, I support alternative B, but I don’t have a strong view on President Williams’s changes.	23.0	111.0
201607	2965	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I’m okay with those changes either way, but I personally am not in favor of the language that was added to paragraph 2.	23.0	111.0
201607	2966	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I understand the distinction between near-term risks and medium-term risks, but I think it’s a little bit too subtle.	23.0	111.0
201607	2967	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	It isn’t clear to me that the risks to the economic outlook have diminished.	23.0	111.0
201607	2968	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And, maybe more important, I don’t think the phrase is actually necessary to preserving optionality for September.	23.0	111.0
201607	2969	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I think the statement as written preserves that optionality.	23.0	111.0
201607	2970	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We always say that every meeting is a live meeting.	23.0	111.0
201607	2971	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So why do we therefore have to signal that we really mean the next meeting is “live,” if we always say that every meeting is a “live” meeting?	23.0	111.0
201607	2972	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	In filling out the June SEP, I indicated one increase in the federal funds rate for 2016 because I expected that, and I hope now that tightening labor markets will continue to push inflation toward our 2 percent target.	23.0	111.0
201607	2973	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I haven’t seen the evidence of that yet.	23.0	111.0
201607	2974	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I know that in recent months, there’s been a little bit of an uptick, but on a year-over-year basis, there’s not any real evidence of it.	23.0	111.0
201607	2975	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So, for me, I need to see real evidence that we’re moving toward 2 percent before I can support a rate increase.	23.0	111.0
201607	2976	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	23.0	111.0
201607	2977	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23.0	65.0
201607	2978	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201607	2979	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I support alternative B.	23.0	88.0
201607	2980	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I came to the meeting comfortable with the statement as written, but I have no objection to removing the reference to residential investment.	23.0	88.0
201607	2981	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I don’t think it will generate excessive attention even if it is, as Thomas said, a soft downgrade.	23.0	88.0
201607	2982	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	For this meeting, I believe it’s prudent to exercise patience and let the post-Brexit economic picture, as well as the array of risks and uncertainties regarding the outlook, congeal.	23.0	88.0
201607	2983	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I don’t think the Committee risks getting “behind the curve” by exercising patience at this meeting.	23.0	88.0
201607	2984	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I think it’s appropriate to keep all options open for the September meeting.	23.0	88.0
201607	2985	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I can foresee conditions that would be a reasonable basis for a discussion of a rate move at that meeting.	23.0	88.0
201607	2986	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In broad strokes, here is a configuration of the incoming data that would make me pretty comfortable that the economy is on a track justifying serious consideration of a rate move.	23.0	88.0
201607	2987	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	First, second-quarter growth above 2 percent confirmed in official releases.	23.0	88.0
201607	2988	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We’ll get the first estimate Friday and the second estimate on August 26.	23.0	88.0
201607	2989	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We’ll also have most of the data releases having direct implications for revision in the third GDP estimate before the September meeting.	23.0	88.0
201607	2990	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Second, apparent third-quarter growth consistent with that of the second quarter.	23.0	88.0
201607	2991	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We’ll have almost all third-quarter GDP source data for July before the September meeting, but not much source data for August.	23.0	88.0
201607	2992	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	But we will have auto sales for August and, most important, retail sales for August.	23.0	88.0
201607	2993	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Third, two more positive employment reports centered on payroll jobs gains comfortably above the breakeven number needed to cover labor force growth.	23.0	88.0
201607	2994	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	As a marker, I’m thinking of 150,000 per month as being comfortably above that breakeven point.	23.0	88.0
201607	2995	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Finally, continuing indications that inflation is firming and moving in the right direction.	23.0	88.0
201607	2996	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	If a scenario consistent with these conditions plays out through mid-September, as I said, I think the Committee should give a rate increase serious consideration.	23.0	88.0
201607	2997	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201607	2998	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	2999	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23.0	65.0
201607	3000	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	103.0
201607	3001	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	I think Governor Tarullo’s comments yesterday about challenging our views and assumptions and being open to changing one’s mind is an important aspect of the job we do here.	23.0	103.0
201607	3002	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	And, because I have found my own views outside the consensus of the Committee from time to time, that kind of self-examination may come more naturally for me.	23.0	103.0
201607	3003	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	But I agree with him that it is an essential aspect of arriving at sound policy prescriptions.	23.0	103.0
201607	3004	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	In fact, I think it’s an obligation to the effective decisionmaking function of this Committee, to the economic well-being of the public we serve, and with the assurance that history will judge best whether our calibrations indeed achieve their aim.	23.0	103.0
201607	3005	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	So, with that in mind, I take a good dose of humility before these meetings, and, in that spirit, I’ll turn to my view on today’s policy choices.	23.0	103.0
201607	3006	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	I support alternative C.	23.0	103.0
201607	3007	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Since our June meeting, job growth has been solid, GDP growth looks to be back near trend, markets have calmed after a surprise Brexit vote, and inflation outcomes are aligning with our statutory objectives.	23.0	103.0
201607	3008	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	As a result, I see a 25 basis point increase today as an appropriate adjustment to realized economic conditions, not necessarily a commitment to a preset path to normal rates.	23.0	103.0
201607	3009	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Waiting longer to make adjustments is not a benign choice, in my view.	23.0	103.0
201607	3010	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	It challenges the clarity and the discipline of our monetary policy strategy, and it leans in the direction of accepting risk.	23.0	103.0
201607	3011	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	As deviations from policy rules become larger, explaining the rationale for not adjusting rates becomes both more difficult and more important.	23.0	103.0
201607	3012	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Continuing to appeal to headwinds—including events abroad, a subdued pace of household formation, and low productivity growth—argues for further clarification.	23.0	103.0
201607	3013	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Household formation and productivity growth are more supply-side factors, or at least structural factors, that monetary policy is ill equipped to influence.	23.0	103.0
201607	3014	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Instead, insofar as these factors at least partially explain declines in estimates for the longer-run terminal rate, it is the case that adjustments to the rate need to occur sooner.	23.0	103.0
201607	3015	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	I am mindful of the fact that financial stability is an essential condition for achieving our objectives for the economy.	23.0	103.0
201607	3016	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	And I’m concerned that this extended period of negative real rates can create incentives to “reach for yield” and can facilitate the misallocation of capital and the mispricing of risk.	23.0	103.0
201607	3017	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	But I do not believe raising rates should be a response to those realities.	23.0	103.0
201607	3018	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	It is too blunt a response, and the ability to both accurately identify these imbalances and time a proper response has historically, both here and abroad, proved challenging.	23.0	103.0
201607	3019	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	I do worry about expectations of low rates for even longer becoming ingrained.	23.0	103.0
201607	3020	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	I recently heard anecdotes from bankers in our District that they have been anticipating higher rates going back to 2011, when the Committee issued its first communication regarding normalization principles, and have managed their balance sheets accordingly.	23.0	103.0
201607	3021	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Now they are beginning to adjust those expectations, offering more longer-term fixed-rate loans with assumptions that the unusually low rate environment will persist even longer.	23.0	103.0
201607	3022	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	This seems likely to be happening in other sectors even if our measures of financial stability aren’t yet registering concern.	23.0	103.0
201607	3023	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, I do not view gradual adjustments to our policy stance as a function of judging whether we are “behind the curve.”	23.0	103.0
201607	3024	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	I’d prefer not to wait for that kind of evidence.	23.0	103.0
201607	3025	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Continuing to wait to see more data could send a message that our attempts to achieve some degree of normalization are failing or have become unnecessary.	23.0	103.0
201607	3026	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	At our June meeting, there were questions about whether we need to talk about normalization, and some expressed concern that the goal seemed to be that normalizing the federal funds rate as a default view was risky.	23.0	103.0
201607	3027	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	I think the Committee should, in fact, take stock of our communications and its strategy in this regard.	23.0	103.0
201607	3028	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Because the Committee outlined on several occasions since 2011 its intended path to policy normalization and then raised the federal funds rate last December, the Committee’s credibility will hinge on our ability to clarify that strategy.	23.0	103.0
201607	3029	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Although we’ve not talked about revisiting those principles, I continue to think the reinvestment policy could offer an alternative or a complement to how we think about future rate increases, especially in a world that continues to demand safe assets.	23.0	103.0
201607	3030	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	And, finally, Madam Chair, on the language change, I can support dropping the reference to residential investment.	23.0	103.0
201607	3031	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	I think that, either way, some in the markets will note whether it’s there or not there.	23.0	103.0
201607	3032	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	3033	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23.0	65.0
201607	3034	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201607	3035	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	With my baseline assumptions, I see the appropriate path forward as one of gradual increases in the federal funds rate.	23.0	104.0
201607	3036	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	For me, the necessary conditions for further increases are, unsurprisingly, continued GDP growth at or above potential, continued progress in the labor market, and inflation moving back to 2 percent over time.	23.0	104.0
201607	3037	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I would like to see unemployment decline well below 5 percent, the current Tealbook estimate of the natural rate, and I’d like to see, in that context, what happens to wages and to labor force participation.	23.0	104.0
201607	3038	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	My baseline expectation is that those conditions will be fulfilled in the course of 2016.	23.0	104.0
201607	3039	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	If they are, I will support further rate increases, and I can see one or two this year—again, if those conditions are fulfilled.	23.0	104.0
201607	3040	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	But if one or more of the conditions are not fulfilled or if obvious global risks emerge, in my view, it may be appropriate to pause.	23.0	104.0
201607	3041	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I don’t see the Committee as needing to be in a hurry to raise rates.	23.0	104.0
201607	3042	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	We have below-target inflation and an apparent weakening in both demand and job creation.	23.0	104.0
201607	3043	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I do not feel a pressing need to take steps to slow the economy further.	23.0	104.0
201607	3044	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	It is plausible to me that those conditions will be fulfilled at the time of the September meeting.	23.0	104.0
201607	3045	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Two strong payroll reports, combined with decent demand, could well suffice.	23.0	104.0
201607	3046	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The market is currently pricing in a modest probability of an increase by the September meeting, and, in fact, the market has been moving that probability up materially in response to incoming data.	23.0	104.0
201607	3047	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	If the two payroll reports are strong, then the market will likely move substantially in the direction of an increase, and the rest of that gap could be closed through communication.	23.0	104.0
201607	3048	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The question for today is whether to send a strong signal through the statement that an increase is likely in September.	23.0	104.0
201607	3049	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I would not do that, because I actually don’t know whether a rate increase in September is likely to be a good idea.	23.0	104.0
201607	3050	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	We gave a strong signal earlier in the year but were whipsawed by incoming data, and I’m reluctant to send a strong signal, as is contained in alternative C, paragraph 3′.	23.0	104.0
201607	3051	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	If the data do support a September increase, it will be straightforward to bring markets into better alignment with that event.	23.0	104.0
201607	3052	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	And if we send a strong signal now but the data don’t cooperate, then I think we are in a position of climbing down again, at real risk to the Committee’s credibility.	23.0	104.0
201607	3053	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	So I think we should continue to say clearly that the path of tightening is likely to be gradual and dependent on the momentum of the economy, and we should let the data do the talking.	23.0	104.0
201607	3054	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I support alternative B as written and am happy to accept the amendment on residential investment.	23.0	104.0
201607	3055	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201607	3056	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	3057	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23.0	65.0
201607	3058	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201607	3059	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In view of my outlook and the risks, I believe a gradual upward path of interest rates remains appropriate.	23.0	999.0
201607	3060	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	We’ve made progress on both of our monetary policy goals, and various forecasts and optimal control exercises indicate that, to continue to make progress on our goals, it’s appropriate that we gradually increase the funds rate.	23.0	999.0
201607	3061	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In my view, from the standpoint of what monetary policy can do, we have met our maximum-employment goal.	23.0	999.0
201607	3062	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Employment growth is projected to be sufficient to lead to further reductions in the unemployment rate and other measures of underutilization of labor.	23.0	999.0
201607	3063	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Both anecdotal reports and data suggest wages are beginning to accelerate, although the pace of acceleration is likely to be relatively slow as long as productivity growth remains low.	23.0	999.0
201607	3064	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I don’t want to underestimate the problems many people continue to have in the labor market.	23.0	999.0
201607	3065	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Technological advances and globalization are changing the nature of available jobs and the skill sets needed to perform those jobs.	23.0	999.0
201607	3066	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I do believe that government policies and programs and private–public partnerships should be brought to bear to help workers develop skills to reenter and stay in the workforce.	23.0	999.0
201607	3067	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I just don’t see how monetary policy is a means to do that, and it seems like a disservice to the very people it’s intended to help to suggest otherwise.	23.0	999.0
201607	3068	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Although inflation remains below our 2 percent goal, we’ve made progress.	23.0	999.0
201607	3069	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I expect inflation to move back gradually to our goal, consistent with my outlook that economic growth will continue to be at or slightly above trend, that the unemployment rate will fall below estimates of its longer-run trend, and that inflation expectations have been and will continue to be reasonably stable.	23.0	999.0
201607	3070	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Of course, there will be some ups and downs along that path, depending on the trajectory of oil prices and the dollar.	23.0	999.0
201607	3071	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	But I think continued gradual progress is a reasonable forecast.	23.0	999.0
201607	3072	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I believe risks associated with the outlook have decreased since our June meeting in terms of both those attending the labor market and the reaction to the UK referendum, which have subsided.	23.0	999.0
201607	3073	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	If financial stresses in the European banking system build up significantly in the future, then we can address the implications for the US economy at that time.	23.0	999.0
201607	3074	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I don’t think holding policy rates low in the United States can mitigate that sort of risk or reduce the probability that this type of event will occur.	23.0	999.0
201607	3075	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Indeed, by keeping rates lower for longer than appropriate, we could be exacerbating problems in the banking system by encouraging even greater search-for-yield behavior in light of lower net interest income.	23.0	999.0
201607	3076	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Putting all of this together, I believe there’s a strong case for raising the funds rate.	23.0	999.0
201607	3077	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	We are not “behind the curve” yet, but if we continue to wait for every piece of data to line up before we act, we will surely be “behind the curve.”	23.0	999.0
201607	3078	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	And if we refrain from acting even though we are making progress toward both of our policy goals, we’re going to confuse the public and reduce our own credibility.	23.0	999.0
201607	3079	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	At this point, I think we have the luxury of taking the next step and then taking time to assess conditions before moving again.	23.0	999.0
201607	3080	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	This is consistent with our anticipated gradual path.	23.0	999.0
201607	3081	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	It’s also consistent with our being data dependent in the right way.	23.0	999.0
201607	3082	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	By that, I mean it allows us to accumulate enough data so that we can better assess whether the medium-run outlook has changed, rather than being “jerked around” by every monthly data release.	23.0	999.0
201607	3083	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Assuming there’s no material change in the medium-run outlook between now and September, whether we raise rates today or do it in September is immaterial from an economic standpoint.	23.0	999.0
201607	3084	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In September we will have a new set of SEP numbers, the first estimate of second-quarter GDP, two more job reports, and opportunities for further communication so that an action isn’t as much of a surprise as one would be today.	23.0	999.0
201607	3085	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Regarding today’s statement, in paragraph 1, I think the characterization of inflation should acknowledge that inflation has risen this year, and that we’ve made progress on our inflation goal.	23.0	999.0
201607	3086	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I prefer the inflation language in alternative C to that in alternative B.	23.0	999.0
201607	3087	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I prefer the alternative language regarding residential investment that President Williams put on the table today.	23.0	999.0
201607	3088	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I don’t think there’s been a material change in our housing outlook since June.	23.0	999.0
201607	3089	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	If you wanted to leave in a reference to residential investment, I suggest using language closer to what we used in June and just simply say “Since the beginning of the year, the housing sector has improved.”	23.0	999.0
201607	3090	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In paragraph 2, I believe it is very important that we indicate that near-term risks have diminished, as now proposed in alternative B.	23.0	999.0
201607	3091	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I read the rest of the statement as not giving any indication of what we will do in September.	23.0	999.0
201607	3092	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Regardless of market expectations, which may remain low because of our own communications, if the outlook for the economy is largely unchanged from what we see today, with employment growth continuing to be at or above the estimates needed to put further downward pressure on the unemployment rate and the forecast that inflation returns to our goal over time still intact, I will expect us to increase the funds rate in September.	23.0	999.0
201607	3093	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201607	3094	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	3095	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23.0	65.0
201607	3096	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201607	3097	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I would want to get additional readings on the underlying momentum of the economy before making a call on whether it’s appropriate to adjust policy.	23.0	107.0
201607	3098	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In considering whether it will be appropriate to adjust policy in coming meetings, it will be important to assess the distance to our policy goals, the speed at which we’re approaching them, the balance of risks, and our ability to adjust course if the economy evolves differently than we anticipate.	23.0	107.0
201607	3099	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The recent pace of progress toward full employment appears to have downshifted materially, and there are few, if any, signs of strong wage pressures.	23.0	107.0
201607	3100	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	As payroll gains have moderated, the unemployment rate has essentially moved sideways.	23.0	107.0
201607	3101	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Although there are some indications that the economy is approaching full employment, estimates of full employment are highly imprecise, and this has been exacerbated by the deep damage wrought by the Great Recession.	23.0	107.0
201607	3102	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, some indicators, such as the prime-age employment-to-population ratio and the number working part time for economic reasons, suggest there is still room to go.	23.0	107.0
201607	3103	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Importantly, both headline and core inflation remain notably below 2 percent, and core inflation has been below our target for 88 out of the past 92 months.	23.0	107.0
201607	3104	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	To the extent that inflation expectations show signs of becoming less well anchored, survey- and market-based measures suggest we should be concerned about unanchoring not to the upside but to the downside.	23.0	107.0
201607	3105	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	If we were to suggest through our policy actions that we are content that the current level of resource utilization is consistent with attainment of our dual mandate, our commitment to a symmetric inflation target around 2 percent could be called into doubt, and inflation expectations could suffer.	23.0	107.0
201607	3106	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	While it seems likely that further improvement in economic momentum and resource utilization will likely be necessary in order to reach our policy goals, more data will help us assess just how much.	23.0	107.0
201607	3107	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In light of the recent slowing in economic momentum, with the economy likely still somewhat short of reaching our goals, the downward tilt of risks to real activity and inflation from abroad counsels a prudent approach.	23.0	107.0
201607	3108	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	We should carefully weigh the risks of moving to tighten policy prematurely against the risks of moving too slowly.	23.0	107.0
201607	3109	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	If we take a patient approach and policy does not adjust as rapidly as it should and inflationary pressures build more quickly than we anticipate, we still have well- understood conventional tools and plenty of space to address this contingency.	23.0	107.0
201607	3110	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, upwardly anchored expectations and weakness in external demand, along with what I believe is a persistently lower neutral rate, will likely limit the steepness of that required policy response.	23.0	107.0
201607	3111	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	On the other hand, if we adjust policy in the hope that favorable data will subsequently materialize and they do not, the economy will become more vulnerable to adverse shocks, even fairly moderate ones.	23.0	107.0
201607	3112	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The space we have to address such a contingency using conventional tools is extremely limited, and the policy options using nonconventional tools are not without complications.	23.0	107.0
201607	3113	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, we could risk a prolonged period in which  inflation and, potentially, employment fall short of our goals.	23.0	107.0
201607	3114	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In short, I would need to see some combination of greater momentum in economic activity and progress on inflation before feeling confident that the economy would both warrant a tightening in policy and remain resilient to possible negative shocks from abroad that we discussed yesterday.	23.0	107.0
201607	3115	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	For those reasons, it’s important that the statement does not provide a soft commitment to a policy adjustment in the near term, both to avoid muddying the waters on data dependence and to avoid any risk to our credibility if we seem to change course subsequently.	23.0	107.0
201607	3116	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	We’ll be receiving important data before our next meeting:  two employment reports, two reports on PCE inflation, the first report on Q2 GDP, revisions to price, compensation, and spending data in previous quarters, and important data on recent changes in labor compensation.	23.0	107.0
201607	3117	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	We’ll also get a better sense of the resilience of euro-area banks and insights about the shape of any possible response by Italy.	23.0	107.0
201607	3118	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	These will provide valuable insights about how much momentum has slowed, whether it’s slowed, how quickly resource constraints are tightening, and how key risks are evolving.	23.0	107.0
201607	3119	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The intermeeting data may indeed be consistent with a need for another step-up in the federal funds rate in coming months, or, of course, they may not.	23.0	107.0
201607	3120	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In view of the uncertainty, there’s a reasonable probability that the incoming data would not be consistent with a policy adjustment in September.	23.0	107.0
201607	3121	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	A soft lean in today’s statement would then be quite problematic insofar as it might constrain our decisions in September.	23.0	107.0
201607	3122	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It would be better to leave decisionmaking in September unconstrained.	23.0	107.0
201607	3123	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	As Governor Powell suggested, if we see the data coming in stronger, the market itself is likely to begin to adjust its expectations, and there’ll be ample opportunity to communicate how the Committee is likely to react to those developments through the minutes and the Chair’s communications.	23.0	107.0
201607	3124	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Finally, I do have a suggestion in response to President Williams’s suggestion.	23.0	107.0
201607	3125	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	If we do decide to follow his recommendation to delete the reference to residential investment being soft, it allows us to downgrade, I think, our description of business investment, which I would prefer to see described as weak, reflecting that it has indeed been one of the troubling spots in the economy for past quarters.	23.0	107.0
201607	3126	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201607	3127	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	3128	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23.0	65.0
201607	3129	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201607	3130	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B.	23.0	96.0
201607	3131	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of language, when I think about paragraph 1, I think it is about us talking not about all of the things that are happening in the US economy, but talking about the things that are happening in the US economy that we think are important and that weigh on the outlook and then, subsequently, weigh on our actions.	23.0	96.0
201607	3132	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If you use those criteria, it seems to me that the reference to residential investment doesn’t really fit.	23.0	96.0
201607	3133	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re not really evaluating there was a lot of signal in the recent softness in residential investment because we think it’s erratic and because it’s following very strong residential investment in the first quarter.	23.0	96.0
201607	3134	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I very much support deleting that reference.	23.0	96.0
201607	3135	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But with respect to the sentence “Job gains were strong in June following weak growth in May,”	23.0	96.0
201607	3136	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think those are important things that we want to stress, because we had quite a bit of anxiety about the weakness in employment in May and we took quite a bit of solace from the rebound in June.	23.0	96.0
201607	3137	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So, by that metric, I think we should be highlighting that.	23.0	96.0
201607	3138	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I agree with President Williams that we don’t want to highlight monthly data a lot in paragraph 1, but when it’s particularly important and when it really weighs on our evaluation of the economic data, I think it’s appropriate.	23.0	96.0
201607	3139	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	There are two things I want to talk about more broadly.	23.0	96.0
201607	3140	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	First, why are expectations about US short-term rates so far below what we actually expect to do over the next year to 18 months?	23.0	96.0
201607	3141	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, is that a problem, and, if so, what should we do about it?	23.0	96.0
201607	3142	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	When I look at the rate expectations out through 2018, I’m amazed at how flat the interest rate curve is.	23.0	96.0
201607	3143	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there are a number of reasons to explain the shift, and that should affect our view of how we think about this.	23.0	96.0
201607	3144	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	First, people’s assessments of the neutral real short- term rate have declined because economic growth has persistently fallen short of expectations.	23.0	96.0
201607	3145	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If you look at the US economy, it’s averaged only a 2.1 percent annual growth rate over the past seven years, and, over the past year, it’s actually grown even weaker than that.	23.0	96.0
201607	3146	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think it’s been much harder to sustain the view that the neutral real short-term rate is close to or will soon be close to its historical level of around 2 percent.	23.0	96.0
201607	3147	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	As I’ve said for a long time, I think we need to reevaluate the efficacy of the Taylor-rule types of formulations.	23.0	96.0
201607	3148	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The estimates of the current neutral real short-term rate obtained from many of the DSGE models within the Federal Reserve System are quite interesting.	23.0	96.0
201607	3149	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Most of those estimates are clustered close to zero, and that seems to me a much more reasonable estimate of what the neutral short-term rate likely is at this time.	23.0	96.0
201607	3150	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If that’s right, it implies there’s only a small gap between the actual real short-term rate of about minus 1 percent and the neutral real short-term rate.	23.0	96.0
201607	3151	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So it implies that, while US monetary policy is accommodative, it’s only mildly so.	23.0	96.0
201607	3152	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think that also has implications for how fast we actually have to move in terms of raising short- term interest rates.	23.0	96.0
201607	3153	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In addition, as I discussed at the June meeting, I think many have come to the view that this idea that the headwinds from the crisis that are depressing the neutral short-term rate are going to dissipate in the near future may be becoming a less compelling story for the simple reason that if the headwinds haven’t dissipated to a meaningful degree after seven years, what’s going to happen in the next year or two that is going to, all of a sudden, necessarily cause them to diminish?	23.0	96.0
201607	3154	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that some of the headwinds, at least, are going to prove to be much more persistent.	23.0	96.0
201607	3155	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The one that I think is most noteworthy is the reduced availability of mortgage financing for those with lower credit scores.	23.0	96.0
201607	3156	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That seems to me likely to linger for a long time, because I think lenders now appreciate that home prices can decline significantly, and, thus, that they can’t rely on the value of the housing collateral to secure their mortgage loans to the extent they thought they could.	23.0	96.0
201607	3157	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So now the credit quality of the borrower really matters in terms of that mortgage lending decision.	23.0	96.0
201607	3158	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this is something that’s just going to be with us for a very long time.	23.0	96.0
201607	3159	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	A second reason for the downward adjustment in US interest rate expectations is that US financial market conditions depend in part on the stance of our monetary policy relative to monetary policies abroad.	23.0	96.0
201607	3160	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So if the economic outlook abroad deteriorates, that causes foreign countries to pursue a more accommodative set of monetary policies, and that means we may also have to adjust our own monetary policy path.	23.0	96.0
201607	3161	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If we don’t adjust our path, then the dollar would likely appreciate because of higher relative US interest rates, and this could result in an undesired tightening in US financial conditions.	23.0	96.0
201607	3162	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	What we’ve seen is that the economic outlook abroad has been disappointing, so the forward rate paths in Europe and Japan have fallen considerably this year.	23.0	96.0
201607	3163	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If we had actually stayed on our December 2015 SEP path, then the US dollar would have likely appreciated much more significantly.	23.0	96.0
201607	3164	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think some of what we’re seeing is, the US rate path is coming down in tandem with the foreign interest rate path, and, as a consequence of that, the dollar has appreciated only modestly.	23.0	96.0
201607	3165	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The second question I wanted to talk about is whether this is a problem and, if so, what we should do about it.	23.0	96.0
201607	3166	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the answer depends in large part on whether one judges that the current set of financial conditions is too accommodative relative to what we need to achieve our objectives.	23.0	96.0
201607	3167	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If we look at the various financial conditions indicators, financial conditions now appear to be a bit easier than they were before our December decision to increase our federal funds rate target.	23.0	96.0
201607	3168	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Although the dollar is slightly stronger, this has been more than offset by lower long-term yields and higher equity prices.	23.0	96.0
201607	3169	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, this easing in financial conditions would seem to argue for a rate hike, but, against this, the global outlook has deteriorated, and we haven’t really upgraded our own forecast of economic growth or inflation.	23.0	96.0
201607	3170	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So, in other words, one could also argue that it seems that we need a more accommodative set of financial conditions in order to best achieve our objectives.	23.0	96.0
201607	3171	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that’s really what the argument is about.	23.0	96.0
201607	3172	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If it’s true that we need an easier set of financial market conditions, then we probably should be patient.	23.0	96.0
201607	3173	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So that’s really the tension here.	23.0	96.0
201607	3174	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m really not sure which view is the right one.	23.0	96.0
201607	3175	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Because I don’t know which view is the right one, I don’t want to foreshadow what we’re going to do in September until I can actually be a little bit more certain about that outcome.	23.0	96.0
201607	3176	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If we do get closer to the September meeting and we think we do want to move but market expectations are not there, I do think there are plenty of opportunities to communicate in order to alter those expectations prior to that meeting.	23.0	96.0
201607	3177	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t see the need to do more at this meeting than what alternative B does.	23.0	96.0
201607	3178	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The near-term risks to the outlook have diminished.	23.0	96.0
201607	3179	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it actually will push expectations about September upward.	23.0	96.0
201607	3180	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I have no idea by how much.	23.0	96.0
201607	3181	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I would judge it’s probably a little rather than a lot, and one could argue that somewhat different language could have a bigger effect.	23.0	96.0
201607	3182	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But I think that, directionally, I’d be very surprised if expectations for September don’t move up a little bit with that language, because people are going to look at it and say, “Despite the Brexit vote, which is a negative, the Federal Reserve has decided that the near-term risks have diminished.”	23.0	96.0
201607	3183	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think they’re going to take it to some extent as saying that the employment news and the favorable market reaction following the Brexit vote trump the Brexit vote itself.	23.0	96.0
201607	3184	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, in terms of the language, as I said, I would favor deleting the “residential investment” language and making no other changes to the statement.	23.0	96.0
201607	3185	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201607	3186	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	3187	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23.0	65.0
201607	3188	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me start with the smaller issues before commenting on the larger ones.	24.0	65.0
201607	3189	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we start with residential investment?	24.0	65.0
201607	3190	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I’ve heard considerable support for changing the language there, and one possibility is simply to delete the language about residential investment and to say nothing.	24.0	65.0
201607	3191	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I did hear President Mester suggest that another possibility would simply be to say “Since the beginning of the year, the housing sector has improved.”	24.0	65.0
201607	3192	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And, frankly, I’m open to either possibility.	24.0	65.0
201607	3193	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I suppose the simpler thing is just to delete all reference to it.	24.0	65.0
201607	3194	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Would most of you be comfortable doing that—just deleting all reference to it?	24.0	65.0
201607	3195	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there was a pretty strong consensus on that side.	24.0	96.0
201607	3196	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	To just delete it completely?	24.0	65.0
201607	3197	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Among the people who spoke, yes.	24.0	96.0
201607	3198	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	24.0	65.0
201607	3199	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	So I suggest we delete it.	24.0	65.0
201607	3200	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	The sentence would read “Household spending has been growing strongly, but business fixed investment has been soft.”	24.0	65.0
201607	3201	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	The second suggestion of President Williams concerned the sentence “Job gains were strong in June following weak growth in May.”	24.0	65.0
201607	3202	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I did hear a little bit of support for President Williams’s proposal to delete that as well as some counterarguments.	24.0	65.0
201607	3203	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I’ll say that, for my own part, normally I don’t like to focus on a lot of up-and-down in the data and prefer instead to focus on longer-term trends, which are highlighted in the sentence that follows that.	24.0	65.0
201607	3204	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	But I agree with the Vice Chairman that, on this particular occasion, we strongly emphasized our concern about the May reading.	24.0	65.0
201607	3205	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And to say that weak reading was completely reversed, essentially, in June is giving a clear sense that we’re now discounting that and taking a stronger view.	24.0	65.0
201607	3206	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	On this occasion, I think it’s important, but if I hear a groundswell of sentiment for getting rid of it, I’m open to it.	24.0	65.0
201607	3207	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	24.0	65.0
201607	3208	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The reason I agreed is, my fear is that we know that each of these monthly data series is subject to revision, and sometimes it’s a large revision.	24.0	110.0
201607	3209	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	As we go forward, as we have volatility in monthly numbers, I don’t want the public to think our reaction function is to overreact or underreact to any month.	24.0	110.0
201607	3210	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And I do think the sentence that follows does the trick by focusing more on smoothing.	24.0	110.0
201607	3211	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m more worried about the public understanding our reaction function, and, to me, citing individual months gives them a somewhat misleading picture of our reaction function.	24.0	110.0
201607	3212	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	That’s the reason I was in favor of deleting it.	24.0	110.0
201607	3213	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I guess, in general, I agree with that, and typically we do not cite “This thing went up last month, and it fell.”	24.0	65.0
201607	3214	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	When such things happen—and I guess residential investment is arguably a case in point—we don’t talk about it, or we talk about longer-term trends.	24.0	65.0
201607	3215	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	So I think this is an unusual situation, but, to my mind, it’s one in which we focused so much attention on our concern about the May employment report that it is a slightly different situation.	24.0	65.0
201607	3216	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	24.0	65.0
201607	3217	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	24.0	94.0
201607	3218	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think President Kaplan brings up a good point about revisions.	24.0	94.0
201607	3219	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This could be changed in the future.	24.0	94.0
201607	3220	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	And I also think it’s unnecessary.	24.0	94.0
201607	3221	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The next sentence says “On balance, payrolls ...	24.0	94.0
201607	3222	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	So I don’t think it helps us, I don’t think it does anything for us, and the “On balance” sentence takes care of it.	24.0	94.0
201607	3223	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	So I would agree with President Williams on this.	24.0	94.0
201607	3224	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	24.0	65.0
201607	3225	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	You know I’ve argued that we should take a longer-term view.	24.0	999.0
201607	3226	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	My fear is that if we don’t put this in, we’re not taking a stand that 287,000 jobs per month is strong job growth.	24.0	999.0
201607	3227	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	And I worry that if we take that out, people are going to think that an increase of 287,000 in jobs is kind of what we’re expecting each time.	24.0	999.0
201607	3228	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it would make the statement softer—	24.0	96.0
201607	3229	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	To take it out.	24.0	90.0
201607	3230	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	—to take it out, frankly.	24.0	96.0
201607	3231	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Because by highlighting the job gains, what you’re doing is saying that you’re taking quite a bit of signal from it, which I think we are.	24.0	96.0
201607	3232	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I agree with that.	24.0	90.0
201607	3233	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Absolutely.	24.0	65.0
201607	3234	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I agree.	24.0	65.0
201607	3235	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	24.0	65.0
201607	3236	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	One possibility, without naming months, is just to delete that sentence, get rid of “On balance,” and say “Job gains, payrolls, and other labor market indicators,” et cetera.	24.0	999.0
201607	3237	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	So it’s recognizing the job gains without actually explicitly naming the month.	24.0	999.0
201607	3238	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re already saying that by the word “payrolls,” though, aren’t we, President Harker?	24.0	96.0
201607	3239	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	I worry about naming the months, especially when you consider revisions.	24.0	999.0
201607	3240	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think we should worry about naming this month.	24.0	108.0
201607	3241	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We had a deviation of about three standard deviations from what was expected, and everybody noticed it, and we used it as a reason why we weren’t raising rates—I don’t know quite how we phrased it—so I think we should at least mention it.	24.0	108.0
201607	3242	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	It was an important factor in our changing view, and this is communicating that we’re now discounting what we said about our concerns at the June meeting.	24.0	65.0
201607	3243	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	24.0	65.0
201607	3244	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I realize there are people on both sides of this.	24.0	65.0
201607	3245	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	My suggestion is that we leave that as is, and let me turn to the larger issue of September.	24.0	65.0
201607	3246	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I certainly heard many of you around the table express the view that there is a strong case, in view of how the economy has behaved, for moving rates gradually up over time; that September certainly should be on the table as an option; and that you would want to see nothing in the statement or in our communications over the next couple of months that would in any way tie our hands in September if we interpret that the data are appropriate to move.	24.0	65.0
201607	3247	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Even among those of you who are more reluctant and skeptical that a move in September will be appropriate and that the data will support it, I’ve also heard an openness on your part to looking at the incoming data and evaluating whether a move in September is appropriate, and I completely share that view.	24.0	65.0
201607	3248	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I can easily imagine a data flow—President Lockhart set out some examples—that would leave me feeling that we should move in September.	24.0	65.0
201607	3249	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I absolutely agree that it should be an open option.	24.0	65.0
201607	3250	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We should do nothing to take September off the table.	24.0	65.0
201607	3251	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And as time passes and the data flow comes in, if our sense is that September is appropriate, then our communication should help markets to understand our evolving views.	24.0	65.0
201607	3252	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Now, frankly, my interpretation of what’s in alternative B—I think both the changes in paragraph 1 and the new red sentence in paragraph 2 do indicate that September is on the table, and that it will be interpreted that way.	24.0	65.0
201607	3253	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I’m not perfect, either, at predicting market reaction to our statements, but it is my sense that, for example, no changes at all are really expected in paragraph 2 by most observers.	24.0	65.0
201607	3254	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And for us to say that near-term risks have diminished, I think, will be noticed and taken as a signal not of any commitment to move, but as a sense that we’re more comfortable with the data flow.	24.0	65.0
201607	3255	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Many of you mentioned my speech at the Jackson Hole symposium.	24.0	65.0
201607	3256	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I have a good opportunity there to comment on the incoming data flow.	24.0	65.0
201607	3257	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	If we’re feeling that September looks like the time we should move, first of all, I think the data flow will move markets.	24.0	65.0
201607	3258	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We’ve seen that in the past.	24.0	65.0
201607	3259	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you have commented on it.	24.0	65.0
201607	3260	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I would expect that.	24.0	65.0
201607	3261	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And I promise that at Jackson Hole, if that looks appropriate, I will say something that will confirm that sentiment or move it along.	24.0	65.0
201607	3262	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I am very worried—a number of you have commented on this—that we have in the past signaled we’re just on the verge of moving, and then something happens and we don’t move.	24.0	65.0
201607	3263	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I do not regret our decisions in various meetings not to move.	24.0	65.0
201607	3264	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think there were good reasons not to move.	24.0	65.0
201607	3265	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	But constantly suggesting we’re on the verge of moving and then not doing so is harming our credibility.	24.0	65.0
201607	3266	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I would prefer to be more in a wait-and-see posture, in which every meeting, particularly September, is “live,” and we will make our decision on the basis of the data flow and not go too far.	24.0	65.0
201607	3267	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And the language that’s in alternative C, I think, is true.	24.0	65.0
201607	3268	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	You know, the case in favor of raising the funds rate I believe has increased.	24.0	65.0
201607	3269	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I wouldn’t take any issue with the truthfulness of that statement, but it would be taken as an extremely strong signal, and, to my mind, it’s not appropriate at this point.	24.0	65.0
201607	3270	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I’ve heard a lot of sentiment in the direction of alternative C, but I also have heard a large number of people who feel pretty strongly that alternative B is far enough for today, so I would propose that we stick with the language in alternative B.	24.0	65.0
201607	3271	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me say just one other thing before we call for a vote, and that is that both today and at our June meeting I heard a number of you say that our statement and communications aren’t as effective as they ought to be.	24.0	65.0
201607	3272	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	In particular, over the past year, the pace of tightening has been noticeably slower than we anticipated in December when we first raised rates.	24.0	65.0
201607	3273	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	That’s led to the cynical conclusion in some quarters that we’re always looking for an excuse, and we’ll always find an excuse, not to raise rates.	24.0	65.0
201607	3274	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I’m wondering, in light of that, whether it’s helpful to keep emphasizing in our statement that the funds rate is likely to rise gradually over the next two or three years.	24.0	65.0
201607	3275	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And I think we do need to think hard about our forward guidance and whether we could change the language so that it provides a somewhat better sense of what our actual reaction function is and what it means when we say that our actions are data dependent.	24.0	65.0
201607	3276	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think that in coming meetings, this is something that we need to consider and discuss, and I will try to structure some conversation on that.	24.0	65.0
201607	3277	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	But for today, I would like to propose that we vote on alternative B as written, with the one change pertaining to residential investment that we discussed.	24.0	65.0
201607	3278	2016-07-27	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	24.0	999.0
201607	3279	2016-07-27	meeting	MADIGAN	This vote will be on the statement associated with alternative B, as on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas’s handout, with the change to the fourth sentence that the Chair indicated.	24.0	999.0
201607	3280	2016-07-27	meeting	MADIGAN	This vote will also cover the directive to the Desk as included in the implementation note on page 10 of Thomas’s package.	24.0	999.0
201607	3281	2016-07-27	meeting	MADIGAN	Chair Yellen   Yes Vice Chairman Dudley  Yes Governor Brainard   Yes President Bullard   Yes Governor Fischer   Yes President George   No President Mester   Yes Governor Powell   Yes President Rosengren  Yes Governor Tarullo   Yes .	24.0	999.0
201607	3282	2016-07-27	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you.	24.0	999.0
201607	3283	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	24.0	65.0
201607	3284	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks, everybody, for a good meeting.	53.0	65.0
201607	3285	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Our next meeting is Tuesday and Wednesday, September 20 and 21.	53.0	65.0
201607	3286	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	For those of you who will be around, there will be a buffet lunch starting at 11:00.	53.0	65.0
201609	0	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Good afternoon, everyone.	50.0	65.0
201609	1	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s get under way.	50.0	65.0
201609	2	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Today’s meeting, as usual, will be a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board of Governors, so I need a motion to close the Board meeting.	50.0	65.0
201609	3	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	50.0	108.0
201609	4	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	50.0	65.0
201609	5	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	50.0	65.0
201609	6	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Our first agenda item is the selection of a Committee officer.	51.0	65.0
201609	7	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	As many of you know, Michael Held, who is seated near the anteroom door, has been appointed general counsel and executive vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.	51.0	65.0
201609	8	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	I am pleased to recommend that the Committee select Michael as its deputy general counsel.	51.0	65.0
201609	9	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Consistent with the Committee’s standard practice for appointment of its officers, this selection would be effective until the Committee’s first regularly scheduled meeting in 2017.	51.0	65.0
201609	10	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Michael has been with the New York Federal Reserve for the past 18 years and is a highly experienced central banking attorney.	51.0	65.0
201609	11	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman, would you like to make a comment?	51.0	65.0
201609	12	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes.	51.0	96.0
201609	13	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	First, I’d like to second the notion of him becoming the deputy general counsel for the FOMC.	51.0	96.0
201609	14	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	He has big shoes to fill with Tom Baxter retiring from the New York Fed, but I’m sure he will do so very ably.	51.0	96.0
201609	15	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I’ve worked with him for many years, and I very much trust his knowledge and his judgment.	51.0	96.0
201609	16	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s nice to have him here at the FOMC on a more permanent basis, taking a seat next to Scott, who’s not here today, but—	51.0	96.0
201609	17	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	[laughter]—we will be seeing Michael there on a regular basis.	51.0	96.0
201609	18	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m very pleased.	51.0	96.0
201609	19	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	51.0	96.0
201609	20	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	51.0	65.0
201609	21	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Any discussion or any objections?	51.0	65.0
201609	22	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	51.0	65.0
201609	23	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, the selection is approved unanimously by the Committee.	51.0	65.0
201609	24	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	And congratulations, Michael, we are looking forward to working with you in your new role.	51.0	65.0
201609	25	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	That takes us to the second agenda item, which concerns proposed revisions of the documents governing foreign currency operations.	64.0	65.0
201609	26	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	As you know, the staff has been engaged in a long-term effort to develop proposed revisions to the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, and other related documents.	64.0	65.0
201609	27	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	You all received memos on the proposal from the staff in mid-August, and last week we sent a short additional memo from the Foreign Currency Subcommittee.	64.0	65.0
201609	28	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	This project has required a lot of careful analysis involving staff from both the New York Federal Reserve and the Board.	64.0	65.0
201609	29	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	That work was carried out under the general oversight of the Subcommittee, and I’d like to thank the staff for what seems to me to be an excellent proposal.	64.0	65.0
201609	30	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	In my view, it meets the important objectives of the project.	64.0	65.0
201609	31	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	I might note that the proposal provides that the Subcommittee, in consultation with the Committee, may give additional instructions to the Desk regarding holdings of foreign currencies.	64.0	65.0
201609	32	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	As I mentioned, the Subcommittee recently sent the Committee a short memo, which included draft instructions that the Subcommittee would plan to issue to the Desk.	64.0	65.0
201609	33	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Unless there are objections, the Subcommittee would issue these instructions within a few days following this meeting.	64.0	65.0
201609	34	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	The Committee will not be asked to vote on those instructions.	64.0	65.0
201609	35	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Let me now turn to Simon, who’s going to summarize the proposal.	64.0	65.0
201609	36	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	64.0	999.0
201609	37	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	I’d just like to say that some of the staff involved in the project are in the room today, including Paul Dozier and Mike Leahy from IF; Cindy Hull from the Desk; and Sophia Allison, who is sitting next to Lorie, from the Board’s Legal Division.	64.0	999.0
201609	38	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	I’ll be discussing important changes to the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations (the Authorization), the Foreign Currency Directive (the Directive), and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations.	64.0	999.0
201609	39	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	As discussed in the memo the Committee received in August titled “Proposed Revisions to Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and Related Organizational Documents,” the revisions are intended to meet three objectives: first, reflect the current operating environment; second, clarify guidance to the Selected Bank by updating governance for each operation; and, third, simplify the structure of the documents.	64.0	999.0
201609	40	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Proposed changes to the document structure are summarized in the top-left panel of your exhibit.	64.0	999.0
201609	41	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The proposed documents are organized to consolidate authorizations and directions into the Authorization and the Directive, respectively, and to clarify governance and guidance relating to specific operation types.	64.0	999.0
201609	42	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	All text authorizing an operation and any language regarding its purpose is in the Authorization, while specific direction to the Selected Bank to conduct each operation is in the Directive.	64.0	999.0
201609	43	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	In both documents, text for each operation type is grouped together, in contrast to the format of the current documents.	64.0	999.0
201609	44	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Also, the existing Procedural Instructions are eliminated, as language from the document is incorporated into the Authorization and Directive.	64.0	999.0
201609	45	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	This proposed two-document organization structure now aligns with the one used for domestic operations.	64.0	999.0
201609	46	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The staff also proposes to move both the definition and governance of the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, currently in the Authorization, into the Rules of Organization and Rules of Procedure, respectively.	64.0	999.0
201609	47	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The staff also proposes several substantive changes to foreign currency operation procedures and governance.	64.0	999.0
201609	48	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	These changes are designed to reflect the current operating environment and to clarify guidance to the Selected Bank.	64.0	999.0
201609	49	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	These changes remove the discretion that the Selected Bank has in the existing governance framework to determine whether to execute foreign currency operations and how to set parameters for investing the foreign currency holdings.	64.0	999.0
201609	50	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The proposed framework now authorizes the Foreign Currency Subcommittee to both determine whether to execute interventions within specified limits and provide additional instructions regarding the management of the foreign reserves.	64.0	999.0
201609	51	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The staff proposes assigning these responsibilities to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee primarily to accommodate the often time-sensitive nature of decisions that must be made regarding implementation of intervention operations as well as to facilitate coordination with the US Treasury or foreign central banks.	64.0	999.0
201609	52	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The proposed documents are organized into five operation types: interventions, warehousing, reciprocal currency arrangements, US dollar and foreign liquidity swaps, and foreign currency holdings.	64.0	999.0
201609	53	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	I will now address major changes made to the documents according to each of these operation types.	64.0	999.0
201609	54	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Additional proposed changes are listed in the appendix of your exhibit.	64.0	999.0
201609	55	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The top-right panel of your exhibit lists major changes to foreign exchange intervention operations.	64.0	999.0
201609	56	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The proposed documents remove the Selected Bank’s discretion to determine whether to execute as much as $600 million in intervention operations per intermeeting period.	64.0	999.0
201609	57	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	For some brief background, this discretion was given to the Selected Bank in 1976, when the documents were first established, a time when intervention operations were somewhat routine.	64.0	999.0
201609	58	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The Selected Bank has not used this discretion in more than 20 years.	64.0	999.0
201609	59	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	However, because intervention operations are now rarely conducted, the proposed documents eliminate this almost 40-year-old provision.	64.0	999.0
201609	60	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The proposed documents provide that all such operations require prior approval from the Committee or Subcommittee.	64.0	999.0
201609	61	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Other limits in the existing framework on the Selected Bank’s intervention discretion, including a list of authorized currencies and a $25 billion cap on the overall size of the foreign currency holdings, are also eliminated.	64.0	999.0
201609	62	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The existing documents authorize the Subcommittee to direct the Desk to execute intervention operations up to $1.5 billion per intermeeting period.	64.0	999.0
201609	63	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The proposed documents increase the limit to $5 billion; any interventions above this limit could only be approved by the Committee.	64.0	999.0
201609	64	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	As the existing $1.5 billion limit was last updated in 1993, the proposed change aligns the size of the Subcommittee’s approval authority with the more than fourfold increase in the FX market size.	64.0	999.0
201609	65	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The middle-left panel of your exhibit lists major changes to the second operation type, warehousing.	64.0	999.0
201609	66	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Warehousing is essentially a swap operation with the US Treasury in which its Exchange Stabilization Fund, the ESF, sells foreign currency to the Selected Bank for US dollars; at the outset of the transaction, the ESF agrees to repurchase the foreign currency at a set future date and exchange rate.	64.0	999.0
201609	67	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Under current practice, the Committee delegates to the Selected Bank the authority to approve Treasury requests to use the warehousing facility of up to $5 billion via the annual Desk Authorization process each January.	64.0	999.0
201609	68	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	However, the existing Authorization documents do not explicitly mention warehousing and instead provide only general authority for the Selected Bank to conduct operations with the ESF.	64.0	999.0
201609	69	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	To improve transparency, the proposed documents include a provision expressly authorizing the $5 billion warehousing arrangement with the Treasury.	64.0	999.0
201609	70	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The proposed directive now also instructs the Subcommittee to internally approve warehousing transactions before the Selected Bank can execute them with the US Treasury.	64.0	999.0
201609	71	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The middle-right panel of your exhibit summarizes major changes for reciprocal currency arrangements and standing liquidity swap lines, the third and fourth types of operations.	64.0	999.0
201609	72	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Reciprocal currency arrangements are swap arrangements with the central banks of Mexico and Canada that were established in 1994 under the North American Framework Agreement.	64.0	999.0
201609	73	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The existing documents authorize the Subcommittee to approve drawings up to certain size limits.	64.0	999.0
201609	74	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	However, because these are expected to be used only rarely, the proposed documents now require the Committee to approve all drawings under these arrangements.	64.0	999.0
201609	75	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	More familiar to the Committee are the standing liquidity swap lines.	64.0	999.0
201609	76	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	These arrangements are maintained with a network of five foreign central banks for the provision of US dollars from the Federal Reserve and the acquisition of foreign currency from the foreign central banks.	64.0	999.0
201609	77	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The swap lines are routinely used to provide dollars to some foreign central banks in the network.	64.0	999.0
201609	78	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	In the existing and proposed Authorization documents, the Committee is charged with approving new swap arrangements and the Chairman is delegated authority to approve changes to the terms of existing arrangements.	64.0	999.0
201609	79	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The Chairman is delegated authority to approve individual dollar draws on the swap lines and can also further delegate approval of such draws to the SOMA manager.	64.0	999.0
201609	80	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Under current practice, foreign central banks present calendars of proposed dollar auctions to the Federal Reserve on a monthly basis and seek assurance that the Federal Reserve intends to approve swap drawing requests associated with these calendars.	64.0	999.0
201609	81	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The Chairman reviews and typically approves the foreign central banks’ proposed dollar auction calendars.	64.0	999.0
201609	82	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The Chairman also typically delegates to the SOMA manager the authority to approve requests to draw on the swap lines to fund these scheduled operations.	64.0	999.0
201609	83	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The exception is for initial draw requests, where “initial” is understood to refer to the first drawing by a central bank since the swap arrangements changed from temporary to standing arrangements in January 2014.	64.0	999.0
201609	84	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	In that case, the Chairman retains authority to approve the drawing.	64.0	999.0
201609	85	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The proposed documents establish a governance process on the basis of whether the draw is associated with a schedule of potential drawings the Chairman has approved in advance.	64.0	999.0
201609	86	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The proposed documents authorize the Chairman to approve a schedule of potential drawings and to delegate to the SOMA manager authority to approve any draws made in accordance with that schedule.	64.0	999.0
201609	87	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	All unscheduled dollar draws must still be approved by the Chairman.	64.0	999.0
201609	88	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The existing documents also delegate to the Chairman approval authority for foreign currency draws by the Federal Reserve.	64.0	999.0
201609	89	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Because such foreign currency draws are expected to rarely occur in the current operating environment and would occur because of developments in the United States, the proposed documents now require prior approval of such draws from the Committee.	64.0	999.0
201609	90	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The bottom-left panel summarizes proposed governance changes to the final operation type, management of foreign currency holdings.	64.0	999.0
201609	91	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	With respect to management of the foreign currency holdings, the proposed documents establish a new governance framework that is intended to complement the updated investment framework presented to the Committee in April of this year.	64.0	999.0
201609	92	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	First, the proposed documents set forth three investment objectives for the Selected Bank:  The Selected Bank must manage the foreign currency holdings primarily to ensure sufficient liquidity to enable the conduct of foreign currency operations, secondarily to have a high degree of safety, and, subject to these two objectives, to achieve the highest rate of return possible in each currency.	64.0	999.0
201609	93	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Second, the Subcommittee, in consultation with the Committee, is delegated the authority to provide additional instructions to the Selected Bank regarding investments of foreign currency holdings.	64.0	999.0
201609	94	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	This new provision removes the Selected Bank’s current autonomy, such as the ability to determine the riskiness of the portfolio, the degree of portfolio liquidity, and the specific issuers and asset classes in which to invest.	64.0	999.0
201609	95	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The proposed governance structure contemplates that risk constraints will no longer appear in the Authorization documents but instead may appear in the additional instructions that the Subcommittee may provide to the Selected Bank.	64.0	999.0
201609	96	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Note that issuance of these instructions would not prevent the Committee from issuing additional direction to the Selected Bank regarding the management of the foreign currency holdings.	64.0	999.0
201609	97	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Finally, the existing average duration limit of 24 months is removed from the Authorization.	64.0	999.0
201609	98	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	If the Committee adopts the proposed governing documents, as the Chair pointed out, the Subcommittee plans to issue additional instructions to the Selected Bank shortly after the conclusion of this meeting.	64.0	999.0
201609	99	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The Subcommittee provided a draft of these instructions to the Committee last week together with the memo titled “Additional Instructions of Foreign Currency Subcommittee to Desk Regarding Holdings of Foreign Currencies.”	64.0	999.0
201609	100	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	I would like to highlight two other proposed changes relating to governance, listed in the bottom-right panel of your exhibit.	64.0	999.0
201609	101	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The first is a provision to delegate any authority of the Subcommittee to the Chairman if the Subcommittee cannot convene in the time available.	64.0	999.0
201609	102	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The second provides that in emergency circumstances, the Chairman may approve actions otherwise reserved for the Committee.	64.0	999.0
201609	103	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	These changes are intended for use only in cases of emergency.	64.0	999.0
201609	104	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Under modern communication technology, it is expected that these would be used only rarely.	64.0	999.0
201609	105	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Additional proposed changes are listed in the appendix of your exhibit.	64.0	999.0
201609	106	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Please note that if you approve the proposed documents, they will first be made public in the minutes of this meeting, and the changes will thus remain confidential until the minutes are released.	64.0	999.0
201609	107	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Before the Chair requests a vote on the foreign authorization documents, the Rules of Organization, and Rules of Procedure, we would be happy to answer any questions on the proposed changes.	64.0	999.0
201609	108	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Simon?	64.0	65.0
201609	109	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Discussion?	64.0	65.0
201609	110	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	64.0	65.0
201609	111	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	64.0	94.0
201609	112	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I think it’s a nice proposal.	64.0	94.0
201609	113	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	There’s a lot of references to “Chairman” in this, and it’s a little bit of residual language.	64.0	94.0
201609	114	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Could we perhaps switch it to “Chair” and not have “Chairman” in it?	64.0	94.0
201609	115	2016-09-21	meeting	ALLISON	Actually, “Chairman” is the term that’s used in the Act.	64.0	999.0
201609	116	2016-09-21	meeting	ALLISON	So that’s why we’ve retained it in these documents.	64.0	999.0
201609	117	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	I did feel strange saying that throughout the briefing, but it was to conform with the Federal Reserve Act.	64.0	999.0
201609	118	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	So it’s the “Chairman” writing a particular check.	64.0	999.0
201609	119	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Maybe we need to update the Federal Reserve Act after all.	64.0	96.0
201609	120	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	64.0	96.0
201609	121	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Not touching that.	64.0	65.0
201609	122	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	64.0	65.0
201609	123	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions or comments?	64.0	65.0
201609	124	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	64.0	65.0
201609	125	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	As many of you know, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond has a long tradition of raising concerns about foreign exchange intervention on the grounds that, if they’re sterilized, they’re meaningless.	64.0	81.0
201609	126	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	If they’re not sterilized, they imply a change in monetary policy stance, which would imply some compromise of our monetary policy independence from the Treasury.	64.0	81.0
201609	127	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	I realize we don’t have a vote, but, on principle, historically, the Richmond Federal Reserve has dissented on anything having to do with foreign exchange authorizations.	64.0	81.0
201609	128	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	I mention this, first, to avoid disappointing those who might have been expecting me to mention this any time a foreign exchange matter is brought up, but also to say that these new documents strike me as the right way for one to authorize foreign exchange operations, if one must.	64.0	81.0
201609	129	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	And I commend the staff on a very thorough and excellent review of these things.	64.0	81.0
201609	130	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	More broadly, though, foreign exchange operations increasingly seem to be an anachronistic tool.	64.0	81.0
201609	131	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Back in the day, in the old operating regime, if we were going to maintain an interest rate peg, we had to sterilize them, so they were kind of meaningless.	64.0	81.0
201609	132	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	If we didn’t sterilize them, they’d drive the rate down.	64.0	81.0
201609	133	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Nowadays, it’s not obvious that they should be expected to have any meaningful economic effect.	64.0	81.0
201609	134	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	It might be worthwhile in the not-too-distant future to give that more thought and maybe give some thought to the role played by ourforeign exchange operations.	64.0	81.0
201609	135	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	64.0	81.0
201609	136	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	64.0	65.0
201609	137	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Other comments or questions?	64.0	65.0
201609	138	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	64.0	65.0
201609	139	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	If there are no further questions or discussion, we’ll now vote on the proposal.	64.0	65.0
201609	140	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	This vote will be to approve all four of the revised documents in the staff proposal—namely, the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, the Committee’s Rules of Organization, and the Committee’s Rules of Procedure.	64.0	65.0
201609	141	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	These documents are included in Simon’s briefing package.	64.0	65.0
201609	142	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	With the proposed changes to these documents, the procedural instructions with respect to foreign currency operations would no longer be necessary and would be rescinded.	64.0	65.0
201609	143	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Is there a motion on this proposal?	64.0	65.0
201609	144	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So moved.	64.0	96.0
201609	145	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	64.0	65.0
201609	146	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	And a second?	64.0	65.0
201609	147	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	64.0	108.0
201609	148	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	64.0	65.0
201609	149	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Any objections?	64.0	65.0
201609	150	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	64.0	65.0
201609	151	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection, the proposal is approved.	64.0	65.0
201609	152	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	64.0	65.0
201609	153	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	We are ready to move on to our third agenda item, and Simon is going to begin with the Desk briefing.	61.0	65.0
201609	154	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201609	155	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	For much of the intermeeting period, most asset prices traded in tight ranges amid low volatility.	61.0	999.0
201609	156	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	This calm was broken in the past couple of weeks by shifts in sentiments about the future policy actions of the ECB and Bank of Japan, sparking some steepening in global sovereign yield curves.	61.0	999.0
201609	157	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	On net, changes in major asset prices were modest and had mixed implications for financial conditions, shown in the first column of the top-left panel of your first exhibit.	61.0	999.0
201609	158	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The dollar depreciated a touch and credit spreads narrowed, while Treasury yields and dollar funding rates such as LIBOR increased slightly and the S&P 500 index was down a bit.	61.0	999.0
201609	159	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Lorie will touch on the drivers and implications of this increase in LIBOR later in the briefing.	61.0	999.0
201609	160	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The survey- and market-implied paths of the target federal funds rate were little changed, as shown in the top-right panel, as market participants balanced generally softer-than-expected economic data against Federal Reserve communications that were somewhat less accommodative than expected.	61.0	999.0
201609	161	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	In the Desk’s most recent surveys, the average probability attached to a rate hike at this meeting was 15 percent and the average probability attached to a rate hike at the December meeting was about 40 percent, shown on the left side of the middle-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201609	162	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	These levels are generally consistent with the probabilities currently implied by market prices.	61.0	999.0
201609	163	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The market-implied probability for a September hike had reached as high as 30 percent over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201609	164	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	As market participants have lowered their assessment of the likelihood of an increase at this meeting, the probability of an increase this year has remained relatively steady, with the marginal probability of a December hike increasing.	61.0	999.0
201609	165	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Last year, when the FOMC did not raise rates at its September meeting, we saw an increase in the survey-implied probability for a rate hike occurring at the December meeting, from 25 percent to 40 percent immediately after, as shown in the shift from the dark to light blue bars on the right side of the middle-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201609	166	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The market-implied paths of most advanced-economy central bank policy rates are shown in the middle-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201609	167	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The Bank of England joined the ranks of advanced foreign economy central banks pursuing further monetary easing, with details of its comprehensive package shown in the bottom-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201609	168	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	And while the Bank of England decided not to take its Bank Rate into negative territory, the United States is the only economy among the G-4 with an upward-sloping policy rate curve over the next three years.	61.0	999.0
201609	169	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	And even in the case of the United States, the projected rate increases are very modest.	61.0	999.0
201609	170	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The low level of rates has produced a number of innovations in how central banks provide accommodation at the zero bound, and the intermeeting period witnessed a range of reactions in financial markets to central banks’ ongoing use of these tools, particularly large-scale asset purchases.	61.0	999.0
201609	171	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	In the initial weeks of its new purchase program, the Bank of England paid substantial premiums over prevailing market prices in several of its long-dated gilt purchase operations as a result of the reluctance of long-term investors—namely, pension funds and insurers—to part with their longer-dated gilt holdings.	61.0	999.0
201609	172	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The operations have been very effective in bringing down long-dated gilt yields, which declined by as many as 40 basis points following the program announcement and the initial rounds of purchases.	61.0	999.0
201609	173	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Investment-grade corporate bond spreads also narrowed 25 basis points in the days following the announcement.	61.0	999.0
201609	174	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Overall, the market reaction to this package has been encouraging, as it suggests no decline in the efficiency of central bank asset purchases in lowering sovereign and private yields.	61.0	999.0
201609	175	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	In July, the Bank of Japan introduced a limited set of additional easing measures and announced that it would undertake a “comprehensive assessment” of the effect of its current monetary easing programs, sparking speculation among market participants as to whether the Bank of Japan is nearing operational limits in its current policies.	61.0	999.0
201609	176	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The results of the comprehensive assessment will be announced overnight.	61.0	999.0
201609	177	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Market expectations are dispersed, with a lack of conviction on the next policy move by the Bank of Japan.	61.0	999.0
201609	178	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The ECB’s actions at its meeting earlier this month were interpreted as less accommodative than expected.	61.0	999.0
201609	179	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The ECB left its asset purchase programs unchanged and stated that it did not discuss extending the program beyond the current stated time frame of “March 2017 or beyond,” versus expectations that an explicit extension might be forthcoming.	61.0	999.0
201609	180	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	There was also speculation that the ECB would adjust the parameters of the program to address self-imposed constraints in its existing program, which it did not do, though President Draghi did say that it was investigating the issue.	61.0	999.0
201609	181	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Paul will discuss these foreign central developments further in his briefing.	61.0	999.0
201609	182	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Amid these actions and communications, the yen and euro strengthened by 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively, against the US dollar over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201609	183	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Sovereign yield curves also steepened, with 30-year Japanese bond yields higher by about 30 basis points and the German 30-year bond yields higher by around 20 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201609	184	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-right panel, long-dated sovereign yields in the United States increased roughly 20 basis points as well, with contacts primarily pointing to effects from foreign developments, especially the ECB meeting.	61.0	999.0
201609	185	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Partly as a result of this steepening in sovereign yield curves, global bank stock prices outperformed over the period, as shown in the top-left panel of your second exhibit.	61.0	999.0
201609	186	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Recall that, at the beginning of the year, bank stocks had declined notably after advanced foreign economy central banks introduced new easing measures, including negative rates from the BOJ and further rate cuts into negative territory by the ECB.	61.0	999.0
201609	187	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The outperformance of bank stocks over the period came amid perceptions that some foreign central banks are trying to address the adverse effect their easing policies may have on financial institutions’ profitability.	61.0	999.0
201609	188	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Market commentary has recently speculated that the Bank of Japan may aim to steepen the Japanese yield curve in order to reduce any adverse effect on financial institutions.	61.0	999.0
201609	189	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Meanwhile, the Bank of England introduced the Term Funding Scheme, which is similar in many ways to the ECB’s TLTROs in providing cheap term funding to banks to facilitate the pass-through of rate cuts to borrowers.	61.0	999.0
201609	190	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Market participants also highlighted the outperformance over the period of certain fixed-income assets, shown in the top-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201609	191	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The outperformance was reportedly fueled by ongoing “reach-for-yield” behavior among long-term investors, driven to a large extent by continued portfolio rebalancing induced by large asset purchase programs.	61.0	999.0
201609	192	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	As emerging markets witnessed increased investor inflows, their bond spreads to Treasury equivalents tightened, despite some recent volatility.	61.0	999.0
201609	193	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Meanwhile, high-yield credit spreads fell to their narrowest levels year-to-date, and MBS option-adjusted spreads narrowed amid reportedly strong demand from foreign investors.	61.0	999.0
201609	194	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Contacts have noted that low levels of volatility earlier in the period were especially supportive of the “reach-for-yield” behavior that led to these assets’ appreciation, on net, over the period despite the recent steepening of advanced- economy yield curves.	61.0	999.0
201609	195	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Measures of option-implied volatility across equities, rates, and currencies reached their year-to-date lows in August.	61.0	999.0
201609	196	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle- left panel, implied volatilities for equities, the blue line, and for both short- and long- term rates, the red and gray lines, were roughly one standard deviation below their long-term averages for much of the period before an increase in market volatility that followed the ECB’s decision.	61.0	999.0
201609	197	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	In the Desk’s most recent surveys, respondents were asked to rate the importance of various factors in explaining the recent low levels of implied volatility through the first week of September.	61.0	999.0
201609	198	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-right panel, the most importance, on average, was placed on advanced foreign economy central bank communication and action, followed by Federal Reserve communication and action.	61.0	999.0
201609	199	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	While the PBOC’s FX policy was generally viewed as consistent and predictable over the period, Desk survey respondents did not rate emerging market central bank actions as an important factor behind the low levels of cross-asset volatility.	61.0	999.0
201609	200	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-left panel, over the intermeeting period, the renminbi was little changed against the dollar, though on a trade-weighted basis the renminbi did depreciate roughly 1 percent, and market participants expect further depreciation.	61.0	999.0
201609	201	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	The recent stability of the Chinese currency might reflect the PBOC’s desire for a smooth introduction of the renminbi into the SDR on October 1.	61.0	999.0
201609	202	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Survey respondents also did not assign much importance to reduced political uncertainty globally as contributing to low implied volatility, with a few respondents suggesting that political developments may, in fact, be adding volatility.	61.0	999.0
201609	203	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	One source of political uncertainty noted by market participants is the upcoming US election, although so far the only substantive market effect has been on the Mexican peso.	61.0	999.0
201609	204	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-right panel, three-month option-implied volatility on the peso– US dollar exchange rate increased sharply when the November US election date rolled into the option window, and more recent increases in implied volatility have been attributed in part to higher uncertainty over the US election.	61.0	999.0
201609	205	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Specifically, market participants have noted downside risk to US–Mexico trade and economic linkages related to the election outcome, including the potential for trade barriers and restrictions on remittances from the United States to Mexico.	61.0	999.0
201609	206	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	Lorie will continue.	61.0	999.0
201609	207	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	In exhibits 3 and 4, I’ll cover money markets and Desk operations.	61.0	999.0
201609	208	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The major focus in money markets this period continued to be the upcoming implementation of the SEC money market mutual fund reform measures on October 14, both in terms of its effect on market conditions and potential implications for Federal Reserve operations.	61.0	999.0
201609	209	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel of your third exhibit, more than $800 billion in assets under management has left prime and tax-exempt money market funds since October of last year, reflecting conversions and closures of funds undertaken by asset managers as well as investor redemptions.	61.0	999.0
201609	210	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The vast majority of this outflow has been reallocated to government funds, leaving overall money fund AUM relatively little changed.	61.0	999.0
201609	211	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Prime fund managers remain highly uncertain about additional outflows, which have picked up recently, averaging about $46 billion per week in September versus $24 billion per week in July and August.	61.0	999.0
201609	212	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	In a Desk survey of money fund managers conducted earlier this month, the average expectation for total prime fund outflows from the end of July to mid-October was more than $500 billion, shown in the left- hand column of your top-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201609	213	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	If fully realized, this would leave prime fund AUM at approximately one-third the size of a year ago.	61.0	999.0
201609	214	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Consistent with trends seen to date, market participants anticipate that most of the outflows will continue to be allocated to government funds.	61.0	999.0
201609	215	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Survey respondents’ expectations for the investments of these inflows are shown in the right-hand column.	61.0	999.0
201609	216	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	While a majority of the inflows are expected to be invested in government securities and private repo, around $100 billion is anticipated to initially be invested in Federal Reserve ON RRPs, the light blue area in the chart.	61.0	999.0
201609	217	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-left panel, usage of the ON RRP facility increased modestly over the period, with much of this increase coming from government funds.	61.0	999.0
201609	218	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	However, their usage of the overnight RRP facility as a proportion of their overall AUM remains little changed.	61.0	999.0
201609	219	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants have suggested that we could see a particularly notable increase in overnight RRP usage around the September quarter- end, and that the increase may persist a bit longer than normal,due to the combination of money fund reform–related flows and quarter-end balance sheet adjustments.	61.0	999.0
201609	220	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The middle-right panel shows that prime funds have been reducing the weighted- average maturity of their holdings in preparation for additional outflows.	61.0	999.0
201609	221	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Industry WAMs, shown in red, are already at multiyear lows and are widely expected to fall further.	61.0	999.0
201609	222	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The decline in both WAMs and AUM has led to a sharp decline in prime funds’ holdings of CP and time deposits, shown in blue.	61.0	999.0
201609	223	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	This reduction in term lending from prime money funds has had a material effect on the cost of term funding.	61.0	999.0
201609	224	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the bottom-left panel, the three-month LIBOR–OIS spread—a common measure of bank funding pressure—has widened since late last year to around 42 basis points, a level last seen during the 2011 European sovereign debt and banking crisis.	61.0	999.0
201609	225	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Rates on certificates of deposit and financial CP have risen by similar amounts to LIBOR, and rates on short-dated U.S interest rate swaps, which settle to three-month LIBOR, have increased.	61.0	999.0
201609	226	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	In the municipal debt market, short-term yields have also increased notably as outflows from tax-exempt money funds that invest in short-term municipal securities have accelerated.	61.0	999.0
201609	227	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	With prime money fund AUMs and WAMs expected to decline further, both survey- and market-implied measures point to a modest further widening in LIBOR– OIS spreads as the implementation date approaches.	61.0	999.0
201609	228	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	By early December, however, the spread is expected to narrow.	61.0	999.0
201609	229	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The expected narrowing could result from prime funds extending their WAMs amid reduced uncertainty about further outflows and from lending in somewhat larger sizes if AUMs rebound modestly.	61.0	999.0
201609	230	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	However, the cost of borrowing from prime funds—as reflected in LIBOR, CP, and CD rates—will likely remain elevated by historical standards because prime fund investors are expected to require relatively higher returns to invest in those funds following the implementation of reform.	61.0	999.0
201609	231	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The adjustments in pricing and issuance of financial CP and CDs, while notable, have been relatively smooth, without disruptions in funding to issuers.	61.0	999.0
201609	232	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	However, market participants note some unease that there could be more abrupt liquidity needs as the reform implementation date approaches.	61.0	999.0
201609	233	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The bottom-right panel shows upcoming weekly maturities of financial CP and CDs with tenors from one month to one year, broken out by the domicile of the issuer.	61.0	999.0
201609	234	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The countries highlighted in the chart represent the top four in terms of the volume of CP maturing between now and October 14, and cumulatively they make up over half of the roughly $350 billion maturing over that period.	61.0	999.0
201609	235	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	These maturities will likely necessitate further changes in issuers’ funding profiles through a combination of paying higher rates to reissue or shifts to alternative funding sources.	61.0	999.0
201609	236	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants have been particularly focused on the funding and liquidity profiles of Japanese banks, shown in red, as their reliance on CP and CD issuance to US money funds for dollar funding remains large relative to other countries.	61.0	999.0
201609	237	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Concerns over the effect of US money fund reform on Japanese banks’ US dollar funding have contributed to the continued upward pressure on the US dollar– yen swap basis, shown as the dark blue line in the top-left panel of your final exhibit.	61.0	999.0
201609	238	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Recall that the basis indicates the implied cost of borrowing US dollars offshore through the foreign exchange market, above what it would cost to borrow dollars directly at US dollar LIBOR.	61.0	999.0
201609	239	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Contacts expect the basis could widen further around the September quarter-end and as the money fund reform implementation date approaches because Japanese banks may need to seek dollar funding through alternative sources.	61.0	999.0
201609	240	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	This is important to note because, as we have observed, if the implied average cost of US dollar funding materially exceeds the costs on foreign central banks’ dollar liquidity operations, draws of the swap lines may increase.	61.0	999.0
201609	241	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Despite these sizable effects across money markets, money fund reform has not had a notable effect on overnight secured or unsecured interest rates.	61.0	999.0
201609	242	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-right panel, these rates remained within ranges seen over recent months.	61.0	999.0
201609	243	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The effective federal funds rate averaged 40 basis points this period, which is unchanged from last period’s average.	61.0	999.0
201609	244	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Shifting to the SOMA portfolio, reinvestment operations continue to be executed smoothly, in line with the Committee’s reinvestment policy.	61.0	999.0
201609	245	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle- left panel, monthly reinvestment purchases of agency MBS have been increasing, driven primarily by the ongoing low level of interest rates and a resulting pickup in refinancing activity.	61.0	999.0
201609	246	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The Desk expects to conduct around $46 billion of MBS reinvestment purchases in September, which would be the largest monthly reinvestment amount to date.	61.0	999.0
201609	247	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Finally, in light of the Committee’s approval of the Foreign Authorization documents and the pending instructions from the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, we plan to implement the new investment framework we discussed at the April FOMC meeting.	61.0	999.0
201609	248	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	As you may recall from that discussion, the Desk undertook a strategic review of the foreign reserves management framework, as our overall approach had not been formally reviewed for about a decade.	61.0	999.0
201609	249	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The negative interest rate environment in the euro area and Japan, which has resulted in negative total income on the foreign portfolio in recent months, also reinforced the need to revisit our approach.	61.0	999.0
201609	250	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The new framework, summarized in the middle-right panel, involves a more explicit process for assessing policymakers’ investment preferences and uses a mean-variance optimization approach to establish a benchmark portfolio for asset allocation.	61.0	999.0
201609	251	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	With the new benchmark, the Desk would begin a three-month process of reinvesting maturing proceeds to match the new asset allocation, which will result in an increase in cash and a more modest increase in longer-term securities in the euro portfolio.	61.0	999.0
201609	252	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Eligible securities for investment will now include Dutch sovereign securities in addition to French and German sovereign debt.	61.0	999.0
201609	253	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	For the yen portfolio,as we still receive a zero interest rate on deposits with the Bank of Japan, we will leave maturing proceeds from securities holdings on deposit with the BOJ for the time being.	61.0	999.0
201609	254	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	However,in view of the dynamic nature of policy in Japan, it’s possible that changes to our approach for the yen portfolio may be required; we will seek instruction from the Subcommittee, in consultation with the Committee, if we need to adjust.	61.0	999.0
201609	255	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	We plan to update the Committee at the next meeting on the status of the implementation and provide quarterly updates on the portfolio thereafter.	61.0	999.0
201609	256	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	As usual, your appendix contains a summary of operational tests performed over the intermeeting period and those planned during the next period.	61.0	999.0
201609	257	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	Susan McLaughlin will now continue the presentation, focusing on the proposed Desk counterparty policy.	61.0	999.0
201609	258	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Thank you, Lorie.	61.0	999.0
201609	259	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	I’ll be referring to the exhibit titled “Proposed Counterparty Policy.”	61.0	999.0
201609	260	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	The staff is seeking your concurrence with a new counterparty policy that we propose to publish on the FRBNY’s website in early November.	61.0	999.0
201609	261	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	The policy documents, in draft form, can be found in the appendixes of the memo that we sent to you last week.	61.0	999.0
201609	262	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	The new policy represents the culmination of a multiyear project conducted by FRBNY and Board staff to strengthen and improve the FRBNY’s framework for managing counterparties for market operations.	61.0	999.0
201609	263	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	The staff also consulted with the staff in the Treasury’s Office of Domestic Finance,on account of the role that primary dealers play in Treasury auctions, as well as the staff in the Treasury’s Office of International Affairs,on account of their reliance on the FRBNY’s foreign exchange/reserve management counterparties for Exchange Stabilization Fund, or ESF, operations.	61.0	999.0
201609	264	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	The review identified a number of improvements that could be made to the FRBNY’s counterparty framework.	61.0	999.0
201609	265	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Last year, the FRBNY implemented the first set of improvements from the review by establishing a single, consistent set of internal management practices and processes with regard to all Desk counterparties.	61.0	999.0
201609	266	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	We are coming back to you now to seek your concurrence with the second set of improvements to the FRBNY’s public documentation on counterparties.	61.0	999.0
201609	267	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	The proposed new policy consolidates the administration and respective expectations of all counterparty types for SOMA operations and for ESF and Treasury auctions that the FRBNY conducts for the Treasury as fiscal agent.	61.0	999.0
201609	268	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	This consolidated format clarifies for the public the overarching framework within which all counterparties for market operations are managed and highlights common themes.	61.0	999.0
201609	269	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	It may also help moderate the perception that primary dealers are special in some way by showing how they are similar to other types of counterparties and the various obligations they assume.	61.0	999.0
201609	270	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	As panel 1 in your exhibit shows, the FRBNY is currently more transparent about its counterparties for open market operations than those for foreign market operations.	61.0	999.0
201609	271	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	We propose to eliminate this inconsistency by expanding the set of information we provide on foreign operations counterparties in two ways.	61.0	999.0
201609	272	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	First, for the first time, we will publish the lists of our FX and foreign reserves counterparties, just as we do today for primary dealers and reverse repo counterparties.	61.0	999.0
201609	273	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	And, second, we will add information on expectations and eligibility criteria for foreign reserve management counterparties to what we already publish for other types of counterparties.	61.0	999.0
201609	274	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	The FRBNY relies on primary dealers not only for the conduct of open market operations, but also to ensure robust coverage of Treasury auctions of new securities.	61.0	999.0
201609	275	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	We propose three changes to the eligibility criteria for primary dealers that will modestly expand the pool of regulated banks and broker-dealers eligible to become primary dealers in an effort to augment operational capacity.	61.0	999.0
201609	276	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	These changes are summarized in panel 2.	61.0	999.0
201609	277	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	First, we would reduce the Federal Reserve’s minimum net regulatory capital, or NRC, threshold for broker-dealers to $50 million from the current $150 million level.	61.0	999.0
201609	278	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Second, we would increase the minimum Tier 1 capital threshold to $1 billion to better align and scale it for the new NRC threshold.	61.0	999.0
201609	279	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Third, we would establish a 0.25 percent Treasury market share threshold to accompany the new minimum capital thresholds.	61.0	999.0
201609	280	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	I would note that reducing the minimum NRC threshold to $50 million is likely to have a fairly modest effect on the number of primary dealers in the near term, as shown in panel 3.	61.0	999.0
201609	281	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Our impact analysis was based on an examination of the 168 broker-dealers that are registered with the SEC, had NRC in excess of $50 million as of year-end 2014, and are not already primary dealers.	61.0	999.0
201609	282	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Of those 168, only 25 appeared to act as market makers in Treasury securities.	61.0	999.0
201609	283	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	And 13 of these 25 firms already had NRC in excess of the current $150 million threshold, leaving only 12 additional dealers that would become eligible to apply at the new $50 million NRC threshold.	61.0	999.0
201609	284	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	I would also like to clarify why we are proposing to increase the minimum Tier 1 capital threshold for banking organizations with subsidiaries or branches as primary dealers to $1 billion from the current level of $150 million as we reduce the minimum NRC threshold.	61.0	999.0
201609	285	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	While NRC is a net measure of capital at the broker-dealer subsidiary level, Tier 1 is a measure of capital supporting all operations of a holding company; the two measures are not equivalent.	61.0	999.0
201609	286	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	In trying to ascertain the level of Tier 1 capital that is analogous to NRC, we looked at the Tier 1 and NRC levels of current primary dealers and found that they differ widely with respect to the scale and scope of businesses their Tier 1 capital supports.	61.0	999.0
201609	287	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	In the absence of a clear relationship between NRC and Tier 1 capital, the staff judged that $1 billion was a reasonable complement to the new NRC threshold proposed.	61.0	999.0
201609	288	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Like the NRC threshold, the Tier 1 threshold is a gating mechanism rather than a mitigant of counterparty credit risk.	61.0	999.0
201609	289	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Finally, we plan to establish a 0.25 percent Treasury market share threshold for primary dealers in order to better gauge new applicants’ ability to meet our transaction needs.	61.0	999.0
201609	290	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	As shown in panel 4, Treasury market share has in the past been used as a gauge of primary dealer capabilities.	61.0	999.0
201609	291	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	You may recall that between 2013 and 2015, the Desk conducted two yearlong pilot programs with small firms, first as participants in our Treasury purchase operations and then as participants in our MBS purchase operations.	61.0	999.0
201609	292	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Our experiences with these pilots suggest that having an explicit, quantifiable criterion like market share may become more important as we consider applications from smaller firms.	61.0	999.0
201609	293	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	We selected the 0.25 percent threshold on the basis of Treasury market share data received from a number of primary dealer applicants and Treasury pilot applicants over the 2010–14 period; these data are summarized in panel 5.	61.0	999.0
201609	294	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Expanding the pool of applicants to some smaller firms will require a few changes to our processes for monitoring counterparty credit risk.	61.0	999.0
201609	295	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Currently, most primary dealers are affiliated with or are branches of publicly traded banks or other publicly traded companies, and FRBNY has access to a range of market-based and supervisory or regulatory information to use in monitoring them.	61.0	999.0
201609	296	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	The others are affiliated with companies that issue debt in the capital markets and are thus subject to SEC filing requirements and rating agency analysis that FRBNY uses in its monitoring process.	61.0	999.0
201609	297	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Because firms with NRC below $150 million are unlikely to have either of these characteristics, much of the information on which FRBNY currently relies will not be available in the case of these firms.	61.0	999.0
201609	298	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	FRBNY will develop an equivalent monitoring process that is appropriate for these firms before taking any new applicants on board.	61.0	999.0
201609	299	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	The staff would appreciate any feedback, either now or in the coming weeks, that you may have on the policy materials.	61.0	999.0
201609	300	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	If the Committee is generally supportive of the approach, we plan to publish the documents on November 9 after incorporating any comments.	61.0	999.0
201609	301	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201609	302	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	That concludes our prepared remarks.	61.0	999.0
201609	303	2016-09-21	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	We’d be happy to respond to your questions.	61.0	999.0
201609	304	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Any questions for the presenters?	62.0	65.0
201609	305	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	62.0	65.0
201609	306	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	I had a question for Lorie on the reinvestment purchases.	62.0	103.0
201609	307	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	At one point, the expectations were that we would cease reinvestments when we’d get to a federal funds rate of 1 to 1¼ percent.	62.0	103.0
201609	308	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Are those expectations of when people expect us to cease reinvestments moving at all relative to expectations for the funds rate, and how would they compare with our own?	62.0	103.0
201609	309	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	The reinvestment expectations in the policy survey are adjusting to changes in expectations for the rate level, so they’ve been consistently moving out as expectations of the path of policy have moved out.	62.0	999.0
201609	310	2016-09-21	meeting	LOGAN	That relationship has stayed fairly stable.	62.0	999.0
201609	311	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	So with our projections coming out, they are likely to change.	62.0	103.0
201609	312	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	So 1⅜ is the median estimate of where the federal funds rate will be.	62.0	999.0
201609	313	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	62.0	103.0
201609	314	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Any further questions?	62.0	65.0
201609	315	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	We do not need a vote on the new counterparty policy, but I would like to see whether there is general support for the Desk to go ahead with the plans as we’ve discussed.	63.0	65.0
201609	316	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	63.0	108.0
201609	317	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes.	63.0	96.0
201609	318	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63.0	65.0
201609	319	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	You have general support.	63.0	65.0
201609	320	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	And I do need a vote to ratify domestic open market operations.	63.0	65.0
201609	321	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So moved.	63.0	96.0
201609	322	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	63.0	65.0
201609	323	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	63.0	65.0
201609	324	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	We’re ready to move along to the economic and financial briefings, and David Wilcox is going to start us off.	11.0	65.0
201609	325	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11.0	999.0
201609	326	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I will be referring to the packet titled “The US Outlook.”	11.0	999.0
201609	327	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The staff economic projection is not much revised since our assessment in either June, which is the last time you provided forecasts for the SEP, or compared with July, so I’ll summarize the current economic situation with greater brevity than usual and will then make the briefing longer than usual overall by reviewing in some detail the comparative labor market experience of blacks, Hispanics, and whites over the past couple of decades.	11.0	999.0
201609	328	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Real GDP growth during the first half of this year is currently estimated to have been noticeably weaker than we anticipated in July, but a shortfall in inventory investment below our expectations more than accounted for the downside surprise.	11.0	999.0
201609	329	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The growth of private domestic final purchases during the first half of the year was, according to current estimates, as strong as we had expected.	11.0	999.0
201609	330	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As shown in panel 1, the available indicators as seen through the lens of the various nowcasting models in operation around the System suggest that real GDP growth has rebounded in the current quarter, a view with which we concur.	11.0	999.0
201609	331	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Indeed, as you will see from the path of the black line, our judgmental assessment is that the rebound has been a little stronger than we anticipated at the time of the July meeting, even taking on board last Thursday’s slightly disappointing retail sales release.	11.0	999.0
201609	332	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Our forecast of real GDP growth over the year as a whole is now unrevised from the July Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201609	333	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from panel 2, our September Tealbook forecast of real GDP growth over the medium term is just a shade weaker than the one we had in July, largely because we trimmed our assumption for potential GDP growth and let that show through to actual GDP.	11.0	999.0
201609	334	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Overall, the picture remains one of steady growth, modestly faster than the growth of potential GDP and slowing slightly toward the end of the projection period as the normalization of monetary policy takes firmer hold and discretionary fiscal policy actions add a little less to the growth of demand.	11.0	999.0
201609	335	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As shown in panel 3, we estimate that the output gap has essentially closed—an assessment very much in line with the range of four models that we track and that produce their own independent estimates of an output gap.	11.0	999.0
201609	336	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Over the medium term, we expect that output will move above its potential, with the differential reaching about 1½ percent of potential GDP by the end of 2018.	11.0	999.0
201609	337	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As a result, the unemployment rate, shown to the right, continues to drift down, reaching a low of 4¼ percent in 2019.	11.0	999.0
201609	338	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As shown in the bottom two panels, the outlook for inflation is also essentially unrevised.	11.0	999.0
201609	339	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The most noteworthy development here since the July meeting is that we’ve received some hard data corroborating our earlier expectation that core inflation would step down in the second half of the year.	11.0	999.0
201609	340	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	We had expected a combination of residual seasonality and the absence of elevated readings in a few idiosyncratic categories to bring core quarterly inflation down into the neighborhood of 1¼ to 1½ percent in the second half of this year, and that reduction seems to be in train—an assessment that survived the publication late last week of the PPI and CPI for August.	11.0	999.0
201609	341	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As shown in panel 7 on the next page, our forecast for top-line PCE inflation this year is unrevised, on net, since December of last year when you first raised the funds rate 25 basis points, reflecting a fortuitous counterbalancing of weaker-than-expected food prices against stronger-than-expected core inflation.	11.0	999.0
201609	342	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As shown to the right, we parse the changes in core inflation into the yellow box for “other” price inflation in 2016.	11.0	999.0
201609	343	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Inflation mavens will recall that there were some price spikes early in the year in categories such as jewelry, apparel, and nonmarket prices—categories that historically have not had much signal value for future inflation.	11.0	999.0
201609	344	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Thus far, the call not to carry any of those higher readings forward into the second half appears to have been the right one.	11.0	999.0
201609	345	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	In 2017 and 2018, a variety of very small factors have caused us to trim a cumulative 0.1 percentage point per year out of our projection.	11.0	999.0
201609	346	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The most easily identifiable of these factors is that, back in March, we took down our assumption for the underlying pace of inflation this year 5 basis points.	11.0	999.0
201609	347	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I will now turn to reviewing the comparative labor market outcomes of blacks or African Americans, Hispanics or Latinos, and whites over the past couple of decades.	11.0	999.0
201609	348	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	A high-level summary is that overall labor market conditions have continued to improve over the past several years, and that this improvement has generally been broadly shared across major racial and ethnic groups.	11.0	999.0
201609	349	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	In relative terms, conditions on at least some dimensions have been improving more rapidly of late for African Americans and Hispanics than for whites.	11.0	999.0
201609	350	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	However, in absolute terms, labor market conditions remain notably worse for African Americans and Hispanics.	11.0	999.0
201609	351	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The following three panels illustrate the overall improvement in labor market conditions.	11.0	999.0
201609	352	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As shown by the black dashed line in panel 9, the national average U-3 unemployment rate has continued to trend down in recent years, and, as shown by the other lines, this is true for blacks and Hispanics as well as for whites.	11.0	999.0
201609	353	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As shown in panel 10, the broader U-6 measure has also generally continued to trend downward, though progress on this measure appears to have been more uneven in recent months for blacks and Hispanics.	11.0	999.0
201609	354	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Panel 11 shows employment-to- population ratios for these same groups, focusing here on persons between the ages of 25 and 54 in order to limit the influence of the marked differences in age structure across racial and ethnic groups.	11.0	999.0
201609	355	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The EPOPs for all groups have trended up over the past several years, with the EPOP for blacks or African Americans making especially notable gains after having suffered especially severely during the Great Recession and having lagged the recovery experienced by other groups.	11.0	999.0
201609	356	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Thus, the labor market experience of Hispanics and African Americans has improved considerably during the past few years.	11.0	999.0
201609	357	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	That said, it remains notably worse in many respects than the labor market experience of whites.	11.0	999.0
201609	358	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Starting with the most obvious fact to illustrate this point, the unemployment rates for blacks and Hispanics remain much higher than that for whites.	11.0	999.0
201609	359	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	For example, 8.7 percent, on average, for blacks over the 12 months ending in August, 5.9 percent for Hispanics, and 4.4 percent for whites.	11.0	999.0
201609	360	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Moreover, panel 12 on your next page shows that, at every age, unemployment rates are higher for blacks and Hispanics than they are for whites.	11.0	999.0
201609	361	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Similarly, panel 13 shows that, with only one exception, unemployment rates for blacks and Hispanics at every level of educational attainment are higher than they are for whites of the same educational attainment.	11.0	999.0
201609	362	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	An especially sobering take on the relative experience of blacks or African Americans compared with whites is revealed by comparing unemployment rates across levels of educational attainment.	11.0	999.0
201609	363	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Remaining in panel 13, for example, comparing the blue bar in the rightmost cluster with the green bar just to the left, we see that during the 12 months ending in August, blacks with a bachelor’s degree or more experienced unemployment at the same 4.2 percent rate as whites with only some college or an associate’s degree.	11.0	999.0
201609	364	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Moving to the left, blacks with some college education but not a bachelor’s degree experienced a higher unemployment rate than did whites with only a high school degree.	11.0	999.0
201609	365	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	And blacks with a high school degree experienced more unemployment than did white high school dropouts.	11.0	999.0
201609	366	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Another aspect of the labor market reality of blacks and Hispanics over the past two decades has been that they have tended to experience a “high beta” version of the unemployment variation of whites.	11.0	999.0
201609	367	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Panel 14 on the next page provides a scatter plot of the unemployment rate for blacks, plotted against the y-axis, against the unemployment rate for whites, plotted against the x-axis.	11.0	999.0
201609	368	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The red dots show unemployment rates from 1994 through 2007, while the blue dots show rates since the beginning of 2011.	11.0	999.0
201609	369	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from the red trend line for the early dots, a 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate for whites before the Great Recession was associated with a 1.8 percentage point increase in the rate for blacks.	11.0	999.0
201609	370	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The bad news is that nothing has changed more recently:  As shown by the trend line for the blue dots, exactly the same relationship holds in the more recent period.	11.0	999.0
201609	371	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The good news, to the extent there is any here, is that this high-beta relationship implies that unemployment rates have been coming down more rapidly for blacks lately than for whites.	11.0	999.0
201609	372	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Panel 15 provides a similar comparison of Hispanic unemployment rates to white unemployment rates.	11.0	999.0
201609	373	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	In this case, and viewed through this simple lens without controlling for other workforce characteristics, there seems to have been some convergence in unemployment experience from the 1990s compared with more recently.	11.0	999.0
201609	374	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As denoted by the red dots, the multiplier for the Hispanic rate during the 1990s was more than 2, and the level of rates was consistently higher.	11.0	999.0
201609	375	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Since the turn of the century, the level of the relationship seems to have rotated downward, but still, the multiplier for Hispanics during the past decade and a half has run in the neighborhood of about 1½.	11.0	999.0
201609	376	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	An obvious question is what the underlying cause of this high-beta experience of blacks and Hispanics might be.	11.0	999.0
201609	377	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	One prominent author has suggested that much of the high-beta experience of blacks and Hispanics can be attributed to the disproportionate employment of blacks and Hispanics in the highly cyclical manufacturing and construction industries.	11.0	999.0
201609	378	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Another prominent author has attributed the phenomenon to discrimination.	11.0	999.0
201609	379	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	A third possibility is that it might reflect different age structures or levels of educational attainment across racial and ethnic groups.	11.0	999.0
201609	380	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	To shed light on the plausibility of differing educational attainments as an explanation for the high-beta experience of blacks and Hispanics, I stratified the earlier scatter plots by level of educational attainment.	11.0	999.0
201609	381	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The four panels on your next page show the results for blacks.	11.0	999.0
201609	382	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	For example, the panel in the upper left compares the unemployment experience of blacks with less than a high school degree with that of whites with the same educational attainment.	11.0	999.0
201609	383	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see, the multiplier in this educational group has averaged 1.7.	11.0	999.0
201609	384	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The remaining panels perform the same exercise for successively higher levels of attainment.	11.0	999.0
201609	385	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The counterintuitive result here is that there is no attenuation of the high-beta experience as education goes up: Even for blacks with a college degree, if the unemployment rate of their white counterparts goes up 1 percentage point, their own unemployment rate goes up 1.8 percentage points on average.	11.0	999.0
201609	386	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The data point furthest to the northeast in this panel—that is, the lower-right panel—is for 2011: In that year, the unemployment rate for whites with a BA or more peaked at 3.9 percent, while the rate for their black counterparts hit 7.1 percent.	11.0	999.0
201609	387	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Your next page presents the analogous results for Hispanics, limiting the sample to 2002 and forward.	11.0	999.0
201609	388	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	In this case, the results differ much more across levels of educational attainment.	11.0	999.0
201609	389	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	In particular, there’s no significant difference between the cyclicality of unemployment of Hispanics and whites who have less than a high school degree (the top-left panel) and a notably smaller difference in the case of those who have a high school degree (shown in the top right).	11.0	999.0
201609	390	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	On the other hand, the unemployment beta for Hispanics who have some college education (in the bottom left) is about 1.3, and the beta for those having a bachelor’s degree or more (in the bottom right) is actually a little higher than in the aggregate.	11.0	999.0
201609	391	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	This investigation is far from providing a complete answer to the question of why the black and Hispanic unemployment rates historically have behaved like an amplified version of the white unemployment rate.	11.0	999.0
201609	392	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	But it suggests to me that even if disproportionate employment in manufacturing and construction is part of the explanation for the high-beta experience of blacks and Hispanics, more may be going on.	11.0	999.0
201609	393	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	In particular, I am struck by the fact that, at least in the case of African Americans, the high-beta behavior manifests at all levels of educational attainment, including among those with a college degree or more.	11.0	999.0
201609	394	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	But, for sure, more work needs to be done here.	11.0	999.0
201609	395	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Before closing, let me briefly note that blacks and Hispanics have worse labor market experiences in other dimensions as well, aside from unemployment.	11.0	999.0
201609	396	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	To give two quick illustrations: As shown in panel 18, blacks and Hispanics report experiencing involuntary part-time employment for economic reasons at considerably higher rates than do whites.	11.0	999.0
201609	397	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	And, as shown in panel 19, blacks experience longer spells of unemployment than do whites.	11.0	999.0
201609	398	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	You can see this latter result by noting that relatively less of black unemployment relative to white unemployment is accounted for in short-duration spells, to the left of the graph, whereas relatively more of black unemployment is taken up in long-duration spells, to the right of the graph.	11.0	999.0
201609	399	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	And I haven’t even touched on the issue of wage equity across racial and ethnic groups.	11.0	999.0
201609	400	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The bottom line that I take away is this:  Much progress has been made in recent years in overall labor market conditions.	11.0	999.0
201609	401	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Moreover, in relative terms, blacks and Hispanics have gained disproportionately during the past few years.	11.0	999.0
201609	402	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	However, in absolute terms, the differences across groups remain large and disturbing.	11.0	999.0
201609	403	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Much more work remains to be done about why this is so and what can be done about it.	11.0	999.0
201609	404	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Paul will carry on with our briefing.	11.0	999.0
201609	405	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201609	406	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	This has been a relatively quiet round for international developments.	11.0	999.0
201609	407	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Global financial and commodity market settings have not moved much since your previous meeting, and, similarly, the outlook for foreign growth and inflation is little changed from what we presented in the July Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201609	408	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Moreover, the hubbub over Brexit has died down for now, with financial markets continuing to recover from the initial declines and economic data showing less near- term effect on the UK and euro-area economies than originally feared.	11.0	999.0
201609	409	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In the July Tealbook, we had based our estimates of Brexit effects on measures of economic uncertainty (panel 1) and related financial stress.	11.0	999.0
201609	410	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Although those measures initially spiked, they have come down considerably.	11.0	999.0
201609	411	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	However, we still expect negotiations between UK and EU authorities over their future trade relationship will be a source of uncertainty that will weigh on both economies during the forecast period.	11.0	999.0
201609	412	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In addition, we expect some drag on UK economic growth from the long-run effects of reduced trade and integration with the rest of Europe.	11.0	999.0
201609	413	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	For the overall foreign economy, the second-quarter pothole in GDP growth was even larger than expected, mostly because temporary factors weighed heavily on the output of our North American trading partners.	11.0	999.0
201609	414	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In Canada, oil production was disrupted by wildfires in May but started to recover by June.	11.0	999.0
201609	415	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In Mexico, economic growth suffered in part from weakness in US industrial production.	11.0	999.0
201609	416	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	However, foreign growth excluding Mexico and Canada (the red line in panel 2) held up better in the second quarter.	11.0	999.0
201609	417	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	With those two countries bouncing back, total foreign growth should recover to around 2½ percent in the second half and stay near that rate through the forecast period.	11.0	999.0
201609	418	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	As shown in panel 3, in most advanced foreign economies, inflation on a four- quarter basis remains near zero, partly because of past declines in energy prices.	11.0	999.0
201609	419	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	With oil prices stabilizing, we see a rebound in headline inflation over the next year, but even by the end of 2019 we project inflation at only 1½ percent in the euro area and 1 percent in Japan.	11.0	999.0
201609	420	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	The sharp sterling depreciation following the Brexit vote is expected to push UK inflation above 2 percent next year, but the Bank of England has said it will “look through” that rise as it counteracts some of the real effects of the Brexit shock.	11.0	999.0
201609	421	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	As Simon discussed, the Bank of England provided further stimulus in early August.	11.0	999.0
201609	422	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In contrast, the ECB held off on easing at its recent meeting, and the Bank of Japan announced only modest further stimulus in late July, even though inflation in those economies remains well below target and long-term inflation compensation (panel 4) is low.	11.0	999.0
201609	423	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In the euro area, it has declined in recent years from around 2½ percent to less than 1½ percent.	11.0	999.0
201609	424	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Japanese inflation compensation was boosted by Abenomics in 2013, rising as yen depreciation spurred actual inflation, but it has fallen back to near zero.	11.0	999.0
201609	425	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Amid questions on why its stimulus has failed to durably raise inflation, the Bank of Japan is undertaking a “comprehensive assessment” of its unconventional policies to be released tonight following its policy meeting.	11.0	999.0
201609	426	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	More generally, foreign central banks are grappling with the effectiveness of further stimulus and what form it should take.	11.0	999.0
201609	427	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	The asset purchases and negative policy rates pursued by the ECB and Bank of Japan have provided stimulus, including through reduced domestic borrowing rates.	11.0	999.0
201609	428	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	As seen in panel 5, since the ECB took its deposit rate negative in mid-2014 and began large-scale sovereign bond purchases in early 2015, interest rates on loans to nonfinancial corporations have declined significantly in the core euro-area economies and even more sharply in the periphery.	11.0	999.0
201609	429	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Yield curves in the euro area and Japan (panel 6) also have shifted down and flattened.	11.0	999.0
201609	430	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	However, with both short and longer-term interest rates so low, there are questions of whether pushing them further down will encourage additional borrowing and spending or provide further stimulus through other channels.	11.0	999.0
201609	431	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In addition, flatter yield curves tend to hurt the profitability of banks, which generally borrow short and lend long, and thus could reduce the transmission of monetary stimulus through the bank lending channel, which is important in both of those economies.	11.0	999.0
201609	432	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Concerns about the bank lending channel arise even at low positive interest rates, prompting the introduction of programs such as the Bank of England’s Term Funding Scheme.	11.0	999.0
201609	433	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	But those concerns intensify as policy rates turn negative, squeezing net interest margins for banks (panel 1 of your next exhibit) if they reduce lending rates but are unable to pass on negative rates to retail depositors.	11.0	999.0
201609	434	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	These potential side effects are leading foreign policymakers to worry that the effective lower bound on the policy rate may not be determined by substitution into cash but by concerns that further rate cuts could be counterproductive.	11.0	999.0
201609	435	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	ECB officials have stressed that lower interest rates also have some positives for banks, including capital gains on bond portfolios and lower charge-offs as a result of improvements in credit quality, and they point to increased bank lending in recent years.	11.0	999.0
201609	436	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Nonetheless, as shown by the blue line in panel 2, we believe the ECB is inclined to pursue other types of stimulus and will leave its deposit rate unchanged at negative 0.4 percent for most of the forecast period.	11.0	999.0
201609	437	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	By the same token, Bank of Japan Governor Kuroda recently acknowledged that negative policy rates can hurt banks’ margins while arguing that rate cuts still have greater benefits than costs.	11.0	999.0
201609	438	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	We expect that, in its comprehensive assessment, the Bank of Japan will conclude that its negative rate policy is effective, opening the possibility of further rate cuts.	11.0	999.0
201609	439	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	However, assuming the Japanese economy achieves the tepid growth and meager rise in inflation projected in our baseline, we currently anticipate the Bank of Japan will not actually reduce the policy rate further.	11.0	999.0
201609	440	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Perhaps responding to the criticism that Bank of Japan and ECB policies have received from the banking community, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has made clear recently he is no fan of negative interest rates, indicating that he sees the effective lower bound as “a positive number close to zero.”	11.0	999.0
201609	441	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	We expect the Bank of England to keep its policy rate at its current low level as the UK economy adjusts to life outside the EU.	11.0	999.0
201609	442	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	But Carney’s view is not universally held in central banking circles, and some draw a different conclusion from the recent experience with negative rates.	11.0	999.0
201609	443	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	For instance, this past December, the Bank of Canada reviewed its policy tools and suggested its policy rate could go as low as negative 0.5 percent, if needed.	11.0	999.0
201609	444	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In addition to low rates, all of these central banks except the Bank of Canada have ongoing asset purchase programs, primarily buying sovereign bonds.	11.0	999.0
201609	445	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Recent discussions of ECB and Bank of Japan policies have often focused on whether and how to expand these purchases.	11.0	999.0
201609	446	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Regarding “whether,” policymakers in both institutions have been surprised by the extent to which long yields have fallen and, as I noted earlier, are concerned about their effects on bank profits.	11.0	999.0
201609	447	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Regarding “how,” both institutions are facing issues and constraints as their asset holdings grow.	11.0	999.0
201609	448	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	The ECB’s constraints are largely self-imposed, as its sovereign debt holdings are still only a small share of outstanding euro-area sovereign debt.	11.0	999.0
201609	449	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In particular, the ECB limits its holdings of any bond and any issuer, its purchases are allocated across countries by its capital key, and it buys only bonds that yield more than its deposit rate.	11.0	999.0
201609	450	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	These constraints interact with each other and become more binding when bond yields decline.	11.0	999.0
201609	451	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	For instance, German bonds have to make up a large share of its purchases (about 25 percent), but many German bonds yield less than the deposit rate and thus are not eligible.	11.0	999.0
201609	452	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	We expect the ECB to announce, most likely in December, an extension of its purchases to the end of 2017 from its current commitment of March 2017.	11.0	999.0
201609	453	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	To do so, it will have to relax some of those constraints, and it has tasked committees with evaluating the options.	11.0	999.0
201609	454	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	The BOJ faces greater concerns over running out of room to buy more sovereign bonds.	11.0	999.0
201609	455	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	As shown in panel 3, it currently holds more than one-third of outstanding JGBs.	11.0	999.0
201609	456	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Moreover, Japanese life insurance companies and pension funds have long- term yen-denominated liabilities and thus are reluctant to sell their JGBs even at elevated prices.	11.0	999.0
201609	457	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Of course, large fiscal deficits are also increasing the supply of JGBs, and the Abe government has announced renewed fiscal stimulus.	11.0	999.0
201609	458	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	We expect the BOJ to maintain its current pace of JGB purchases for the next several years but not to increase that pace.	11.0	999.0
201609	459	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Given the issues associated with further sovereign bond buying, central banks are moving into purchases of riskier, private-sector assets.	11.0	999.0
201609	460	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In July, the Bank of Japan increased its rate of ETF purchases, and we think it likely will increase its purchases of real estate investment trusts and corporate bonds, both of which it currently buys in relatively small amounts.	11.0	999.0
201609	461	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	The ECB began in June a program to buy corporate bonds, and corporate bond spreads (panel 4) have declined significantly since the announcement.	11.0	999.0
201609	462	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In August, the Bank of England also announced corporate bond purchases as part of its stimulus program.	11.0	999.0
201609	463	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In sum, we believe that AFE central banks still have room to provide further stimulus, but further action comes with growing complications and side effects that need to be managed.	11.0	999.0
201609	464	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Hence, central banks are resorting to a widening array of instruments, and they face growing challenges of communicating simultaneously about not only the stance of monetary policy, but also its shifting composition.	11.0	999.0
201609	465	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Regardless of whether AFE central banks add to their stimulus in the years to come, their policies are generally expected to remain highly accommodative.	11.0	999.0
201609	466	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	As discussed in Carol Bertaut’s pre-FOMC briefing, this expectation is spurring capital flows to emerging markets and boosting EME asset prices as well as reducing high- yield credit spreads in advanced economies.	11.0	999.0
201609	467	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	However, as evidenced by the backup in long yields in recent weeks, this buoyancy is fragile and could be undermined by signs that accommodation is being removed more quickly than anticipated.	11.0	999.0
201609	468	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In this environment, the risks associated with FOMC tightening may be greater than usual, especially with regard to the dollar.	11.0	999.0
201609	469	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Accordingly, we have chosen to increase the sensitivity of our dollar forecast to policy rate surprises, a move supported by the experience of the past couple of years.	11.0	999.0
201609	470	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	We now assume the dollar will increase by 3 percent against all floating currencies for each 100 basis points of policy rate surprise, compared with about 2¼ percent previously.	11.0	999.0
201609	471	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	In addition, we reassessed our assumption about the path of the Chinese renminbi (panel 5) in light of the Chinese government’s apparent willingness to allow further gradual declines in its currency.	11.0	999.0
201609	472	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	We now assume that the dollar will appreciate against the renminbi through the end of the forecast period.	11.0	999.0
201609	473	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Previously, we had assumed the dollar would depreciate starting in the second half of 2017.	11.0	999.0
201609	474	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	All told, as shown in panel 6, we now project a steeper path of dollar appreciation over the forecast period.	11.0	999.0
201609	475	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	And, as illustrated by an alternative scenario in the Tealbook, we view the risks to our dollar outlook as toward the upside.	11.0	999.0
201609	476	2016-09-21	meeting	WOOD	Beth Klee will continue our presentation.	11.0	999.0
201609	477	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	I’ll be referring to the packet labeled “Material for Briefing on the Summary of Economic Projections.”	11.0	999.0
201609	478	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	To summarize, while your near- and medium- term economic projections are quite similar to those you submitted in June, more than half of you reduced your estimates of longer-run real GDP growth.	11.0	999.0
201609	479	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	In addition, most of you revised down your assessments of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate through 2018 and over the longer run.	11.0	999.0
201609	480	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Exhibit 1 summarizes your economic projections, which are conditional on your individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.	11.0	999.0
201609	481	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As shown in the top panel, the median of your projections of real GDP growth this year is 1.8 percent.	11.0	999.0
201609	482	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Most of you project that economic growth will pick up a bit next year and run at or slightly above your estimates of its longer-run rate in 2017 and 2018, and a majority of you expect real GDP growth to be at its longer-run trend in 2019.	11.0	999.0
201609	483	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	One participant did not submit longer-run projections of the percentage change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate.	11.0	999.0
201609	484	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	That fact will be noted in the SEP material that will be released to the public.	11.0	999.0
201609	485	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As shown in the second panel, the median of your projections of the unemployment rate by the end of this year is 4.8 percent, equal to the median of its longer-run normal level.	11.0	999.0
201609	486	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	A substantial majority of you see the unemployment rate falling to or below its longer-run normal level over the next two years.	11.0	999.0
201609	487	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	In addition, many of you see the unemployment rate edging up to or toward its longer-run level in 2019.	11.0	999.0
201609	488	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As can be seen in the third panel, the median of your projections of headline PCE inflation moves up from 1.3 percent this year to 1.9 percent in 2017 and 2 percent in 2018 and 2019, when all of you project that inflation will be equal to or within a couple tenths of a percentage point of the Committee’s objective.	11.0	999.0
201609	489	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Turning to the bottom panel, the medians of your projections of core inflation also increase gradually over the next three years.	11.0	999.0
201609	490	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Exhibit 2 compares your current projections with those in the June Summary of Economic Projections and with the September and June Tealbooks.	11.0	999.0
201609	491	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As indicated in the top panel, the median of your forecasts of real GDP growth in 2016 has fallen since June; many of you attributed the downward revision to weaker-than-expected incoming data for the first half of this year.	11.0	999.0
201609	492	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	The median values of your projections of real GDP growth in 2017 and 2018 are unchanged from June at 2 percent, a pace slightly above the median projection of its longer-run growth rate, which was revised down to 1.8 percent.	11.0	999.0
201609	493	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As shown in the second, third, and fourth panels, the medians of your projections of the unemployment rate and of total and core PCE inflation are little changed from June.	11.0	999.0
201609	494	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Compared with the latest Tealbook, the median of your projections of real GDP growth is a bit higher this year, moderately lower in 2017, and about in line for 2018 and beyond.	11.0	999.0
201609	495	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	The median of your projections of the unemployment rate and for headline and core inflation are generally somewhat higher than those presented in the Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201609	496	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Exhibit 3 provides an overview of your assessments of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate.	11.0	999.0
201609	497	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	The median of your projections, indicated by the red horizontal lines in the top panel, is consistent with one 25 basis point rate hike by the end of this year.	11.0	999.0
201609	498	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Thereafter, the medians of your projections are 1.1 percent at the end of 2017, 1.9 percent at the end of 2018, and 2.6 percent at the end of 2019.	11.0	999.0
201609	499	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Compared with the June projections, which are shown in the bottom panel, 12 of you revised down the federal funds rate you expect to prevail at the end of this year; the median of your projections is now 25 basis points lower.	11.0	999.0
201609	500	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	All but a couple of you revised down your funds rate forecast over the next two years, and, since June, many of you also lowered your assessment of the appropriate pace of rate hikes in 2017.	11.0	999.0
201609	501	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	The median federal funds rate projection moves up 50 basis points from the end of 2016 to the end of 2017, compared with a 75 basis point increase expected in June, and by another 75 basis points in 2018.	11.0	999.0
201609	502	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Many of you expressed a view that increases in the federal funds rate over the next several years will need to be gradual in light of a short-term neutral real interest rate that is currently low and will only rise slowly—a phenomenon that a number of you attributed to persistently low productivity growth and other factors.	11.0	999.0
201609	503	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	In addition, some of you cited risk-management considerations,due to the proximity of the effective lower bound, as a reason for taking a cautious approach to normalization.	11.0	999.0
201609	504	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	With respect to the longer-run federal funds rate, 12 of you moved down your projections by at least 25 basis points, and the median now stands at 2⅞ percent, compared with 3 percent in June.	11.0	999.0
201609	505	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	In making the downward revisions, participants noted a number of factors, including the persistence of unfavorable global demographic dynamics; weak productivity growth; and low longer-term yields stemming from, for example, a weak outlook for economic growth abroad.	11.0	999.0
201609	506	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As in June, almost all of you anticipate that the appropriate level of the funds rate at the end of 2018 will remain below your individual judgments of its longer-run level.	11.0	999.0
201609	507	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Most of you expect this difference to narrow considerably by the end of 2019.	11.0	999.0
201609	508	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As shown by the red diamonds in exhibit 3, the median federal funds rate that a non-inertial Taylor (1999) rule prescribes for the end of this year,conditional on your individual projections of core inflation, the unemployment rate gap, and the longer- run federal funds rate, has shifted down since June, reflecting downward revisions to projected inflation and the longer-run federal funds rate as well as upward revisions to the unemployment rate.	11.0	999.0
201609	509	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	The lower Taylor rule prescriptions for 2017 and 2018 primarily reflect the downward revisions to the longer-run federal funds rate.	11.0	999.0
201609	510	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	All of you continue to project levels of the federal funds rate in 2016, 2017, and 2018 that are well below the prescriptions using your individual economic outlooks as variables in the policy rule, and only two of you project the federal funds rate in 2019 to be equal to that suggested by the rule.	11.0	999.0
201609	511	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Exhibit 4 compares the medians of your current projections with those from September 2015.	11.0	999.0
201609	512	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As illustrated in the top panel, the median projections of real GDP growth in 2016 and 2017 are a bit lower than a year ago.	11.0	999.0
201609	513	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As shown in the second panel, the median projection of the unemployment rate is modestly lower than it was in September 2015.	11.0	999.0
201609	514	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As depicted in the third panel, the median projection of inflation in 2016 has been revised down, generally reflecting declines in energy prices and continued strength in the dollar that were not expected a year ago.	11.0	999.0
201609	515	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	While the median projections of economic activity, employment, and inflation are little changed from the September 2015 SEP, the path of the federal funds rate that you anticipate will generate these outcomes is much lower in the current projection.	11.0	999.0
201609	516	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	In September 2015, the median federal funds rate at year-end 2016 was 1.4 percent, compared with 0.6 percent now.	11.0	999.0
201609	517	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	This gap widens through 2018.	11.0	999.0
201609	518	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Moreover, over the past year, the median of your longer-run federal funds rate declined from 3.5 percent to 2.9 percent.	11.0	999.0
201609	519	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Exhibit 5 shows your assessments of the uncertainty and risks surrounding your economic projections.	11.0	999.0
201609	520	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As shown in the figures to the left, you continue to view the uncertainty attached to your projections as being broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years.	11.0	999.0
201609	521	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	As in June, the majority of you also see the risks to your projections of GDP growth and the unemployment rate as being broadly balanced, as illustrated in the top two figures to the right, and fewer of you see the risks to economic growth as weighted to the downside or view the risks to unemployment as weighted to the upside than in June.	11.0	999.0
201609	522	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Moving to the two bottom-right figures, a couple more of you now see the risks to your inflation projections as broadly balanced rather than as tilted to the downside; those who revised their view pointed to an easing of concerns about global financial developments or inflation expectations remaining anchored at policy- consistent levels.	11.0	999.0
201609	523	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Those who continue to judge that the risks to inflation are weighted to the downside cited the risks associated with encountering negative economic shocks at the effective lower bound as well as recent readings on survey-based measures of inflation expectations and financial market measures of inflation compensation, among other reasons.	11.0	999.0
201609	524	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201609	525	2016-09-21	meeting	KLEE	That concludes our prepared remarks, and we would be happy to respond to your questions.	11.0	999.0
201609	526	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for any of the presenters are welcome.	12.0	65.0
201609	527	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	12.0	65.0
201609	528	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	107.0
201609	529	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	This is for David Wilcox.	12.0	107.0
201609	530	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	I thought the discussion and the decomposition on unemployment experiences by different racial groups was extremely interesting.	12.0	107.0
201609	531	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	It seems very important as we try to figure out where we are with regard to remaining slack and where that remaining slack may be, although it’s a little unclear as to why there are these very differential experiences.	12.0	107.0
201609	532	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	As I look at it, I thought the decomposition by education was very striking, both in terms of the variability and in terms of the levels.	12.0	107.0
201609	533	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	And, as you were talking, it seems a little harder superficially to associate that kind of a pattern with sectoral differences as opposed to potentially alternative explanations like discrimination.	12.0	107.0
201609	534	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	But I wondered whether you had any further thoughts on what this is telling you so far or what additional analysis you might think about doing to try to get further insights into that.	12.0	107.0
201609	535	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I think it’s a really important question to be investigated.	12.0	999.0
201609	536	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As I said in the course of the briefing itself, I don’t regard this work as having laid to rest the question.	12.0	999.0
201609	537	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I’m a little skeptical that differential exposure to cyclical industries—in particular, manufacturing and construction—can account for the high-beta experience of blacks and Hispanics.	12.0	999.0
201609	538	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	My view on that is informed importantly by the results, perhaps most especially those in the lower-right panel in exhibit 16, which show that even for African Americans with a bachelor’s degree or more, this multiplier of 1.8 pertains relative to whites.	12.0	999.0
201609	539	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I haven’t looked at the industry exposure of African Americans and whites with a bachelor’s degree or more, but I’m a little skeptical that the exposure of African Americans with a bachelor’s or more to construction and to manufacturing could be significant enough to account for that.	12.0	999.0
201609	540	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Industry exposure itself may account for some of this behavior.	12.0	999.0
201609	541	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I am skeptical that it provides a complete explanation.	12.0	999.0
201609	542	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	There are marked differences in the age structure of these racial and ethnic groups.	12.0	999.0
201609	543	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	For example, relatively speaking, the Hispanic population has far fewer elderly than the white population.	12.0	999.0
201609	544	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	So another avenue for investigation is something akin to what I’ve done that would investigate the potential role of differential age structure and account for this sort of situation.	12.0	999.0
201609	545	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	But I think there’s a lot of work to be done not only here inside the Federal Reserve, but by outside researchers as well.	12.0	999.0
201609	546	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	12.0	65.0
201609	547	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I thought that the box in Tealbook A, “Alternative View:  A Return to the Greenspan Conundrum,” was really interesting.	12.0	102.0
201609	548	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I want to reiterate something I think I’ve said many times over the years—how much I appreciate the alternative view boxes.	12.0	102.0
201609	549	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I know that you’re not supporting the particular views here, but I think they are really valuable, at least for us—2,500 miles away we sit and discuss these, and it forces us to think through things in a very constructive way.	12.0	102.0
201609	550	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, again, I view this as a very positive exercise.	12.0	102.0
201609	551	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, that one exercise did get me looking at the alternative scenario that was related to that, which was, again, named “A Return to the Greenspan Conundrum.”	12.0	102.0
201609	552	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	One intriguing result of that alternative scenario was that the unemployment rate comes down to 3¼ percent in late 2019.	12.0	102.0
201609	553	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I know that throughout my lifetime we’ve never had a 3¼ percent unemployment rate.	12.0	102.0
201609	554	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I actually don’t think we’ve had one, probably, since World War II.	12.0	102.0
201609	555	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	You’re not that young.	12.0	999.0
201609	556	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	[Laughter]	12.0	999.0
201609	557	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay.	12.0	102.0
201609	558	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I don’t think we’ve had an unemployment rate that low.	12.0	102.0
201609	559	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	No, I don’t think so.	12.0	65.0
201609	560	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	It got down to about 3.5, I think, in 1999?	12.0	65.0
201609	561	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes.	12.0	102.0
201609	562	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	It has not gone to 3.	12.0	65.0
201609	563	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	No.	12.0	102.0
201609	564	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	But what about in the ’60s, at the end of the ’60s?	12.0	65.0
201609	565	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	It didn’t go to 3¼ percent in the ’60s.	12.0	102.0
201609	566	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	No.	12.0	999.0
201609	567	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay.	12.0	102.0
201609	568	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So the unemployment rate has not gone down to 3¼ percent in my lifetime.	12.0	102.0
201609	569	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’ll stick with that.	12.0	102.0
201609	570	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	12.0	102.0
201609	571	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	The question I have is—I think this simulation was done in the FRB/US model—if you thought through that scenario of a really strong economy, in which monetary policy, for whatever reason, is not taming output growth, do you really think the unemployment rate would go down to close to 3 percent?	12.0	102.0
201609	572	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Or do you think that something else would give in the model?	12.0	102.0
201609	573	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Are we pushing this model outside of the historical norms far enough that maybe labor force participation would pick up, maybe wages would pick up, or something?	12.0	102.0
201609	574	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	How do you think about scenarios of an essentially linear model when you’re taking it well outside a historical norm that was estimated?	12.0	102.0
201609	575	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Really tough question.	12.0	999.0
201609	576	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t have a ready, fully formed answer for you.	12.0	999.0
201609	577	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I’ll answer with a partial response, which is that I suspect that a feature of a lot of these alternative scenarios in which we’re stressing one aspect of the economy would entail other aspects.	12.0	999.0
201609	578	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	So the all-else-being-equal assumption would fail for sure.	12.0	999.0
201609	579	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Now, where the rivets would pop off, I think, is what you’re asking, and I don’t know the answer to that.	12.0	999.0
201609	580	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	If I had thought 3.2 percent unemployment was absolutely outlandish, I wouldn’t have shown the results in the scenario.	12.0	999.0
201609	581	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I do think it begins to push the boundaries of what we’re likely to see, but, by design, this is a pretty extreme scenario.	12.0	999.0
201609	582	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I thought it was appropriate to show that kind of an outcome even though it pushes pretty far into the tail of the probability distribution.	12.0	999.0
201609	583	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t have a ready answer for how things might evolve differently from the way that the model portrays them.	12.0	999.0
201609	584	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	The question I go to is, if we look at episodes in which unemployment went very low or in which we were pushing the economy hard, did we actually see something different happening?	12.0	102.0
201609	585	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Do we get off the linear relationships?	12.0	102.0
201609	586	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Do wages accelerate more quickly, or does something else happen differently in those extreme scenarios?	12.0	102.0
201609	587	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m thinking about the stuff that I remember Mike Kiley doing years ago, looking at how relationships work when you’re at the ends of the distribution.	12.0	102.0
201609	588	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	As it happens, I think Mike is here.	12.0	999.0
201609	589	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	He’s going to deny my referencing his work.	12.0	102.0
201609	590	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Mike, do you have anything to add to this?	12.0	999.0
201609	591	2016-09-21	meeting	KILEY	I think, David, the only thing that I can add is that if you look at the picture—although I don’t have it in front of me—that President Williams is referring to, you can see that the confidence intervals of the unemployment rates are very low.	12.0	999.0
201609	592	2016-09-21	meeting	KILEY	And the folks that work on the FRB/US model are quite worried about exactly the point that President Williams is raising, that historical experience doesn’t have these things.	12.0	999.0
201609	593	2016-09-21	meeting	KILEY	What are the relevant nonlinearities?	12.0	999.0
201609	594	2016-09-21	meeting	KILEY	Are they on participation?	12.0	999.0
201609	595	2016-09-21	meeting	KILEY	Would they be in wages?	12.0	999.0
201609	596	2016-09-21	meeting	KILEY	But I just don’t think we have historical episodes.	12.0	999.0
201609	597	2016-09-21	meeting	KILEY	The one that is in our lifetime, the one in the late 1990s, was accompanied by very favorable other developments regarding productivity, et cetera.	12.0	999.0
201609	598	2016-09-21	meeting	KILEY	So wage pressures or price pressures or other things weren’t particularly apparent.	12.0	999.0
201609	599	2016-09-21	meeting	KILEY	We might imagine they might arise, but that experiment didn’t particularly shed light.	12.0	999.0
201609	600	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	12.0	102.0
201609	601	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	One comment on a point that President Williams raised.	12.0	96.0
201609	602	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	A rate of 3.2 percent today would be very different than a rate of 3.2 percent in the late ’60s because the demographics of the population are quite different.	12.0	96.0
201609	603	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So while I basically take your point, I think you’d have to adjust for the changes in the demographic structure of the economy.	12.0	96.0
201609	604	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I want to come back to the issue of the black and Hispanic unemployment.	12.0	96.0
201609	605	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there’s no question that discrimination is a factor because we have a lot of evidence on things like long- term unemployment that hurts people in terms of their ability to be hired.	12.0	96.0
201609	606	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So while we don’t know the proportion, I think discrimination definitely plays a role.	12.0	96.0
201609	607	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I’m inclined to agree, and this evidence pushes me further in that direction.	12.0	999.0
201609	608	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Another body of research that corroborates that view is the matched résumé submitting, showing that when identical résumés are sent to employers but one of the names has a stereotypical ethnic association, and callback rates differ dramatically between the two.	12.0	999.0
201609	609	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	So that, in my mind, is another piece of corroborating evidence.	12.0	999.0
201609	610	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I just wanted to make it clear that it’s not up in the air.	12.0	96.0
201609	611	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s actually evidence.	12.0	96.0
201609	612	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Right.	12.0	65.0
201609	613	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	There is evidence.	12.0	65.0
201609	614	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	12.0	65.0
201609	615	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Well, I agree with President Williams that extrapolations like this do make you wonder about what could go wrong, and I think there are other things that could happen, right?	12.0	91.0
201609	616	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	In a simulation like this, it could be that the matching technology for employment is better so that, in fact, labor market outcomes are more efficient and you get lower unemployment.	12.0	91.0
201609	617	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	To the extent that there’s tension, I agree it would be manifest either in wages or maybe inflation expectations.	12.0	91.0
201609	618	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	And in this scenario inflation expectations are undoubtedly anchored, but if there was a tension, I would expect that to go wrong.	12.0	91.0
201609	619	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	So that’s the element of the model or the data I’d be looking for, in order to try to weigh in on that.	12.0	91.0
201609	620	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	12.0	65.0
201609	621	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	We’re going back and forth between President Williams’s comments and the earlier comments on further study.	12.0	88.0
201609	622	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	I’d also add that gender cuts, I think, could tell us a great deal.	12.0	88.0
201609	623	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	And just yesterday in Atlanta, I attended a meeting that talked about the judicial system and incarceration rates and the effect of a record of some kind on employment.	12.0	88.0
201609	624	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	So this is a multilayered thing.	12.0	88.0
201609	625	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	If we’re going to tackle it, I think we have to tackle it in a very thorough way, and that’s why I mentioned the gender cuts.	12.0	88.0
201609	626	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I agree completely, but despairing of being able to come to the Committee with a complete answer on all dimensions, I thought I’d come to the Committee with some evidence that I thought was pretty interesting, even if only partial.	12.0	999.0
201609	627	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The incarceration rates are just astonishing—not only the stock of individuals who are currently incarcerated, but those who have a previous record of incarceration.	12.0	999.0
201609	628	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	And that’s bound to be a significant influence in what’s going on.	12.0	999.0
201609	629	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	With regard to gender, I absolutely agree that that’s another important dimension to be explored.	12.0	999.0
201609	630	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	But, as I say, I wanted to come before my own retirement [laughter] with some kind of discussion to the Committee.	12.0	999.0
201609	631	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Thank you.	12.0	999.0
201609	632	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Further comments or questions?	12.0	65.0
201609	633	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	12.0	65.0
201609	634	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	94.0
201609	635	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	My question is on exhibit 2 in “The International Outlook,” panel 6, “Real Dollar Indexes.”	12.0	94.0
201609	636	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We talked before about the reason we’re projecting a stronger dollar is because we think we’re going to surprise markets with our path of rate increases.	12.0	94.0
201609	637	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	So is that surprise the Taylor (1999) rule, or is it the SEP median?	12.0	94.0
201609	638	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Well, the surprise is the difference between the staff assumption about the federal funds rate over the next three or four years.	12.0	999.0
201609	639	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Which is Taylor (1999)?	12.0	94.0
201609	640	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Which is Taylor (1999).	12.0	999.0
201609	641	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Yes.	12.0	94.0
201609	642	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	I would just say, because the entire outlook for the US and global economy is conditioned on that assumption, I wanted to make clear that it’s a staff assumption about the future path of the federal funds rate, which is indeed based on Taylor (1999).	12.0	999.0
201609	643	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	It’s the comparison of that and one measure of what the market expects, which is the OIS rate path.	12.0	999.0
201609	644	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	And it’s that gap that represents the surprise because the markets, as represented by the OIS rates, expect a much shallower uplift in the federal funds rate than is embedded in the staff forecast.	12.0	999.0
201609	645	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Would you say that this is becoming increasingly tenuous, to make this kind of assumption, because Taylor (1999) is getting further and further away from market expectations?	12.0	94.0
201609	646	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Well, that’s a question for my colleagues.	12.0	999.0
201609	647	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	[Laughter]	12.0	999.0
201609	648	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	The reason that we use that staff assumption about the path of the federal funds rate is so that our dollar forecast is exactly consistent with both the economic forecast and the conditioning assumption about monetary policy.	12.0	999.0
201609	649	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Then that raises the question about what is the right conditioning assumption regarding the federal funds rate, and we have reviewed that, and I’ll let one of my colleagues speak more on that.	12.0	999.0
201609	650	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	In a tough spot.	12.0	999.0
201609	651	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The one thing that I would simply note is that, as time progresses, the median expectations from the primary dealer survey, for example, are for a substantially flatter increase than what the Taylor rule applied to our economic forecast implies.	12.0	999.0
201609	652	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	So, by the end of 2019, I think you are looking at a gap on the order of about 1¼ percentage points.	12.0	999.0
201609	653	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	The assumption there is informing the whole outlook and sort of changing the whole context of what you’re presenting to the Committee.	12.0	94.0
201609	654	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	But aren’t these really small effects?	12.0	96.0
201609	655	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re talking about, what, 3½ or 4 percent on the dollar?	12.0	96.0
201609	656	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201609	657	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	On the dollar, you can look at the picture on panel 6.	12.0	999.0
201609	658	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The uncertainty associated with that has got to be a lot greater.	12.0	96.0
201609	659	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Yes, you can see that our real dollar goes up about 5 percent over the next three and a half years or so.	12.0	999.0
201609	660	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	The 5 percent is a non-negligible amount but, stretched over that long a period, it does not have very strong effects on US economic growth.	12.0	999.0
201609	661	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Now, in the Tealbook we have an alternative assumption of a 10 percent rise over a much shorter period, and that is, of course, very material.	12.0	999.0
201609	662	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	And, as Vice Chairman Dudley mentions, that uncertainty dwarfs the arguments you might have about the baseline path of the dollar.	12.0	999.0
201609	663	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Well, the reason I bring this up is because it’s particularly stark when you look at exchange rates because you would expect foreign exchange markets to already have encompassed assumptions about various central bank policies, and therefore you wouldn’t be able to predict very well—and, in fact, you can’t predict very well—what’s going to happen to exchange rates.	12.0	94.0
201609	664	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	But here we’re saying we have some kind of information that the markets do not have, and then that’s feeding into the entire forecast.	12.0	94.0
201609	665	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	That’s exactly right.	12.0	999.0
201609	666	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	We do believe that the current configuration of exchange rates incorporates all information about the future that is expected both by markets and by us.	12.0	999.0
201609	667	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	In almost all areas of global economics that might influence the current exchange rate are information sets that we probably hold in common with the markets.	12.0	999.0
201609	668	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	So there’s really one key area in which our views differ from the market, and that’s the assumption about the future path of the federal funds rate.	12.0	999.0
201609	669	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	We also incorporate into our dollar forecast some differences in views about foreign central bank monetary policy, but they’re not that material.	12.0	999.0
201609	670	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	It’s mainly differences of views about US monetary policy, about the federal funds rate, which in turn lead to expectations on our part that the market will be surprised.	12.0	999.0
201609	671	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	That is that one difference between our information sets and the markets’ that we build into our forecast.	12.0	999.0
201609	672	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	12.0	94.0
201609	673	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	12.0	65.0
201609	674	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	103.0
201609	675	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	My question is spawned by President Williams’s question, only looking at the Tealbook.	12.0	103.0
201609	676	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	The Tealbook unemployment rate for 2019 of 4.2 percent, and long-run of 5—would there be historical experience to say what happens when you go from 4.2 to 5, just even in that range?	12.0	103.0
201609	677	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	There’s not a lot.	12.0	999.0
201609	678	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The excursions of the unemployment rate below the natural rate and then back up to the natural rate are pretty rare, and as I think Michael Kiley was referring to, one has to wonder whether at that point, with a rising unemployment rate, some nonlinear dynamics might take over and we might end up with something other than a smooth landing.	12.0	999.0
201609	679	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I think the record of the postwar period, in my view, is less dispositive on that point than it might first appear because many of the recessions in the postwar period were actually deliberatively induced by the Federal Reserve in order to wring inflation out of the system.	12.0	999.0
201609	680	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	This is what gave rise to the designation by Christina Romer and David Romer of the so-called “Romer dates” when they divined that the mind of the Committee had switched from one mode, which was promoting economic growth, to another mode, which was fighting inflation.	12.0	999.0
201609	681	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	So I think it’s less evident than it might seem on the surface that it’s impossible to accomplish a smooth landing of the kind that’s portrayed at the baseline projection, but there isn’t a long historical record to show that it can be done.	12.0	999.0
201609	682	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	If I may, just ever so briefly, I’d like to come back to President Williams’s original comment about the alternative view.	12.0	999.0
201609	683	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I’m aware that there’s been quite a lot of turnover on the Committee since that franchise was introduced, and I thought I might just place it a little bit into context.	12.0	999.0
201609	684	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	It’s the only place in the Tealbook in which I give individual staff members a byline, so they’re individually invested and identified in the production of that.	12.0	999.0
201609	685	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	The goal here is to ask staff members to make the case for an off-baseline possibility of consequence to you as policymakers.	12.0	999.0
201609	686	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I’m asking them to act as lawyer advocates of a nonbaseline possibility.	12.0	999.0
201609	687	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	And my compact with them is that I will never ask them if they believe that their scenario is superior to the baseline scenario, because if I did that, I would be putting them in the position of saying that they think their judgment is better than mine.	12.0	999.0
201609	688	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Now, I suspect that, frankly, many of them do believe that [laughter], but I never force them to come out and say that to my face.	12.0	999.0
201609	689	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	It’s good enough.	12.0	999.0
201609	690	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	And the way that I assess the quality of their work is, simply, “How well did you marshal the evidence on behalf of your case?	12.0	999.0
201609	691	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Did you argue it well by appealing to history, foreign central bank experience, US central bank experience, or other issues like that?”	12.0	999.0
201609	692	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	All I’m asking them to do is, articulate a plausible possibility off baseline with the goal, I hope, of advancing the ability of all of you to think through various contingencies that you might confront.	12.0	999.0
201609	693	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	12.0	65.0
201609	694	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes.	12.0	102.0
201609	695	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I want to clarify something, again, for people who may not be following exactly what David said earlier.	12.0	102.0
201609	696	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	You said something about how you may have assumed that it’s impossible to get a soft landing when you have the unemployment rate way below its natural rate.	12.0	102.0
201609	697	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	You didn’t actually say what the fact was, and the fact is, it’s never happened.	12.0	102.0
201609	698	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I just wanted everyone to be clear.	12.0	102.0
201609	699	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s the thing that you were talking about that you weren’t convinced by, but I think that does get to President George’s question.	12.0	102.0
201609	700	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	We have not seen an example in the postwar history in which the unemployment rate went up more than ½ percentage point that wasn’t associated with a recession.	12.0	102.0
201609	701	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, the reasons for that, which you brought up in the debate about why that is the case, is definitely a live subject.	12.0	102.0
201609	702	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	But it is a striking—not even a “stylized” fact but a fact that this hasn’t occurred in the past.	12.0	102.0
201609	703	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So it is an area in which I worry that, when you have an unemployment rate that low, it is very hard, and historically hard—you have to go way back in history, I think—to find an example of that being successful.	12.0	102.0
201609	704	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t know if that was a legal two-hander [laughter].	12.0	102.0
201609	705	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	This is an important issue.	12.0	91.0
201609	706	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I’m going to guess that in models you’ve written down, President Williams—I don’t tabulate these things myself—if you simulate them, you probably have a lot of examples in which the unemployment rate has gone up in those simulations without it being what somebody might call a recession.	12.0	91.0
201609	707	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Andin view of the small number of recessions that we’ve had and some lack of luck during some of these—as we were talking about in Chicago just last week, one of my colleagues pointed out that, well, 1990 and ’91 could have been a soft landing, but then Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait came about.	12.0	91.0
201609	708	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	And, you know, things happen during fragile times.	12.0	91.0
201609	709	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	So there’s a small number of observations.	12.0	91.0
201609	710	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	There are some shocks that do that.	12.0	91.0
201609	711	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	If it was as much of a slam dunk as your comment kind of suggests offhand, then your models ought to be reflecting this, and I just don’t think they are.	12.0	91.0
201609	712	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	So it’s worth a lot of discussion because, frankly, I think it is a big deal.	12.0	91.0
201609	713	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	If, in fact, undershooting the natural rate of unemployment is something that is going to lead to a recession, and if we think that the Phillips curve mechanism is going to be important to get inflation up to our target, well, then, we’re probably never going to get it up to target, because we’re going to say, “If I do this, I’ll have a recession, and that would be worse.”	12.0	91.0
201609	714	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	And then that’s going to ratify that 2 percent as a ceiling.	12.0	91.0
201609	715	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	So I think this is a really important issue for more discussion.	12.0	91.0
201609	716	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	I absolutely agree with you.	12.0	65.0
201609	717	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I agree, President Evans—and President Williams, too.	12.0	999.0
201609	718	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I think that one needs to acknowledge that this is an area in which it is going to be difficult to make solid progress in research.	12.0	999.0
201609	719	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I certainly feel that I can’t speak with great conviction that our nice, tidy linear models describe well the dynamics that take over in a more fragile economy when demand is growing more slowly.	12.0	999.0
201609	720	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	One is struck, for example, by the profile of unemployment over the business cycle.	12.0	999.0
201609	721	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	You see steep increases in the unemployment rate, and you don’t see equivalently steep declines in the unemployment rate.	12.0	999.0
201609	722	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	And in a simple, tidy linear model like the FRB/US model, there probably shouldn’t be that discrepancy in behavior.	12.0	999.0
201609	723	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	Now, that said, my impression is that there have been two attempts at a soft landing in the post–World War II era.	12.0	999.0
201609	724	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	And, as President Evans just mentioned, I think there is an easily identifiable event with regard to one of them—namely, the 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq— that provided a plausible shock of sharp magnitude that disrupted economic processes.	12.0	999.0
201609	725	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	I just don’t think you can look to the historical record and get a dispositive answer on that question.	12.0	999.0
201609	726	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	And I don’t have a huge amount of confidence in the ability of our models to discriminate, because the kind of model you go to in looking for that answer—that will pretty much give you the answer.	12.0	999.0
201609	727	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	If you go to a linear model like the FRB/US model and you rely on that model as the source for your answer, you will decide that it’s feasible that there’s no particular problem here.	12.0	999.0
201609	728	2016-09-21	meeting	WILCOX	If you go to a model that incorporates nonlinear dynamics, that will be the answer that you get.	12.0	999.0
201609	729	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	12.0	65.0
201609	730	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’ll talk about it in my own session, so I will follow-up then.	12.0	90.0
201609	731	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	12.0	65.0
201609	732	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	I just want to confirm my recollection of a number that the previous Chairman told us about in early 2008, and I think it’s that the unemployment rate doesn’t rise more than 0.3 percentage point without a recession.	12.0	81.0
201609	733	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Is that the right number?	12.0	81.0
201609	734	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Three-month moving average.	12.0	96.0
201609	735	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Of what?	12.0	81.0
201609	736	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	A three-month moving average of the unemployment rate.	12.0	96.0
201609	737	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	If it goes up more than 0.3 percentage point, we’ve always had a recession.	12.0	96.0
201609	738	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Thanks.	12.0	81.0
201609	739	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Not causation.	12.0	102.0
201609	740	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	12.0	65.0
201609	741	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	94.0
201609	742	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Just on this Greenspan conundrum discussion, we may not have observed a 3¼ percent unemployment rate in President Williams’s lifetime.	12.0	94.0
201609	743	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	But we did observe a conundrum in the early 2000s, and we do have some experience with that.	12.0	94.0
201609	744	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	In that episode, we did not see this huge decline in the unemployment rate.	12.0	94.0
201609	745	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	That’s just another way to look at that issue.	12.0	94.0
201609	746	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	So it’s not like it’s completely out of historical experience.	12.0	94.0
201609	747	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12.0	65.0
201609	748	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we get started then on our economic go-round.	13.0	65.0
201609	749	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll have a few comments and then take a coffee break.	13.0	65.0
201609	750	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s start with President Rosengren.	13.0	65.0
201609	751	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Oh, am I going now?	13.0	90.0
201609	752	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	13.0	65.0
201609	753	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’m sorry.	13.0	90.0
201609	754	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	I thought we were going for the break.	13.0	90.0
201609	755	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	[Laughter]	13.0	90.0
201609	756	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	My apologies.	13.0	90.0
201609	757	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	No problem.	13.0	65.0
201609	758	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	He was changing what he was going to say.	13.0	97.0
201609	759	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	13.0	97.0
201609	760	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201609	761	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	We can come back to you.	13.0	65.0
201609	762	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	My forecast is quite similar to that of the Tealbook.	13.0	90.0
201609	763	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	I expect real GDP growth for the second half of this year to be more than 1 percentage point higher than for the first half of this year.	13.0	90.0
201609	764	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	This pickup will largely reflect continued strength in consumption and some rebuilding of inventories.	13.0	90.0
201609	765	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Growth in real final sales to private domestic purchasers has been fairly solid over the past year, and I expect a solid increase in 2017 as well.	13.0	90.0
201609	766	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, abstracting from transitory fluctuations induced by inventory changes, domestic economic growth remains quite healthy, with limited spillovers to date from the strong dollar and weak growth of our trading partners.	13.0	90.0
201609	767	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	My expectation regarding core PCE inflation for the second half of this year is slightly higher than the Tealbook’s.	13.0	90.0
201609	768	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	By the end of 2017, I expect core inflation to be only slightly below our 2 percent inflation target.	13.0	90.0
201609	769	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	One concern with such an inflation forecast has been the decline in inflation expectations in the Michigan survey.	13.0	90.0
201609	770	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, as with other measures of inflation expectations, the lowest quartile has been relatively stable, with most of the decline coming from the higher quartiles.	13.0	90.0
201609	771	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Such behavior could be consistent with households finally realizing that the inflation environment has changed.	13.0	90.0
201609	772	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Even with a noticeable rise in the funds rate, I expect the unemployment rate to reach 4.5 percent by the end of 2017.	13.0	90.0
201609	773	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	This forecast of an overshoot of full employment is not an outlier, as both the Tealbook and the Blue Chip consensus forecast also expect the unemployment rate to be 4½ percent by the end of 2017.	13.0	90.0
201609	774	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Using the Tealbook’s estimate of the natural rate, this implies a ½ percentage point overshoot of full employment.	13.0	90.0
201609	775	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	My estimate of the natural rate is a bit lower, so 4½ percent implies only a 0.2 percentage point overshoot of full employment.	13.0	90.0
201609	776	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, within 15 months, all three forecasts expect the unemployment rate to fall below where the consensus of the Committee expects the unemployment rate to be in the long run.	13.0	90.0
201609	777	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Like the Tealbook, I expect the unemployment rate to continue drifting down through 2018, reaching 4.2 percent at the end of 2019.	13.0	90.0
201609	778	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Hence, my forecast envisions economic growth in excess of potential, even with 100 basis points of tightening in 2017.	13.0	90.0
201609	779	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	The Tealbook also expects the unemployment rate to fall to 4.2 percent.	13.0	90.0
201609	780	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	While this is my modal forecast, I believe risks are balanced around that outlook.	13.0	90.0
201609	781	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	There is a significant risk that we will exceed this already large overshoot of full employment.	13.0	90.0
201609	782	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	If foreign trade partners grow more quickly or moderate demand does not draw workers back into the labor force, the unemployment rate could easily decline even further.	13.0	90.0
201609	783	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	One reason why I see balanced risks associated with the Tealbook forecast of the unemployment rate is because I believe an assumption of an additional increase in labor force participation is far from certain.	13.0	90.0
201609	784	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	My staff examined state-level participation rates to see if participation has risen significantly in states whose unemployment rate is quite low.	13.0	90.0
201609	785	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	They do not find a strong state-level correlation between recent changes in participation rates and low unemployment rates.	13.0	90.0
201609	786	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, we must consider the possibility of a more significant overshoot of full employment, which would bring with it significant risks to the sustainability of the expansion.	13.0	90.0
201609	787	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we find ourselves in the position in which we need to increase the unemployment rate ½ percentage point or more in order to return to full employment, we will be attempting a feat that is yet to be accomplished.	13.0	90.0
201609	788	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Historically, every attempt to raise the unemployment rate ½ percentage point or more from below full employment has resulted in a recession that produces a much larger rise in unemployment than a few tenths.	13.0	90.0
201609	789	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Overshooting tends to happen in both directions.	13.0	90.0
201609	790	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	This was part of the discussion that we were just having, as mentioned earlier by President Williams and President Evans.	13.0	90.0
201609	791	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think this is actually very fundamental to the discussions that we are having today.	13.0	90.0
201609	792	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	While it may be possible to have a soft landing, is it probable, particularly if we do a significant overshoot?	13.0	90.0
201609	793	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	While there are advantages to using accommodative monetary policy to probe for additional improvements in labor markets, particularly for low-skilled workers and minorities who may benefit from a stronger market, we must balance these potential benefits against the risk of a significant overshoot of full employment that could ultimately do even more harm to the same populations.	13.0	90.0
201609	794	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Should we once again be unsuccessful in fine-tuning a slowdown, the ensuing recession will likely fall disproportionately on low-skilled workers and minorities.	13.0	90.0
201609	795	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	I will discuss the policy implications of that concern tomorrow.	13.0	90.0
201609	796	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201609	797	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	798	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13.0	65.0
201609	799	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	81.0
201609	800	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Reports received from contacts in the Fifth District have been more positive than negative since the previous meeting and are consistent with the continuation of recent growth trends.	13.0	81.0
201609	801	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The manufacturing picture remains mixed.	13.0	81.0
201609	802	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Our August survey shows a decline in the overall manufacturing index, as did preliminary figures for September due out next Tuesday.	13.0	81.0
201609	803	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	I continue to receive positive reports from some industries, particularly those tied to consumer markets and, particularly, autos.	13.0	81.0
201609	804	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The service sector index also softened in August, but preliminary readings for September show a rebound.	13.0	81.0
201609	805	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	In both surveys, wage indexes remain very high.	13.0	81.0
201609	806	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Contacts indicate continued tightness in labor markets across regions and industries.	13.0	81.0
201609	807	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Regulatory issues and uncertainty regarding the upcoming election were cited as potentially weighing on economic activity.	13.0	81.0
201609	808	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The outlook for commercial real estate remains very strong according to recent data and comments from contacts.	13.0	81.0
201609	809	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The residential sector is more uneven, however, with reports of very strong markets in some areas but also a number of weaker markets.	13.0	81.0
201609	810	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Constraints on the supply of lots and skilled workers is said to be restraining activity in some areas.	13.0	81.0
201609	811	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	In assessing the national outlook at this meeting, I think it’s useful to look back to last December.	13.0	81.0
201609	812	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	At that point, we saw an economy that had expanded steadily, if slowly, in the years since the recession.	13.0	81.0
201609	813	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	For 2015, it looked as if payroll employment had increased about 220,000 jobs per month.	13.0	81.0
201609	814	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The unemployment rate had declined 0.6 percentage point to 5 percent, close to most estimates of the natural rate.	13.0	81.0
201609	815	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Real GDP had grown at about 2 percent, supported by strong PCE growth.	13.0	81.0
201609	816	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	And 12-month core PCE inflation had stabilized at 1.3 percent despite low headline inflation and a strengthening dollar.	13.0	81.0
201609	817	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The median outlook for 2016 of the SEP was for a further decline in the unemployment rate, supported by more strong growth in payroll employment, real GDP growth of 2.4 percent, and fourth-quarter core inflation firming to around 1.6 percent.	13.0	81.0
201609	818	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Coming into the final quarter of this year, the data are lining up fairly well with that December outlook.	13.0	81.0
201609	819	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	There have been some misses, but they’re relatively minor, I’d argue.	13.0	81.0
201609	820	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Payroll employment has averaged about 180,000 a month, a small slowdown from last year’s pace but still much higher than we would need to maintain constant unemployment rates across demographic cohorts.	13.0	81.0
201609	821	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	And you’d expect payroll employment growth to slow as the unemployment rate flattens out.	13.0	81.0
201609	822	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The unemployment rate has declined 0.1 percentage point, just 0.1 less of a decline than the Tealbook expected by now, so labor market conditions seem very close to our earlier projections.	13.0	81.0
201609	823	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	GDP growth has been below forecast for the first half of the year, but a significant portion of the slowdown is attributable to the inventory surprise, and that’s unlikely to persist.	13.0	81.0
201609	824	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The inventory swing, together with an upturn in nonresidential structures and continued strength in PCE, is likely to give us fourth-quarter GDP growth that’s close to but below 2 percent for this year.	13.0	81.0
201609	825	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	I wrote down 1.9 percent.	13.0	81.0
201609	826	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The median SEP forecast is 1.8 percent.	13.0	81.0
201609	827	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	It is about ½ percentage point lower than the median SEP forecast in December, but it’s well within the usual forecast uncertainty.	13.0	81.0
201609	828	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	With employment coming in close to expectations, the implication is that productivity growth has been lower than anticipated.	13.0	81.0
201609	829	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Core PCE inflation has been right in line with our December SEP forecasts.	13.0	81.0
201609	830	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The 12-month figure was 1.6 percent in July, equal to the median December projection for 2016 as a whole and up from 1.3 percent a year earlier.	13.0	81.0
201609	831	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The August CPI report is in line with that firming trend, causing the staff to increase the third-quarter core inflation forecast, and I expect that the 12-month figure is going to continue its gradual climb toward 2 percent.	13.0	81.0
201609	832	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Against the background of expectations of stable or somewhat increasing energy prices, this should bring headline PCE inflation closer to 2 percent as well.	13.0	81.0
201609	833	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	So the inflation outlook has not changed and remains in line with our expectations in December that inflation would gradually rise to our target.	13.0	81.0
201609	834	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Employment and core inflation are tracking quite close to what we expected as of December, but productivity growth is coming in low.	13.0	81.0
201609	835	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	In contrast, as illustrated in exhibit 4 of Elizabeth Klee’s presentation, the policy outlook is significantly different than it was in December.	13.0	81.0
201609	836	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Then, the median participant expected it to be appropriate to raise rates four times, so we probably would have been making our third increase of the year at this meeting, bringing the funds rate target above 1 percent.	13.0	81.0
201609	837	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	This gives rise to a question:  What explains the significant shift in our policy stance over that time frame despite little or no change in the outlook for employment or inflation?	13.0	81.0
201609	838	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Well, I mentioned that productivity growth has been lower than expected.	13.0	81.0
201609	839	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Monetary policy is unlikely to have much effect on productivity, though, and besides, our mandate is employment and inflation, not productivity or output.	13.0	81.0
201609	840	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	But, of course, lower steady-state productivity growth does imply a lower steady-state real interest rate and arguably would imply a lower value for the intercept term in a Taylor-type policy reaction rule.	13.0	81.0
201609	841	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	So, by how much should we revise our estimate of r* in response to the latest productivity numbers?	13.0	81.0
201609	842	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	This is analogous to how much we should think trend employment has fallen after seeing the May employment report.	13.0	81.0
201609	843	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Obviously, you wouldn’t think that the trend employment growth is 30,000 after seeing the May employment report; one uses a moving average of recent data.	13.0	81.0
201609	844	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	So the econometric methods of Lubik-Matthes and Laubach-Williams tell us quantitatively how much to take on board for r*, and the answer is, essentially, some, but not enough to rationalize where the funds rate is today.	13.0	81.0
201609	845	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Now, we have seen a series of flare-ups since the beginning of the year that seem to suggest heightened downside risks to the outlook:  global financial disturbances in January and February, a very weak employment report for May, and concerns about Brexit in June.	13.0	81.0
201609	846	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	As it turned out, the financial market tumult of the first quarter was mostly about Chinese economic growth concerns that have dissipated; the May payroll employment number was, as suspected, a fluke; and the Brexit vote turned out to have much smaller near-term implications for economic growth than feared for the United Kingdom and negligible implications for the United States.	13.0	81.0
201609	847	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	While holding off on a second rate increase may have been a prudent and reasonable choice in each case, it seems unlikely to have had much to do with how things turned out.	13.0	81.0
201609	848	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	It’s hard to argue that holding off raising the funds rate stabilized Chinese growth prospects, boosted the June employment report, or damped the real effects of the Brexit vote.	13.0	81.0
201609	849	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The data on employment and inflation are in line with what we expected in December, but there are no risk flare-ups in sight that might rationalize another delay.	13.0	81.0
201609	850	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Holding steady at this meeting would thus mark a substantial and persistent departure from the policy settings that would be expected, on the basis of our December projections or policy reaction functions characterizing our past behavior.	13.0	81.0
201609	851	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	This would appear to imply a distinct shift in our policy reaction function—that is, in how policy settings depend on the data.	13.0	81.0
201609	852	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	I plan to discuss this topic further in the next round.	13.0	81.0
201609	853	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13.0	65.0
201609	854	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201609	855	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	The tone and content of reports of my District contacts and directors in the most recent cycle were largely unchanged from the reports given before the July and June meetings.	13.0	88.0
201609	856	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Overall sentiment remains positive, with an outlook of continued, steady, moderate growth.	13.0	88.0
201609	857	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	If there was any difference this time around, comments were slightly more cautious in tone.	13.0	88.0
201609	858	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard some mention of uncertainty related to the upcoming election.	13.0	88.0
201609	859	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Reports on consumer spending were positive on balance.	13.0	88.0
201609	860	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Most retailers report solid sales levels and expect modestly higher sales for the remainder of 2016 compared with earlier this year.	13.0	88.0
201609	861	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	A minority of reports pointed to softening sales.	13.0	88.0
201609	862	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Auto sales were worthy of note.	13.0	88.0
201609	863	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Earlier cautionary reports on the sustainability of auto sales of our director who heads the country’s largest retailer seem to be accurate.	13.0	88.0
201609	864	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	He very clearly attributes some of the slowing to added caution of consumers ahead of the election.	13.0	88.0
201609	865	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	While firms tied to the oil and gas sector continue to report layoffs, many of our contacts remain in net hiring mode and report widespread wage pressure.	13.0	88.0
201609	866	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	And according to a number of reports, labor market tightening has deepened at various levels of the firm, with some weighting to low-skill, and broadened across a range of job types.	13.0	88.0
201609	867	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	These trends are confirmed by the elevated reading of the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker.	13.0	88.0
201609	868	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	In this cycle we repeated our practice of asking about pricing power of firms, and pricing power, to generalize, remains constrained.	13.0	88.0
201609	869	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	That said, margins seem to be holding steady for most contacts.	13.0	88.0
201609	870	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	At a more strategic level, we picked up a theme in this cycle of firms reevaluating business models to avoid expanding capacity.	13.0	88.0
201609	871	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard reports of efforts to leverage underutilized assets at capacity owned by other firms before moving forward with traditional growth-oriented investments.	13.0	88.0
201609	872	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	A major national rental car company is exploring the use of idle space in parking lots with valet service in lieu of building new rental facilities.	13.0	88.0
201609	873	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	As regards the third quarter, our tracking estimate as of this morning puts the quarter at just short of 3 percent annualized GDP growth, with real final sales growth around 2.3 percent.	13.0	88.0
201609	874	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	So I’m confident we’re experiencing meaningful acceleration after the weak first half.	13.0	88.0
201609	875	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	My forecast has not changed materially from June.	13.0	88.0
201609	876	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	My forecast anticipates continuation of moderate GDP growth around 2 percent for the forecast period.	13.0	88.0
201609	877	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	This marginally exceeds potential but is sufficient to absorb any remaining resource slack.	13.0	88.0
201609	878	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	In my forecast, I have an assumption of some acceleration of growth of business fixed investment.	13.0	88.0
201609	879	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	So far this year, we’ve heard little from District contacts that would support this assumption.	13.0	88.0
201609	880	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	The reasons for a cautious approach to capital spending are familiar—most notably, a reference to uncertainty.	13.0	88.0
201609	881	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	This cycle we did a survey of more than 200 CEOs, CFOs, and business owners and asked about uncertainty tied to the upcoming election.	13.0	88.0
201609	882	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Roughly one-third reported that uncertainty about election results is influencing their business decisions, and we took that number to be material.	13.0	88.0
201609	883	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	A failure of business investment to pick up after the election and through the forecast period is a downside risk to my outlook.	13.0	88.0
201609	884	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding our inflation objective, my forecast foresees a modest acceleration of inflation achieving the 2 percent target by year-end 2017.	13.0	88.0
201609	885	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	We read the August CPI report and its various cuts as consistent with this view.	13.0	88.0
201609	886	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	I see the risks to my outlook as being more balanced today than at the time of our June meeting, and I’m comfortable with describing the near-term outlook as “roughly balanced,” as in policy alternative B, or just “balanced,” as in alternative C.	13.0	88.0
201609	887	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201609	888	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	889	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13.0	65.0
201609	890	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	13.0	107.0
201609	891	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	The economy has seen welcome progress on some fronts in recent months, in part because of the prudent approach taken by the Committee and the corresponding supportive financial conditions.	13.0	107.0
201609	892	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent data on the labor market and aggregate spending suggest we are continuing to move toward full employment, but that progress is gradual.	13.0	107.0
201609	893	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	The labor market has continued to improve, with few indications of overheating and some signs that continued slack remains.	13.0	107.0
201609	894	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	So far this year, monthly job gains have averaged 180,000, below last year’s pace but still sufficient to reduce slack.	13.0	107.0
201609	895	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	The slowing pace of job gains has been associated with a flattening out in the unemployment rate over the past year, along with a heartening ½ percentage point increase in the prime-age labor force participation rate.	13.0	107.0
201609	896	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	These developments suggest that an improving job market has made joining or remaining in the labor force increasingly attractive and may imply the labor market has some room for further improvement.	13.0	107.0
201609	897	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Despite this improvement, the prime-age labor force participation rate remains about 1½ percentage points below its pre-crisis level.	13.0	107.0
201609	898	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	While it’s possible that this simply reflects ongoing pre-crisis trends, we cannot rule out the possibility that it reflects a lagged, and still incomplete, response to a very slow recovery in job opportunities and wages.	13.0	107.0
201609	899	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	The latter possibility is reinforced by the continued muted recovery in wage growth.	13.0	107.0
201609	900	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Although wage growth has picked up to about a 2½ percent pace in recent quarters, this is only modestly above that which prevailed over much of the recovery and well below growth rates seen before the crisis.	13.0	107.0
201609	901	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	This reinforces the point that uncertainty remains about how much slack is left.	13.0	107.0
201609	902	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	In the SEP, the projection regarding the longer-run rate of unemployment has come down significantly from a central tendency of 5.2 to 6.0 percent only four years ago to a median of 4.8 in the most recent SEP, well below the lower end of that previous range.	13.0	107.0
201609	903	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	We can’t rule out the possibility that estimates of the natural rate may move further lower.	13.0	107.0
201609	904	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	In the presence of uncertainty and in the absence of accelerating inflationary pressures, it would be unwise for policy to foreclose the possibility of making further gains in the labor market.	13.0	107.0
201609	905	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	With regard to aggregate spending, economic activity over the past three quarters has been disappointing, with growth in GDP and GDI each averaging less than 1 percent, a significant step-down from the same period in the previous year.	13.0	107.0
201609	906	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	However, recent data suggest a pickup in third-quarter output growth.	13.0	107.0
201609	907	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Although retail spending stalled in July and August following several strong months, I would expect continued job growth, buoyant sentiment, and rising household wealth to lead to consumption growth near 3 percent over the second half, about in line with the average pace of gains since the beginning of 2014.	13.0	107.0
201609	908	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	There are also some positive signs for investment.	13.0	107.0
201609	909	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Inventory investment, which edged lower last quarter, should step up over the second half of the year to a level more in line with continued moderate increases in final sales.	13.0	107.0
201609	910	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	The number of oil drilling rigs in operation has edged up in recent months after the previous sharp declines, and nonresidential building investment also appeared strong in the middle of the year, although the data are notoriously volatile and subject to revisions.	13.0	107.0
201609	911	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	However, other parts of the economy remain weak, likely still reflecting the large appreciation of the dollar since June 2014.	13.0	107.0
201609	912	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	The recent data on equipment investment continue to be quite tepid, manufacturing output remains flat, and real exports are a little more than 1 percent below their level a year ago.	13.0	107.0
201609	913	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Corporate profits fell close to 5 percent over the four quarters ending in the second quarter, and the housing sector, which provided important support to GDP growth last year, looks to be contracting in the middle of this year.	13.0	107.0
201609	914	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Thus, while I would expect economic growth to move up from its weak pace over the first half of the year, the persistent weakness in several key areas suggests that the pace will be moderate.	13.0	107.0
201609	915	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Progress on inflation has been mixed.	13.0	107.0
201609	916	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	While core inflation has increased from a year ago, we’re still some distance from our target, which is symmetric, and some measures of inflation expectations remain quite low.	13.0	107.0
201609	917	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	The recent data seem consistent with the staff’s projection that core PCE inflation would slow noticeably over the second half of this year.	13.0	107.0
201609	918	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	But on a 12-month basis, core PCE inflation is estimated to be 1.6 percent in August, which is an improvement over a year ago.	13.0	107.0
201609	919	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, core inflation has not yet convincingly broken out of the 1.4 to 1.6 percent range it has occupied for most of the past three years.	13.0	107.0
201609	920	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	The underperformance of core inflation relative to our target has been extremely persistent.	13.0	107.0
201609	921	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	If the staff projection for September is correct, core PCE inflation on a 12-month change basis will have been below 2 percent for all but four months out of the past eight years.	13.0	107.0
201609	922	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	I want to highlight this fact because it does seem important for our discussion of policy.	13.0	107.0
201609	923	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	With the stabilization of the dollar and oil prices, there is reason to expect inflation to rise.	13.0	107.0
201609	924	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	However, even putting aside the renewed dollar appreciation that would likely accompany further tightening, there are ample reasons to worry that the unwinding of these forces alone will not be sufficient to move core back to our target.	13.0	107.0
201609	925	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	First, recent research suggests the Phillips curve is quite flat.	13.0	107.0
201609	926	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Second, as I noted earlier, we may still be some distance from full employment.	13.0	107.0
201609	927	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	And, lastly, the persistently low level of survey-based inflation expectations and very weak readings on inflation compensation may indicate that inflation expectations have moved down in recent quarters.	13.0	107.0
201609	928	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Despite the recent increases in oil prices and stabilization of the dollar, 10-year inflation compensation is less than 1.5 percent, close to its historic low.	13.0	107.0
201609	929	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	At the same time, as everyone, I think, has noted, median 5-to-10-year inflation expectations in the Michigan survey matched its historical low of 2.5 percent in both August and the preliminary September reading.	13.0	107.0
201609	930	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	In view of the apparent weak relationship between levels of resource utilization and inflation and signs of downward pressure on inflation expectations, reaching our inflation target requires ensuring the US economy maintains sufficient positive momentum, especiallyin the broader international environment.	13.0	107.0
201609	931	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Let me close by briefly referring to the risks.	13.0	107.0
201609	932	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	We have been able to maintain positive momentum in the labor market so far this year despite some notable risk events, most recently Brexit, in part because of our prudent approach to monetary policy.	13.0	107.0
201609	933	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	However, important medium-term risks remain.	13.0	107.0
201609	934	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	In Europe, economic growth is slow and inflation is very low.	13.0	107.0
201609	935	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Low growth and a flat yield curve are contributing to reduced profitability and a high cost of equity financing for banks, which in turn could impair a key transmission channel of monetary policy in the euro area.	13.0	107.0
201609	936	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	A low-growth/low-inflation environment also makes progress on fiscal sustainability difficult and leaves countries with high debt-to-GDP levels very vulnerable.	13.0	107.0
201609	937	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Against this backdrop, uncertainty about the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union could damp business sentiment and investment in the period ahead.	13.0	107.0
201609	938	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Japan, as everyone has noted, remains greatly challenged by weak economic growth and low inflation.	13.0	107.0
201609	939	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	And it’s striking that despite active and creative monetary policies in both the euro area and Japan, inflation remains far below target.	13.0	107.0
201609	940	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	The experiences of these economies highlight the risk of becoming trapped in a low-growth, low-inflation, low-inflation-expectations environment and suggest that policy here should be oriented toward minimizing the risk of the United States slipping into such a situation.	13.0	107.0
201609	941	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Downside risks are also prominent in emerging markets, most notably China.	13.0	107.0
201609	942	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	As China has experienced very high growth in corporate debt, the downshift in economic growth that everyone anticipates could pose risks.	13.0	107.0
201609	943	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	And while Chinese authorities have made some progress on clarifying their policy stance and capital outflows have slowed in recent months, considerable uncertainty remains and further volatility cannot be ruled out, particularly if we were to see a notable strengthening of the dollar, which could lead to renewed fears of a larger exchange rate devaluation and capital outflow pressures.	13.0	107.0
201609	944	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent research suggests that changes in expectations regarding developments in other major economies—and I think Steve was referring to this earlier—relative to the United States and the associated policy responses lead to exchange rate movements that appear to be bigger than they were several years ago.	13.0	107.0
201609	945	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	These risks have implications for risk management in a low neutral rate environment, a subject we will return to tomorrow.	13.0	107.0
201609	946	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	107.0
201609	947	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	948	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13.0	65.0
201609	949	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201609	950	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I decided this time to do something slightly different than pore through the Tealbook to see whether I agreed with it or didn’t and just give a presentation from a less detailed viewpoint of what appears to be going on in the economy.	13.0	108.0
201609	951	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I’ll divide this into four unequal parts:  the labor market, inflation, economic growth, and tomorrow’s decision.	13.0	108.0
201609	952	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	First, the labor market.	13.0	108.0
201609	953	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Employment has been continuing to grow at a good pace, averaging 180,000 per month so far this year.	13.0	108.0
201609	954	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Calculations suggest that depending on the rate of labor force participation, it will take somewhere between 75,000 and 150,000 net new hires a month to keep the U-3 unemployment rate from rising.	13.0	108.0
201609	955	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Accordingly, the gloomy tone of the headlines about the 151,000 estimate of net new hires in August was not appropriate.	13.0	108.0
201609	956	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	One hears the concern that the U-3 unemployment rate has barely fallen over the course of the past 12 months, but over the same period, the participation rate has stopped falling.	13.0	108.0
201609	957	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I believe we should prefer the current labor market situation, in which people are being attracted back into the labor force while the unemployment rate remains constant, to a situation such as the one we faced in May, when the U-3 unemployment rate declined to 4.7 percent while the participation rate declined significantly.	13.0	108.0
201609	958	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	The rise in participation may reflect the effects of the modest pickup in wage growth we are now seeing, with the rate of increase of the employment cost index having risen from an annual rate of about 2 percent last year to around 2.5 percent this year.	13.0	108.0
201609	959	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Attention has also been drawn to the fact that the trend rate of new hires is declining, but that should not be a surprise as the labor market tightens.	13.0	108.0
201609	960	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Over the course of the past year, we have been concerned about the effects of a variety of negative shocks on the US economy, including the Chinese devaluation, market turbulence in the first six months of this year, the May pothole, Brexit, and more.	13.0	108.0
201609	961	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	But employment has resumed robust growth after each temporary slowdown.	13.0	108.0
201609	962	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	This has been, and continues to be, a powerful recovery, at least in terms of employment.	13.0	108.0
201609	963	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Let me turn now to the second part, inflation.	13.0	108.0
201609	964	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	We have not heard many complaints about the low rate of inflation from the general public.	13.0	108.0
201609	965	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	The 2 percent inflation target was set originally as a tradeoff between the many costs of positive inflation and the increased efficiency of reallocation in the labor market that a moderate rate of inflation makes possible.	13.0	108.0
201609	966	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I do not recall that the costs associated with a greater probability of being at the zero lower bound or the effective lower bound with a lower rate of inflation were taken into account at that time, which I think was the early and mid-’90s.	13.0	108.0
201609	967	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	The core rate of PCE inflation has been increasing since the middle of last year—slowly, to be sure—and is now close to our 2 percent target.	13.0	108.0
201609	968	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	In view of the imprecision of our estimates of the optimal rate of inflation, we should be happy to be as close as we are to the target we have chosen, particularly when the Phillips curve appears to be so flat.	13.0	108.0
201609	969	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	The CPI rate of core inflation has been above 2 percent and the rate of wage increase has been increasing, an indication that the Phillips curve lives, if not with the same vigor as in the past.	13.0	108.0
201609	970	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	But, on balance, I believe we are close to meeting our inflation target.	13.0	108.0
201609	971	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Let me discuss a few other aspects of the inflation target.	13.0	108.0
201609	972	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	One is the argument that because we set 2 percent as our target, that is the number we have to hit if we are to remain credible.	13.0	108.0
201609	973	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I give this argument some weight, though I do not believe we need to hit precisely 2 percent, but rather that some divergence should be permitted both above and below 2 percent.	13.0	108.0
201609	974	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Taking into account the confidence interval around the economic cost of diverging from the 2 percent target, which is wide, I believe it would have been better to define an optimal range for the inflation rate—for example, 1.5 to 2.5 percent—rather than a precise number.	13.0	108.0
201609	975	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	A final point on inflation.	13.0	108.0
201609	976	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	The jury is still out on whether there has been a permanent downward revision in the level of r*, something that’s extremely difficult to predict, both because the future is long and “permanent” is a long way off, and the standard deviation of r* is large, which is more relevant.	13.0	108.0
201609	977	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	However, as everyone knows, if r* remains low for a long time, monetary policy could be constrained by the ELB more frequently than in the past.	13.0	108.0
201609	978	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Should we, therefore, raise the target inflation rate, as many well-known economists have suggested?	13.0	108.0
201609	979	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Well, of course, the optimal rate of inflation is an area of active research and debate.	13.0	108.0
201609	980	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	But, actually, changing the target rate is a serious matter not to be entered into lightly.	13.0	108.0
201609	981	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	First, there are welfare costs to higher inflation, which kick in at a relatively low rate of inflation, especially in the form of indexation.	13.0	108.0
201609	982	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Further, there is the credibility cost of changing the target inflation rate, something that done once becomes a permanent credibility-reducing part of history.	13.0	108.0
201609	983	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	If such a step were nonetheless taken, it would be essential to include a formal mechanism for dealing with future changes in the target rate—for instance, the mechanism used by Canada in which the inflation target can, in principle, be reset every five years.	13.0	108.0
201609	984	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	So, on inflation, all this is to say that core PCE inflation is indeed approaching its target level, that real wages are rising at a more rapid rate than earlier in the post–Great Recession period, and that we need to think very hard before deciding to change the monetary framework to solve a problem that is likely to be solved within a year or two without changing the inflation target.	13.0	108.0
201609	985	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I will digress slightly into a discussion of economic growth, which will be short.	13.0	108.0
201609	986	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Each of us probably asks himself or herself, when wondering why people don’t like us, why our outstanding performance in the period since the fall of Lehman Brothers is so underappreciated.	13.0	108.0
201609	987	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I mean that.	13.0	108.0
201609	988	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I think the performance has been outstanding.	13.0	108.0
201609	989	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	The slow growth of the economy is due mainly to the extremely low rate of productivity growth, to which the low rate of physical investment contributes despite the near-zero short-term interest rate.	13.0	108.0
201609	990	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	But there’s not much we at the Federal Reserve can do that directly affects productivity growth except to maintain conditions conducive to investment and productivity growth by giving confidence to investors in the stability of the economy and the financial system and by continuing to support the excellent research on productivity growth of several of our economists.	13.0	108.0
201609	991	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Finally, the decision.	13.0	108.0
201609	992	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Our Committee has been justifiably cautious about raising the federal funds rate since 2009.	13.0	108.0
201609	993	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Two arguments have carried the day:  first, that we should not raise the rate because we could soon be forced to reduce it and return to the ZLB or ELB, thereby suffering a loss of credibility; and, second, that there’s very little difference between making the decision at this FOMC meeting rather than at a subsequent meeting.	13.0	108.0
201609	994	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	With regard to the credibility loss of having to return to the effective lower bound, there are also credibility costs to the extremely low frequency with which we have raised the interest rate since 2008.	13.0	108.0
201609	995	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	The argument I have just made is liable to be countered by the statement: “But it’s only because we kept the interest rate so low for so long that the US economy has performed so well since 2009.”	13.0	108.0
201609	996	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I’m sure that is right for a significant part of the period since 2009, but it remains to be shown that the performance of the economy would have been worse with an interest rate path 25 or 50 basis points above the path that was actually obtained during the past few years.	13.0	108.0
201609	997	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I’m aware that I’ve entered dangerous territory here, but it has been suggested that our superlow interest rates have encouraged financial transactions, particularly mergers and acquisitions, as much as they have encouraged physical investment.	13.0	108.0
201609	998	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	We’ve been sending a message to everyone in the economy that says the US economy is still weak and requires the support of superlow interest rates to grow, even at the moderate 2 percent rate to which we have all gradually become accustomed.	13.0	108.0
201609	999	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I do not believe that to be the case, and I do believe that we should very soon take the second step on our gradual path away from the ELB and toward interest rate normalization.	13.0	108.0
201609	1000	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Now, this is the less technical version.	13.0	108.0
201609	1001	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	For the technical version, I suggest you read again the presentation by President Rosengren in his remarks that opened this discussion.	13.0	108.0
201609	1002	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	13.0	108.0
201609	1003	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201609	1004	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest we take a coffee break—how about 25 minutes.	52.0	65.0
201609	1005	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	We will return at 5 minutes to 4:00.	52.0	65.0
201609	1007	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	52.0	65.0
201609	1008	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we continue our go-round with President Mester.	13.0	65.0
201609	1009	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201609	1010	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Overall, economic conditions in the Fourth District softened a bit in August.	13.0	999.0
201609	1011	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The Bank’s diffusion index of business contacts reporting better versus worse conditions declined to minus 4 from plus 18 at the time of our previous meeting.	13.0	999.0
201609	1012	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	This is the only negative reading in the index this year.	13.0	999.0
201609	1013	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	It dipped to become negative late last year as well, so it’s too soon to read too much into it at this point.	13.0	999.0
201609	1014	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	By sector, construction, freight, and banking continue to show positive readings.	13.0	999.0
201609	1015	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Energy was stable, and manufacturing and retail showed negative readings.	13.0	999.0
201609	1016	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Some District manufacturers and commercial construction firms reported that they put some planned investments on temporary hold.	13.0	999.0
201609	1017	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	In contrast, consumers in the District appear to be more optimistic.	13.0	999.0
201609	1018	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Delinquency rates across most consumer borrowing categories are down, and home prices and incomes are rising, all of which are supporting higher levels of consumer lending than we have seen for some time.	13.0	999.0
201609	1019	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Labor market conditions in the District remain healthy.	13.0	999.0
201609	1020	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	As of July, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland staff estimates that year-over-year growth in District payrolls was 1 percent, and the District’s unemployment rate remained low and stable at 5 percent.	13.0	999.0
201609	1021	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Anecdotal reports suggest District firms continue to add workers.	13.0	999.0
201609	1022	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	As was true last time, nearly all District sectors reported some upward pressure on wages, and the diffusion index of those reporting increases versus decreases has risen over the year.	13.0	999.0
201609	1023	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	District firms report that pressure on nonlabor input costs are rising this year as well.	13.0	999.0
201609	1024	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland Fed’s diffusion index of nonlabor costs, which was flat to negative last year, has steadily risen this year to more than 20.	13.0	999.0
201609	1025	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Prices received have also been generally moving up since the beginning of the year.	13.0	999.0
201609	1026	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Some manufacturers have told us that they have raised their finished good prices in recent weeks in response to higher steel prices.	13.0	999.0
201609	1027	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Construction companies have been reporting raising prices for some time either to cover rising import costs or in response to strong demand.	13.0	999.0
201609	1028	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	As far as the national economy is concerned, second-quarter GDP growth came in weaker than anticipated, with much of the drag reflecting weaker inventory investment.	13.0	999.0
201609	1029	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Although GDP growth was subdued in the first half of the year, incoming economic information summarized in the nowcasts suggests that growth will strengthen in the second half of the year, as the drag due to inventories wanes and consumer spending, buoyed by strength in labor markets and personal income growth, remains solid.	13.0	999.0
201609	1030	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Housing continues to improve at a gradual pace.	13.0	999.0
201609	1031	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The trouble spot continues to be weak business investment spending, but financial conditions, including low corporate bond spreads and stability in oil prices, are supportive of a coming pickup in investment.	13.0	999.0
201609	1032	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The July and August employment reports confirm continued solid performance in the labor market.	13.0	999.0
201609	1033	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Monthly payroll job gains have averaged 182,000 this year.	13.0	999.0
201609	1034	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Although this is down from last year’s average monthly pace of 229,000, it is well above current estimates of the pace of job growth consistent with estimated trends in output growth and the labor force participation rate.	13.0	999.0
201609	1035	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The Board staff estimates that range of job growth at 85,000 to 115,000 per month.	13.0	999.0
201609	1036	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Other estimates put it at 75,000 to 120,000 or even lower.	13.0	999.0
201609	1037	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The unemployment rate has been roughly stable around my estimate of its longer-run rate.	13.0	999.0
201609	1038	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	It and most of the other labor market indicators suggest to me that we are basically at full employment from the standpoint of what monetary policy can effectively address, and that labor market conditions will remain healthy.	13.0	999.0
201609	1039	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	We have seen some acceleration in wages, but productivity growth has been weaker than in earlier expansions.	13.0	999.0
201609	1040	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	If weak productivity growth persists, then it seems unlikely that wage growth will return to the pre-recession pace.	13.0	999.0
201609	1041	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Overall, my outlook for the US economy over the medium run is little changed since our previous meeting.	13.0	999.0
201609	1042	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I made relatively minor changes to my SEP forecasts of GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation since my SEP submission in June.	13.0	999.0
201609	1043	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	In response to the weak first-half data, I marked down my GDP growth forecast a tad for 2016 and less so for 2017.	13.0	999.0
201609	1044	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I continue to see the fundamentals, including accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions, improved household balance sheets, the strong labor market, and low and stable oil prices, as supportive of continued growth at the pace at or slightly above trend, which I put at 2 percent over the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201609	1045	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	This pace is sufficient to put downward pressure on the unemployment rate, which falls below my longer-run rate over the next two years before returning to my longer-run rate of 5 percent by the end of 2019.	13.0	999.0
201609	1046	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	My undershooting of the longer-run unemployment rate is less than in the Tealbook.	13.0	999.0
201609	1047	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I continue to anticipate that inflation will rise gradually toward our goal of 2 percent over the next couple of years.	13.0	999.0
201609	1048	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The trajectory of both headline and core inflation over the past year is consistent with this forecast.	13.0	999.0
201609	1049	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Headline PCE inflation has risen as the effects of the earlier declines in oil prices and appreciation of the dollar have passed through.	13.0	999.0
201609	1050	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Measured year-over- year, core PCE inflation and trimmed mean PCE inflation are 1.6 percent, which is near the goal.	13.0	999.0
201609	1051	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Other measures of underlying inflation, like core CPI and median CPI, have picked up to levels of more than 2 percent.	13.0	999.0
201609	1052	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland Federal Reserve median CPI measure has been above 2¼ percent all year and at or above 2½ percent for the past four months.	13.0	999.0
201609	1053	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Long-term inflation expectations from the Survey of Professional Forecasters and the Cleveland Federal Reserve 10-year and 5-year, 5-year-forward measures have been stable.	13.0	999.0
201609	1054	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The New York Fed’s measure of consumer inflation expectations two years ahead has moved up and down from month to month this year, averaging around 2.6 percent over the year to date.	13.0	999.0
201609	1055	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The University of Michigan survey measure of inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years has been trending down since 2013.	13.0	999.0
201609	1056	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Cleveland Federal Reserve staff’s analysis of the microdata underlying the survey indicates that over that time period, the numbers of respondents reporting expected inflation rates at 5 percent and at 10 percent have fallen.	13.0	999.0
201609	1057	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	It’s not clear whether this change in the distribution accounts for the downward trend in the median, which would be less susceptible to outliers than the mean would be.	13.0	999.0
201609	1058	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	So while the downward movement in the Michigan survey bears watching and further investigation, at this point I view longer-run inflation expectations as reasonably stable.	13.0	999.0
201609	1059	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	This, along with output growth at or slightly above trend and continued strength in the labor market, suggests that inflation is on a path of gradually returning to our 2 percent goal over the next couple of years, which is sooner than in the Tealbook forecast.	13.0	999.0
201609	1060	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I see the risks associated with my forecast as broadly balanced.	13.0	999.0
201609	1061	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Economic growth abroad and US investment spending could be weaker than I have assumed, but accommodative financial conditions could lead to stronger growth than I am anticipating.	13.0	999.0
201609	1062	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Inflation could remain below our target for longer than I have assumed, but accommodative monetary policy could lead to stronger price pressures.	13.0	999.0
201609	1063	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Risks to financial stability from very low interest rates appear to be contained, but a failure to implement a gradual rise in interest rates will increase these risks.	13.0	999.0
201609	1064	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I continue to project that a gradual upward path of interest rates over the forecast horizon will be appropriate.	13.0	999.0
201609	1065	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	On the basis of the evidence of how economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation have been evolving and the continued low estimates of the equilibrium real rate, I have revised down my estimate of the longer-run federal funds rate 25 basis points to 3 percent.	13.0	999.0
201609	1066	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I want to acknowledge that there is a wide confidence band around this estimate and that my 25 basis point reduction isn’t statistically significant.	13.0	999.0
201609	1067	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	But this revised estimate, coupled with my slightly weaker economic growth forecast, has led me to project a funds rate path that is 25 to 50 basis points more shallow over the forecast horizon than in my June projection.	13.0	999.0
201609	1068	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201609	1069	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	1070	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13.0	65.0
201609	1071	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201609	1072	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Anecdotal and aggregate statistical information received during the intermeeting period remains consistent with the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis’s new regime-based view of near-term macroeconomic outlook and monetary policy.	13.0	94.0
201609	1073	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Our view emphasizes a forecast that places real GDP growth at about 2 percent over the forecast horizon, with inflation also at about 2 percent.	13.0	94.0
201609	1074	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Unlike the Tealbook, we do not regard 2 percent real GDP growth as being meaningfully above trend.	13.0	94.0
201609	1075	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Consequently, we also expect relatively little change in the unemployment rate over the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201609	1076	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We think end-of- year unemployment rates will remain centered on 4.7 percent.	13.0	94.0
201609	1077	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We see optimal monetary policy as being regime dependent.	13.0	94.0
201609	1078	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Under the current regime, we see the current setting of the policy rate as being just slightly below neutral.	13.0	94.0
201609	1079	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We think there is a case to be made to move the policy rate to the regime-neutral value at some point.	13.0	94.0
201609	1080	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	However, unless there is a switch in regime, we think it is unwise to give the impression, as the Tealbook does and perhaps the dot plot does, that the Committee is on the precipice of a 275 basis point move in the policy rate over the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201609	1081	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Instead, we should acknowledge that, on the basis of the information we have today, we do not expect much different to happen over the next several years, and, therefore, we do not need to forecast a major move in the policy rate.	13.0	94.0
201609	1082	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	At the heart of the St Louis Federal Reserve view is that real GDP growth has been slow and is not expected to meaningfully accelerate.	13.0	94.0
201609	1083	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	The annualized real GDP growth rates for the past three quarters are 0.9 percent, 0.8 percent, and 1.1 percent, averaging about 1 percent, well below even pessimistic estimates of the potential real GDP growth rate.	13.0	94.0
201609	1084	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Although growth looks set to accelerate in the second half of 2016, all this will do if it materializes is bring the real GDP growth rate for all of 2016 somewhat closer to, but less than, 2 percent.	13.0	94.0
201609	1085	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Any acceleration from there into 2017 is likely to be modest and is, in my mind, a speculative guess.	13.0	94.0
201609	1086	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I think it strains credulity to suggest that eight years after the Committee moved the policy rate close to zero, there is still any meaningful cyclical dynamic that would push the real output growth rate above potential in a statistically significant way.	13.0	94.0
201609	1087	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	A better way to think about the current situation is to accept that the current real output growth rate is slow and likely not too different from the potential growth rate.	13.0	94.0
201609	1088	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	The corollary is that the unemployment rate is likely to remain in the 4½ to 5 percent range as long as we remain in the current regime.	13.0	94.0
201609	1089	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	This is what happened during 2006 and 2007, a period that was arguably characterized by stronger GDP growth—due in part to the housing bubble, to be sure—than what we are witnessing today.	13.0	94.0
201609	1090	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Inflation has been running somewhat below 2 percent according to PCE-based measures, with CPI-based measures somewhat higher.	13.0	94.0
201609	1091	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We think an inflation forecast centered on 2 percent over the forecast horizon is reasonable.	13.0	94.0
201609	1092	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I was encouraged, in reaching this forecast, by page 22 of Tealbook A, which gives the staff forecast of headline PCE inflation, core PCE inflation, and core CPI inflation in graphical format with 70 percent confidence intervals.	13.0	94.0
201609	1093	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I think it is reasonable to interpret these figures as illustrating forecasts essentially centered at 2 percent over the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201609	1094	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I do remain concerned that market-based measures of inflation expectations remain too low to be consistent with the 2 percent inflation forecast.	13.0	94.0
201609	1095	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	This is a risk to the outlook that I have described.	13.0	94.0
201609	1096	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Output growing at its potential rate, unemployment essentially unchanging, and inflation expected to hit 2 percent sounds like a steady state.	13.0	94.0
201609	1097	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	However, the regime-switching conceptualization acknowledges that this situation can and will change at some point in the future.	13.0	94.0
201609	1098	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	The most likely candidates for a switch in regime are, one, faster productivity growth and, two, an abating of the very large liquidity premium on short-term government debt.	13.0	94.0
201609	1099	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Both of these possibilities would suggest upside risk to the St Louis Federal Reserve’s policy rate forecast.	13.0	94.0
201609	1100	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	However, as of today, I see little evidence that a switch is occurring on either of these dimensions.	13.0	94.0
201609	1101	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Accordingly, we continue to assume we are in a low-growth regime, driven in part by low productivity growth, as well as in a regime characterized by very low real rates of return on short-term government debt, the so-called r†.	13.0	94.0
201609	1102	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	This, in turn, leads us to project a very flat policy rate path over the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201609	1103	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201609	1104	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201609	1105	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	13.0	65.0
201609	1106	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201609	1107	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Overall economic activity in the Third District has been somewhat sluggish over the intermeeting period.	13.0	999.0
201609	1108	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Job growth continues to lag the nation, with employment growing a mere 0.7 percent in July, less than half that of the nation.	13.0	999.0
201609	1109	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	And the unemployment rate ticked up another 0.1 percentage point to 5.4 percent.	13.0	999.0
201609	1110	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	In part, the increase in unemployment is due to a stronger rebound in labor force participation than one sees nationally.	13.0	999.0
201609	1111	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Additionally, the sharp contraction in mining and drilling in the Marcellus shale region was responsible for much of the weaker job growth in the region.	13.0	999.0
201609	1112	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	And to give you some sense of the sharpness of that contraction, the number of active wells in Pennsylvania has gone over the past few years from more than 4,600 to around 200 today.	13.0	999.0
201609	1113	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Manufacturing has picked up a bit, with the general activity index in our Business Outlook Survey now in positive territory.	13.0	999.0
201609	1114	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	At 12.8, the September index is slightly above its nonrecessionary average.	13.0	999.0
201609	1115	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	The new orders index eked into positive territory as well, but shipments contracted and, although employment improved substantially, that index remained in negative territory.	13.0	999.0
201609	1116	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Survey respondents remain upbeat, with all of the forward-looking indexes showing substantial optimism.	13.0	999.0
201609	1117	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	In a series of special questions, we attempted to gauge the future capital spending plans of manufacturers in the region.	13.0	999.0
201609	1118	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	A vast majority indicated that they primarily intended to modernize existing manufacturing processes, while only one-third indicated they intended to expand facilities.	13.0	999.0
201609	1119	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Very few, roughly 17 percent, indicated that they were looking to grow through acquisition.	13.0	999.0
201609	1120	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Further, modernization has taken on increasing importance in firm planning, with roughly 60 percent of firms indicating that it was now more important to them than it had been over the past five years.	13.0	999.0
201609	1121	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Some reasons cited for this shift in priorities were increases in labor costs due to government mandates such as the ACA and the need or desire to replace labor with robotics and automation.	13.0	999.0
201609	1122	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Thus, there was not much in the responses to indicate why we have been seeing such very weak investment numbers at the national level.	13.0	999.0
201609	1123	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	But this type of investment activity may lead to better productivity numbers down the road.	13.0	999.0
201609	1124	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	At my recent board of directors meeting, the board of directors, on the other hand, expressed unanimous sentiment that policy uncertainty is weighing on capital expenditure plans.	13.0	999.0
201609	1125	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	As one director phrased it, “The data are positive.	13.0	999.0
201609	1126	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	It’s the psychology that’s driving caution.”	13.0	999.0
201609	1127	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	The FOMC is also viewed as contributing to that uncertainty.	13.0	999.0
201609	1128	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	A lack of confidence to raise rates is causing business leaders to wonder what the FOMC is seeing that they are not.	13.0	999.0
201609	1129	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	That is not to say that policy is not being conducted systematically.	13.0	999.0
201609	1130	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	I think there is a lot of coherence to our deliberations.	13.0	999.0
201609	1131	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	But the view around my boardroom seems to indicate the existence of communications challenges that we as a Committee may not be fully addressing.	13.0	999.0
201609	1132	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Another director characterized the climate as one of “caution, caution, caution.”	13.0	999.0
201609	1133	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Thus, the opinions of my directors appear consistent with what we’re seeing in the investment data.	13.0	999.0
201609	1134	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Regarding the labor market, we are hearing a rising crescendo of complaints regarding the inability to fill high-skilled positions, which is consistent with the growing gap between the job openings rate and the hiring rate in the JOLTS data.	13.0	999.0
201609	1135	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	We are also hearing instances of fairly aggressive nominal wage growth as well.	13.0	999.0
201609	1136	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	For example, a local hospital has just raised wages for its nursing staff 9 percent and is considering additional increases.	13.0	999.0
201609	1137	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	A few other areas in the District are doing well.	13.0	999.0
201609	1138	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	One such area is construction, in which we are seeing fairly strong growth.	13.0	999.0
201609	1139	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Although the value of permits has recently declined, the value of contracts remains at a high level, and nonresidential construction in the District continues to outpace that of the nation.	13.0	999.0
201609	1140	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	The trend in the mix of new housing construction in the District has also gravitated toward a greater share of multifamily units.	13.0	999.0
201609	1141	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	That may be the cause for an interesting behavioral element that one of my directors, who has an interest in an organic pet food company, pointed out—namely, that there has been a shift in dog ownership preferences to smaller dogs.	13.0	999.0
201609	1142	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Perhaps baby boomers and millennials find smaller dogs more conducive to an urban lifestyle.	13.0	999.0
201609	1143	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	But related to being a dog owner, one of my other directors brought up the following.	13.0	999.0
201609	1144	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	There has been an interesting innovation in the fintech community.	13.0	999.0
201609	1145	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	A company called Wags Lending has pioneered a financial contract that provides for leasing with an option of buying a dog.	13.0	999.0
201609	1146	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	He estimates that we should see a drop in the dog unemployment rate we commonly refer to as the “U-canine.”	13.0	999.0
201609	1147	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Sorry, I had to do that.	13.0	999.0
201609	1148	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	[Laughter]	13.0	999.0
201609	1149	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Regarding Third District consumers, the pace of activity has diminished somewhat, which was reflected in the general activity index in our nonmanufacturing survey.	13.0	999.0
201609	1150	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	It fell to slightly below its nonrecessionary average.	13.0	999.0
201609	1151	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	However, in our District, auto sales continue to be brisk and consumers remain optimistic.	13.0	999.0
201609	1152	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Overall, the Third District is seeing and should continue to see steady if unspectacular growth, and contacts remain upbeat about the future.	13.0	999.0
201609	1153	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	For the nation as a whole, I, like many of you, anticipate a solid bounceback in economic activity this quarter, with a gradual return to trend growth over the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201609	1154	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Thus, my economic projections are not much different from those of the staff, although I see inflation returning to trend at a bit brisker pace.	13.0	999.0
201609	1155	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Much of the near-term acceleration activity is driven by strong consumption growth and by a bounceback in inventories.	13.0	999.0
201609	1156	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	I believe that economic fundamentals are in line with this view, as income growth has been solid and balance sheets remain healthy.	13.0	999.0
201609	1157	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Thus, I see 1.8 percent GDP growth for this year, 2.3 percent growth in 2017, and a return to trend-like growth over the rest of the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201609	1158	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	My main concern is the low productivity growth that we’ve experienced of late.	13.0	999.0
201609	1159	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	The recovery will look increasingly fragile if productivity growth does not strengthened.	13.0	999.0
201609	1160	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Regarding unemployment, I envision job growth will gradually taper to a rate consistent with the constant rate of unemployment, but my projections of the unemployment rate do somewhat undershoot that level, falling to 4.4 percent in 2017 before beginning to rise very gradually.	13.0	999.0
201609	1161	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	And with respect to inflation, I continue to anticipate a gradual return to target, with the return achieved perhaps as early as the beginning of 2018.	13.0	999.0
201609	1162	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	With that projection in hand, I see a gradual rise in the funds rate as appropriate with the funds rate slightly exceeding its long-run value of 3 percent in 2019.	13.0	999.0
201609	1163	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	My somewhat optimistic outlook will inform my views on policy tomorrow.	13.0	999.0
201609	1164	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201609	1165	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	1166	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	13.0	65.0
201609	1167	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201609	1168	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I’ll start with a discussion of the District, and I’ll begin with energy.	13.0	110.0
201609	1169	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Our view on energy, despite recent price volatility, is basically the same as it was at the previous FOMC meeting.	13.0	110.0
201609	1170	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	We continue to believe that global supply and demand will move into balance sometime during the first half of 2017, and that global oil inventories will begin to climb in the third quarter of 2017.	13.0	110.0
201609	1171	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Some observers, particularly recently, see this process taking six months longer, but we continue to expect that daily demand will increase approximately 1.3 million barrels per day in 2016 and 2017 and that this growth in demand, along with a slowing trajectory of growth in global supply—which includes significant cuts in the United States—should ultimately lead to balance.	13.0	110.0
201609	1172	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	We expect continued price volatility, though, during the intervening period, but we expect the overall trend in prices to be one of firming as we move toward balance.	13.0	110.0
201609	1173	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Several factors apprear to have contributed to the recent price volatility.	13.0	110.0
201609	1174	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	First, refinery margins are very volatile, and they can influence the level of gasoline inventories.	13.0	110.0
201609	1175	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Our view is that market participants may, in some cases, have overread the implications of excess gasoline inventories for oil supply.	13.0	110.0
201609	1176	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	We prefer to focus on global oil supply and demand as more essential.	13.0	110.0
201609	1177	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Second, there’s been talk from Russia and OPEC members about a production freeze.	13.0	110.0
201609	1178	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	We continue to believe, on the basis of conversations we have had with our contacts, that a freeze is unlikely, but the talk about this has probably had some positive effects on prices over the past couple of months.	13.0	110.0
201609	1179	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	And, third, there have been outages, which we’ve mentioned before, in Nigeria, Libya, Canada, Iraq, and other nations, which appear to have caused trading participants at times to be unduly optimistic about the timing of supply–demand balance.	13.0	110.0
201609	1180	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	It’s our view that most of these outages are going to be restored, although Nigeria and Libya will persist for some time.	13.0	110.0
201609	1181	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	So with all of this, the rig count in Texas is starting to build, albeit very gradually, and we think that expansion will only accelerate if prices rise to between $50 and $60 a barrel, and we’re not there yet.	13.0	110.0
201609	1182	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Even in the Permian, the breakeven is above $50 a barrel.	13.0	110.0
201609	1183	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Certainly on many long-lived projects, the breakeven is much higher, and we are a considerable period of time away from significant investment in those.	13.0	110.0
201609	1184	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	We continue to believe there will be more bankruptcies, mergers, and restructurings in this sector, in view of the existence of several highly leveraged companies as well as the fact that breakeven levels for shale in the Permian Basin are well in excess of $50 a barrel.	13.0	110.0
201609	1185	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Overall, though, we think the energy sector will only be a modest headwind for our District for the remainder of 2016 as opposed to being the significant headwind that it was in the first half of the year.	13.0	110.0
201609	1186	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	In connection with that point, employment growth in the state of Texas was flat for the first six months of 2016.	13.0	110.0
201609	1187	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	We think the second half of 2016 is looking considerably brighter, and we’re expecting approximately 2 percent job growth for the last half of the year.	13.0	110.0
201609	1188	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	And our forecast now is for 2 percent job growth during 2017.	13.0	110.0
201609	1189	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Texas continues to benefit from significant continued migration of people and firms to the state, and we expect this trend to continue in 2017.	13.0	110.0
201609	1190	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	For the nation, my projections regarding the US economy in the latest SEP round are strongly influenced by analysis recently conducted at the Dallas Federal Reserve and around the Federal Reserve System, which suggests that the economy’s real growth potential is only about 1¾ percent or lower,in light of demographic and productivity trends, and that the longer-run normal federal funds rate is certainly lower than it has been previously.	13.0	110.0
201609	1191	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	In response, I’ve lowered my projected path of both GDP growth and the funds rate.	13.0	110.0
201609	1192	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	We’re participant number 12, by the way, in the dot plot.	13.0	110.0
201609	1193	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I’ve not materially changed my projections regarding unemployment or inflation.	13.0	110.0
201609	1194	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	We continue to forecast that, under appropriate policy, the unemployment rate will fall modestly from its current level, and we continue to believe that this drop in unemployment will be accompanied by some level of improved nominal wage growth.	13.0	110.0
201609	1195	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	The Dallas trimmed mean PCE inflation rate has been running between 1.6 and 1.7 percent for the past year and a half.	13.0	110.0
201609	1196	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Imbedded in this rate is a historically muted level of health- care inflation, and we’ve been talking more recently at our bank about whether this muted level of health-care inflation is likely to persist.	13.0	110.0
201609	1197	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Overall, these numbers give us confidence that we will gradually move toward our 2 percent objective in the medium term.	13.0	110.0
201609	1198	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	A word about the recent ISM surveys, which have been weak.	13.0	110.0
201609	1199	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	We prefer to look at the three-month moving averages of both the nonmanufacturing and the manufacturing surveys.	13.0	110.0
201609	1200	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Both have held steady on a three-month moving average basis.	13.0	110.0
201609	1201	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	In addition, the NFIB small business survey for August, initial unemployment insurance claims, and various surveys of consumer attitudes tell us that we are not seeing a deterioration in the outlook.	13.0	110.0
201609	1202	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Let me just briefly comment on our discussion with contacts in our District about business investment.	13.0	110.0
201609	1203	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	We also see, as many of you do, business leaders continuing to be cautious about hiring plans and capacity expansion.	13.0	110.0
201609	1204	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Apart from the obvious effect of lower oil prices on energy cap-ex, we also see business cap-ex being held back by sluggish global demand, high rates of industry disruption, challenging levels of regulatory requirements, and one more factor, a rise in shareholder activism, which has shortened time horizons for CEOs and their boards of directors.	13.0	110.0
201609	1205	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	CEO tenures in this country are shorter.	13.0	110.0
201609	1206	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Investment time frames are shorter.	13.0	110.0
201609	1207	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Activism is on the rise.	13.0	110.0
201609	1208	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Investor patience is as short as at any time in my career, and the threat of fund redemptions is as high as I’ve ever seen it because investors are searching, and in some cases desperately searching, for adequate return.	13.0	110.0
201609	1209	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	All of this makes capital spending, which pays off with lags of 5 to 10 years or more, much tougher to justify versus share repurchase and dividend increases.	13.0	110.0
201609	1210	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I don’t see this changing materially in the months and years ahead unless there are changes to business incentives for capital spending.	13.0	110.0
201609	1211	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	One other comment outside the United States.	13.0	110.0
201609	1212	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	A team from the Dallas Federal Reserve visited Beijing and Shanghai in August.	13.0	110.0
201609	1213	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I know a number of others around this table also visited China in the past two months.	13.0	110.0
201609	1214	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	This trip confirmed our analysis regarding high levels of overcapacity, growing levels of debt to GDP—particularly to support an economic growth rate of 6½ percent, which we think is artificially elevated—the challenges of an aging workforce, and the challenges of a transition to a more consumer-service oriented economy.	13.0	110.0
201609	1215	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	It is clear, on the basis of our discussions throughout that country, that currency controls have been dramatically tightened to reduce outflows and that nonperforming loans are likely closer to $2 trillion than $1 trillion.	13.0	110.0
201609	1216	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	These issues, though, are mitigated by the fact that most of these loans have been made by government-owned entities to government-controlled entities, and China has shown an ability to keep the need for external capital to a relatively modest level.	13.0	110.0
201609	1217	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	So the trip reinforced our view that while non-performing loans  are building, China can manage them because of the internal nature of its debt problem.	13.0	110.0
201609	1218	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	There’s a question about how effective the currency controls are going to be and whether they’re going to be able to bind things the way they have, even with the recent deterioration in the currency.	13.0	110.0
201609	1219	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	As the private sector continues to grow in China, the country hopes to steadily reduce its reliance on state-owned enterprises, but there’s no question that the challenges faced by China are unlikely to be resolved in quarters or years—it’s more likely to take decades.	13.0	110.0
201609	1220	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	And in the meantime, we believe that the world is certainly going to have to become accustomed to lower levels of Chinese GDP growth and may suffer periodic bouts of financial instability in the same manner that we saw in January and February.	13.0	110.0
201609	1221	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201609	1222	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	1223	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13.0	65.0
201609	1224	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201609	1225	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Before I dive into my laboriously prepared and scripted report, I need to prepare everyone for a euphemism I will use about halfway through my remarks.	13.0	91.0
201609	1226	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	The quickest explanation is the following example of a backyard family conversation: “Mommy, what did Daddy say just now when he hit his thumb with the hammer?”	13.0	91.0
201609	1227	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	“ ‘Shirt,’ dear.	13.0	91.0
201609	1228	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Daddy said, ‘Shirt.’ ”	13.0	91.0
201609	1229	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	13.0	91.0
201609	1230	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	All right.	13.0	91.0
201609	1231	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	With this modest preamble, I will try to avoid reading from the Governor Rick Mishkin playbook.	13.0	91.0
201609	1232	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	13.0	91.0
201609	1233	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Now, the reports from my directors and other business contacts were quite similar to those in the previous round.	13.0	91.0
201609	1234	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	On balance, the mixed tone of the commentary continues to feel consistent with the 1 to 2 percent GDP growth rates we’ve seen over the past year.	13.0	91.0
201609	1235	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	As we’ve been hearing for some time, consumer-facing businesses are holding up well.	13.0	91.0
201609	1236	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	In Chicago, we also heard some encouraging news about nonresidential construction and the labor market serving these projects.	13.0	91.0
201609	1237	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	My labor union director, who heads the Chicago Federation of Labor, reported that several new large building projects are luring workers out of retirement and justifying the expansion of sorely needed apprenticeship programs.	13.0	91.0
201609	1238	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	However, local stories like these are tempered by other national contacts who are less sanguine about construction for the United States as a whole.	13.0	91.0
201609	1239	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Furthermore, many non-consumer-facing businesses, especially in manufacturing, face lingering challenges.	13.0	91.0
201609	1240	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Our steel contacts note that mills are reducing capacity in response to falling demand.	13.0	91.0
201609	1241	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	A director who formerly headed a nationwide trucking company reported that the freight industry no longer needs to expand capacity.	13.0	91.0
201609	1242	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	The demand for new heavy trucks has fallen sharply, and the industry is no longer facing a significant shortage of drivers.	13.0	91.0
201609	1243	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	With regard to the international situation, several contacts reported that their global sales are improving, but in many countries these gains are just coming off the bottom, and they still see the level of demand as relatively weak and the outlook as highly uncertain.	13.0	91.0
201609	1244	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	On the financial front, regulatory changes have increased some short-term borrowing costs, but my contacts said that longer-term debt markets continue to be highly receptive to investment-grade issuers.	13.0	91.0
201609	1245	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I heard contrasting stories about risk-taking.	13.0	91.0
201609	1246	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	My director from Discover Financial noted some stretch-for-yield activities.	13.0	91.0
201609	1247	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Some of his credit card competitors are increasing card issuance to households further down the credit spectrum and luring customers with overly generous rewards programs.	13.0	91.0
201609	1248	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	He thinks they will be unprofitable.	13.0	91.0
201609	1249	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	In contrast, several contacts mentioned increased equity in commercial real estate markets.	13.0	91.0
201609	1250	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	One report characterized a type of deal that last year would have been written at 35 percent equity and 65 percent debt.	13.0	91.0
201609	1251	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Now, similar deals are being struck at a 50–50 split, so there’s a noticeable shift to more equity and less debt.	13.0	91.0
201609	1252	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	In addition, this report cited tougher recourse provisions in these transactions.	13.0	91.0
201609	1253	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	We heard that private equity deals were also being structured with somewhat less leverage.	13.0	91.0
201609	1254	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	The loans are still often covenant-lite, but the borrowers now have more skin in the game.	13.0	91.0
201609	1255	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Turning to our economic growth outlook—and, by the way, we are number 11 in the SEP—we expect increased inventory accumulation and some pickup in business fixed investment.	13.0	91.0
201609	1256	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	These factors will lift real GDP growth to around a 2¾ percent annual rate during the second half of this year.	13.0	91.0
201609	1257	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	In 2017 and 2018, we see GDP growth averaging just over 2 percent, roughly similar to the Tealbook.	13.0	91.0
201609	1258	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	We do differ with the Tealbook, however, on the degree of slack we see in the economy.	13.0	91.0
201609	1259	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	For 2016, we estimate the natural rate of unemployment to be 4.7 percent.	13.0	91.0
201609	1260	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	We also think the labor force participation rate is still a little below trend.	13.0	91.0
201609	1261	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	These observations and others from wages indicate that some slack remains in the labor market.	13.0	91.0
201609	1262	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	In our forecast, resource gaps are closed by the end of 2017.	13.0	91.0
201609	1263	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	There is some modest overshooting thereafter, though less than in the Tealbook.	13.0	91.0
201609	1264	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I should note that we expect demographic factors to lower the natural rate of unemployment gradually, by 5 basis points annually for some time.	13.0	91.0
201609	1265	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	By 2020, our estimate is down to 4½ percent.	13.0	91.0
201609	1266	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	More generally, uncertainty seems high.	13.0	91.0
201609	1267	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Corporate expectations for capacity expansion seem weak, and I continue to see downside risk to our outlook for economic growth.	13.0	91.0
201609	1268	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Our main concern is that if the US consumer begins to falter, there will be no component of domestic or foreign demand to pick up the slack for the foreseeable future.	13.0	91.0
201609	1269	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Even though things have been relatively quiet of late, the international situation definitely remains an important risk.	13.0	91.0
201609	1270	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	On the domestic front, my biggest concern is that business caution will hold back capital spending more than we expect and may even impinge on future hiring.	13.0	91.0
201609	1271	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	All right, now for the euphemism.	13.0	91.0
201609	1272	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Am I the only one who talks to business CEOs who describe their challenges as selecting from a “shirt” bucket of low-growth opportunities?	13.0	91.0
201609	1274	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Apparently.	13.0	102.0
201609	1275	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13.0	102.0
201609	1276	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	This remark came from a CEO describing the most recent discussions of the Business Roundtable, and it is discouraging.	13.0	91.0
201609	1277	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Separately, but along this same theme, Manpower Employment Services’s CEO said most of his customers expect to be in cost-cutting mode next year.	13.0	91.0
201609	1278	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Such plans hardly are consistent with an outbreak of capital spending.	13.0	91.0
201609	1279	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Also, the head of John Deere reported that its internal baseline projection for 2017 is for a slight decline in equipment sales, but the company is preparing for the possibility of even worse outcomes.	13.0	91.0
201609	1280	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	As corporate CEOs prepare to navigate an economy with 1¾ to perhaps 2 percent trend growth, I realize that I haven’t spoken with anyone who talks about robust expansion plans in the United States.	13.0	91.0
201609	1281	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Turning to inflation, my numbers are again close to the Tealbook.	13.0	91.0
201609	1282	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I see both core and total inflation moving up gradually but still falling short of our 2 percent target at the end of 2019.	13.0	91.0
201609	1283	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	While we see less overshooting of potential output than the Tealbook, our forecast is conditioned on a flat dollar and a somewhat slower pace of policy normalization.	13.0	91.0
201609	1284	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Our monetary policy assumption is a key factor in our forecast narrative, as we see it bolstering inflation expectations and their eventual upward pull on actual pricing.	13.0	91.0
201609	1285	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	That said, I again see downside risk to this forecast.	13.0	91.0
201609	1286	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	TIPS-derived inflation compensation in financial markets and many survey measures of inflation expectations remain low, and my business contacts report few inflationary pressures and no appreciable pricing power.	13.0	91.0
201609	1287	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	We have heard more accounts of wage increases, but it is striking how modest the gains are.	13.0	91.0
201609	1288	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	There are very few reports that appear commensurate with the 2 percent PCE inflation environment.	13.0	91.0
201609	1289	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	If we were likely to see a quick return to 2 percent inflation, I would expect to see more bubbling up with these indicators by now, but there just isn’t that much there.	13.0	91.0
201609	1290	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Instead, I see a rather firmly entrenched low-inflation psychology.	13.0	91.0
201609	1291	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, why are businesses holding the line on wages even when many tell us there’s a shortage of workers?	13.0	91.0
201609	1292	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	It must be because they don’t expect to be able to increase prices enough to justify the expense.	13.0	91.0
201609	1293	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	This psychology is unlikely to change quickly, not without more dramatic and sustained increases in aggregate demand or something else supporting expectations of upward movement and underlying inflation.	13.0	91.0
201609	1294	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Until this happens, even modest inflation increases remain more of a hope than a solid expectation.	13.0	91.0
201609	1295	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201609	1296	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	1297	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13.0	65.0
201609	1298	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	102.0
201609	1299	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	During the past few meetings, the economy has had several flares fly across the bow.	13.0	102.0
201609	1300	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	We saw jobs data, financial volatility, and Brexit worries, but each of these shots passed without effect, and, all told, the expansion remains solid and on track.	13.0	102.0
201609	1301	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	As others have said, we’re on course to add nearly 2¼ million jobs this year, and that’s far more than the million or so that we need to keep pace with labor force growth.	13.0	102.0
201609	1302	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’d like to comment on something President Evans said, which I agree with.	13.0	102.0
201609	1303	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I hear some similar remarks.	13.0	102.0
201609	1304	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	We have a trucking company and a couple of metals companies on our boards, and I’m definitely hearing the exact same thing.	13.0	102.0
201609	1305	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So there’s no question about that.	13.0	102.0
201609	1306	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	But then, when you switch over to anyone who’s affected by the energy industry, the strong dollar, some of these other factors, you definitely hear more negative comments.	13.0	102.0
201609	1307	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	On the services and consumer sides, I hear much more positive comments.	13.0	102.0
201609	1308	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the end, the comments I hear from our directors and our business contacts are consistent with what we’re seeing in the overall economy—that consumer services are really driving economic growth today.	13.0	102.0
201609	1309	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s above trend because it has to make up for weakness in other areas.	13.0	102.0
201609	1310	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I actually agree with that way of describing it, and I think it reflects what we see in the data when you look at how we’re getting the real GDP growth that we’re getting.	13.0	102.0
201609	1311	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Also, when I look across my District, one of the things that I find encouraging is that job growth has been pretty broad based.	13.0	102.0
201609	1312	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	A lot of people think, “Well, it’s San Francisco, of course it’s booming.”	13.0	102.0
201609	1313	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, generally, seven of the nine states in the 12th District are among the fastest growing in the United States.	13.0	102.0
201609	1314	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s different stories.	13.0	102.0
201609	1315	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I was just in Reno, Nevada, where it’s really just a story of recovery from a very deep recession.	13.0	102.0
201609	1316	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	In other states, like Utah, it’s just a very strong economy.	13.0	102.0
201609	1317	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, overall, I’m seeing good growth broadly, not just in the very hot areas like the Bay Area and Seattle.	13.0	102.0
201609	1318	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Looking ahead, I think that real GDP growth will be about 1¾ percent on a national basis this year, which is faster than my estimate of potential.	13.0	102.0
201609	1319	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	My outlook hasn’t changed much over this year.	13.0	102.0
201609	1320	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Economic data, as they relate to our dual mandate, continued to meet or beat expectations, and the domestic headwinds slowing the economy have eased.	13.0	102.0
201609	1321	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	In particular, government spending on all levels is on the upswing, and households have registered solid gains in disposable income and net wealth and are well positioned for strong consumption.	13.0	102.0
201609	1322	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	With output and unemployment gaps now closed and substantial monetary accommodation still in place, I expect that the economy will overshoot potential next year, and that will push the unemployment rate down to nearly 4½ percent.	13.0	102.0
201609	1323	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the resulting upward pressure on inflation should speed the return to our 2 percent price objective, which I expect to reach by the end of next year.	13.0	102.0
201609	1324	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I view the risks to the outlook as basically balanced and similar to those of the past 20 years, especially in light of the diminished downside risk emanating from abroad.	13.0	102.0
201609	1325	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Importantly, this projection embeds an assumption of an appropriate policy rate path, with two increases in the funds rate this year and four in 2017.	13.0	102.0
201609	1326	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Perhaps the most crucial issue regarding the forecast is not so much what the specific numbers are, but how they relate to the “new normal” for steady-state growth.	13.0	102.0
201609	1327	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	On this point, I found the box in Tealbook A about the neutral pace of payroll growth a very useful reminder that steady-state monthly employment gains are much lower than what we’ve been used to in the past.	13.0	102.0
201609	1328	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	As I mentioned in a previous meeting, looking across a lot of estimates, including those obtained by our colleagues at the Chicago Federal Reserve, my own view is that something like 80,000 jobs is the likely benchmark as we go forward.	13.0	102.0
201609	1329	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, we’ve been averaging about 180,000 jobs per month this year, and that’s an extraordinary pace that can’t be sustained forever.	13.0	102.0
201609	1330	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	The special staff memos on the new lower estimates of g* and r*, I thought, were very useful.	13.0	102.0
201609	1331	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	They were clear, concise, and astutely aware of the relevant literature.	13.0	102.0
201609	1332	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	As the memos describe—yes, I’m only reading what I was given [laughter]—there is growing consensus that a long period of slow productivity growth is under way.	13.0	102.0
201609	1333	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Modest underlying productivity growth, combined with slower growth in labor quality and less favorable demographics, means that 2.5 percent real GDP growth on a sustainable basis just isn’t possible anymore.	13.0	102.0
201609	1334	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, people’s estimates differ by a tenth or two here and there.	13.0	102.0
201609	1335	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	My own estimate is that longer-run potential output growth is 1.6 percent.	13.0	102.0
201609	1336	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, looking at most forecasters, they have taken on board the idea that something around 1½ percent is more likely than something like 2½ percent.	13.0	102.0
201609	1337	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	In that context, the real GDP growth of about 1 percent in the first half of this year was really only a bit below trend.	13.0	102.0
201609	1338	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	As noted in the Board staff memo, the continuation of slow real growth has implications for r*.	13.0	102.0
201609	1339	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, in the model that Thomas Laubach and I developed a while ago, the effect is roughly one-for-one with the neutral real rate falling with lower potential output growth.	13.0	102.0
201609	1340	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have for this reason—but on the basis of a lot of analysis—lowered my own estimate of r* to ¾ percent, down from 1 percent in June, much like the Tealbook assumption.	13.0	102.0
201609	1341	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	One comment I’d like to make on the r* issue that does come up in thinking about monetary policy is that from my own perspective, I felt that the short-run r*, if you will, has been around zero.	13.0	102.0
201609	1342	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that is consistent with some analysis that Thomas has done, consistent with—I guess I’m peeking ahead at your memo—with a number of our views here.	13.0	102.0
201609	1343	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So in the short run, I felt that an r* of zero was about right.	13.0	102.0
201609	1344	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	The real question is whether this a transitory phenomenon and we’re going to move back to a more normal level, or is this really something that’s going to be—I don’t know about permanent, but will be with us for 5 or 10 years?	13.0	102.0
201609	1345	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	And that’s really the area in which the evolution in my thinking has happened.	13.0	102.0
201609	1346	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	The short-run r* has been at zero for quite some time, and I haven’t changed that view.	13.0	102.0
201609	1347	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s really more the accumulation of evidence not only in the United States—from different models, different approaches—but also recent work showing that r* seems to have fallen more broadly across countries that’s pushed me in the direction of lowering my long-run r*.	13.0	102.0
201609	1348	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s one way you can try to figure out how I can have my own views of the short run.	13.0	102.0
201609	1349	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s not really about changing my views on the short-run r*, it’s really about how much of that is likely to be with us for 5 to 10 years.	13.0	102.0
201609	1350	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Another steady-state star variable, if you will, that has come up a few times already today is u*, the natural rate of unemployment, and, of course, that can move around over time.	13.0	102.0
201609	1351	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	In particular, demographics have an effect on the natural rate, and President Evans talked a bit about that.	13.0	102.0
201609	1352	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Younger workers consistently face higher unemployment rates than older workers, so the fall in the share of younger workers in the labor force is pushing down the natural rate, all else being equal.	13.0	102.0
201609	1353	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Typically, economists use these fixed-weight unemployment rates or demographically adjusted unemployment rates to try to take that into account.	13.0	102.0
201609	1354	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	My own staff has developed a more granular demographic adjustment.	13.0	102.0
201609	1355	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	They went to the underlying microdata of the six fundamental labor force transitions on the movements between “employment,”	13.0	102.0
201609	1356	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	The analysis based on this method shows that over the past decade or so, changes in the demographic composition of the labor force have lowered the natural rate, as President Evans and others have said, but by only about ¼ percentage point.	13.0	102.0
201609	1357	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So taking this onboard, it’s consistent with a view that the natural rate is somewhere between 4.75 and 5 percent, but I don’t think demographics can push you—at least where we are today—to a much lower view of the natural rate of unemployment.	13.0	102.0
201609	1358	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, there are other factors besides demographics that can affect the natural rate of unemployment.	13.0	102.0
201609	1359	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s useful to look at a lot of other measures: Vacancy rates as well as survey data on the ease of finding jobs and filling jobs have continued to improve and are at levels consistent with our maximum employment goal.	13.0	102.0
201609	1360	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Furthermore, several measures of wage growth, especially for workers who are continuously full-time employed, have picked up notably this year, and that suggests the labor market is at full employment.	13.0	102.0
201609	1361	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Taking all of this into account, I’ve left my estimate of the long-run rate of unemployment unchanged at this time at 5 percent.	13.0	102.0
201609	1362	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	For the record, since we’re on a run right now, I’m SEP respondent lucky number 13.	13.0	102.0
201609	1363	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13.0	102.0
201609	1364	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13.0	65.0
201609	1365	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	103.0
201609	1366	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	The District economy expanded modestly since the previous meeting, and unemployment rates held steady, although they did tick higher in a few states.	13.0	103.0
201609	1367	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	The divergence between energy and non-energy-producing states remains notable, with states like Oklahoma and Wyoming in what could be viewed as a regional recession.	13.0	103.0
201609	1368	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Our District survey shows the manufacturing sector is also still facing some headwinds, with the majority of the weakness concentrated in the oil-producing states, although within the energy sector, the rig count in the District has stabilized and started to modestly increase.	13.0	103.0
201609	1369	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	In the agriculture sector, farm income is expected to fall, and lower crop prices continue to weigh on profit margins.	13.0	103.0
201609	1370	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Margins also remain poor in the cattle and dairy sectors, and as a result, agriculture credit conditions bear close watching, as loan repayment rates have fallen.	13.0	103.0
201609	1371	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Although agriculture and energy certainly remain soft, the spillovers to broader activity in the District have been limited so far and primarily are centered in those energy- and agriculture- concentrated states.	13.0	103.0
201609	1372	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	And even in these states, economic activity is more diversified than a few decades ago, which accounts for sentiment that is relatively more upbeat.	13.0	103.0
201609	1373	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	In the much larger services sector throughout the region, services are growing at a pace similar to that of the nation.	13.0	103.0
201609	1374	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	My outlook for the national economy is little changed.	13.0	103.0
201609	1375	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	I expect GDP growth in the second half of the year to pick up significantly from the disappointing pace in the first half, and looking at next year, I continue to see moderate growth, with inflation rising to 2 percent.	13.0	103.0
201609	1376	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	The key question for me in framing this outlook is whether consumers can continue to pull the economy forward over the next few years.	13.0	103.0
201609	1377	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Consumption growth was strong in the second quarter, with another robust gain projected in the current quarter.	13.0	103.0
201609	1378	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Looking ahead, I expect consumption growth to be supported by strong labor market conditions.	13.0	103.0
201609	1379	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	The steady growth in average hourly earnings, amid modest productivity gains, also points to a tightening labor market.	13.0	103.0
201609	1380	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Consistently, last week’s Census report on income and poverty highlighted a welcome gain in real median household incomes last year.	13.0	103.0
201609	1381	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Although the labor market looks likely to continue its improvement, I do think a risk worth monitoring is the decline in the workweek since the beginning of the year.	13.0	103.0
201609	1382	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Analysis by my staff offers a couple of observations concerning the declining hours in retail trade, leisure and hospitality, and professional business services.	13.0	103.0
201609	1383	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	In the categories of leisure and hospitality and professional business services, which comprise a substantial share of employment, the workweek appears to be returning to a level comparable with a few years ago, suggesting there may have been some overshooting in the average workweek in these sectors.	13.0	103.0
201609	1384	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	On the other hand, the workweek for retail trade has been on a downward trend since late 2011.	13.0	103.0
201609	1385	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	This may be related to structural changes in this sector, such as the emergence of online retailers.	13.0	103.0
201609	1386	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Regarding the outlook for residential investment, analysis by my staff suggests that the falloff in single-family construction reflects a limited amount of undeveloped land in locations desired by households, a supply-side factor that is likely to persist for a considerable time.	13.0	103.0
201609	1387	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Additionally, existing home sales appear to be constrained by a shortage of listings.	13.0	103.0
201609	1388	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	These supply constraints may lead homeowners to remodel an existing house rather than buying a new one.	13.0	103.0
201609	1389	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	With improvements accounting for one-third of residential investment, spending associated with home improvements could resume its upward trend of the past three years and offset much of the drag over the medium term arising from the behavior of new construction.	13.0	103.0
201609	1390	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Like Tealbook, I see few signs of strength in business fixed investment, yet nonfinancial corporate debt as a share of GDP is approaching its highest level on record going back to 1959.	13.0	103.0
201609	1391	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Debt-to-earnings in the nonfinancial corporate sector is also at multidecade highs for firms able to issue investment-grade debt.	13.0	103.0
201609	1392	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	For firms issuing high-yield debt, debt relative to earnings is also at its highest level since 2003.	13.0	103.0
201609	1393	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Clearly, the nonfinancial corporate sector has increased leverage, which concerns me in an environment in which S&P 500 firms have collectively spent more on dividends and buybacks than they generated in operating income in the last seven quarters.	13.0	103.0
201609	1394	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	An unusually low rate environment has facilitated these trends, and the economy could be at risk if earnings disappoint and the markets reevaluate exposures to the sector.	13.0	103.0
201609	1395	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, since our July meeting, inflation expectations in the recent Survey of Consumer Expectations moved up both at the one-year and three-year horizons.	13.0	103.0
201609	1396	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Last week’s CPI release was also encouraging, as core goods inflation was not a drag on the overall CPI for the first time in three months.	13.0	103.0
201609	1397	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	This suggests some stabilization in the portion of US inflation that is most affected by dollar strength.	13.0	103.0
201609	1398	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	With the stable trend in core CPI above 2 percent, stable survey- based inflation expectations, tight labor markets, and rising wages, I see inflation as fully consistent with our mandate for price stability and moving toward our long-run goal of 2 percent.	13.0	103.0
201609	1399	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	103.0
201609	1400	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	1401	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	13.0	65.0
201609	1402	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	111.0
201609	1403	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	The Ninth District economy continues to perform well, though the pace of economic growth slowed.	13.0	111.0
201609	1404	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Wage growth appears moderate.	13.0	111.0
201609	1405	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Price inflation remains subdued, partly reflecting depressed oil prices in our large region with the Bakken.	13.0	111.0
201609	1406	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Actually, we welcomed the very good news from the Census last week on the 5.2 percent rise in median household income between 2014 and 2015, with significantly fewer households in poverty.	13.0	111.0
201609	1407	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	It’s great that the recovery is finally extending more broadly across the income distribution, and it reflects steadily strengthening labor market conditions between 2010 and last summer.	13.0	111.0
201609	1408	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	We hope the growth in median income will continue.	13.0	111.0
201609	1409	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	On the inflation front, from our perspective, we’ve made little progress toward our inflation objective.	13.0	111.0
201609	1410	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	I find it interesting that the staff forecast of core PCE inflation is to remain at 1.6 percent for both 2016 and all of 2017.	13.0	111.0
201609	1411	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Market- and survey-based measures of expected inflation are near record lows.	13.0	111.0
201609	1412	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Some attribute this to temporary factors and argue that inflation is coming.	13.0	111.0
201609	1413	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	The inflation hawks might be right, but I’m looking for it in the data, not just faith and hope.	13.0	111.0
201609	1414	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	On the labor market front, growth has slowed over the past 12 months.	13.0	111.0
201609	1415	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	The unemployment rate and the staff’s labor market conditions index are little changed since last summer, and as others have noted, recent manufacturing and retail sales data have been disappointing.	13.0	111.0
201609	1416	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Economic growth in Mexico and Canada, our major trading partners, also looks very weak, so my baseline outlook is more of the same:  sluggish growth, subdued inflation.	13.0	111.0
201609	1417	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	We have talked about this many times since I’ve been here that there’s asymmetry with our tools related to the lower bound, so for me, the risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside.	13.0	111.0
201609	1418	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	It’s much tougher for us to respond to very low inflation than to high inflation.	13.0	111.0
201609	1419	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	The risk of unsustainable growth stoking inflation seems remote,in view of the less than 2 percent GDP growth and the stable labor market indicators  And I think I’ve mentioned it before: If it were to surprise us on the upside, that’s a high-class problem compared with surprising us on the downside.	13.0	111.0
201609	1420	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	13.0	111.0
201609	1421	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	1422	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13.0	65.0
201609	1423	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201609	1424	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	At the December 2015 meeting at which the Committee raised the interest rate, I wrote down three rate increases for 2016, and I guess I see two main unexpected developments since then that have changed my view of the appropriate path so far this year.	13.0	104.0
201609	1425	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	First, the period of financial market turmoil in January and February linked to the possibility of a large devaluation of the RMB was followed by a series of weak incoming data.	13.0	104.0
201609	1426	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Real GDP growth in the first half of the year came in at 1¼ percent, well below expectations.	13.0	104.0
201609	1427	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Payroll growth also declined sharply in the first half.	13.0	104.0
201609	1428	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Although this weakness is now passing, it does leave, for me, a declining residue of uncertainty.	13.0	104.0
201609	1429	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Second, and of more significance for the period ahead, interest rates have declined significantly right across the curve, and, like many others, I have come to the view that rates need to be lower than I had thought to support activity.	13.0	104.0
201609	1430	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	The kinds of rate increases that have been in the SEP for the past few years seem increasingly unrealistic in the global context that we are now in.	13.0	104.0
201609	1431	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	For me, that argues for a more gradual path of increases but not a change in the direction of travel.	13.0	104.0
201609	1432	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	To talk about each of those a little bit, even though GDP in the first half disappointed, about half of that slowdown over the past year, as David Wilcox covered, was about a decline in inventory accumulation—an inventory correction—which really says little about the underlying strength of demand.	13.0	104.0
201609	1433	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Private domestic final purchases are a better indicator.	13.0	104.0
201609	1434	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	They have behaved about as expected, growing at 3 percent last quarter and 2¼ percent over the past four quarters.	13.0	104.0
201609	1435	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	The Tealbook and seemingly all private forecasters expect stronger GDP growth in the second half.	13.0	104.0
201609	1436	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	And, for what I regard as good reasons:  The inventory correction should end.	13.0	104.0
201609	1437	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	The drag on business investment from lower oil prices that should end now that rig counts appear to have stabilized.	13.0	104.0
201609	1438	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	The contractionary effects of the big increase in the exchange value of the dollar should be waning.	13.0	104.0
201609	1439	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Financial conditions have eased materially since December.	13.0	104.0
201609	1440	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	And, finally, consumer spending should remain strong, with rising real incomes, continued job market strength, and much improved household balance sheets.	13.0	104.0
201609	1441	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Overall, I expect strong growth in the second half that will lift 2016 GDP close to 2 percent for the year as a whole.	13.0	104.0
201609	1442	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	In labor markets, payroll growth this year has averaged 180,000, down 50,000 from last year’s pace, but the underlying pattern is significant.	13.0	104.0
201609	1443	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	The average for March, April, and May, which is what the Committee saw at the time of the June meeting, was only about 120,000, which was a sharp deceleration since 2015.	13.0	104.0
201609	1444	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Fortunately, the average for the past three months through August is back up to 230,000, which is reassuring.	13.0	104.0
201609	1445	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	I would add that labor markets are also a better real-time indicator of the strength of GDP than is reported GDP.	13.0	104.0
201609	1446	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	With the increase in labor force participation, both unemployment and participation appear now to be very close to their longer-term trends, suggesting that the economy is pretty close to full employment.	13.0	104.0
201609	1447	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Indeed, despite modest rates of increases for wages, the very low levels of productivity growth and inflation over the past few years mean that unit labor costs are now rising faster than prices.	13.0	104.0
201609	1448	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	In addition, the Conference Board’s survey on job availability now shows, for the first time since 2008, that more respondents think jobs are plentiful than find them hard to get, and that has generally only happened when unemployment is at or below the natural rate.	13.0	104.0
201609	1449	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	In contrast to recent years, the improvement in labor markets has shown up this year in the form of an apparent upside surprise in our admittedly volatile measure of labor force participation.	13.0	104.0
201609	1450	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	If participation had declined as predicted in the December Tealbook, and holding all else equal, the unemployment rate would now be 4.3 percent.	13.0	104.0
201609	1451	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	I suspect that this would have been a very different meeting if that had been the case.	13.0	104.0
201609	1452	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	In any case, above-forecast labor force participation suggests that the economy has more room to expand, or at least that supply-side limits are probably more than usually uncertain, and I think we would be wise to take that into account in thinking about policy.	13.0	104.0
201609	1453	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	If job growth continues at anything like these rates, unemployment may fall well below current estimates of the natural rate, or labor force participation may continue to improve relative to trend, or both.	13.0	104.0
201609	1454	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Any of these outcomes would support a return to 2 percent inflation and would be welcome for me.	13.0	104.0
201609	1455	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Another possibility is that inflation does not pick up and that we continue to revise down our estimate of the natural rate.	13.0	104.0
201609	1456	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Finally, it’s also possible, of course, that wage and price pressures will appear to an unexpected degree, and that would require a more aggressive response from policy and potentially put the recovery at risk.	13.0	104.0
201609	1457	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	There are no risk-free paths, and this latter I find a good argument for which the time has not yet come, in my thinking.	13.0	104.0
201609	1458	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	The third factor I mentioned is much lower interest rates.	13.0	104.0
201609	1459	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Since the rate increase of December, there has been significant loosening in financial conditions.	13.0	104.0
201609	1460	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Between that SEP and the current SEP, we’ve seen median FOMC participant expectations regarding the total number of rate increases for this year and next year decline from eight to three.	13.0	104.0
201609	1461	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	By a straight read, markets are pricing in about a 50 percent chance of one increase this year and one more rate increase next year.	13.0	104.0
201609	1462	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Accounting for term premiums and other factors, I think, actually, for 2017, market expectations are probably not far from this meeting’s SEP.	13.0	104.0
201609	1463	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Other financial conditions have loosened as well, with lower long-term rates, higher stock prices, a weaker dollar, and narrower credit spreads.	13.0	104.0
201609	1464	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	With this loosening of financial conditions, GDP growth and the pace of job creation have stabilized, and I do see a causal relationship between the first and the second.	13.0	104.0
201609	1465	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	The implication, though, is that the neutral rate of interest remains very low, even lower than I had thought.	13.0	104.0
201609	1466	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Inflation, on the other hand, has performed very close to expectations.	13.0	104.0
201609	1467	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Year-to-date core inflation is 1.6 percent, up 0.3 percentage point over the year.	13.0	104.0
201609	1468	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	That said, rising unit labor costs may put some downward pressure on profits and upward pressure on prices, helping us get back to 2 percent inflation.	13.0	104.0
201609	1469	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	I continue to see inflation rising to 2 percent over the medium term, although I do see the risks as slightly more to the downside.	13.0	104.0
201609	1470	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	In particular, low measures of inflation expectations remain a concern, and to address that concern, I do see it as appropriate to allow unemployment to decline modestly below the natural rate in order to support progress toward our 2 percent inflation target.	13.0	104.0
201609	1471	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201609	1472	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	1473	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13.0	65.0
201609	1474	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201609	1475	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	During the day on Saturday and on Sunday morning, I composed a set of remarks for the economic go-round that were, I believe, destined to be remembered as one of the most remarkable interventions in the annals of the FOMC.	13.0	97.0
201609	1476	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	On Sunday afternoon, my computer crashed, and those remarks, unfortunately, were lost to posterity.	13.0	97.0
201609	1477	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	13.0	97.0
201609	1478	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Having tried to reconstitute them Sunday evening and yesterday, somehow the brilliance had been fleeting, and for that reason, I’m grateful that Presidents Evans, Rosengren, and Williams what I actually think is the most important thing to talk about in this meeting:  the relative risks of overshoot against failing to stimulate more.	13.0	97.0
201609	1479	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	So, in a somewhat impromptu way, I’m going to try to make some remarks about that.	13.0	97.0
201609	1480	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	First, we really are in a fundamentally different position than a year—or certainly two or three—ago.	13.0	97.0
201609	1481	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	At that time, I honestly couldn’t understand arguments that were being made for why we needed to be ready to start tightening, or we should start thinking about tightening, or the like.	13.0	97.0
201609	1482	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Whatever one’s view, and I think people know where I stand on this relative to others on the Committee, we are surely in a realm now in which the possibilities and the risks on both sides have to be taken seriously.	13.0	97.0
201609	1483	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And even though I come out differently from, say, where President Rosengren is, I think he has raised an important set of issues both here and in his public speeches, which it behooves all of us to engage in and just try to balance to see what the right path is for the period ahead.	13.0	97.0
201609	1484	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	The first thing I’d say on that—and this is the risk of overshooting—and as I think the discussion among Presidents Evans, Rosengren, and Williams and David Wilcox showed, it’s actually hard to find historical examples of pretty much anything that we want to demonstrate here.	13.0	97.0
201609	1485	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	One of the problems is that, as President Williams pointed out, it’s hard to find an example when there was a soft landing where unemployment went up several tenths of a percentage point without a recession.	13.0	97.0
201609	1486	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	But, on the other side, it is also hard to find one of those circumstances in which the FOMC did not arguably keep its foot on the brake way too long.	13.0	97.0
201609	1487	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	One has to recognize that, in these cases, inflation had actually gotten well above target for some period of time.	13.0	97.0
201609	1488	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	So I think while it’s reasonable for all of us to look at history and try to learn from it, I suspect that history isn’t going to provide an answer here, even though it will, in a sort of Biblical fashion, provide a little bit of support on both sides.	13.0	97.0
201609	1489	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	So, the question of what the risks associated with a modest to moderate overshoot are, I think, are the ones that Eric lays out, and others have echoed, and are the ones that we should be worried about.	13.0	97.0
201609	1490	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And the questions are, first:  How likely is that to happen?	13.0	97.0
201609	1491	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Because, obviously, that’s important.	13.0	97.0
201609	1492	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And then, second: What are the risks on the other side?	13.0	97.0
201609	1493	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	That is, if one takes the approach of beginning to raise rates in order to avoid those risks, what kinds of risks are you courting on the other side?	13.0	97.0
201609	1494	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	As you can tell from what I already said about history, while I agree that there is the risk of an overshoot that requires us to respond in a very robust way and thereby induces a recession, it seems to me that in an environment in which inflation has been running below target as long as it has, in which there is a global arguably disinflationary—and certainly not inflationary— environment, and in which we are talking not about massive overshoots but a few tenths of a percentage point overshoot, my instinct is that the risks are nontrivial but modest to moderate.	13.0	97.0
201609	1495	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And that’s reinforced for me by looking at the flip side of this, which is: What are the risks of nonlinearity in the labor market—specifically, with the unemployment rate going down below what is perceived to be a natural rate?	13.0	97.0
201609	1496	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	If this is the concern, I think there aren’t really a lot of historical examples to support that kind of concern.	13.0	97.0
201609	1497	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	If you want to see a nonlinear relationship between falling unemployment, arguably below the natural rate, and a nonlinear increase in wages, you can go back to the 1990s, but that did not translate into price inflation, presumably, at least in part because of the fact that the Phillips curve had already flattened by then.	13.0	97.0
201609	1498	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	So if you want to see price inflation being associated in a nonlinear fashion with a dip below the natural rate, I think you have to go back to the 1960s.	13.0	97.0
201609	1499	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And if you’re going back to the 1960s—again, I lived through that period, but I do not recall what was happening with inflation directly at that time—my understanding is that the estimates of the natural rate may have been off by a substantial amount, like 1 or maybe 2 percentage points, not several tenths of a percentage point.	13.0	97.0
201609	1500	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	So, again, it was really quite a different context from the one in which we find ourselves today.	13.0	97.0
201609	1501	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And then, I add to that the uncertainty that Governor Brainard and President Evans have referred to regarding the exact value of the natural rate of unemployment is.	13.0	97.0
201609	1502	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	If we’re worrying about overshooting it by too much and if it’s actually lower than the staff estimate of 5 percent, then the kinds of overshooting that we are talking about are obviously smaller still.	13.0	97.0
201609	1503	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And I do continue to think there’s a pretty good chance that the rate of unemployment at which even wage pressures will be significantly built up is lower than the 5 percent estimated by the staff.	13.0	97.0
201609	1504	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	What we have seen over the past year or so has been an encouraging phenomenon that there really is more slack in the labor market than some believed.	13.0	97.0
201609	1505	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	That is the significance of the fact that the unemployment rate has remained stable during this period.	13.0	97.0
201609	1506	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	It is that we’ve been creating jobs at a healthy clip—above the number needed to deal with new entrants into the labor force—and yet unemployment has not been falling during that period.	13.0	97.0
201609	1507	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Now, maybe that could all reverse very quickly, and you would simultaneously have no people coming into the labor market and unemployment beginning to decline very quickly.	13.0	97.0
201609	1508	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	But it seems to me as though it is more likely that we are testing the bounds of how much slack there is, and this will be something more of a gradual process, because the amounts really have exceeded, I think, what many people expected even a year or two ago.	13.0	97.0
201609	1509	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Just a couple of mildly relevant comments on this from current activities: EPOP has been increasing faster this year than last year, again suggesting that it has been drawing slack back into the labor market.	13.0	97.0
201609	1510	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And recently, compensation increases have actually flattened out a bit.	13.0	97.0
201609	1511	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	With some exceptions, like construction, for which supply constraints do seem to be present, we haven’t seen an unusual acceleration of wages at the high end of the distribution of wage growth, and that is the phenomenon that has been observed during past recoveries when unemployment dropped below what later proved to be the natural rate.	13.0	97.0
201609	1512	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	All in all, to me, the situation we’re in now is a pretty good one of continued job creation that is taking up slack in the economy, a process that has helped bring the share of the long-term unemployed back to its pre-crisis level.	13.0	97.0
201609	1513	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	It is now helping minority and other groups whose unemployment rates traditionally run significantly higher than the average for the labor force as a whole.	13.0	97.0
201609	1514	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	So that’s my own assessment, gloss, and obviously, to some degree, disagreement with the very salient issue that Eric raised as to how much of a risk there is there.	13.0	97.0
201609	1515	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And I’d just much more briefly point out that, on the other side, there are risks, too.	13.0	97.0
201609	1516	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	There is, it seems to me, a growing case for some variant on the secular-stagnation hypothesis.	13.0	97.0
201609	1517	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Maybe not secular stagnation itself, but the cognitive transmogrification of headwinds into prevailing winds, which I think a lot of people have gone through, is something that needs to be taken quite seriously.	13.0	97.0
201609	1518	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	That suggests, again, that if we’re in an environment in which there is a risk that inflation is not going to go up and indeed is susceptible to recessions pushing it down further again, one actually wants to err on what I’ve characterized as the “show me” side of things, of looking for tangible evidence that inflation is rising toward and will remain around its target level.	13.0	97.0
201609	1519	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t expect to persuade people who have the other view, but I really do think that that’s the discussion.	13.0	97.0
201609	1520	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	The discussion of the set of issues, which Presidents Evans, Rosengren, and Williams started in their questioning of David Wilcox and which I’m trying to continue now, is I think probably the right one to have maybe in October as people think, looking ahead, about where this balance of risks really does lie and forcing each of us to confront the quite legitimate position that those who have the opposite instincts are taking.	13.0	97.0
201609	1521	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201609	1522	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	1523	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13.0	65.0
201609	1524	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201609	1525	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I want to endorse what Governor Tarullo just said.	13.0	96.0
201609	1526	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this issue about where the risk lies is really the germane subject that we’re wrestling with.	13.0	96.0
201609	1527	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think that one reason why I’m less worried about the overshooting risk, which I think is legitimate, is because we are growing only very modestly above trend, so we’re approaching full employment at a very shallow trajectory.	13.0	96.0
201609	1528	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Inflation is below our target rather than above our target, and inflation expectations are probably a little bit depressed.	13.0	96.0
201609	1529	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Obviously, nobody wants to repeat the 1960s.	13.0	96.0
201609	1530	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	But I would emphasize that, to get the inflation that we got in the 1970s, we had to work really, really hard for a decade of a whole series of policy mistakes over and over again.	13.0	96.0
201609	1531	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Not only was the unemployment rate allowed to decline below the natural rate, but I think there also was a fundamental error in policymakers’ thinking that if the unemployment rate got too low, the inflation rate would go a little bit higher, but it wouldn’t be the case that the change in the inflation rate would continue to go up every year that you kept the unemployment rate below its full-employment rate.	13.0	96.0
201609	1532	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think there was a model failure in terms of how the inflation process actually worked, so as inflation expectations got unanchored, what happened was, as you stayed below that full employment unemployment rate, inflation got worse year after year.	13.0	96.0
201609	1533	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think coming back in October and maybe actually reviewing some of this historical evidence is certainly an interesting thing to take a look at.	13.0	96.0
201609	1534	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I would encourage the staff to bring all this back to us and maybe actually talk about some of these various episodes and whether the current situation is different or similar to those earlier circumstances.	13.0	96.0
201609	1535	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, in terms of the outlook, my views, as I’ve said many times, have not changed much since the previous FOMC meeting.	13.0	96.0
201609	1536	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	On the growth side, we expect real GDP growth to average about 2¾ percent during the second half of the year, and for 2017 and 2018 we’re penciling in GDP growth around 2 percent but have considerable uncertainty about that.	13.0	96.0
201609	1537	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the very near-term outlook—in other words, the next couple of quarters—I’m of two minds.	13.0	96.0
201609	1538	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	On the one hand, I do take comfort from the fact that financial conditions are accommodative, the fiscal impulse is positive, and real GDP is getting a short-term boost as the drag due to the decline in inventory investment reverses itself.	13.0	96.0
201609	1539	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	But, on the other hand, we do have to recognize that some of the recent data have been quite weak.	13.0	96.0
201609	1540	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, although the last employment report had 151,000 in payrolls and people took a lot of comfort from that, the rest of the report was very soft—aggregate hours worked declined, and some of the earlier rise that we saw in average hourly earnings on a year-over-year basis reversed.	13.0	96.0
201609	1541	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	In addition, retail sales were quite soft in August, suggesting that maybe some of the recent momentum in consumer spending has faded, and the past two ISM reports for manufacturing and services for August registered large drops.	13.0	96.0
201609	1542	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	As President Kaplan has noted, this may just be noise, and maybe we want to look at a smooth three-month moving average.	13.0	96.0
201609	1543	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	But the size of the declines in both of those were quite large, so I’m not willing to discount it completely.	13.0	96.0
201609	1544	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the labor market, my assessment is that there is still some slack.	13.0	96.0
201609	1545	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we need to be clear when we talk about the monthly payroll gains needed to keep the unemployment rate steady in the long run, which is suggested at 85,000 to 115,000 in the Tealbook.	13.0	96.0
201609	1546	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	That is a long-run concept and may not be a good metric to use in assessing when is the appropriate time to remove monetary policy accommodation.	13.0	96.0
201609	1547	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	As we’ve seen over the past eight months, payrolls can grow considerably more rapidly than that without necessarily pushing down the unemployment rate.	13.0	96.0
201609	1548	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	If an improving labor market pulls discouraged workers back into the labor force, I think that’s a welcome development, and we don’t necessarily want to forestall that.	13.0	96.0
201609	1549	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I can, in fact, imagine payroll gains persisting at 151,000 a month or more for some time without that generating much downward movement in the unemployment rate.	13.0	96.0
201609	1550	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	If that occurred and other data suggested no evidence of a rise in inflationary pressures, the right conclusion might be to conceivably keep monetary policy on hold for some time to come.	13.0	96.0
201609	1551	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Obviously, the decision wouldn’t just depend on what is happening in the labor market.	13.0	96.0
201609	1552	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	It would depend on many factors.	13.0	96.0
201609	1553	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	My point here, though, is that we shouldn’t suggest that our actions are going to mainly be dictated by the pace of monthly payroll change relative to the long-term pace consistent with a stable unemployment rate.	13.0	96.0
201609	1554	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	That is just too simplistic a metric, I think, in terms of our monetary policy decision rule.	13.0	96.0
201609	1555	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Another issue I am concerned about on the economic growth side is whether low interest rates are losing their punch in terms of supporting the economy.	13.0	96.0
201609	1556	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	There are at least two issues here.	13.0	96.0
201609	1557	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	First, the attenuation of monetary policy stimulus over time, as the activity that has been pulled forward by lower interest rates—for example, motor vehicle sales—is no longer there when the future inevitably arises.	13.0	96.0
201609	1558	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	We may be starting to see that in the motor vehicle sector, as sales have flattened out this year and in August actually declined.	13.0	96.0
201609	1559	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The second is the prospect that a persistent period of low interest rates may eventually lead to a rise in the saving rate.	13.0	96.0
201609	1560	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	If real rates stay very low, households, pension funds, and endowments will likely have to save more to achieve their wealth objectives.	13.0	96.0
201609	1561	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	On the household side, we see some evidence of this in the fact that the household saving rate is a bit elevated today relative to what one would expect, just on the basis of the level of household net worth relative to income.	13.0	96.0
201609	1562	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, one could take this as a positive sign.	13.0	96.0
201609	1563	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	If the typical relationship was restored, the household savings rate would drop, and consumption would grow faster than income as the saving rate declined.	13.0	96.0
201609	1564	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Or it could be that the current situation is just the beginning of a more persistent updrift in the saving rate as savings behavior responds to the low level of interest rates.	13.0	96.0
201609	1565	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	As I’ve said at other meetings, we have never been in this circumstance before, so to think that we understand the dynamics of how the household sector is going to react to this long period of low interest rates is just an open question at this point.	13.0	96.0
201609	1566	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	If the saving rate were to rise, consumption would grow more slowly than income, and that, in turn, would exert a restraining effect on economic activity.	13.0	96.0
201609	1567	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to institutions such as pensions and endowments, I’d like to relate a conversation I had with a person responsible for overseeing the management of a major university’s endowment fund recently.	13.0	96.0
201609	1568	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Currently, this university takes 5 percent of its endowment each year into its general budget.	13.0	96.0
201609	1569	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	But 5 percent seems too high to be sustainable in the current financial market environment, so the endowment managers are faced with some tough choices: They can take more risks to generate a 5 percent real rate of return, they can reduce the draw on the endowment to a smaller percentage and reduce university spending to compensate, or they can let the endowment diminish in size in real terms by maintaining the 5 percent annual drawdown but not actually getting investment returns sufficient to replenish it.	13.0	96.0
201609	1570	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not sure how this is all going to play out in terms of timing, but this does seem to be another avenue that might eventually translate into less spending.	13.0	96.0
201609	1571	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The same dynamic is at play in terms of corporate defined-benefit plans and state and local pension plans.	13.0	96.0
201609	1572	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	For both corporate and state and local plans, the annualized nominal rates of return that they are assuming varies considerably across different plans—there’s a pretty broad range.	13.0	96.0
201609	1573	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	But the median is around 7½ percent nominal rate of return annually; such returns are unlikely to be achieved over the long term.	13.0	96.0
201609	1574	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, this has been papered over a bit in recent years because declining longer-term rates have boosted bond prices, generating capital gains that have supported the terms.	13.0	96.0
201609	1575	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	But this can’t go on indefinitely.	13.0	96.0
201609	1576	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Eventually, the low level over the current yield will dominate in terms of determining future returns.	13.0	96.0
201609	1577	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Eventually, the contributions in the pension funds will have to rise, with consequences for corporate profits and for state and local taxes and expenditures I think we need to do more work to understand the potential consequences of a “low interest rate forever” environment on savings and spending behavior not because I necessarily think that we are going to have a low interest rate environment forever, but because I’d like to understand the consequences if we stay on the current trajectory.	13.0	96.0
201609	1578	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I can imagine an environment in which persistently low interest rates led to more saving that in turn depressed economic growth, and the sluggish rate of growth in turn reinforced the downward pressure on interest rates.	13.0	96.0
201609	1579	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So there would be a sort of feedback loop that would lead to low interest rates and sluggish economic growth.	13.0	96.0
201609	1580	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	In fact, you could argue that’s what we’ve been experiencing.	13.0	96.0
201609	1581	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	On the inflation side, my outlook also hasn’t changed much.	13.0	96.0
201609	1582	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Whereas before we had an expectation that core PCE inflation would moderate during the second half of the year, now it appears that expectation is being realized.	13.0	96.0
201609	1583	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Combined with somewhat less wage pressure in the most recent reading, the persistence of low energy prices, and subdued inflation expectations, there doesn’t seem to be much risk that inflation is going to get away from us on the upside any time soon.	13.0	96.0
201609	1584	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The fact that inflation is still low and below our target, the likelihood that there is still some slack in the labor market, and some concerns I have about the growth outlook all reinforce my view that there is little urgency to tightening monetary policy right now.	13.0	96.0
201609	1585	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think a patient approach is warranted for the time being, but more on that tomorrow.	13.0	96.0
201609	1586	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, a few thoughts on the updraft in the short-term LIBOR and in the foreign exchange swap basis for both the euro and yen.	13.0	96.0
201609	1587	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	This was the focus of much of the discussion at the most recent BIS meetings Stan and I were at over the weekend.	13.0	96.0
201609	1588	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The general consensus was that the upward movements were due mainly to regulatory changes that increased the cost of dealer balance sheets.	13.0	96.0
201609	1589	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Money market fund reforms that require prime institutional money market funds to move to floating net asset value on October 14 was also considered to be a factor.	13.0	96.0
201609	1590	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Much money has already shifted out of such money market mutual funds, and if you look at the money market mutual fund’s prime institutional funds, they have already reduced their weighted- average maturity sharply to only 11 days in the most recent reading.	13.0	96.0
201609	1591	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	This suggests to me that most, if not all, of the adjustment in short-term rates due to money market fund reform may already have taken place.	13.0	96.0
201609	1592	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I expect that once we get past the October 14 deadline, these prime funds will presumably lengthen their average maturities.	13.0	96.0
201609	1593	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The consequence of that will push up the relative yields on these funds compared with Treasury funds, and that will actually cause some funds to flow back into the prime funds.	13.0	96.0
201609	1594	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The Tealbook looks at the issue of how much the rise in the three-month LIBOR represents a tightening of financial market conditions through the channel of nonfinancial corporate borrowing costs.	13.0	96.0
201609	1595	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I agree with the analysis that this has a very small effect.	13.0	96.0
201609	1596	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The main channel of monetary policy, in my mind, is how changes in the expected short-term rate path affect longer-term interest rates.	13.0	96.0
201609	1597	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	If the three-month LIBOR rises because the term structure of interest rates otherwise doesn’t change, then I think the effect should be little.	13.0	96.0
201609	1598	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So if everything is the same, and the only thing that has moved is three-month LIBOR, I don’t really think that has much consequence for financial market conditions, and we should basically not put much weight on it.	13.0	96.0
201609	1599	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So to sum up, while I think there are several good reasons not to tighten monetary policy at this meeting, I don’t think the rise in the three-month LIBOR or money market fund reform are among them.	13.0	96.0
201609	1600	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201609	1601	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201609	1602	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	And my thanks to everyone for an interesting discussion of the outlook and particularly the risks that we face at this juncture.	13.0	65.0
201609	1603	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	I’d just like to wrap up the go-round with brief comments on two issues that I consider relevant to our policy discussion tomorrow.	13.0	65.0
201609	1604	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	First, what does the current pace of labor market improvement imply for resource utilization?	13.0	65.0
201609	1605	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	And, second, are there signs of emerging inflation pressures?	13.0	65.0
201609	1606	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	On the first issue, I’m echoing what the Vice Chairman and Governor Tarullo and others have indicated:  The data clearly show that labor market conditions have improved appreciably over the past year.	13.0	65.0
201609	1607	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Since August of last year, the economy has added about 2½ million jobs, enabling the employment-to-population ratio to rise 0.3 percentage point despite demographic effects that are pulling down the underlying trend.	13.0	65.0
201609	1608	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Furthermore, job growth remained solid through the late spring and summer, with payroll gains averaging about 180,000 per month over the past four months.	13.0	65.0
201609	1609	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	In light of the apparent pickup in real GDP growth in the second half of this year, it seems reasonable to expect, as the Tealbook does, that job gains will remain solid through the rest of the year and into early next year.	13.0	65.0
201609	1610	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Even if payroll gains in coming months were to moderate somewhat from their recent average pace—say, to the 150,000 increase recorded in August—employment growth would still be running ahead of what is sustainable in the longer run.	13.0	65.0
201609	1611	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you have emphasized this point.	13.0	65.0
201609	1612	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	The staff’s estimates, reported in the Tealbook,  suggest that job gains will eventually have to moderate substantially over time to stabilize the unemployment rate, most likely to somewhere in the 85,000 to 115,000 per month range,in view of the downward trend in labor force participation and likely divergence between payroll and household employment gains, but conceivably as low as 65,000 per month.	13.0	65.0
201609	1613	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	That long-run growth constraint does not necessarily imply, though, that continued job gains in the 150,000 to 200,000 range would be problematic in the near term, because data we have received over the past year suggest that the economy may have more room to grow than previously thought.	13.0	65.0
201609	1614	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Consider the labor force participation rate, which rose over the past year, rather than declining as the staff projected last September.	13.0	65.0
201609	1615	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	That allowed the unemployment rate to remain virtually unchanged, despite the strong job gains.	13.0	65.0
201609	1616	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	One reasonable response to this unexpected development would be to revise up the path of employment estimated to be consistent with a given unemployment rate.	13.0	65.0
201609	1617	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	For anyone who gauges inflationary pressures using the standard unemployment gap, this sort of revision effectively constitutes a favorable supply shock, and it implies that the economy can sustainability operate with a higher long-run employment-to- population ratio.	13.0	65.0
201609	1618	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Other labor indicators also seem to be consistent with the proposition that labor market slack has been shrinking at only a modest pace recently.	13.0	65.0
201609	1619	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Involuntary part-time employment and the broad U-6 measure of labor utilization are both little changed since last fall.	13.0	65.0
201609	1620	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	And even in the case of those indicators that continue to trend up—such as JOLTS readings on openings and quits and survey assessments of job availability and whether jobs are hard to fill—the pace of improvement appears to have slowed this year.	13.0	65.0
201609	1621	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	In light of these developments, I anticipate that utilization will continue to tighten at a gradual pace as we move into next year, especially as I see some potential for a healthy labor market to attract yet more people back into the labor force.	13.0	65.0
201609	1622	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, employment growth does have to moderate at some point if we want to ensure longer-run price stability.	13.0	65.0
201609	1623	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Nonetheless, we should be wary of slowing employment growth too rapidly, especially as some slack still remains, and a moderately tight labor market would help speed the return to 2 percent inflation.	13.0	65.0
201609	1624	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	After all, the unemployment rate is still a couple of tenths above my estimate of its longer-run value, and involuntary part-time employment is more than 1 percentage point above its average pre-crisis level.	13.0	65.0
201609	1625	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Let me now turn to my second question:  Are there signs of emerging inflation pressures?	13.0	65.0
201609	1626	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	If there were, I would be more concerned that we could be falling “behind the curve,” but, frankly, I can’t see many signs of that yet.	13.0	65.0
201609	1627	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	The September Beige Book reported remarkably few signs of rising cost pressures or planned price increases.	13.0	65.0
201609	1628	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	From what I heard around the table, this was also not a significant theme in your conversations with your various business contacts.	13.0	65.0
201609	1629	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	As regards hard data, nominal wage gains remain subdued by most measures.	13.0	65.0
201609	1630	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Oil prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar are little changed from where they stood last fall.	13.0	65.0
201609	1631	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Non-energy commodity prices have moved up some this year, but only to a moderate level.	13.0	65.0
201609	1632	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Market-based measures of inflation compensation and survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations have changed little in recent months and remain at or below their longer- run averages.	13.0	65.0
201609	1633	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Most directly, the monthly price data have come in about as I and the staff expected.	13.0	65.0
201609	1634	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Accordingly, I continue to expect that core PCE inflation will come in at just over 1½ percent this year.	13.0	65.0
201609	1635	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	That’s up ¼ percentage point from 2015 due to the waning effects of past dollar appreciation.	13.0	65.0
201609	1636	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	That was my SEP forecast a year ago.	13.0	65.0
201609	1637	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	And my  forecast for 2015 has remained essentially unchanged since then.	13.0	65.0
201609	1638	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Now, it’s true, and several of you mentioned this, that core CPI inflation and other CPI-based measures of trend inflation have risen more notably than core PCE inflation over the past two or three years, primarily because of differences between the CPI and PCE weights on rents and medical prices and differences in the measurement of health-care inflation in the two series.	13.0	65.0
201609	1639	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, if one looked at movements in the CPI were more closely related to consumer welfare than movements in the PCE index, then the recent rise in CPI-based measures of underlying inflation would be cause for concern.	13.0	65.0
201609	1640	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	But the Committee judged that the opposite was true when it decided to define our inflation objective using the PCE measure.	13.0	65.0
201609	1641	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Alternatively, one might be alarmed by the growing wedge between these two inflation measures, if such a gap signals an increased likelihood of a pickup in future PCE price inflation, all else being equal.	13.0	65.0
201609	1642	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	We conducted some regression analysis to look at that issue, and the results suggest exactly the opposite.	13.0	65.0
201609	1643	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	When core CPI inflation rises relative to core PCE inflation, it’s core CPI inflation that tends to fall in the following year.	13.0	65.0
201609	1644	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, it is worth stressing that some other price measures, including GDP prices excluding food and energy and the trimmed mean PCE price index, also suggest little net change in underlying inflation over the past two or three years.	13.0	65.0
201609	1645	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there.	13.0	65.0
201609	1646	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	I think we still have time before we head to dinner to let Thomas give us his policy briefing.	21.0	65.0
201609	1647	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201609	1648	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21.0	999.0
201609	1649	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	One issue you have been discussing in recent meetings is the amount of monetary policy accommodation provided by current and expected settings for the federal funds rate.	21.0	999.0
201609	1650	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	Exhibit 1 examines that issue through the lens of your SEP-implied neutral real rates.	21.0	999.0
201609	1651	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	As Beth noted in her briefing on the SEP, your forecasts for 2017 and 2018 for your two key goal variables have changed very little over the past year, with the unemployment rate at the end of 2018 at or slightly below its longer-run level and inflation moving toward the Committee’s objective.	21.0	999.0
201609	1652	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	However, as shown in the top- left panel, your assessments of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate associated with those projections has shifted down notably.	21.0	999.0
201609	1653	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	That shift reflects revisions to both the longer-run equilibrium level of the federal funds rate and the pace at which the federal funds rate is projected to rise to achieve the Committee’s economic objectives.	21.0	999.0
201609	1654	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	Since the September 2015 SEP, the median estimate of the longer-run federal funds rate has been marked down, as Beth noted, from 3.5 percent to 2.9 percent.	21.0	999.0
201609	1655	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	A year ago, in considering the appropriate path of the funds rate over the medium run, most of you expected that it would be appropriate to move the policy rate up at a pace that would put it close to its longer-run level by the end of 2018.	21.0	999.0
201609	1656	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	In subsequent SEPs, that path has moved lower.	21.0	999.0
201609	1657	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	And many of you now anticipate that the appropriate level of the funds rate consistent with your economic projections will, at the end of 2019, still be below its longer-run level.	21.0	999.0
201609	1658	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The remaining panels return to an analysis that I presented a couple of times before.	21.0	999.0
201609	1659	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	This analysis requires your longer-run projections, so I have results for only 16 participants.	21.0	999.0
201609	1660	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	Because a year has passed since I most recently did this exercise, I summarize the key steps in the box at the top right:  First, I estimate an IS equation that relates the unemployment gap (u minus u*) to its own lag and the lagged real rate gap, defined as the deviation of the real federal funds rate (r) from a time-varying equilibrium level (r*).	21.0	999.0
201609	1661	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	This equation has the property that, if the actual real rate were kept at its equilibrium level, the unemployment rate gap would close over time.	21.0	999.0
201609	1662	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The coefficients in this equation are estimated over the 1961–2014 period using data for the fourth quarter of each year, the staff’s estimates of u*, and estimates of r* taken from the Laubach-Williams model.	21.0	999.0
201609	1663	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	With the estimated coefficients in hand, I insert each participant’s projected values of the unemployment rate and the real federal funds rate, as well as his or her estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate, and solve the equation for the implied values of the time-varying r* at the end of each year from 2016 to 2019.	21.0	999.0
201609	1664	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	Note that, to calculate the implied r* for 2019, the equation requires assumptions regarding your unemployment rate forecasts for 2020.	21.0	999.0
201609	1665	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	For this exercise, I simply set them at their 2019 levels, but therefore the implied r* values for 2019 should be treated with caution.	21.0	999.0
201609	1666	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The implied values of each participant’s r* projections are plotted as the blue dots in the middle-left panel.	21.0	999.0
201609	1667	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	As always,reflecting the diversity of your views about the outlook and appropriate monetary policy, these estimates of r* show some dispersion.	21.0	999.0
201609	1668	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	In line with the views that many of you have expressed during recent meetings, the implied r* for almost all of you is 0.5 percent or lower at the end of 2016.	21.0	999.0
201609	1669	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	And, by these calculations, the implied r* remains low over the next several years.	21.0	999.0
201609	1670	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The median implied r* estimates (shown by the red diamonds) remain close to zero through 2018 before moving up to the longer-run value in 2019.	21.0	999.0
201609	1671	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The analysis I just presented suggests that the relevant measure of policy accommodation implicit in your individual SEPs is the gap at each point in time between your individual projections of the real federal funds rate and your implied time-varying equilibrium real rates.	21.0	999.0
201609	1672	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	These gaps are plotted in the middle right.	21.0	999.0
201609	1673	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	Although I don’t want to oversell the results of this simple analysis, it highlights three points that would likely hold under different approaches to measuring neutral rates and implied real rate gaps:  First, all of you view the stance of policy that you see as appropriate at the end of this year to be accommodative; second, the neutral real rate is expected to remain near zero over the next two years, and then move up by only a modest amount; and, finally, as illustrated in the bottom-left panel, the median path of the neutral rate implied by your projections has shifted down substantially over the past year.	21.0	999.0
201609	1674	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The footnote to that panel is correct—as the red line in the legend should be labeled “September 2016.”	21.0	999.0
201609	1675	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	Sorry about that.	21.0	999.0
201609	1676	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	As summarized in the bullets in the bottom right, the choices offered by the policy alternatives in front of you can be understood as emphasizing these three points to varying degrees.	21.0	999.0
201609	1677	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The policy strategy in alternative C would be warranted if the Committee was confident that the economy is now well positioned to achieve the outcomes for the labor market and inflation summarized in paragraph 2 of the statement, with an increase in the federal funds rate at today’s meeting followed by further gradual adjustments to the stance of policy.	21.0	999.0
201609	1678	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The sizable median real rate gap in 2016 shown in the middle right supports the view expressed by alternative C that policy would remain accommodative in the near term even after an increase in the funds rate tomorrow.	21.0	999.0
201609	1679	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	You might prefer alternative C if you judge that it is important to start narrowing this gap in order to limit the risk of falling “behind the curve” if the economy picks up more quickly than currently expected.	21.0	999.0
201609	1680	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The policy strategy in alternative A is grounded in a much less sanguine view of the economic outlook—that r* is low, perhaps well below zero, and likely to remain quite low for some time.	21.0	999.0
201609	1681	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	If that is the situation as you see it, you might deem it appropriate for the Committee to convey that it is in no rush to remove accommodation, and that the current level of policy accommodation is needed until inflation has moved closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis.	21.0	999.0
201609	1682	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The Committee could view the persistence of below-trend inflation even as the labor market has tightened and some signs of lower longer-term inflation expectations as having increased its uncertainty about the cyclical position of the economy—the natural rate of unemployment might be lower and the economy remains short of conditions that would lead to a step-up in inflation in the near term.	21.0	999.0
201609	1683	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	With alternative B, the Committee would acknowledge the mostly favorable economic and financial developments in recent months, including developments that might indicate that the labor market has a little more room to tighten than previously expected.	21.0	999.0
201609	1684	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative B would suggest that the Committee does not need much additional supporting evidence to conclude that another increase in the target range for the federal funds rate is warranted.	21.0	999.0
201609	1685	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	However, it would indicate that the Committee is deferring the next step in removing accommodation “for the time being.”	21.0	999.0
201609	1686	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	You might see waiting for some further evidence as appropriate in light of the successive downward revisions to medium- and longer-run r* in recent years, as well as the continued proximity to the effective lower bound.	21.0	999.0
201609	1687	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	That completes my prepared remarks.	21.0	999.0
201609	1688	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	The July statement and the draft alternatives are shown on pages 3 to 11 of the handout.	21.0	999.0
201609	1689	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	I will be happy to take questions.	21.0	999.0
201609	1690	2016-09-21	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201609	1691	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	22.0	65.0
201609	1692	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Thomas?	22.0	65.0
201609	1693	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Quiet group today.	22.0	65.0
201609	1695	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Very good.	52.0	65.0
201609	1696	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	52.0	65.0
201609	1697	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Well, seeing no questions, we’ve got a reception and dinner across the street that’s ready now, and we will resume our policy go-round tomorrow morning at 9:00 am September 21 Session .	52.0	65.0
201609	1698	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	52.0	65.0
201609	1699	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s get started.	52.0	65.0
201609	1700	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to call on Steve Kamin to discuss the Bank of Japan actions.	11.0	65.0
201609	1701	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11.0	999.0
201609	1702	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Obviously, my colleagues and I were just as shocked as you all were when we woke up to the news this morning.	11.0	999.0
201609	1703	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Who would have guessed that, after all of these years, Brad and Angelina would have finally split up?	11.0	999.0
201609	1704	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	[Laughter]	11.0	999.0
201609	1705	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	By comparison, the Bank of Japan’s announcement following its monetary policy meeting yesterday was more in line with expectations.	11.0	999.0
201609	1706	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Just to back up and reiterate what Paul Wood described yesterday, the Bank of Japan has basically been struggling with two main monetary control problems of late.	11.0	999.0
201609	1707	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	One of them is how to get inflation and inflation expectations back up to its 2 percent target.	11.0	999.0
201609	1708	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	And the second problem is how to do that without further flattening the yield curve and putting downward pressure on bank profits and those of pension funds, insurance companies, and other financial intermediaries.	11.0	999.0
201609	1709	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	In response to those concerns, the Bank of Japan launched the so-called comprehensive assessment project.	11.0	999.0
201609	1710	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	The outcome of that, which was announced last night, was basically two main elements of the program.	11.0	999.0
201609	1711	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	The first of these is a so-called inflation-overshooting commitment, in which the Bank of Japan commits itself to expand the monetary base until the observed rate of increase in the CPI exceeds 2 percent in a stable manner.	11.0	999.0
201609	1712	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Now, that has at least two, or maybe two and a half, distinctive elements.	11.0	999.0
201609	1713	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	The first of those is that the Bank of Japan basically abandoned a particular date at which it was predicting that it would achieve its 2 percent target.	11.0	999.0
201609	1714	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	The second aspect of that is that it committed not just to hit its target, but also to exceed it.	11.0	999.0
201609	1715	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	And the third was a slight clarification, being very explicit, that the QE program would continue until it achieved that slight overshoot.	11.0	999.0
201609	1716	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	It had had a soft commitment before to continuing the program until it got to its target.	11.0	999.0
201609	1717	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	But this made it a little bit more concrete.	11.0	999.0
201609	1718	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	That was the first aspect of its announcement.	11.0	999.0
201609	1719	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	The second aspect was a so-called yield curve control aspect.	11.0	999.0
201609	1720	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Basically, that involved a commitment to control both the short-term and the long-term aspects of the yield curve in order to prevent a shallowing of the yield curve that would put excessive pressure on financial industry profits.	11.0	999.0
201609	1721	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	In particular, the Bank of Japan committed to keep the 10-year yield at zero.	11.0	999.0
201609	1722	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	It had previously been below zero.	11.0	999.0
201609	1723	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Then it announced a number of technical measures that might be used to achieve that, including buying JGBs at a fixed interest rate and even making low fixed- rate loans up to 10 years’ maturity.	11.0	999.0
201609	1724	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	In the event, that was the basic framework that the Bank of Japan announced.	11.0	999.0
201609	1725	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	It didn’t really announce any concrete new actions immediately or for the future, but the framework is broadly consistent with our earlier forecast that the Bank of Japan would continue to make heavy QE purchases over the next several years and might, in certain situations—greater weakness— lower the near-term policy rate further into negative territory.	11.0	999.0
201609	1726	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	But neither of those actions was taken today.	11.0	999.0
201609	1727	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	The announcement was, broadly speaking, in line with market expectations.	11.0	999.0
201609	1728	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	In response, the JGB yield moved a little bit—for the 10-year, a little further up, although it’s still a little bit negative.	11.0	999.0
201609	1729	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	The basic index of stock prices in Japan rose about 2 percent.	11.0	999.0
201609	1730	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Commercial bank stocks rose a lot more, around 7 percent.	11.0	999.0
201609	1731	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	The yen initially weakened, which was presumably part of the goal of the program, but actually has subsequently strengthened.	11.0	999.0
201609	1732	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Right now, it’s actually slightly stronger than it was before the announcement for reasons that are a little bit unclear.	11.0	999.0
201609	1733	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Global markets have pretty much taken everything in stride.	11.0	999.0
201609	1734	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Foreign stock prices are up a bit.	11.0	999.0
201609	1735	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	I think US futures are little changed, and US yields are little changed, too.	11.0	999.0
201609	1736	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	So that’s what I have for you.	11.0	999.0
201609	1737	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	I’d be happy to take any of your questions.	11.0	999.0
201609	1738	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	12.0	65.0
201609	1739	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	In the press release, I saw they talked about keeping their 10-year at zero, associated with bond buying.	12.0	110.0
201609	1740	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	But it struck me:  Won’t they need to sell the 10-year to keep the rate at zero?	12.0	110.0
201609	1741	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	I think the answer could well be “yes,” but they were not explicit on that point.	12.0	999.0
201609	1742	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Okay.	12.0	110.0
201609	1743	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	So they could do either, and people are anticipating they could actually sell the 10-year, if necessary.	12.0	110.0
201609	1744	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	I don’t know that people are expecting that, but it is a natural question to ask.	12.0	999.0
201609	1745	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	There are no details yet.	12.0	999.0
201609	1746	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	I think, at the end of the month, they’ll release more details.	12.0	999.0
201609	1747	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Okay, got it.	12.0	110.0
201609	1748	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any other questions?	12.0	65.0
201609	1749	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	12.0	65.0
201609	1750	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Steve, are you willing to speculate on any spillover onto our yield curve?	12.0	88.0
201609	1751	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	A few weeks ago, the Wall Street Journal, I believe, carried an article that talked about major Japanese institutions essentially buying the long end of our curve, hedged.	12.0	88.0
201609	1752	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	At that time, they were concerned that if the hedges expired and they went off hedge, it could have some effect on the yield curve here in the United States.	12.0	88.0
201609	1753	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	How should we think about this affecting financial conditions and the dollar?	12.0	88.0
201609	1754	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	I guess what I’d say is that if their actions had involved a much more substantial change in their target for yields—for example, if their goal was to drive 10-year JGB yields up to 25 or 50 basis points—you could imagine that actually having a material effect on capital flows and leading to some upward pressure on our longer-term yields and perhaps downward pressure on the dollar.	12.0	999.0
201609	1755	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	But so far, as they are targeting the 10-year yield at zero, which is only a little bit higher than it had been, it doesn’t seem like the changes that are in store are large enough, at least for now, to make a material difference for the dollar or our yields.	12.0	999.0
201609	1756	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Again, this announcement is more like a backup or contingency plan just in case the yield curve was to get too shallow again.	12.0	999.0
201609	1757	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions?	12.0	65.0
201609	1758	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	12.0	65.0
201609	1759	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	But doesn’t that constrain their ability to actually go more negative?	12.0	90.0
201609	1760	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Presumably, if you’re fixing the 10-year rate at zero, people can go in and out of the 10-year at zero risk as long as that peg is on.	12.0	90.0
201609	1761	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	So, as they lower the short end of the market, you’d assume there’d be no trading at the short end.	12.0	90.0
201609	1762	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	People would just be buying at the 10-year maturity.	12.0	90.0
201609	1763	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Am I missing something?	12.0	90.0
201609	1764	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Well, let’s put it this way.	12.0	999.0
201609	1765	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	I think the goal is to anchor the long end so that the yield does not fall too much, giving them the freedom, in some sense, to lower the short end even further into negative territory.	12.0	999.0
201609	1766	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	In their announcement, further down in the text, they talk about their view that Japanese economic performance is more influenced by short- and medium-term yields than by longer-term yields, with the longer-term yields being the ones that might, if they fall, negatively affect the financial industry.	12.0	999.0
201609	1767	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Who’s the marginal investor that would choose to be at the short end rather than at the long end, in which they can go in and out at will as long as there is rate pegging?	12.0	90.0
201609	1768	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The point is, you’re reducing the risk of moving to a 10-year instrument.	12.0	96.0
201609	1769	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	They haven’t shown that they can actually do it yet.	12.0	999.0
201609	1770	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	So that would be part of it.	12.0	999.0
201609	1771	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	I think your point is well made.	12.0	999.0
201609	1772	2016-09-21	meeting	KAMIN	Suddenly, it makes the 10-year look like a great risk-free investment.	12.0	999.0
201609	1773	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Although your prospects for capital gains on the 10-year will go away.	12.0	96.0
201609	1774	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	It could be argued before that if you thought Japan was going to continue to go into deflation and 10-year yields could keep falling, they had a capital-gains component—which they’re taking off the table now.	12.0	96.0
201609	1775	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think it’s pretty complicated to see how people react to this, frankly.	12.0	96.0
201609	1776	2016-09-21	meeting	POTTER	If it is credible—you’d be taking the capital gains off it.	12.0	999.0
201609	1777	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any further questions?	12.0	65.0
201609	1778	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	12.0	65.0
201609	1779	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12.0	65.0
201609	1780	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	If I might, I’d like to start off our policy go-round, and I want to emphasize that today’s decision is not an easy one.	23.0	65.0
201609	1781	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	On the basis of the data in hand, one person may reasonably conclude that the economic outlook and associated risks argue for an increase in the target range today, while another looking at the same information reasonably decides that holding off is the better strategy.	23.0	65.0
201609	1782	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	In contrast to many of our previous meetings, the appropriate policy decision today is not clear cut.	23.0	65.0
201609	1783	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	This ambiguity is reflected in alternatives B and C, which present essentially the same characterization of the incoming data and the economic outlook yet arrive at different conclusions about what action we should take.	23.0	65.0
201609	1784	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	We may not all agree on today’s decision, but I think, in line with the SEP, that most of us will be inclined to support an increase in the federal funds rate before year-end if the economy continues along its current trajectory, with economic growth picking up as expected, continued solid employment gains, an absence of notable downside inflation surprises, and the emergence of no significant new risks.	23.0	65.0
201609	1785	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	If this assessment is correct, we should be careful not to exaggerate the consequences of raising the federal funds rate now as opposed to in an upcoming meeting.	23.0	65.0
201609	1786	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	My recommendation for today is not to move and to adopt alternative B, teeing up a likely move in December if things move along their current course.	23.0	65.0
201609	1787	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	But why not move now,as the economic consequences of tightening today instead of waiting until December are probably minimal?	23.0	65.0
201609	1788	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	At our July meeting, after all, I said that raising the target range in September would likely be appropriate if we saw reasonably strong payroll gains in July and August, which we have, and the overall outlook remained favorable, which it has.	23.0	65.0
201609	1789	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	And, at the Jackson Hole symposium, I said that the case for tightening had strengthened.	23.0	65.0
201609	1790	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Still, despite the generally satisfactory state of current conditions, I recommend that we hold off raising the funds rate for the moment for two reasons.	23.0	65.0
201609	1791	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	First, incoming data suggest to me that we have a bit more running room than I’d anticipated, and I see little danger that monetary policy is falling “behind the curve.”	23.0	65.0
201609	1792	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	As I said yesterday, some slack still remains in the labor market.	23.0	65.0
201609	1793	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Utilization appears to be increasing at a relatively slow pace.	23.0	65.0
201609	1794	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	There are few signs of emerging inflationary pressures, and inflation continues to run below our objective.	23.0	65.0
201609	1795	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Under these conditions, we can afford to proceed patiently, and doing so will promote additional labor market improvements and so speed the return to 2 percent inflation.	23.0	65.0
201609	1796	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’ll have ample time to adjust policy in the event the economy shows signs of becoming overheated.	23.0	65.0
201609	1797	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	After all, as long as we remain in a low-r* environment, it won’t take very many rate increases to get back to a neutral policy stance.	23.0	65.0
201609	1798	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Furthermore, a moderately tight labor market might also pull more people back into the labor force than we anticipate, and that’s a potential supply-side benefit that we shouldn’t close off prematurely.	23.0	65.0
201609	1799	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Indeed, as I noted yesterday, we have seen solid employment growth over the past year without significant declines in either U-3 or U-6.	23.0	65.0
201609	1800	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Over the past year, the labor market seems to have had more room to improve without creating inflation pressures than I’d expected.	23.0	65.0
201609	1801	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	This is an important reason why I’m inclined, in the words of alternative B, “for the time being, to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward [our] objectives.”	23.0	65.0
201609	1802	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Second, I consider waiting until we’ve seen somewhat more progress on our objectives advisable on risk-management grounds.	23.0	65.0
201609	1803	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	If economic growth in the second half of the year was to turn out to be stronger than I anticipate or if we were to begin seeing signs of accelerating wages and prices, we would have ample opportunity to respond appropriately over the course of 2017 and beyond.	23.0	65.0
201609	1804	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	But if economic conditions were instead to turn out to be weaker than expected or if downside risks to the outlook were to emerge, then we would probably regret having decided to move today.	23.0	65.0
201609	1805	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	After all, the surprising events that we’ve encountered so far this year—turmoil in global financial markets, wild month-to-month swings in the data, and Brexit— demonstrate that bumps in the road are common and the concerns related to the effective lower bound are not to be dismissed.	23.0	65.0
201609	1806	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	And this is especially true in an environment in which we find ourselves repeatedly lowering our estimates of r*.	23.0	65.0
201609	1807	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	While I strongly believe that economic performance has been well served by our caution in raising interest rates thus far this year, we clearly can’t delay too long because policy does need to be forward looking.	23.0	65.0
201609	1808	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	If labor market conditions improve somewhat further in coming months, as I expect, then a December rate hike will, in all likelihood, be warranted to reduce the risk of the unemployment rate markedly undershooting its longer-run level in 2017 and beyond.	23.0	65.0
201609	1809	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	I think an increase will be appropriate even if inflation readings remain near their current levels, as I expect.	23.0	65.0
201609	1810	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	The language in alternative B is meant to convey this expectation for policy.	23.0	65.0
201609	1811	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	I recognize that the phrase “for the time being” is essentially a calendar-based reference, but I think, in the current circumstances, we need to be clear in our intentions.	23.0	65.0
201609	1812	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Softening this language by just saying that policy will be data dependent would, in my view, only increase confusion about our reaction function and intentions.	23.0	65.0
201609	1813	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	So let me stop there, and our next speaker is President Williams.	23.0	65.0
201609	1814	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	102.0
201609	1815	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I favor alternative C.	23.0	102.0
201609	1816	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’re at full employment, the labor market is robust, and inflation is on a path to meet our 2 percent target over the medium term.	23.0	102.0
201609	1817	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Interestingly, as you just said, this is the characterization of the economy in both alternatives B and C.	23.0	102.0
201609	1818	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	In arguing for an increase in interest rates, I want to emphasize that I’m not seeking to derail the economic expansion.	23.0	102.0
201609	1819	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s exactly the opposite.	23.0	102.0
201609	1820	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	My aim is to keep it on a sound footing so that it can be sustained for a long time.	23.0	102.0
201609	1821	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I do worry that further delays in raising rates increase the risk of unintended consequences down the road.	23.0	102.0
201609	1822	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, we had a good start of a discussion yesterday.	23.0	102.0
201609	1823	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Governor Tarullo, President Rosengren, President Evans, President George, and I all commented on this issue, and I always like it when a conversation breaks out at the meeting.	23.0	102.0
201609	1824	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	23.0	102.0
201609	1825	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So that’s a good thing.	23.0	102.0
201609	1826	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I do look to see more work coming from the staff on these issues about these unintended consequences of waiting too long.	23.0	102.0
201609	1827	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do think we have to be humble about our understanding of that.	23.0	102.0
201609	1828	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yesterday there was a little bit of going through, recession by recession, and finding, well, that was because of this, and that was because of that.	23.0	102.0
201609	1829	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think we don’t truly understand the dynamics surrounding recessions.	23.0	102.0
201609	1830	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m taken back to an event that happened to me that has stuck with me ever since.	23.0	102.0
201609	1831	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	That was when I was on the staff of the Council of Economic Advisers sometime in 1999 or 2000—I can’t remember exactly when.	23.0	102.0
201609	1832	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	But then-Chairman Greenspan came and gave an impromptu talk about recessions in the hallway of the Old Executive Office Building.	23.0	102.0
201609	1833	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	It was interesting because, of course, at the time we were well along the way of the longest expansion in the history of the US economy.	23.0	102.0
201609	1834	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Everything was looking great.	23.0	102.0
201609	1835	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	And his talk was basically that we don’t understand the dynamics of the economy when it’s in recession.	23.0	102.0
201609	1836	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	He emphasized the nonlinear aspects of how things happen when the economy, for whatever reason, goes off the cliff.	23.0	102.0
201609	1837	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	He also emphasized that our linear models—of course, at the time, that’s what my day job was, working on the FRB/US model—are good at capturing the dynamics during expansions and normal times, but, during recessions, they don’t capture the dynamics there.	23.0	102.0
201609	1838	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think David Wilcox mentioned that one of the facts we don’t understand is, why does unemployment move very gradually down, but, when it moves up, it moves up very sharply?	23.0	102.0
201609	1839	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even back then, I remember talking in 2000 about this little factoid—that you never see unemployment rates move up by any significant amount without there being a recession.	23.0	102.0
201609	1840	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I think we should be humble in our understanding of the dynamics.	23.0	102.0
201609	1841	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s not the case that I think we should just be looking at, well, monetary policy causes recessions.	23.0	102.0
201609	1842	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think imbalances form when the economy runs too hot for too long.	23.0	102.0
201609	1843	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Those can happen in a multitude of different ways, and the dynamics of that are hard to understand.	23.0	102.0
201609	1844	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, in thinking about risk management, we have to take seriously the fact that if we do drive the unemployment rate down to 4.2 percent or 4 percent, or even lower, then those risks would grow significantly.	23.0	102.0
201609	1845	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	At this point, our policy stance already incorporates a significant amount of delay, and that’s illustrated in the optimal control simulations in Tealbook B.	23.0	102.0
201609	1846	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	For instance, if you have a minimal weight on rate adjustments—this artificial cost of moving the funds rate around—the optimal control simulation calls for a 350 basis point increase in the funds rate by the end of next year.	23.0	102.0
201609	1847	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	That just shows you how big the gap is between where we would be in optimal control, given the objective, and where we are today in that simulation.	23.0	102.0
201609	1848	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, importantly, that simulation ignores uncertainty.	23.0	102.0
201609	1849	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, again, it just shows you how heavily we already are weighing risk-management arguments in the current stance of policy.	23.0	102.0
201609	1850	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	If you look at another optimal control simulation that does penalize rate adjustments— you might think of this as a proxy for a cautious approach—it projects a lower path of the funds rate.	23.0	102.0
201609	1851	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	But even there, the simulation has two rate increases this year and has us reaching the long-run neutral rate by the end of next year.	23.0	102.0
201609	1852	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, again, I think these optimal control simulations provide some context for thinking about, absent risk management and other asymmetries, where we would be, and then you can adjust from there.	23.0	102.0
201609	1853	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	More concretely, the median SEP forecast back in June called for two 25 basis point rate increases.	23.0	102.0
201609	1854	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Since then, strong employment gains have resumed, the Brexit vote has passed without any near-term consequences, inflation data have been basically right what we thought, equity markets have risen, and there’s really been very little movement in the dollar.	23.0	102.0
201609	1855	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	There’s been a notable decrease in the spread between high- and low-grade corporate debt, and that could reflect some increased search-for-yield activity.	23.0	102.0
201609	1856	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Taken together, financial conditions are easier than in June, and the risks of getting “behind the curve” loom larger.	23.0	102.0
201609	1857	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Accordingly, at this meeting, I support alternative C as written.	23.0	102.0
201609	1858	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I actually do understand that that’s not the decision the Committee will likely make today.	23.0	102.0
201609	1859	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	In that light, I would comment on the language in alternative B.	23.0	102.0
201609	1860	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	In view of the decision that’s going to be made, I think the language in alternative B is about the best that can be hoped for in explaining the reasoning for today’s decision for further delay.	23.0	102.0
201609	1861	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Madam Chair, I think your description of the reasoning makes sense.	23.0	102.0
201609	1862	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	It takes an appropriately positive stand on the economy and its direction, consistent with our policy goals and longer-run strategy statement and our past FOMC statements.	23.0	102.0
201609	1863	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Importantly, it does not introduce new hurdles or conditions for future action.	23.0	102.0
201609	1864	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, again, I think that the statement is about as good as I could hope for at this juncture.	23.0	102.0
201609	1865	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23.0	102.0
201609	1866	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	1867	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	23.0	65.0
201609	1868	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201609	1869	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	My views are actually quite consistent with what President Williams just laid out.	23.0	90.0
201609	1870	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would say that I would also endorse his view that it would be quite worthwhile to have a discussion of what the likelihood and costs of possibly overshooting are.	23.0	90.0
201609	1871	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think those comments were made by Governor Tarullo and Vice Chairman Dudley yesterday, and I think that that would be a very good discussion to have.	23.0	90.0
201609	1872	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	For this meeting, I support alternative C.	23.0	90.0
201609	1873	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Since our last tightening in December, we have made significant progress toward achieving our dual mandate.	23.0	90.0
201609	1874	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	We have added more than 1 million jobs since the beginning of the year.	23.0	90.0
201609	1875	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	As evidence that labor markets have tightened relative to earlier in the recovery, wages have risen gradually above the 2 percent level that they seemed stuck at earlier.	23.0	90.0
201609	1876	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Core PCE inflation was running between 1.3 and 1.4 percent and is now at 1.6 percent.	23.0	90.0
201609	1877	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	This progress has occurred despite significant headwinds from abroad, including a slowdown in China, a surprising Brexit vote, and continued European banking problems.	23.0	90.0
201609	1878	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Based solely on the economic progress since our last tightening, a further increase in rates could easily be justified.	23.0	90.0
201609	1879	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is in the forecast, however, that the case for raising rates at this meeting becomes even more compelling.	23.0	90.0
201609	1880	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	The Tealbook’s and my own forecast expect that by 2019, the unemployment rate will have dropped to 4.2 percent despite an assumption that monetary policy accommodation is more aggressively removed.	23.0	90.0
201609	1881	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	As I highlighted yesterday, such overshoots in the past have always been followed by recessions, as the unsustainably low unemployment rate begins to generate higher inflation rates, rising asset prices, or both.	23.0	90.0
201609	1882	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Driving the unemployment rate to such a low level goes well beyond probing on full employment.	23.0	90.0
201609	1883	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	We should aim for a long and durable recovery.	23.0	90.0
201609	1884	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	A significant overshoot of full employment places the recovery in jeopardy.	23.0	90.0
201609	1885	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	We now have the ability to raise rates gradually and gently probe to find the level of full employment.	23.0	90.0
201609	1886	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	But our ability to gently probe shrinks the longer we defer action.	23.0	90.0
201609	1887	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Failure to continue the gradual removal of accommodation now could ultimately require us to raise rates faster and more aggressively, which could shorten rather than lengthen the duration of this expansion.	23.0	90.0
201609	1888	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, I am arguing for tightening now out of a concern that not doing so today will put the recovery at greater risk.	23.0	90.0
201609	1889	2016-09-21	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201609	1890	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	1891	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23.0	65.0
201609	1892	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	81.0
201609	1893	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	At our July meeting, I argued that our policy rate should be moving back toward a more normal level because estimated gaps for both inflation and real activity are currently quite small.	23.0	81.0
201609	1894	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Economic conditions have not changed materially since our July meeting, so I believe an increase in our policy rates is appropriate today.	23.0	81.0
201609	1895	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Accordingly, I support alternative C.	23.0	81.0
201609	1896	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	I’d argue the delay represents an increasingly significant departure from our past behavior.	23.0	81.0
201609	1897	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	At our July meeting, I made reference to parametric policy rules that support the case for raising rates.	23.0	81.0
201609	1898	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Those benchmark reaction functions—Taylor rules, if you will—do a good job of describing our behavior during past periods in which monetary policy seems to have been effective.	23.0	81.0
201609	1899	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	It’s important to emphasize that these are relevant whether or not you believe that we are following a Taylor rule or we make direct reference to a Taylor rule in the formulation of policy then or now.	23.0	81.0
201609	1900	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	We may have thought of ourselves as looking at everything and setting policy optimally in the past, but whatever we were doing gave rise to the fact—the clear fact—that Taylor rules do a good job of characterizing the statistical relationship between those gap variables on the right-hand side and our policy-setting.	23.0	81.0
201609	1901	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	So, to behave in a way that generates a significant variance between those relationships that are captured in the data suggests that we are departing from past policy-setting principles, whatever those principles were and whatever we founded them on.	23.0	81.0
201609	1902	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Even after adjusting the econometric estimates for the downward trend in the natural real rate of interest, rates ought to be substantially higher than they are now, according to these benchmarks.	23.0	81.0
201609	1903	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	For example, the two non-inertial Taylor rules shown in the Tealbook both show values above 2¼ percent.	23.0	81.0
201609	1904	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Those implementations use the staff’s assumed r* value of ¾ percent.	23.0	81.0
201609	1905	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Using the current estimates of basically zero from Lubik-Matthes or Laubach-Williams, you still get values around 1½ percent.	23.0	81.0
201609	1906	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	These benchmark rules take into account the degree to which a shortfall of inflation from our goal would, in the past, stay our hand.	23.0	81.0
201609	1907	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	So even if we account for our core inflation running around 1.6 percent, past practice indicates that an increase in the funds rate target today is well warranted.	23.0	81.0
201609	1908	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Those benchmark rules capture the extent to which we’ve consistently tightened policy in the past as labor market slack was eliminated in order to preclude having to raise rates precipitously later on and risk inducing a recession, as President Rosengren alluded to.	23.0	81.0
201609	1909	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Presidents Rosengren and Williams have spoken convincingly about this risk in public in recent weeks, as did you, Madam Chair, last December.	23.0	81.0
201609	1910	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	In the SEP submissions for our December 2015 meeting, the median funds rate for the end of this year was 1.3 percent, which would have represented four further rate increases.	23.0	81.0
201609	1911	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	That path would have closed a good part of the gap between actual rates and our benchmark.	23.0	81.0
201609	1912	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Presumably, those rate increases would have occurred at the press conference meetings in March, June, September, and December.	23.0	81.0
201609	1913	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Instead, a series of special factors emerged, which caused us to delay raising rates.	23.0	81.0
201609	1914	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	In March it was global market turbulence, and in June it was the May employment report and looming Brexit risks.	23.0	81.0
201609	1915	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	These concerns might have been plausible and reasonable at the time, but the downside risks failed to materialize.	23.0	81.0
201609	1916	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Actual economic data since December have been close to what we expected, and the outlook for employment and inflation is relatively unchanged as well.	23.0	81.0
201609	1917	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The usefulness of Taylor rules as policy guides is not inconsistent with temporary departures.	23.0	81.0
201609	1918	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	After all, the historical fit is seldom perfect, and the residuals presumably reflect outlook-relevant information to which policymakers responded beyond what was captured by the usual right-hand-side gap variable.	23.0	81.0
201609	1919	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Nonetheless, a more substantial and sizable—a more persistent—departure from how we behaved in the past would be problematic.	23.0	81.0
201609	1920	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Inflation expectations rest squarely on beliefs about how we are likely to respond to future developments.	23.0	81.0
201609	1921	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	While our communications can play a useful role in fostering public understanding of our likely future responses, actions generally speak louder than words.	23.0	81.0
201609	1922	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Accumulated observations on our past conduct are likely to be the critical determinant of public beliefs about our behavior.	23.0	81.0
201609	1923	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	New observations that conflict with expectations will ultimately result in shifts in beliefs, and those shifts could be sudden and unpredictable.	23.0	81.0
201609	1924	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Such shifts would pose a real risk to the stability of inflation expectations.	23.0	81.0
201609	1925	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Holding steady yet again at this meeting would represent a substantial and persistent movement away from how we’ve typically behaved in similar circumstances.	23.0	81.0
201609	1926	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	It would represent not only a deviation from the behavior that served us well in the past, but also a deviation from the behavior that in December we led markets to expect this year.	23.0	81.0
201609	1927	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	No obvious disturbances at hand that would justify such a departure, and the clear implication is that a discrete shift in our policy reaction function is in train.	23.0	81.0
201609	1928	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	In particular, we would appear to be moving away from preemption, the defining element of the strategy that ushered in the current multidecade period of inflation stability that we now take for granted.	23.0	81.0
201609	1929	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Preemption meant raising rates before inflation began rising precipitously.	23.0	81.0
201609	1930	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	It meant raising rates before we run out of running room.	23.0	81.0
201609	1931	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	In attempting to wring out slack, we seem to be implicitly adopting a reaction function that places heavy reliance on our ability to tighten policy just in time in response to accelerating inflation.	23.0	81.0
201609	1932	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	The current quiescence of inflation and inflation expectations suggests that markets may be sanguine about our shifting policy strategy, but history suggests that this is cold comfort.	23.0	81.0
201609	1933	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	Erosion of credibility occurs most often after the application of too much stimulus rather than before or during.	23.0	81.0
201609	1934	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	I recognize the legitimate concern that the asymmetric effectiveness of our policy instrument in a low-natural-rate environment makes the risks to our objective skewed to the downside.	23.0	81.0
201609	1935	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	But I believe that a later-but-faster strategy of moving little unless inflation pressures actually emerge gives rise to risks that are skewed heavily in the other direction, and, for me, the latter outweigh the former.	23.0	81.0
201609	1936	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	1937	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23.0	65.0
201609	1938	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201609	1939	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	I think the decision to raise the policy rate at this meeting versus later this year is a close call.	23.0	88.0
201609	1940	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	In the big scheme of things, an increase at this meeting, as opposed to the November or December meeting, won’t matter much in its effect on the real economy.	23.0	88.0
201609	1941	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Therefore, exercising my prerogative as a nonvoter, I’m prepared to support either alternative B or alternative C, and I won’t vehemently oppose waiting until December.	23.0	88.0
201609	1942	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	On the basis of the data in hand and progress toward objectives in my forecast for the second half of this year and 2017, I believe there’s a good data-dependent case for at least one increase this year.	23.0	88.0
201609	1943	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	My criteria are growth of real GDP and of employment at rates consistent with absorbing remaining resource slack over the forecast horizon.	23.0	88.0
201609	1944	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	I’ve also been looking for indications that wage growth is picking up.	23.0	88.0
201609	1945	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	I see those conditions as being satisfied by the third- quarter data we now have in hand.	23.0	88.0
201609	1946	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Because the probable decision today is alternative B, I’d like to comment on some implications as I see the situation for the next two meetings.	23.0	88.0
201609	1947	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	The case for waiting, as I see it, is to accumulate more data evidence that the current read on third-quarter activity is not a head fake and progress toward our objectives will be sustained into the fourth quarter.	23.0	88.0
201609	1948	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	In light of some weaker signals in the very recent incoming data, I see the wisdom of this approach.	23.0	88.0
201609	1949	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	But the forward lean in paragraph 3 of alternative B naturally raises the question of, at what point over the next two meetings will we likely have accumulated enough evidence that we remain on track to pull the trigger on a rate increase?	23.0	88.0
201609	1950	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Looking to the data calendar, by the November meeting, we will have just one more employment report.	23.0	88.0
201609	1951	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	By the December meeting, we will have two more employment reports.	23.0	88.0
201609	1952	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Otherwise, we will not have a lot of information on the fourth quarter, particularly about economic growth or inflation.	23.0	88.0
201609	1953	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	If December is the date we have in mind, it strikes me that labor market developments, therefore, will be the determining factor in the decision.	23.0	88.0
201609	1954	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	In view of the forward lean in the alternative B draft statement, it’s desirable to have a common understanding of what data will be required to make a “go” or “no go” call and when we will have that data in hand.	23.0	88.0
201609	1955	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Without that understanding, I’m concerned that the Committee is inviting communications challenges on the question of why we passed on this meeting—and might pass on the November meeting, if that’s what we choose to do.	23.0	88.0
201609	1956	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	I have some reservations about delaying a rate increase decision to December.	23.0	88.0
201609	1957	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	My reservations relate to risk events that could be timed to be around the December meeting.	23.0	88.0
201609	1958	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Although the date has not yet been set, there’s a possibility the Italian constitutional referendum could be scheduled around the time of our meeting.	23.0	88.0
201609	1959	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	The Italian referendum is considered by some observers to be critical to the future of the EU.	23.0	88.0
201609	1960	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Closer to home, there’s a chance that the continuing resolution expected to be passed by the Congress before the elections will expire on or about December 9.	23.0	88.0
201609	1961	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Depending on election results, there could be another budget showdown just before we meet.	23.0	88.0
201609	1962	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	These are events that could create a lot of volatility in financial markets and an awkward environment for a rate hike, even if the data play out in a satisfactory way.	23.0	88.0
201609	1963	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Let me emphasize that I’m not projecting that market noise and volatility associated with these transitory events will materially affect inflation and employment outcomes.	23.0	88.0
201609	1964	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Brexit passed with little apparent effect on the real economy of the United States.	23.0	88.0
201609	1965	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	But even if the economic fundamentals are satisfactory for a policy action, the Committee might be hesitant, as we were in June.	23.0	88.0
201609	1966	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	At some point, repeatedly backing off, even if justified by developments, will hurt the Committee’s credibility.	23.0	88.0
201609	1967	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	So I am not opposed to waiting until December, but, with these concerns I’ve expressed, I’m trying to assume an “eyes wide open” mindset.	23.0	88.0
201609	1968	2016-09-21	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201609	1969	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	1970	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	23.0	65.0
201609	1971	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201609	1972	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Because of my fairly upbeat outlook for the economy and the slow but persistent march of inflation to target, I could easily support a funds rate increase at this meeting.	23.0	999.0
201609	1973	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	However, due to a variety of risks, including heightened political and subsequent policy uncertainty, I can see this case for being a bit cautious.	23.0	999.0
201609	1974	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	However, I don’t view the language in alternative B as sufficiently indicative of a funds rate increase by December.	23.0	999.0
201609	1975	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	I actually preferred the original draft language.	23.0	999.0
201609	1976	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	I felt it more clearly communicated a predilection for a rate hike in the near future.	23.0	999.0
201609	1977	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	My reading of that language was that, absent a significant departure from our expectations of how the economy will evolve, we would be raising the funds rate this year.	23.0	999.0
201609	1978	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	The revised language seems a bit more guarded and hedged, which makes me somewhat uncomfortable.	23.0	999.0
201609	1979	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	The current statement acknowledges an improved outlook for the economy and a balanced assessment of risks but remains vague about what it would take for the Committee to raise rates.	23.0	999.0
201609	1980	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	What further evidence do we need for us to move?	23.0	999.0
201609	1981	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Do we need to hit our inflation target or continue to see it evolving in line with the Tealbook forecast—or just be more sure that we will not see any disinflation between now and the end of the year?	23.0	999.0
201609	1982	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	I think we should be clearly signaling that if economic growth appears to be attaining its projected rate, we would very likely raise rates this year.	23.0	999.0
201609	1983	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Now, of course, the signal can be delivered outside of this statement via the press conference and speeches that we all give.	23.0	999.0
201609	1984	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	And we often put too much emphasis on the words in one single statement.	23.0	999.0
201609	1985	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	But I do think it’s important that we begin to move the market probability of a rate increase this year.	23.0	999.0
201609	1986	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Thus, taking that into consideration, I can live with the current alternative B language, although, again, I preferred the original draft language.	23.0	999.0
201609	1987	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	It’s not overly important whether we act today, as several of my colleagues have said, or in the very near future.	23.0	999.0
201609	1988	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	What’s important is that the signal we deliver today and in the future will, in itself, start the process and will achieve some measure of tightening in financial markets that will start to move those probabilities.	23.0	999.0
201609	1989	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	So if economic data materialize in line with the staff forecast, it is very important, in my view—I echo President Lockhart—and I think it’s important to the credibility of the Committee, that we act this year.	23.0	999.0
201609	1990	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	I think it’s important that we send a strong signal today and in the future that we will.	23.0	999.0
201609	1991	2016-09-21	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201609	1992	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	1993	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23.0	65.0
201609	1994	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201609	1995	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	In my opinion, normalization is not going well.	23.0	94.0
201609	1996	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I think our normalization program is, in fact, on the rocks.	23.0	94.0
201609	1997	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We began the year expecting four increases in the policy rate.	23.0	94.0
201609	1998	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We’re going to end the year with one or possibly no increases in the policy rate.	23.0	94.0
201609	1999	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Moving once a year is not a normalization program.	23.0	94.0
201609	2000	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We should quit describing it as such.	23.0	94.0
201609	2001	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	It would take eight years to go 200 basis points.	23.0	94.0
201609	2002	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	That’s way outside of any business cycle time with which we’re familiar.	23.0	94.0
201609	2003	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	This, in my opinion, is very damaging to the credibility of the Committee, and I worry that now we may not have credibility when we actually need it in the future.	23.0	94.0
201609	2004	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	The real ex post rate on government paper is very low.	23.0	94.0
201609	2005	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We should be looking at this rate, which we’re calling r† in St Louis, as the key rate because there are other assets in the economy.	23.0	94.0
201609	2006	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	It’s not clear that all real rates of return are low.	23.0	94.0
201609	2007	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	In particular, rates of return on capital right out of the GDP accounts have not fallen nearly as much as real rates of return on government paper.	23.0	94.0
201609	2008	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	The slow growth in the US economy is largely driven by slow productivity growth.	23.0	94.0
201609	2009	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	So we should treat this as a regime.	23.0	94.0
201609	2010	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	It’s almost like thinking of it as a steady state, except that you’re acknowledging you can pop out of that steady state at some point in the future.	23.0	94.0
201609	2011	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	The implication of viewing things this way is that the market-based expectations of what this Committee will do are ratified, and you get a view of future rates that is more realistic versus thinking in terms of the Taylor (1999) policy rule.	23.0	94.0
201609	2012	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	The policy rate increase last December packed a punch much larger than anticipated.	23.0	94.0
201609	2013	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Global market turmoil increased substantially, and, in my opinion, this was because the one rate hike was accompanied by a projection of four additional increases during 2016.	23.0	94.0
201609	2014	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	This event made me think that we have the wrong model, and I’m sympathetic with President Williams’s comments just now about how out of line with reality some of the things we’re looking at in our optimal control exercises are.	23.0	94.0
201609	2015	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We should think in terms of this slow-growth, low real interest rate regime that corresponds more closely to reality.	23.0	94.0
201609	2016	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We should design policy for the regime we’re in.	23.0	94.0
201609	2017	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Policy should be regime dependent.	23.0	94.0
201609	2018	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	The mean reversion to the so-called normality of the past gets de-emphasized appropriately in this type of formulation.	23.0	94.0
201609	2019	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Under this interpretation, the current policy rate is only slightly less than neutral, and cyclical dynamics coming from the 2007–09 period are completely exhausted.	23.0	94.0
201609	2020	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	There would be no reason to change the policy rate very much in the foreseeable future provided no further major shocks occur.	23.0	94.0
201609	2021	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Major shocks would be regime switches in this formulation.	23.0	94.0
201609	2022	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Instead of thinking of the current policy rate as being far out of position, we can think of the current policy rate as being about rightunder the regime.	23.0	94.0
201609	2023	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I think this is much closer to what markets are thinking and is more appropriate for our situation.	23.0	94.0
201609	2024	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I also think that we should incorporate some thinking along this line in future Tealbook exercises.	23.0	94.0
201609	2025	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	At a minimum, I suggest an alternative simulation with the market expectation of the future policy rate instead of the Taylor (1999) rule, which has become increasingly irrelevant as a benchmark.	23.0	94.0
201609	2026	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I presume that the Board staff’s model—the FRB/US model—and other models would predict that bad things would happen in that scenario.	23.0	94.0
201609	2027	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I think it’s important for this Committee to understand what those bad things are so that we can weight them appropriately, and this feeds into some of the discussion around the table yesterday.	23.0	94.0
201609	2028	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	One could go a step further and feed into the staff model a different regime just by changing the steady state.	23.0	94.0
201609	2029	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	That isn’t really the appropriate way to do it, but it’s a quick and dirty way to do it.	23.0	94.0
201609	2030	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	And the alternative steady state would simply have a very low real rate of return on government paper persisting into the indefinite future, along with a very low growth rate, which is already part of the model.	23.0	94.0
201609	2031	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	That would be a simple way to get at the regime idea.	23.0	94.0
201609	2032	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	We’ve done that with our own models at the St Louis bank, and I’m pretty sure what you’re going to get is very little cyclical dynamics for the period ahead and something that’s much closer to the market expectation for the US economy.	23.0	94.0
201609	2033	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	For today, I support alternative B as written.	23.0	94.0
201609	2034	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I think that the probability on December will rise substantially in reaction to this statement, possibly close to 1.	23.0	94.0
201609	2035	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I think very difficult questions will be asked about the November meeting.	23.0	94.0
201609	2036	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	If it was a close call here, why wouldn’t it also be a close call in November, and possibly the Committee would move in November?	23.0	94.0
201609	2037	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I would see the probability on that meeting moving up as well.	23.0	94.0
201609	2038	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	I think we need to be very clear about what would have to happen to cause us not to move in December.	23.0	94.0
201609	2039	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	This is going to be viewed as more or less committing to a December rate increase.	23.0	94.0
201609	2040	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	If we get to that date and we want to back off that, it’s going to be very difficult to do so, and I don’t want the Committee to be in a position in which we have to plow ahead even though the data have not come in to be supportive of that.	23.0	94.0
201609	2041	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	So that’s a danger about this type of decision that we’re making today, but I agree with others that this is probably the best we can do for today.	23.0	94.0
201609	2042	2016-09-21	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201609	2043	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	2044	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23.0	65.0
201609	2045	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201609	2046	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The theory and practice of central banking provide several lessons for monetary policymakers.	23.0	999.0
201609	2047	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	First, as the Chair indicated, policymakers should be forward looking because monetary policy affects the economy with long and variable lags.	23.0	999.0
201609	2048	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	So policy actions need to be taken before the goals are met, on the basis of the economic outlook over the medium run and the risks to that outlook.	23.0	999.0
201609	2049	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Second, policymakers should strive to be consistent in how they respond to economic conditions and to effectively communicate the rationale for their decisions.	23.0	999.0
201609	2050	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	This helps the public form expectations about the future path of policy and raises public confidence in the policy itself.	23.0	999.0
201609	2051	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Third, policymakers should remain humble about what they know about the economy and how monetary policy can affect it.	23.0	999.0
201609	2052	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	There’s uncertainty associated with the outlook, with the monetary policy transmission mechanisms, and with the underlying structural aspects of the economy, such as the natural rate of unemployment, potential output growth, structural productivity growth, and the equilibrium real rate of interest.	23.0	999.0
201609	2053	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	In view of the uncertainties, monetary policy need not respond in the way suggested by benchmarks that have worked well in the past.	23.0	999.0
201609	2054	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	But when policy does deviate from those benchmarks, policymakers need to think carefully about the factors influencing their decisions to deviate.	23.0	999.0
201609	2055	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	In light of these lessons, I support alternative C today.	23.0	999.0
201609	2056	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Conditional on the outlook, which has been corroborated by economic developments, and the risks associated with the outlook, I believe that a gradual upward path of interest rates is appropriate and that we should take a further step on that path today.	23.0	999.0
201609	2057	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	We’ve made progress on both of our monetary policy goals.	23.0	999.0
201609	2058	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Various forecasts, optimal control exercises, and our own statements indicate that to promote our longer-run policy goals, it’s appropriate that we gradually increase the federal funds rate.	23.0	999.0
201609	2059	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Even after a 25 basis point move today, policy would remain accommodative, with the real federal funds rate below the range of estimates of the equilibrium interest rate.	23.0	999.0
201609	2060	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	This accommodative policy will continue to lend support to the economic expansion in the period ahead.	23.0	999.0
201609	2061	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	In my view, the evidence on labor market conditions in our models indicates that, from the standpoint of what can be achieved using monetary policy, we have met our maximum-employment goal.	23.0	999.0
201609	2062	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I recently visited Hazard, Kentucky, in the heart of Appalachia.	23.0	999.0
201609	2063	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	On the trip, I spoke with several coal miners who were just about to graduate from an electrical fiber-optic lineman program.	23.0	999.0
201609	2064	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Of the 30 coal miners who started the one-year program, 28 were graduating, and all had jobs or were entertaining several job offers.	23.0	999.0
201609	2065	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I was impressed by the program and the people I met.	23.0	999.0
201609	2066	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	These types of programs hold promise in addressing the longer-run workplace development issues our country faces.	23.0	999.0
201609	2067	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I don’t believe monetary policy will be an effective tool with respect to these longer-run issues.	23.0	999.0
201609	2068	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	But the Federal Reserve, through its community development function, does have a role to play in helping such regional transitions.	23.0	999.0
201609	2069	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Via our own objective analysis, we can help measure the scope of the problems communities in transition face, we can study how to make small programs like the one I saw in Kentucky scalable, and we can evaluate the effectiveness of alternative policies and other programs.	23.0	999.0
201609	2070	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Regarding the other part of our mandate, PCE inflation remains below our 2 percent goal, but it’s been rising over the past year as anticipated, and it’s projected to return to 2 percent gradually over the forecast horizon.	23.0	999.0
201609	2071	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	This forecast is supported by other measures of underlying inflation, including the core CPI and the median and trimmed mean CPI measures.	23.0	999.0
201609	2072	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Longer-run inflation expectations have been reasonably stable.	23.0	999.0
201609	2073	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	And this, coupled with growth that’s expected to be slightly above trend, also supports the forecast that inflation will return to goal.	23.0	999.0
201609	2074	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The risks that the Committee has been concerned about have diminished.	23.0	999.0
201609	2075	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The data have shown that the weak reading on employment in May was temporary.	23.0	999.0
201609	2076	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Concerns about the fallout from the UK referendum have subsided.	23.0	999.0
201609	2077	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Financial conditions are accommodative.	23.0	999.0
201609	2078	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	In my view,against the background of progress in achieving our two statutory goals, the economic outlook, and the risks associated with the outlook, today’s decision should not be framed as, “Is it appropriate to take the next step on the gradual policy rate path we communicated?” but rather as, “Is it really appropriate not to take the next step?”	23.0	999.0
201609	2079	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I agree with Governor Tarullo’s remarks yesterday that we need to assess the costs and benefits of our policy options.	23.0	999.0
201609	2080	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Since last December, when we increased rates, our discussions focused on the risks of moving rates up too quickly, and we have emphasized these risks in our communications.	23.0	999.0
201609	2081	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	However, there are also risks to delaying.	23.0	999.0
201609	2082	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I don’t think we’re “behind the curve” yet, but if we continue to wait for every piece of data to line up before we act, we will surely be “behind the curve.”	23.0	999.0
201609	2083	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The lesson that policy should be forward looking is based on the history of poor outcomes when that strategy hasn’t been followed.	23.0	999.0
201609	2084	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Sometimes being prudent means moving the policy rate up.	23.0	999.0
201609	2085	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Some may say that the macro effects of waiting for another meeting or two would be small, but I do see risks in continuing to delay action when incoming information has been corroborating both our outlook and the gradual upward path that we have been communicating is appropriate.	23.0	999.0
201609	2086	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	If we fail to set policy on the basis of the realized and projected progress on our goals and our medium-run outlook, we risk further confusing the public about our policy rationale, reinforcing a growing view that the Committee is acting in a discretionary manner, and undermining the credibility we’ve gained with the public over time.	23.0	999.0
201609	2087	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Our policy lessons tell us that we need to set policy in a manner consistent with the communications we continue to make.	23.0	999.0
201609	2088	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	This isn’t to say that we’re locked in by past communications.	23.0	999.0
201609	2089	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	If it was the case that incoming information had changed our outlook, then we would need to change what we are communicating to the public about our anticipated policy rate path.	23.0	999.0
201609	2090	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	But that’s not the situation we’re in.	23.0	999.0
201609	2091	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	The outlook is little changed, and the consensus anticipation among participants is that a gradual upward path of interest rates is appropriate.	23.0	999.0
201609	2092	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Given economic conditions and the outlook, I believe taking the next action sooner rather than later makes it more likely that the gradual path will indeed turn out to be appropriate.	23.0	999.0
201609	2093	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	If we continue to delay even as we make further progress on our goals, perhaps in an attempt to drive the unemployment rate well below its natural rate in order to generate a cyclical rebound in labor force participation, stronger nominal wage growth, and a faster increase in inflation, then we risk having to undertake a considerably steeper policy rate path later on in order to foster our goals.	23.0	999.0
201609	2094	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Such a strategy is inconsistent with what we have been communicating, and I do not believe it’s a strategy we want to follow.	23.0	999.0
201609	2095	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	As we discussed yesterday, in the past, strategies like that have led to recession.	23.0	999.0
201609	2096	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	As David Wilcox’s briefing yesterday showed, if we end up in recession, it will disproportionately harm the very demographic groups—minorities, older workers, and lower-income people—the strategy was intended to help, because their unemployment rates are more sensitive to downturns.	23.0	999.0
201609	2097	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Moreover, if we end up in a poor outcome, it will also raise questions about our ability to exit from the nontraditional policies we’ve put into effect in the aftermath of the crisis, jeopardizing their use in the future should the need arise.	23.0	999.0
201609	2098	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I’d rather be in a position of being able to move rates up gradually.	23.0	999.0
201609	2099	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I think it gives us a better chance of recalibrating the policy rate path over time as we gain more insights into the underlying structural aspects of the economy I mentioned earlier.	23.0	999.0
201609	2100	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	In my view, there’s a strong case for raising the funds rate target range 25 basis points today, and that’s what I feel compelled to support.	23.0	999.0
201609	2101	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I deeply respect my colleagues around this table.	23.0	999.0
201609	2102	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Some of you hold views that differ from mine, and my reading of the economy and policy judgment may not be correct.	23.0	999.0
201609	2103	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I very much appreciate the Chair’s commitment to fostering an atmosphere in these meetings of serious deliberation and the free exchange of ideas.	23.0	999.0
201609	2104	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	I believe the history of the institution has shown that better policy decisions are made when a diversity of views is considered, and I appreciate the opportunity and responsibility to express my nonconsensus view today.	23.0	999.0
201609	2105	2016-09-21	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201609	2106	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	2107	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23.0	65.0
201609	2108	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201609	2109	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I have to say that these are among the most thoughtful comments I remember on any morning of a policy decision, so I really appreciate the conversations.	23.0	91.0
201609	2110	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	We are facing hard and consequential choices in the period ahead.	23.0	91.0
201609	2111	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	It’s only 25 basis points at the moment, but there’s so much more.	23.0	91.0
201609	2112	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	And I look forward to more conversation about the important issues—about the risk of overshooting and what the evidence is.	23.0	91.0
201609	2113	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	At the moment, I’m reluctant to weigh the evidence that we talked about yesterday on overshooting at face valueon the basis of the time periods that we’ve experienced.	23.0	91.0
201609	2114	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I do recall, as research director, with my former boss providing commentary and advice very much like I’ve heard this morning, about “One way to make sure we can sustain the recovery is by increasing interest rates at this moment, because that’s how we keep the momentum going without overshooting.”	23.0	91.0
201609	2115	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	But I believe all of the overshooting evidence to date was in an environment that’s very different from what we’re facing today.	23.0	91.0
201609	2116	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	In the 1970s, in the ’80s, and in the ’90s, inflation was always well above what the Committee’s objective was—in the 1970s, it was double digits—and the Committee was hoping just to get it down.	23.0	91.0
201609	2117	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	In the 1980s, when Chairman Volcker left office, it was 4 to 5 percent, substantially higher than where we are and what we’ve committed to.	23.0	91.0
201609	2118	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	The advice was always “Let’s get it down.”	23.0	91.0
201609	2119	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	So when we found ourselves overshooting, the risk was so much worse because we were not going to be moving down in a secular fashion, but we were going to lose what progress we’d made.	23.0	91.0
201609	2120	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Now, today, we’re in a very different situation, in which inflation is below our inflation objective.	23.0	91.0
201609	2121	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	How will policy respond?	23.0	91.0
201609	2122	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	It is true that, in the past, Taylor rules have captured the Committee’s intention to raise rates to keep the economy sustainable.	23.0	91.0
201609	2123	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Maybe that’s the way the Committee behaved.	23.0	91.0
201609	2124	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	But we’re lower than our inflation objective, so the Lucas critique really bears minding at this point.	23.0	91.0
201609	2125	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Do we know that the policy environment that the Taylor rule was premised on is the environment that we face now?	23.0	91.0
201609	2126	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I don’t know that the answer is “yes.”	23.0	91.0
201609	2127	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I don’t know what the right answer is to any of these questions.	23.0	91.0
201609	2128	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I look forward to more discussion.	23.0	91.0
201609	2129	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I have to say, I can’t refrain from making the following comment—and I’ve used this myself.	23.0	91.0
201609	2130	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	When we use the term “humble” or “humility,” it’s almost always used in the context that, because I get to say it first, I’m going to talk about what I think is the more humble channel or thought—that type of thing.	23.0	91.0
201609	2131	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	It’s a first-mover advantage, I’ve always felt.	23.0	91.0
201609	2132	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s why you go first.	23.0	102.0
201609	2133	2016-09-21	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	23.0	102.0
201609	2134	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	And I suppose if I had gone first, I could say, “Well, it’s important to be humble,”	23.0	91.0
201609	2135	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I think, about the claim that at 4.9 percent unemployment, “We’re at full employment, and we can’t do better.”	23.0	91.0
201609	2136	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	The Federal Reserve Act says we should seek conditions to support maximum employment.	23.0	91.0
201609	2137	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	It takes a lot of courage, conviction, and strength of how you analyze things to say, “I think that the unemployment rate naturally might be 5 percent.”	23.0	91.0
201609	2138	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Many have that view, and I’m not saying it’s wrong.	23.0	91.0
201609	2139	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I don’t know what the right answer is.	23.0	91.0
201609	2140	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	My own assessment is, it’s lower, and I think that in the current environment, with inflation below our target, we can continue to see how much more room there is to grow.	23.0	91.0
201609	2141	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Madam Chair, I agree with your comment very much in that regard.	23.0	91.0
201609	2142	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Now, having said that, I’ll turn back to my more prepared remarks, with apologies.	23.0	91.0
201609	2143	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I support alternative B—no change in our policy setting today.	23.0	91.0
201609	2144	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Although I worry that the current expansion may be somewhat fragile and there are many risks to the outlook, I believe solid fundamentals for the labor market and the consumer should be adequate to support my baseline projections of moderately above-trend economic growth.	23.0	91.0
201609	2145	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	If core PCE inflation was clearly on its way to 2 percent, then I would see a readjustment of monetary policy toward its long-run neutral setting as an appropriate and easy decision.	23.0	91.0
201609	2146	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I say “toward its long-run neutral setting” because,in view of the headwinds and impediments that remain, the short-run equilibrium federal funds rate likely is still below our longer-run assessment, and that’s like what President Williams indicated yesterday.	23.0	91.0
201609	2147	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	The lack of building wage and price pressures is strong evidence for this hypothesis, especially in light of our long period of low interest rates.	23.0	91.0
201609	2148	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Furthermore, inflation has been below 2 percent for many years, as Governor Brainard mentioned yesterday.	23.0	91.0
201609	2149	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, the inflation endpoint attractor used in the Board model has been stuck near 1¾ percent for quite some time.	23.0	91.0
201609	2150	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	This is consistent with what we see in financial markets, in which participants are clearly much more concerned about ensuring against low-inflation outcomes than they are about above-target inflation.	23.0	91.0
201609	2151	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I’m left thinking that forecasts that have sustainable 2 percent PCE inflation any time soon aren’t much more than hopes, and so we need to be very careful about adjusting policy and communication surrounding the appropriate path that normalization should take.	23.0	91.0
201609	2152	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	In my public commentary, I routinely state that the FOMC has a symmetric 2 percent objective.	23.0	91.0
201609	2153	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Frankly, this comment is often greeted by blank stares.	23.0	91.0
201609	2154	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I can’t recall anyone saying to me that, yes, the FOMC has clearly demonstrated a commitment to a symmetric objective.	23.0	91.0
201609	2155	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Many see 2 percent as a hard ceiling on where we would allow inflation to go.	23.0	91.0
201609	2156	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Again,in light of our inflation performance and public rhetoric, I understand why they think like that.	23.0	91.0
201609	2157	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	This worries me greatly.	23.0	91.0
201609	2158	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	If we end this economic cycle with inflation still below 2 percent, I can’t imagine why anyone will believe us or our future colleagues when we say our symmetric target is 2 percent.	23.0	91.0
201609	2159	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	This will be a huge problem when policy is next confronted with disinflationary forces, a zero- lower-bound challenge, and the need to establish higher inflation expectations in order to lower real rates enough and help right the economy.	23.0	91.0
201609	2160	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Our complacency today and our willingness to try to thread the needle to get to 2 percent without any overshooting will create substantial challenges for Committees in the future.	23.0	91.0
201609	2161	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I worry that we and our future colleagues will regret this lack of a strong and full commitment.	23.0	91.0
201609	2162	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	At the Jackson Hole symposium, Chris Sims regaled us with an elaborate theory indicating that only fiscally irresponsible policies could increase inflation and inflation expectations.	23.0	91.0
201609	2163	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Although I’m unpersuaded by Sims’s highly theoretical analysis without adequate empirical investigation that the role of fiscal policy currently trumps monetary policy for generating higher inflation, my assessment shares one similar characteristic.	23.0	91.0
201609	2164	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	In the current environment, moving inflation expectations from 1¾ percent up to 2 percent requires strong, bold, and explicit policy prescriptions.	23.0	91.0
201609	2165	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I simply do not have confidence that our current expected course of policy adjustments and our existing communications regarding that path will be sufficient.	23.0	91.0
201609	2166	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Alternative B leans very heavily toward a rate increase later this year.	23.0	91.0
201609	2167	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Although the current debate is over when we make the next move, the larger issue is how we’re going to decide on a path of rates after that.	23.0	91.0
201609	2168	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	When we move, we need to think carefully about how we will characterize the conditions for our subsequent rate increases.	23.0	91.0
201609	2169	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Again, in the current environment, I believe achieving our target requires moving the inflation attractor up from 1¾ percent to 2 percent.	23.0	91.0
201609	2170	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I keep saying “attractor.”	23.0	91.0
201609	2171	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	The Board, I understand, uses “underlying inflation,” but that seems to bury the real concept, it seems to me.	23.0	91.0
201609	2172	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	To do this, I believe we need more explicit policy prescriptions than what we have in the current statement.	23.0	91.0
201609	2173	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	When we raise rates to the ½ to ¾ percent range, it will be important for the Committee to state explicit conditions governing further increases.	23.0	91.0
201609	2174	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	The statement needs to assure the public that this Committee is seeking economic and financial conditions to support inflation attaining our 2 percent PCE inflation objective sustainably, symmetrically, and sooner rather than later.	23.0	91.0
201609	2175	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I would prefer an explicit marker that core PCE inflation should be very close to 2 percent before we move rates again.	23.0	91.0
201609	2176	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Of course, other indicators could signal this, too.	23.0	91.0
201609	2177	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Another useful explicit marker would be continued reductions in unemployment, which presumably would help foster tighter labor and resource conditions to boost inflation.	23.0	91.0
201609	2178	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	And a third condition would be increases in measures of inflation expectations in line with the Board’s inflation attractor moving up to 2 percent from below where it’s been stuck for quite some time.	23.0	91.0
201609	2179	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	At the time of our next policy move, I would strongly support incorporating some configuration of these conditions, along with continued good economic fundamentals, as markers for guiding further continuation of the—I said “normalization process.”	23.0	91.0
201609	2180	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I agree with President Bullard that I’m not sure what the right term is.	23.0	91.0
201609	2181	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	By the way, I sincerely hope I soon will be embarrassed by my current inflation pessimism.	23.0	91.0
201609	2182	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	It would be fantastic if I am mistaken about the difficulty we face in getting inflation to target.	23.0	91.0
201609	2183	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I hope I’m wrong.	23.0	91.0
201609	2184	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	I think this language I discussed is robust to this possibility.	23.0	91.0
201609	2185	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	If I’m wrong about inflation, then these inflation, unemployment, and expectations markers will be met sooner rather than later, and we will appropriately be on a speedier path to increasing rates than I now envision.	23.0	91.0
201609	2186	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	That would be a very good thing.	23.0	91.0
201609	2187	2016-09-21	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201609	2188	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	2189	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23.0	65.0
201609	2190	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201609	2191	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Well, once again, I found Tealbook B’s “The Case for Alternative B” very useful in developing the argument for waiting for more evidence before deciding to raise the federal funds rate 25 basis points.	23.0	108.0
201609	2192	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	However, I see the case for going now as almost as strong as that for waiting.	23.0	108.0
201609	2193	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Or, in the words of Tealbook B, page 35, I “judge that not much additional evidence would be needed to warrant a rate hike,” and I therefore accept the Tealbook’s request that I so indicate in my statement.	23.0	108.0
201609	2194	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Tealbook B’s outline of the current economic conditions and outlook points to the staff’s real GDP forecast for the second half of the year of about 2.6 percent growth and to the fact that they see the near-term risks to the US economic outlook as roughly balanced.	23.0	108.0
201609	2195	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	They note, however, that headline inflation is likely to run below the 2 percent target.	23.0	108.0
201609	2196	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	That is to say, the staff and the draft statement of alternative B are in close agreement on the state of the economy, both the present state and expectations of future states.	23.0	108.0
201609	2197	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	The staff’s presentation is valuable, but I’d like to highlight a few points they make with which I do not fully agree.	23.0	108.0
201609	2198	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	First, their presentation refers to the solid average gain in payroll employment over recent months as indicating that there have been increases in labor utilization.	23.0	108.0
201609	2199	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	But they then go on to argue that because the unemployment rate has, on net, remained constant at 4.9 percent since the beginning of the year, there has been little increase in labor utilization.	23.0	108.0
201609	2200	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	I do not understand this argument, which does not even mention the increase in the labor force participation rate that has taken place over the past year.	23.0	108.0
201609	2201	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	And, accordingly, I judge that labor utilization should also be regarded as a positive factor in assessing the current state of the labor market.	23.0	108.0
201609	2202	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	In the policy strategy discussion of the case for alternative B, the staff starts by considering the possibility that policymakers “may judge it prudent to wait for more evidence that domestic demand will continue to grow at a moderate pace and that the labor market will strengthen somewhat further” before raising the interest rate.	23.0	108.0
201609	2203	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	They then give three arguments for this possibility.	23.0	108.0
201609	2204	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	First, while job gains have rebounded since May, the unemployment rate and other indicators have changed little since the beginning of the year.	23.0	108.0
201609	2205	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	A further wait “could allow the Committee to better assess underlying trends in employment, productivity, and inflation.”	23.0	108.0
201609	2206	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Second, policymakers may be leaning toward raising the interest rate, but a number of factors— among them, slow output growth, little change in labor utilization, and low wage and price inflation since the start of the year—may have reduced FOMC voters’ confidence in the view that current policy provides considerable accommodation.	23.0	108.0
201609	2207	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	So a wait-and-see posture might seem appropriate.	23.0	108.0
201609	2208	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Well, these two arguments have been deployed in the past to explain why we have elected not to move on occasions in which the economic gestalt was similar to that of today.	23.0	108.0
201609	2209	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	They are valid, and they are likely to remain valid.	23.0	108.0
201609	2210	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	But they are doubts that, before making a decision to take action, any serious decisionmaker has to examine and take into account and decide that they’re not sufficiently important to prevent action.	23.0	108.0
201609	2211	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	The third argument the staff makes for being hesitant to move is that the nominal interest rate is close to the effective lower bound, which limits the ability of monetary policy to respond to negative shocks.	23.0	108.0
201609	2212	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	My second doubt about the staff’s view is, this seems to me to be a reason, when a decision is close, to move—to build up a policy reserve to deal with future negative shocks.	23.0	108.0
201609	2213	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	In saying that, I should add that I believe the global level of the nominal interest rate is set primarily by the United States, and that decisions by us would have affected the interest rates of other countries.	23.0	108.0
201609	2214	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	That is to say, I think that relative interest rates would likely not have been very different had we raised our rate on some previous occasions.	23.0	108.0
201609	2215	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	This subject, the effect of our policies on those of other countries, is one to which I believe we should give more attention at some point in the near future.	23.0	108.0
201609	2216	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	We have been taking the rest of the world into account as a Stackelberg follower and not as a leader, and we are the leaders in the global economy.	23.0	108.0
201609	2217	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	My third doubt is, the staff then points out that a decision to maintain the current target range would be in line with the expectations of financial market participants.	23.0	108.0
201609	2218	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	This is not convincing as a reason not to move, for it ignores the fact that the market’s expectations of what we are likely to do is heavily influenced by the speeches of the Chair and other members of the FOMC and by the wording of the statement.	23.0	108.0
201609	2219	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	That is to say that the expectations of market participants are, in most respects, a policy choice of the FOMC—which is to say that our communications could have prepared the markets and the public for either decision that we were going to make.	23.0	108.0
201609	2220	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Let me add a fourth point that is frequently made in favor of waiting—that we know how to deal with high inflation if it comes.	23.0	108.0
201609	2221	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	We do, but we also know that dealing with high inflation, if it comes, requires a “tough love” approach where, unfortunately, the toughness is typically more needed than the love.	23.0	108.0
201609	2222	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	And that is what we will face if we don’t move in time.	23.0	108.0
201609	2223	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	All in all, I do not think there’s a strong case for waiting, which means that I support alternative B and expect that if the economy continues on its current course, we should raise the federal funds rate at our December meeting.	23.0	108.0
201609	2224	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201609	2225	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	2226	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	23.0	65.0
201609	2227	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201609	2228	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	In the first half of the year, we’ve seen weakness outside the United States, particularly in China.	23.0	110.0
201609	2229	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Our GDP forecast is lower than at the start of the year, and we’ve been making frustratingly slow progress in meeting our inflation target.	23.0	110.0
201609	2230	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	For all of those reasons and others, I’ve agreed up to now with exercising patience before removing accommodation.	23.0	110.0
201609	2231	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I’ve also been influenced by analysis that showed that the neutral rate is lower than it had previously been thought.	23.0	110.0
201609	2232	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	And, I am a believer that the economy is not yet overheating.	23.0	110.0
201609	2233	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I also agree that there are persistent headwinds, particularly demographics and other global risks.	23.0	110.0
201609	2234	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	These issues need to be weighed, however, against the costs of accommodation, particularly the cost to savers as well as the market and business imbalances that are being created.	23.0	110.0
201609	2235	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m particularly and increasingly concerned about a growing trend toward use of what I will loosely call the carry trade—people going out on the risk curve, people leveraging up low- volatility assets to produce acceptable returns, and overallocation to risk assets by institutions and households.	23.0	110.0
201609	2236	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	As a result, time frames for risk assets are becoming shorter, and I think, as I mentioned yesterday, that is putting increasing pressure on corporate leaders to leverage up to buy back stock.	23.0	110.0
201609	2237	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I think all of these financial trends can be managed, but I think we’re at the point—if not now, then very soon—where they need to be tamped down because they will be increasingly painful to unwind.	23.0	110.0
201609	2238	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I’ve been in favor, as I said, of “slow and gradual,” but I don’t want “slow and gradual” to become a stall.	23.0	110.0
201609	2239	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	And I am concerned that if we don’t act today, there will be very valid reasons that will emerge for not acting in December.	23.0	110.0
201609	2240	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	On the basis of all of this—and the fact that, near the effective lower bound, there is unlikely to be a good time to raise rates—I would prefer that we raise the federal funds rate 25 basis points today and emphasize, using the SEP that’s coming out, that the path of rates is likely to be historically shallow, and that the terminal rate is likely to be lower than has been widely expected.	23.0	110.0
201609	2241	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I would emphasize that we intend to continue to be accommodative, and that future removals of accommodation will be done only in a gradual and patient manner.	23.0	110.0
201609	2242	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I am concerned about FOMC credibility in that—to my eye, at least—three- and six- month rolling job growth numbers are in the strike zone.	23.0	110.0
201609	2243	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	And the weaker ISM is a concern, but our own model suggests that the consumer is strong and will continue to be strong for the remainder of this year.	23.0	110.0
201609	2244	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Given that it appears we are not going to raise rates today, I would love to see us emphasize, as we’ve discussed, that the normalization process is very challenging, maybe more challenging than has been widely understood, due to these persistent headwinds, particularly aging demographics and the effects of globalization.	23.0	110.0
201609	2245	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	I would emphasize that we do not have a predetermined timetable, we do not intend to be bound by calendar considerations, we will move when conditions warrant, and we need to see continual removal of labor slack and some greater evidence that inflation will return to our 2 percent target in the medium term.	23.0	110.0
201609	2246	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	And I would continue to emphasize that our tools are asymmetrical at or near the lower bound.	23.0	110.0
201609	2247	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	That is, it is much easier to tighten than to ease.	23.0	110.0
201609	2248	2016-09-21	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201609	2249	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	2250	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23.0	65.0
201609	2251	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	103.0
201609	2252	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	I support alternative C.	23.0	103.0
201609	2253	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	With unemployment and inflation at or near their longer-run levels, removing some accommodation is warranted.	23.0	103.0
201609	2254	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	An increase in the funds rate is overdue, as I see it, and waiting for further evidence continues to unwisely discount future costs in order to reap perceived marginal benefits today.	23.0	103.0
201609	2255	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	As I reflected on yesterday’s discussion, it may indeed be the case that historical experience and relationships will not serve us well today, and that this time may be different.	23.0	103.0
201609	2256	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	I’m not persuaded that we should ignore the history, but, as others have suggested, I do think it’s essential that we talk about the risks associated with various policy options to understand the consequences.	23.0	103.0
201609	2257	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Understanding the risk of overshooting full employment seems particularly important over the next year, especially if we continue a wait-and-see approach along the lines of alternative B.	23.0	103.0
201609	2258	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Instead, if the majority of the Committee is truly convinced that r* is likely to stay extremely low for an extended time, alternative A may, in fact, be a more honest representation of the Committee’s intentions.	23.0	103.0
201609	2259	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	We hurt our credibility by repeatedly projecting multiple rate increases in the SEP, only to stand pat in the face of tightening labor markets and inflation moving toward 2 percent.	23.0	103.0
201609	2260	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, alternatives B and C have nearly identical descriptions of current conditions and the outlook, while one calls for acting at this meeting and the other signals a move is on the horizon.	23.0	103.0
201609	2261	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	This feels to me like a classic central bank trap of needing to move but not just yet in order to see a bit more information.	23.0	103.0
201609	2262	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	The divergence between the current setting of the funds rate and prescriptions from simple policy rules also suggests that the Committee’s policy choices lean too much in the direction of discretion, even after accounting for the downward revision in the longer-term equilibrium real rate.	23.0	103.0
201609	2263	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Since June 2014, the Board staff has marked down its assumptions regarding r* and longer-run growth.	23.0	103.0
201609	2264	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	The projections in the SEP have followed, and I, too, have marked down my assessment of r*.	23.0	103.0
201609	2265	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	But if there is substantial uncertainty about the trend rate of growth or the value of r*, surely the Committee would be well served to ground its judgments with some kind of analytical instrumentation.	23.0	103.0
201609	2266	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	For example, my understanding of first-difference rules suggests that their use might fit well during such a time of uncertainty.	23.0	103.0
201609	2267	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Here, too, according to the Tealbook, the Board’s version of a first-difference rule has been prescribing a move since March of this year.	23.0	103.0
201609	2268	2016-09-21	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	103.0
201609	2269	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	2270	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23.0	65.0
201609	2271	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201609	2272	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	I will support alternative B.	23.0	104.0
201609	2273	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	This year, financial turmoil, weaker incoming data, and a reassessment of the neutral rate of interest have pointed financial markets and the Committee toward a more gradual path of rate increases.	23.0	104.0
201609	2274	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	That path can and will be adjusted, either up or down, as events evolve.	23.0	104.0
201609	2275	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	I believe that the Committee’s patience through this period has paid dividends and will continue to do so.	23.0	104.0
201609	2276	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Nonetheless, the labor market has continued to tighten, and the forecast is for output to strengthen and inflation to continue on its path of gradual increases.	23.0	104.0
201609	2277	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	If that forecast is broadly realized, then I believe that it will be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate soon.	23.0	104.0
201609	2278	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	I’ve written down one rate increase for this year and two for next year.	23.0	104.0
201609	2279	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	It is possible, as several here have pointed out, to wait too long to move.	23.0	104.0
201609	2280	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	This would put the Committee “behind the curve” and require more aggressive action, possibly risking a recession.	23.0	104.0
201609	2281	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	That risk increases as the unemployment rate continues to move down and labor markets show increased signs of tightening.	23.0	104.0
201609	2282	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	For me, the time for the overshooting argument is coming but is probably not yet here for a couple of reasons.	23.0	104.0
201609	2283	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	The apparent upside surprise in labor force participation suggests that we have more room to grow.	23.0	104.0
201609	2284	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	In fact, looking back this morning, labor force participation has now really been flat, in the high 62s, since late 2013, which represents a pretty significant three-year gain against our estimate of the underlying downward trend.	23.0	104.0
201609	2285	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	It does suggest that we may actually be using up a margin of slack, but it also suggests, yes, grounds for humility that, in fact, there may be more room to go.	23.0	104.0
201609	2286	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	The economy is growing just barely above trend.	23.0	104.0
201609	2287	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Inflation is below our 2 percent objective and has been every single month since the second quarter of 2012.	23.0	104.0
201609	2288	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	We’re making progress toward 2 percent inflation, and my baseline case that we can continue to do that.	23.0	104.0
201609	2289	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	But let’s face it—it’s happening at a snail’s pace.	23.0	104.0
201609	2290	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	So, for me, the balance of risks continues to call for patience and a gradual path of rate increases, assuming the forecast is realized.	23.0	104.0
201609	2291	2016-09-21	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201609	2292	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	2293	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	23.0	65.0
201609	2294	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	111.0
201609	2295	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	I am comfortable with alternative B, but I lean toward alternative A.	23.0	111.0
201609	2296	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	I prefer alternative A because I would like to see evidence of rising inflationary pressure before tightening.	23.0	111.0
201609	2297	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	In particular, I’m looking for either a sustained upward move in core PCE inflation or evidence of rising inflation expectations or a substantial decline in the headline unemployment rate.	23.0	111.0
201609	2298	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	The discussion we had yesterday about workers coming off the sidelines—it’s not moving the headline unemployment rate.	23.0	111.0
201609	2299	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	The truth is that we don’t know how much slack is left.	23.0	111.0
201609	2300	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	It seems to me that there is still some more slack.	23.0	111.0
201609	2301	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	I’d like to find out how much more there is.	23.0	111.0
201609	2302	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Actually, I found President Evans’s comments very consistent with my own views.	23.0	111.0
201609	2303	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	When I saw the Tealbook and its staff forecast of core PCE inflation of 1.6 percent for the rest of this year and for all of next year, I asked myself, “If that’s right, what would it take to get me to want to move?”	23.0	111.0
201609	2304	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	I’d want to see inflation expectations climb, or I’d want to see the headline unemployment rate fall meaningfully, such that I had confidence that slack had actually been taken up.	23.0	111.0
201609	2305	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Absent that, I’m starting to get persuaded by my neighbors here, President Bullard and President Evans, that I don’t see a strong case for raising rates.	23.0	111.0
201609	2306	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Alternative A lays down a marker that we want to see meaningful progress toward our inflation target, and I think that that would be helpful.	23.0	111.0
201609	2307	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Alternative B isn’t terrible, but I’m a little nervous about the language, because I do think it signals to the market that a rate hike is coming.	23.0	111.0
201609	2308	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	It may not come, and I think we all agree that every time we put out a marker that it’s about to come and then we don’t deliver, there’s a cost to us in terms of our credibility.	23.0	111.0
201609	2309	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	So I’m nervous about alternative B being too strong in signaling a December rate increase.	23.0	111.0
201609	2310	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Now, some say that we need to get going to raise rates so that we don’t fall “behind the curve.”	23.0	111.0
201609	2311	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	I think each of us reads these optimal control simulations and takes what we want out of them, because I look at them and, even in the most accommodative scenarios, the overshoot is 2.2 percent inflation.	23.0	111.0
201609	2312	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	So if these things are valuable at all, I don’t see where the concern is.	23.0	111.0
201609	2313	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	If the worst-case scenario is 2.2 percent inflation, that’s less of an overshoot than we’re undershooting right now.	23.0	111.0
201609	2314	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Then there’s been discussion that, well, it’s better that we gradually raise rates because a shallow path and then steep at the end is somehow more recessionary.	23.0	111.0
201609	2315	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	My staff found a Board memo of 2014, a background memo on potential implications of alternative approaches to the timing and pace of tightening.	23.0	111.0
201609	2316	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	This memo by Board staff suggests that it’s entirely unclear that a late and steep path of tightening is somehow more recessionary than a gradual path.	23.0	111.0
201609	2317	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	So I don’t find those arguments persuasive.	23.0	111.0
201609	2318	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	I’m not saying one is right and one is wrong, but it doesn’t appear to be clear that one is better than the other.	23.0	111.0
201609	2319	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	In view of where economic growth is—it’s pretty slow—and that inflation is definitely below target, I think we should be patient and allow the data to come to us before we are anticipating inflation that may not come.	23.0	111.0
201609	2320	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	The last thing I’ll say is, I know this makes me sound like I’m an uber-dove or a perma-dove.	23.0	111.0
201609	2321	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	I’m not.	23.0	111.0
201609	2322	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	When the data reveal themselves—when inflation actually materializes or expectations change—I will be advocating raising rates.	23.0	111.0
201609	2323	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	I just don’t see it yet.	23.0	111.0
201609	2324	2016-09-21	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	23.0	111.0
201609	2325	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	2326	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23.0	65.0
201609	2327	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201609	2328	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	I favor alternative B-plus or A-minus.	23.0	97.0
201609	2329	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	I’m not exactly sure which.	23.0	97.0
201609	2330	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And the reason is, I have some measure of uncomfortableness with a couple of the elements of alternative B as written.	23.0	97.0
201609	2331	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	First, the characterization of the risks as being roughly balanced doesn’t accord with my own understanding.	23.0	97.0
201609	2332	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	I think that shorter-term risks still are modestly to moderately on the downside.	23.0	97.0
201609	2333	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	While I don’t take too much signal on the basis of the retail sales numbers because, basically, that’s stuff from stores, a decreasingly important part of total consumption, the bouncing-around of housing permits and starts gives at least a little pause.	23.0	97.0
201609	2334	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And, like Vice Chairman Dudley, I do put a little bit more weight on, or at least have a little bit more concern with, the nonmanufacturing purchasing managers’ survey, particularly because it’s a forward-looking indicator in the much larger part of the economy that’s relatively insulated from the effect of the stronger dollar.	23.0	97.0
201609	2335	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	When coupled with the apparent softness in the total number of hours worked, as reported by the BLS, which was applicable in the service sector as well as the manufacturing sector, it indicates to me at least something to watch, but it’s a risk.	23.0	97.0
201609	2336	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	It’s not a reality—it’s just a risk.	23.0	97.0
201609	2337	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	But I think that the “roughly balanced” is getting a little bit ahead of ourselves.	23.0	97.0
201609	2338	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Second, I am also a little uncomfortable with the language in paragraph 3 of alternative B because, as many have commented, it does lean forward—perhaps not as far as some would like—to a December rate increase.	23.0	97.0
201609	2339	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And as Presidents Bullard and Lockhart and others have noted, in and of itself, that may raise some communication problems, but it may also raise some issues for us of, what is it that we’re expecting to see?	23.0	97.0
201609	2340	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	However, it may be the best language that could garner a consensus,in view of the rather divergent views of people here.	23.0	97.0
201609	2341	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	But I did want to indicate that I am a little bit uncomfortable with it.	23.0	97.0
201609	2342	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	I think, by the way, the problems that Presidents Bullard and Lockhart and others have referred to will only be exacerbated if everybody on this Committee runs out trying to influence market expectations about later increases, because then we’re going to get into another one of these wars of words, in which everybody goes out and gives their speeches and then sees how much the 10-year has moved to see whether they’ve given a good speech or not.	23.0	97.0
201609	2343	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And I don’t think that’s been particularly useful for the Committee as a whole.	23.0	97.0
201609	2344	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	I feel like we’re stuck in a bit of a collective action problem here, and I don’t know how to get out of it.	23.0	97.0
201609	2345	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	But maybe the communications subcommittee—no, I’m only kidding, Stan.	23.0	97.0
201609	2346	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Well, if you joined it, then—[Laughter]	23.0	108.0
201609	2347	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	No.	23.0	97.0
201609	2348	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	I was on it briefly.	23.0	97.0
201609	2349	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	For reasons I’ll explain in a moment, though, I’m not actually totally comfortable with alternative A, either.	23.0	97.0
201609	2350	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	I did want to say a couple of things about the discussion that’s gone back and forth, both in part of the go-round yesterday and today.	23.0	97.0
201609	2351	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	This is not exactly on the humility point, but we are in an environment in which there’s good reason to believe that the structure and dynamics of the US economy are really quite different from what they have been in the relatively recent past and through much of the postwar period.	23.0	97.0
201609	2352	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And what I think that indicates is the possibility that tools and even analytic frameworks, such as various correlations among economic variables, that were quite useful for some period of time in thinking about and setting monetary policy may have more limited utility in the current circumstances.	23.0	97.0
201609	2353	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	What, of course, goes along with that is the idea that historical precedent becomes rather less useful, because the precedent just abstracts a couple of things and pulls them out of the broader context in which various more important secular forces are affecting the structure and dynamics of the economy.	23.0	97.0
201609	2354	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	That first observation counsels more openness to the idea that things may be different and thus that you don’t take some things—whether it’s the Taylor rule or the traditional understanding of the Phillips curve or any number of other analytical frameworks—as your presumptive path.	23.0	97.0
201609	2355	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	From there—and, as I said, this is where humility comes in—we, as policymakers, don’t then want to jump to the conclusion of, “Ah, we now understand the way the dynamics and structure in this different economy are actually functioning, and thus we’re pretty confident about the way in which we will set policy.”	23.0	97.0
201609	2356	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	So that is why—and I think a number of people, even though they haven’t used the language, and other people around the table have taken a similar approach—it seemed to me that we have to develop at least operating presumptions that allow us to make policy decisions from meeting to meeting.	23.0	97.0
201609	2357	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	But we need to be more open than usual to the possibility that something different is going on than is reflected in that operating presumption.	23.0	97.0
201609	2358	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	So that’s what’s led me to what I’ve described as a pragmatic approach.	23.0	97.0
201609	2359	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Just to be clear—and this is where my difference with alternative A comes in—what I’ve been saying is, I would like to see more evidence that inflation would be moving toward the 2 percent target on a sustainable basis.	23.0	97.0
201609	2360	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	For me, that doesn’t necessarily translate into the inflation rate itself moving there, because I can imagine that there would be evidence of an underlying dynamic in certain parts of the economy that suggested pretty convincingly that, because of other things going on, inflation was going to rise.	23.0	97.0
201609	2361	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	So I think, again, one can be a little bit more open minded about what it is that would be evidence that would give reasonable certainty, to invoke a past phrase we used, that inflation will move back to target.	23.0	97.0
201609	2362	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	And the second thing, obviously, that’s been important to me is what we discussed yesterday, which is the comparative longer-term risk framework.	23.0	97.0
201609	2363	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	By the way, let me just say it explicitly today—boy, talk about a heterodox idea—it would be great to dispense with the economic go-round, as conventionally done, in November and just come in prepared to have a conversation about the set of issues that at least half a dozen or eight of us were discussing yesterday.	23.0	97.0
201609	2364	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	But I haven’t consulted with anybody beyond Presidents George and Rosengren on this, and they didn’t even endorse it.	23.0	97.0
201609	2365	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	They just said, “That’s interesting.”	23.0	97.0
201609	2366	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	23.0	97.0
201609	2367	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Let’s see.	23.0	97.0
201609	2368	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Finally—notwithstanding my reservations about some of the language in alternative B—obviously, when it comes to a vote today, I’ll vote for alternative B and do so with the understanding that either the evidence on inflation or my understanding of that comparative-risk framework may change between now and the next couple of meetings.	23.0	97.0
201609	2369	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	So, while I’m concerned about the degree of forward lean, I by no means foreclose the possibility that I will be there as well later in the year.	23.0	97.0
201609	2370	2016-09-21	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201609	2371	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	2372	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23.0	65.0
201609	2373	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201609	2374	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	I, too, want to express my appreciation for the very thoughtful arguments that are being made on both sides, and I’ll try to provide my take on some of these arguments.	23.0	107.0
201609	2375	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	First of all, I believe that our prudent risk-management approach has served us well this year, supporting continued gains in employment and progress on inflation while helping to navigate a number of risks.	23.0	107.0
201609	2376	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Several have noted that the economy is not far from the forecasts of the Committee a year ago.	23.0	107.0
201609	2377	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	I would simply point out that this has been achieved only with a very substantial reduction in both the actual and expected policy rate path and the corresponding adjustment in broader financial conditions.	23.0	107.0
201609	2378	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Even so, actual progress on inflation still remains tentative, and there’s uncertainty about how close the economy is to full employment.	23.0	107.0
201609	2379	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	To me, it seems, therefore, appropriate to continue a fairly cautious approach and wait to see confirmation of further progress on inflation and tightening of resource constraints before removing further accommodation.	23.0	107.0
201609	2380	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Of course, as many have noted, that policy stance contains risks.	23.0	107.0
201609	2381	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, if momentum in the economy is much stronger than the data now suggest and resource constraints start to bind more quickly than I currently anticipate, then inflation could rise more quickly than expected.	23.0	107.0
201609	2382	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	In such a contingency, we have tried-and-tested tools and ample policy space in which to react.	23.0	107.0
201609	2383	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, there are several features of today’s economy, today’s new normal, that might lead us to expect that the effects of such unexpected strength in demand on inflation, and on the economy more generally, will be somewhat more modest and require a somewhat more tempered policy response than in the handful of historical episodes that are frequently referenced.	23.0	107.0
201609	2384	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	First, due to the experience, in particular, of the past year, it reminds us that it is possible material resource slack still remains, and that full employment in the wake of the severe recession might look a bit different.	23.0	107.0
201609	2385	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Second, the recent elevated sensitivity of the exchange rate to policy surprises suggests that an appreciating currency would play an important role in absorbing any excess demand and restraining inflation.	23.0	107.0
201609	2386	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Third, because the neutral rate has been and likely will be persistently low, the distance back to a neutral stance is not as great.	23.0	107.0
201609	2387	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	And, finally, inflation expectations are well anchored to the upside.	23.0	107.0
201609	2388	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Together, these factors suggest that the response of inflation to unexpected strength in demand will likely be modest and gradual, requiring a correspondingly moderate policy response and implying relatively slight costs to the economy.	23.0	107.0
201609	2389	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	In the face of an adverse shock, however, our conventional policy toolkit is very limited, and thus the risk of being unable to respond adequately is greater.	23.0	107.0
201609	2390	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	The experience of the Japanese and euro-area economies should be sobering and suggests that prolonged weakness in demand is very difficult to correct, leading to economic costs that can be considerable.	23.0	107.0
201609	2391	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	In short, in what I think of as today’s new normal, the costs to the economy of greater-than-expected strength in demand are likely to be lower than the costs of significant unexpected weakness.	23.0	107.0
201609	2392	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	There’s another question that’s been raised that is important in this context that I wanted to address briefly address.	23.0	107.0
201609	2393	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Some are asking whether there really is a cost to signaling that the Committee is comfortable acquiescing in underlying inflation remaining in the 1.4 to 1.6 percent range, which it hasn’t meaningfully exceeded over the past several years.	23.0	107.0
201609	2394	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	In the “new normal,” in which the long-run neutral rate may well be 1¼ to 1½ percentage points below the canonical Taylor 2 percent, every ½ point reduction in our perceived inflation target reduces to an uncomfortably tight margin the conventional policy space we have in which to respond to a shock.	23.0	107.0
201609	2395	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	For that reason, I join others in thinking it’s extremely important that we defend the credibility of the target and make clear through our actions that there really is symmetry around 2 percent.	23.0	107.0
201609	2396	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	I agree that we would regret complacency on this front.	23.0	107.0
201609	2397	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	In short, the costs of entrenching a low-inflation, low-growth, low-expectations environment are considerable.	23.0	107.0
201609	2398	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	The asymmetry in risk management counsels prudence in the removal of policy accommodation.	23.0	107.0
201609	2399	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	I believe this approach has served us well and will continue to do so.	23.0	107.0
201609	2400	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	When we look at the language, I must say that I, too, have some concerns about locking ourselves in to moving before the end of the year.	23.0	107.0
201609	2401	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	That approach hasn’t worked so well for us previously.	23.0	107.0
201609	2402	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, I also recognize there’s a large diversity of views around the table, and I’m very comfortable supporting the Chair’s preferred formulation in alternative B.	23.0	107.0
201609	2403	2016-09-21	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	23.0	107.0
201609	2404	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201609	2405	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23.0	65.0
201609	2406	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	23.0	96.0
201609	2407	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B as written, although I do have some unease about how forward leaning it is in terms of December, because I think the market is going to take it as making December highly likely.	23.0	96.0
201609	2408	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I’ll talk about that at the end of my remarks.	23.0	96.0
201609	2409	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	But I can certainly support it as written.	23.0	96.0
201609	2410	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Although I agree that the case for tightening monetary policy has strengthened in recent months as financial conditions have eased, near-term Brexit risks have receded, and the pace of economic growth has picked up, I don’t find the case sufficiently compelling to move today for three reasons.	23.0	96.0
201609	2411	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this is very similar to what the Chair said in her earlier remarks.	23.0	96.0
201609	2412	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	First, the economy is just not growing that fast.	23.0	96.0
201609	2413	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The pressure on labor utilization is increasing very slowly, and discouraged workers are coming back into the workforce, augmenting the supply of labor.	23.0	96.0
201609	2414	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	With the unemployment rate broadly stable this year and wage gains still subdued, I don’t see a labor market that signals there’s urgency to tighten right now.	23.0	96.0
201609	2415	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	And I would really be hesitant to keep a bunch of people out of work on the presumption that somehow we’re already at the full-employment unemployment rate.	23.0	96.0
201609	2416	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that would be unconscionable.	23.0	96.0
201609	2417	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, inflation is still below our target and is projected in the Tealbook to be below our target for some time to come.	23.0	96.0
201609	2418	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Earlier in the year, we did see core PCE inflation increase a bit on a sequential basis, but it’s subsequently come back down.	23.0	96.0
201609	2419	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, before, that was just a forecast, but I think the fact that the forecast is now being realized is significant.	23.0	96.0
201609	2420	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The core PCE price index is moving sideways rather than upward on a year-over-year basis.	23.0	96.0
201609	2421	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that and the fact that inflation has been consistently below our 2 percent objective, and the potential consequences of that on inflation expectations, also argue for patience.	23.0	96.0
201609	2422	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Third, monetary policy is not very accommodative.	23.0	96.0
201609	2423	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this is a pretty widely held view in this room.	23.0	96.0
201609	2424	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The gap between where we are and where we judge the neutral short-term rate, the so-called r*, to be has narrowed.	23.0	96.0
201609	2425	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I would judge that a neutral monetary policy regime currently is likely no more than 100 to 150 basis points above where we are now.	23.0	96.0
201609	2426	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So that gap could be closed quite quickly if we needed to do so.	23.0	96.0
201609	2427	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	If the gap was larger, then I think the economy would presumably be growing faster and there would be more work to do to move policy back toward neutral.	23.0	96.0
201609	2428	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So if that was the case, that would push you on the side of moving more quickly, but I don’t think that’s where we are right now.	23.0	96.0
201609	2429	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, if we mostly agree that there’s going to be only one move this year and the debate is really between today versus December, I ask the obvious question:  Why not wait to see whether a more favorable GDP growth trend actually emerges before moving?	23.0	96.0
201609	2430	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	At the end of October, we’ll get the GDP data for the third quarter, and I think that’ll be something that you can hang your hat on in terms of why you’re tightening monetary policy subsequently.	23.0	96.0
201609	2431	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	With inflation below our objective, I will feel less bad if it turns out a hike was justified today on the basis of subsequent data and we move a few months later, compared with a situation in which the economy disappoints, suggesting that we really shouldn’t have moved at today’s meeting.	23.0	96.0
201609	2432	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	For the SEP, I’ve got one further 25 basis point rate hike for 2016, two for ’17, and three for ’18, and that takes the federal funds rate up to 1¾ to 2 percent at the end of 2018.	23.0	96.0
201609	2433	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I’ve also reduced my longer-run federal funds rate projection to 2½ percent from 3 percent.	23.0	96.0
201609	2434	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think r* is depressed relative to its historical norm of 2 percent and will remain sodue to slower productivity growth, an aging population, and the persistence of a global savings glut.	23.0	96.0
201609	2435	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, I’ve become more skeptical of the story we’ve been telling for some time, that the headwinds following the financial crisis are likely to dissipate relatively soon.	23.0	96.0
201609	2436	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So that also feeds into my reassessment of what the long-term federal funds rate is likely to be.	23.0	96.0
201609	2437	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, in terms of language, I think we should have no illusions.	23.0	96.0
201609	2438	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The market is going to react to what we put out today as making December highly likely.	23.0	96.0
201609	2439	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there are several aspects of that that are going to push in that direction.	23.0	96.0
201609	2440	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	First, I view the statement language as stronger than what the market generally expects.	23.0	96.0
201609	2441	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	If you look at the surveys of the primary dealers and the buy side, most of them didn’t really see a lot of changes as likely occurring in the statement.	23.0	96.0
201609	2442	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	There are two changes that I think are going to be important.	23.0	96.0
201609	2443	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	One is the movement of risks to “roughly balanced.”	23.0	96.0
201609	2444	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I think people who thought that might change were more likely to think “nearly balanced,” but “roughly,”	23.0	96.0
201609	2445	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess, is closer to neutral than “nearly”—by a little bit.	23.0	96.0
201609	2446	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The second thing is, this language that the case has strengthened—I don’t think that will surprise people.	23.0	96.0
201609	2447	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	But the phrase “for the time being,” putting in the time component there, will, I think, push in the same direction.	23.0	96.0
201609	2448	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The SEP, I think, is also going to do the work in the same direction.	23.0	96.0
201609	2449	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	All but three of us have one or two rate hikes in 2016, so it’ll be the strong sense of the Committee that the Committee expects a rate hike this year.	23.0	96.0
201609	2450	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	And the fact that we’re going to have three dissents on the side of tightening at this meeting—three dissents is a relatively large number of dissents.	23.0	96.0
201609	2451	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	That’ll also push in the same direction.	23.0	96.0
201609	2452	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So I don’t think we should be surprised if the probability for December goes up.	23.0	96.0
201609	2453	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think that’s a big problem if the data cooperate.	23.0	96.0
201609	2454	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	But if the data don’t cooperate, then that’s going to be a problem, because it’s going to be another case of raising the probability and subsequently shrinking back from that.	23.0	96.0
201609	2455	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So I hope the data will cooperate this time.	23.0	96.0
201609	2456	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201609	2457	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	24.0	65.0
201609	2458	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’ve had a really great discussion of the issues and done an excellent job of identifying the key risks that we face on both sides as we try to decide the appropriate path of policy.	24.0	65.0
201609	2459	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	And I will work with the staff—before our next meeting, I hope—to see if there’s some further work we can do to try to analyze the various risks that have been identified here.	24.0	65.0
201609	2460	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	For today, while I recognize that there’s discomfort of all sorts in both directions with alternative B, my proposal is to vote on alternative B as written.	24.0	65.0
201609	2461	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Brian.	24.0	65.0
201609	2462	2016-09-21	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	24.0	999.0
201609	2463	2016-09-21	meeting	MADIGAN	This vote will be on the policy statement for alternative B as included on pages 5 and 6 of Thomas Laubach’s briefing materials and on the directive to the Desk as included in the implementation note on page 9 of those materials.	24.0	999.0
201609	2464	2016-09-21	meeting	MADIGAN	Chair Yellen Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Brainard Yes President Bullard Yes Governor Fischer Yes President George No President Mester No Governor Powell Yes President Rosengren No Governor Tarullo Yes .	24.0	999.0
201609	2465	2016-09-21	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you.	24.0	999.0
201609	2466	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	53.0	65.0
201609	2467	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s see.	53.0	65.0
201609	2468	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	To wrap up, let me just say our next meeting is Tuesday and Wednesday, November 1 and 2.	53.0	65.0
201609	2469	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	There are boxed lunches that should be available now in the anteroom, and there will, as usual, be a TV set up in the Special Library for anybody who wants to stay—	53.0	65.0
201609	2470	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	For the extra entertainment.	53.0	96.0
201609	2471	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	53.0	96.0
201609	2472	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, the live murder board.	53.0	65.0
201609	2473	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	I will do my best to present a balanced presentation.	53.0	65.0
201609	2474	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	Madam Chair, may I raise an issue?	53.0	108.0
201609	2475	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	53.0	65.0
201609	2476	2016-09-21	meeting	FISCHER	For those who are going to be here four years from now, is it essential to set the meeting just before the election?	53.0	108.0
201609	2477	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	You mean maybe moving it up a week?	53.0	96.0
201609	2478	2016-09-21	meeting	MADIGAN	We look at a lot of events and constraints in constructing the calendar.	53.0	999.0
201609	2479	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	The BIS, I think, is a constraint there, because the BIS meeting typically is going to be right in front of the election.	53.0	96.0
201609	2480	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think the BIS is a constraint there, Stan.	53.0	96.0
201609	2481	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	It does demonstrate our nonchalance.	53.0	81.0
201609	2482	2016-09-21	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	53.0	81.0
201609	2483	2016-09-21	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think it’s a big deal, myself.	53.0	96.0
201609	2484	2016-09-21	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	53.0	65.0
201611	0	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	50.0	65.0
201611	1	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	As usual, this meeting will be a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board of Governors.	50.0	65.0
201611	2	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I need a motion to close the Board meeting.	50.0	65.0
201611	3	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	50.0	108.0
201611	4	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	50.0	65.0
201611	5	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	50.0	65.0
201611	6	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And, as many of you know, Nellie Liang and Mike Leahy have announced that they will be retiring, and this will be their last FOMC meeting.	50.0	65.0
201611	7	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Nellie began her career at the Board in 1986 when she joined the Division of Research and Statistics as an economist, and she worked on a variety of financial issues over the course of her career.	50.0	65.0
201611	8	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Nellie was a key participant in crafting the Federal Reserve’s response to the financial crisis.	50.0	65.0
201611	9	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	She helped lead a number of crisis-era programs, including the 2009 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, or bank stress tests, which played an important role in increasing public confidence in the banking system and set the template for our ongoing CCAR program.	50.0	65.0
201611	10	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	In 2010, she was appointed founding director of the newly created Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research, which went so well that it is now the Division of Financial Stability.	50.0	65.0
201611	11	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	As director, she led the effort to establish our new financial stability monitoring and policy framework.	50.0	65.0
201611	12	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Nellie started attending FOMC meetings in 2005 and has attended a total of 53 meetings.	50.0	65.0
201611	13	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Mike first joined the Board as a research assistant in the Division of International Finance on a break from his PhD work.	50.0	65.0
201611	14	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	After returning to graduate school and completing his studies, he rejoined IF and then rose steadily through the ranks, becoming deputy director in 2012.	50.0	65.0
201611	15	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Along the way, Mike made innumerable contributions to the work of the division, the Board, and the FOMC as one of our leading experts on exchange rates and monetary policy.	50.0	65.0
201611	16	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Including today’s meeting, Mike has attended 55 FOMC meetings since his first meeting in 2004.	50.0	65.0
201611	17	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Nellie and Mike, we are all truly grateful for everything that you have done for the Federal Reserve, and we wish you the best in your well-deserved retirements.	50.0	65.0
201611	18	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	[Applause]	50.0	65.0
201611	19	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Before turning to the first agenda item, I would like to recognize Governor Fischer as chairman of the communications subcommittee.	95.0	65.0
201611	20	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	108.0
201611	21	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I would like to provide some advance notice on changes to the policy on external communications that the subcommittee on communications will be proposing when we conduct our annual review of FOMC organizational documents in January.	95.0	108.0
201611	22	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	In particular, we would like to align the start of the blackout period more closely with the start of our serious discussion of the monetary policy alternatives.	95.0	108.0
201611	23	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Under our current practice, Committee participants receive the first draft of the alternative policy statements on the Friday 11 days before the beginning of the FOMC meeting.	95.0	108.0
201611	24	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	That is assuming the usual Tuesday–Wednesday meeting schedule.	95.0	108.0
201611	25	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	But our blackout period on external communications commences at midnight eastern time 7 days before the beginning of the meeting.	95.0	108.0
201611	26	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The circulation of the draft policy statements marks the start of our deliberative process for the coming FOMC decision, a process that the blackout period is intended to foster and to protect.	95.0	108.0
201611	27	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	That means that we currently face a gap between the time our deliberations begin and the start of the blackout period.	95.0	108.0
201611	28	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And we are investigating ways to close this gap.	95.0	108.0
201611	29	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	In the meantime, I urge all of us to be very careful in our public communications—which I’m sure we all are most of the time—particularly during the time period in question.	95.0	108.0
201611	30	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	In addition to this modification, in January we will also be suggesting some clarifications of the blackout policy, particularly as it relates to the staff and their possible participation in conferences and during the blackout period.	95.0	108.0
201611	31	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The subcommittee will circulate a memo describing all proposed changes sometime before the December meeting.	95.0	108.0
201611	32	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	95.0	108.0
201611	33	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Any questions or comments for Governor Fischer?	95.0	65.0
201611	34	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	95.0	65.0
201611	35	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Then let’s turn to the first item on our agenda, which is “Long-Run Framework for Monetary Policy Implementation.”	93.0	65.0
201611	36	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Troy Davig is going to start off our presentations.	93.0	65.0
201611	37	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	Thank you Madam Chair.	93.0	999.0
201611	38	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	We will be referring to the materials titled “Material for Briefing on Long-Run Monetary Policy Implementation Framework.”	93.0	999.0
201611	39	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	The briefings today summarize the work of the latest phase of the long- run framework project.	93.0	999.0
201611	40	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	As you are aware, this has been a Systemwide project featuring contributions from the Board and all Reserve Banks.	93.0	999.0
201611	41	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	In addition to the presenters at the table, there were several additional coauthors on the main memos, including Ron Feldman, who is also present and available to answer questions.	93.0	999.0
201611	42	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	Following on the foundational work presented at the July meeting, which covered money markets, foreign experiences, and lessons from the crisis, this phase of the project focused on issues related to possible policy rate targets and operating regimes as well as considerations regarding the balance sheet.	93.0	999.0
201611	43	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	In general, the combination of these elements comprises the key aspects of an operating “framework.”	93.0	999.0
201611	44	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	The scope of this project was outlined now over one year ago, with three broad objectives listed on page 3 of your briefing packet.	93.0	999.0
201611	45	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	The first project objective was that any framework needs to achieve an appropriate degree of short-term interest rate control, including in periods of financial distress and in a manner robust to structural changes in the financial system.	93.0	999.0
201611	46	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	As the briefings by Jane Ihrig and Antoine Martin will highlight, this objective can be achieved using different policy rates and with a range of operating frameworks, which could vary in the use of ceiling and floor facilities, the level of reserves, and the breadth of counterparties.	93.0	999.0
201611	47	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	The second objective was that a framework should enhance the ability to achieve macroeconomic and financial-stability objectives at the effective lower bound.	93.0	999.0
201611	48	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	Here the work reveals that the ability to effectively respond to the effective lower bound does not create sharp distinctions across operating regimes, though some operating regimes would require adjustments at the lower bound.	93.0	999.0
201611	49	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	In addition, maintaining operational readiness is important, particularly if the Committee intends to possibly use asset purchases or other tools that are not used routinely as part of the day-to-day operational framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	50	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	In terms of balance sheet policy, Deborah Leonard and David López-Salido will discuss how the balance sheet can be used to support interest rate control as well as macroeconomic goals and financial stability.	93.0	999.0
201611	51	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	The third objective was that a framework should support the System’s ability to address liquidity strains in money markets and support overall financial stability.	93.0	999.0
201611	52	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	Regarding liquidity strains, the work suggests there may be advantages to having separate lending facilities for different types of liquidity provision as well as a broad set of counterparties.	93.0	999.0
201611	53	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	Tradeoffs often exist when decisions about one aspect of the framework can have implications for others, though there are exceptions.	93.0	999.0
201611	54	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	For example, the briefings will discuss arrangements that allow for some separation between decisions about the balance sheet and the policy rate, such as in the current framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	55	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	Decisions about various aspects of a framework, of course, can also have important implications from a political economy perspective.	93.0	999.0
201611	56	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	In addition to the three project objectives I just discussed, there was a set of additional objectives listed on the top of page 4 of your packet that are addressed in today’s briefings.	93.0	999.0
201611	57	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	Finally, the Committee’s normalization principles and plans provided an additional set of criteria, also listed on page 4.	93.0	999.0
201611	58	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	In general, the issues discussed in the memos do not necessarily call for any near-term decisions about a long-run framework or for a need to make decisions about changes to the existing framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	59	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	Looking ahead, today’s discussion will help inform any additional staff work or dimension of the project that warrants further analysis.	93.0	999.0
201611	60	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	Thank you.	93.0	999.0
201611	61	2016-11-02	meeting	DAVIG	With that, I will now turn the briefing over to Jane.	93.0	999.0
201611	62	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Thanks, Troy.	93.0	999.0
201611	63	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	As noted on slide 6, the memo titled “Interest Rate Targets and Operating Regimes” analyzes several interest rates that you may wish to consider using as a policy rate and analyzes operating regimes designed to promote money market conditions consistent with the target policy rate.	93.0	999.0
201611	64	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Antoine and I would like to thank Ron Feldman—our co-lead—and many staff from around the System who helped develop the ideas we are about to discuss.	93.0	999.0
201611	65	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	The memo’s goal is to illustrate tradeoffs across a variety of policy implementation frameworks with respect to a few considerations, including the objectives Troy just outlined, to help the Committee begin evaluating features that it may want in a long-run framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	66	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	To start, on slide 7 we review some choices of policy rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	67	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	The policy rate serves the function of communicating the stance of policy as well as supporting transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.	93.0	999.0
201611	68	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	The memo considers several overnight rates that can be grouped into money market rates and administered rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	69	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	In terms of an unsecured rate, the Committee could continue with the federal funds rate as the policy rate or move to the overnight bank funding rate, or OBFR, which the Federal Reserve began to publish in March.	93.0	999.0
201611	70	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	A secured rate could be a general collateral Treasury repo rate, and the administered rates could be interest on reserves, such as excess or required, or an overnight reverse repurchase offering rate, an ON RRP rate.	93.0	999.0
201611	71	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	The choice of the policy rate is an important factor affecting the selection of operating tools and the counterparties with which the Federal Reserve interacts to achieve interest rate control.	93.0	999.0
201611	72	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	This point can be seen by looking at the three illustrative frameworks presented in the memo.	93.0	999.0
201611	73	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Your next slide summarizes case 1, in which the policy rate can be an unsecured market rate or the interest rate on excess reserves, and a key feature of the operating regime is that the Federal Reserve operates on the flat portion of the reserve demand curve.	93.0	999.0
201611	74	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	This case encompasses the current framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	75	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	In this regime, floor tools, such as interest on excess reserves and the overnight RRP facility, are the main mechanism through which the framework influences the level of market interest rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	76	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Ceiling tools could be useful to contain rate volatility, should it emerge, although a high level of excess reserves would put downward pressure on market rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	77	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Reserve requirements and fine-tuning open market operations would be unnecessary in this framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	78	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	A question, though, is: What is the appropriate level of reserves?	93.0	999.0
201611	79	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Policymakers would need to evaluate tradeoffs with relatively large and small balance sheets with respect to issues such as financial stability and macroeconomic objectives that Debby and David will soon discuss as well as payment system efficiencies and political economy risks.	93.0	999.0
201611	80	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Case 2, described on your next slide, has similarities to the pre-crisis system.	93.0	999.0
201611	81	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	The policy rate can be an unsecured market rate or the interest rate on required reserves.	93.0	999.0
201611	82	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	The Federal Reserve would operate on the steep portion of the reserve demand curve and actively manage the supply of reserves to control interest rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	83	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	A key tool in this type of framework is reserve requirements, either mandatory or voluntary, to establish a fairly stable and predictable downward-sloping reserve demand curve.	93.0	999.0
201611	84	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Discretionary open market operations would also play an important role in offsetting volatile autonomous factors affecting the supply of reserves.	93.0	999.0
201611	85	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Ceiling and floor tools can play important roles in this framework to limit the volatility of interest rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	86	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Indeed, operating on the steep portion of the reserve demand curve could lead to greater interest rate volatility than in the previous case.	93.0	999.0
201611	87	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Historically, the discount window was intended to limit upward spikes in the policy rate, and Antoine will discuss a possible variant of the discount window that could help establish a more effective ceiling.	93.0	999.0
201611	88	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	In terms of a floor, interest on excess reserves would be the primary tool in the framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	89	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	In times of stress, the Federal Reserve could use sterilization tools to remain in this regime or use interest on excess reserves, or possibly an overnight RRP facility if the tool was in the regime, to transition to a floor system.	93.0	999.0
201611	90	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Case 3, which is noted on slide 10, focuses on the repo market.	93.0	999.0
201611	91	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	The policy rate in this case could be a measure of the general collateral Treasury repo rate or the overnight RRP offering rate.	93.0	999.0
201611	92	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	The operating regime would focus on the supply and demand conditions in the repo market.	93.0	999.0
201611	93	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	As discussed in some of the staff memos, the quantity of reserves and the setting of interest on excess reserves would remain important factors influencing repo market conditions.	93.0	999.0
201611	94	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	In this framework, an overnight repurchase facility may be desirable to limit unwanted upward spikes in money market rates, and an overnight reverse repurchase facility would be desirable in order to limit downward spikes in repo rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	95	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	The number and type of counterparties as well as the cap and offering rate settings on an overnight RP and overnight RRP facility would affect the interest rate control.	93.0	999.0
201611	96	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	If the objective was to maintain the policy rate within a reasonable broad range, the framework could function very much like the current one, but if, instead, you wanted to target a much narrower range, or a point target, then fine-tuning open market operations might be desirable.	93.0	999.0
201611	97	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	It would be important to consider how the use of standing and discretionary open market operations affect the level of reserve balances, which influence the effect of unsecured rate volatility.	93.0	999.0
201611	98	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Policymakers may prefer to operate with abundant reserves in this regime for this reason, and, in this situation, reserve requirements and discretionary open market operations may not be necessary.	93.0	999.0
201611	99	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Your next three slides evaluate the three cases with respect to the long-run framework objectives.	93.0	999.0
201611	100	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	As mentioned by Troy, one key conclusion is that, in normal times, interest-rate control can be achieved in the case of a wide range of potential policy rates through the appropriate choice of operating regime tools, and the policy rates will likely also effectively transmit the stance of policy to broader financial conditions and the real economy.	93.0	999.0
201611	101	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Interest rate control would be maintained at the effective lower bound as well, although it might require some changes in operating regimes in some cases.	93.0	999.0
201611	102	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Turning to your next slide, the memo highlights a difference between the regimes with respect to how they mitigate liquidity strains.	93.0	999.0
201611	103	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Regimes that operate on the flat part of the demand curve for reserves, such as in case 1, can easily accommodate liquidity injections, as the increase in the level of reserves does not affect money market rates much.	93.0	999.0
201611	104	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	In contrast, when operating on a steep portion of the demand curve for reserves, as in case 2, interest rate control can be maintained by using reserve sterilization tools.	93.0	999.0
201611	105	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Alternatively, this framework could transition to case 1 by raising the level of interest on excess reserves.	93.0	999.0
201611	106	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	In a repo regime, you could rely on the overnight RRP facility and interest on excess reserves to support the policy rate.	93.0	999.0
201611	107	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Other long-run framework objectives are mentioned on the next slide.	93.0	999.0
201611	108	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	In all cases, burdens of mandatory reserve requirements could be reduced or eliminated.	93.0	999.0
201611	109	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Reserve requirements could be set to zero in case 1 and possibly case 3, while voluntary reserve targets could be considered in case 2.	93.0	999.0
201611	110	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	All regimes support active money markets, although only regimes that operate on the steep portion of the demand curve for reserves would support an active interbank market.	93.0	999.0
201611	111	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Finally, payment system efficiency is achieved in different ways across the regimes.	93.0	999.0
201611	112	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	In particular, frameworks featuring high levels of reserve balances facilitate early payment settlements, a state of affairs that delivers this objective directly.	93.0	999.0
201611	113	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	Meanwhile, regimes characterized by low levels of reserve balances would rely on the Board’s existing payment system risk policies to achieve payment efficiencies through the provision of free collateralized daylight credit.	93.0	999.0
201611	114	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	I will now turn the presentation to Antoine to summarize the key considerations across the cases.	93.0	999.0
201611	115	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Thanks, Jane.	93.0	999.0
201611	116	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Slide 14 provides a summary of some of the salient considerations associated with each of the three cases.	93.0	999.0
201611	117	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	The first two rows concern the policy rate.	93.0	999.0
201611	118	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	As noted in row 1, the choice of policy rate would be familiar in cases 1 and 2, particularly if the Committee chose to continue targeting the federal funds rate or move to the closely associated overnight bank funding rate.	93.0	999.0
201611	119	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	The interest rates paid on reserves, both required and excess, have been used in FOMC communication, so they are also familiar.	93.0	999.0
201611	120	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	In case 3, a market repo rate or the overnight RRP offering rate, which represent risk-free rates, would be less familiar to market participants and a more significant change.	93.0	999.0
201611	121	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Row 2 notes that case 1, using the federal funds rate as the policy rate, would not be robust to a significant reduction in federal funds lending by Federal Home Loan Banks.	93.0	999.0
201611	122	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Those concerns would be mitigated by the OBFR, particularly if that rate could be broadened to include onshore wholesale deposits.	93.0	999.0
201611	123	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	These concerns would be lessened in case 2, as an interbank market would likely reemerge.	93.0	999.0
201611	124	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	There are few robustness concerns associated with a repo rate.	93.0	999.0
201611	125	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	The next three rows concern properties of the operating regime.	93.0	999.0
201611	126	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	In row 3, case 1 would be particularly simple to operate in normal times, even if the Committee wanted to supply a smaller quantity of reserves than at present.	93.0	999.0
201611	127	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Case 2, while familiar from the pre-crisis experience, is more complicated.	93.0	999.0
201611	128	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Case 3 would be least familiar, although the experience of the last few years suggests that it could work like the current operating regime.	93.0	999.0
201611	129	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	As noted in row 4, since the level of reserves doesn’t affect interest rates much in case 1, injecting liquidity in times of market stress would not be an issue.	93.0	999.0
201611	130	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	In contrast, sterilization tools would be needed in case 2, or the regime would have to transition to case 1.	93.0	999.0
201611	131	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Liquidity provision may not be an issue in case 3 if this framework operated with the supply of reserves intersecting the flat part of the demand for reserves.	93.0	999.0
201611	132	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	For similar reasons, cases 1 and 3 could remain unchanged at the effective lower bound, as noted in row 5, whereas case 2 would likely have to transition to a framework like case 1 in instances of large-scale asset purchases.	93.0	999.0
201611	133	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Row 6 concerns reserve requirements.	93.0	999.0
201611	134	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	These requirements could be set to zero in case 1, as they would not play any role in a regime that operates on the flat portion of the reserve demand curve.	93.0	999.0
201611	135	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	To operate on the steep part, as in case 2, reserve requirements could be maintained, or you could consider voluntary reserve targets, which would reduce some of the costs associated with reserve requirements.	93.0	999.0
201611	136	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Reserve requirements could also be set to zero in case 3 if operating with abundant reserves.	93.0	999.0
201611	137	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Finally, row 7 discusses political economy risk.	93.0	999.0
201611	138	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Some risks are associated with having a relatively large balance sheet, as could happen in cases 1 and 3.	93.0	999.0
201611	139	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Case 2 likely represents the lowest amount of political economy risk, because it could be accompanied by a smaller balance sheet and money market rates would be above IOER.	93.0	999.0
201611	140	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Slide 15 discusses considerations for a ceiling tool that may be relevant for any of the cases Jane reviewed, with some focus on the discount window.	93.0	999.0
201611	141	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Historically, the discount window has been used for three purposes:  to help support interest-rate control, to provide liquidity to address broad-based market funding pressures, and to provide liquidity to individual firms facing idiosyncratic liquidity shocks.	93.0	999.0
201611	142	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Stigma— the reluctance of an institution to access a central bank’s standing lending facility out of concern that, if detected, it could be interpreted as a sign of financial weakness—is perhaps most closely related to the third role.	93.0	999.0
201611	143	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	But because use of the discount window does not distinguish the motivation, the presence of stigma for that one purpose likely prevents the discount window from performing all roles effectively.	93.0	999.0
201611	144	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Policymakers may want to consider options to reduce stigma.	93.0	999.0
201611	145	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	One approach, as Troy mentioned, is to establish separate facilities, one for each role, which may allow some tools to work more effectively.	93.0	999.0
201611	146	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	The memo provides two examples of facilities that may act as a more robust ceiling for interest rate control.	93.0	999.0
201611	147	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Policymakers could consider introducing a depository institution repo facility (DIRF) or a financial institution repo facility (FIRF).	93.0	999.0
201611	148	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	These facilities would be established under Section 14 authority for open market operations.	93.0	999.0
201611	149	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	More work could be done on considering the effectiveness of these facilities and other options could also be considered.	93.0	999.0
201611	150	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	These ceiling tools could be used alongside the discount window, which would only address individual liquidity needs, and a version of the term auction facility, or TAF, which could be considered for broad-based liquidity needs.	93.0	999.0
201611	151	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Slide 16 considers the degree to which these types of liquidity backstop might be incorporated into the framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	152	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	For example, the discount window and swap lines are “integrated” into the current operating regime—that is, they are continuously available as part of the monetary policy implementation framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	153	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	A potential drawback of integration is that integrated tools are more likely to lead to moral hazard compared with other approaches.	93.0	999.0
201611	154	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	The degree of integration could range from fully integrated tools to those that are less integrated and made available only under some preannounced conditions.	93.0	999.0
201611	155	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Or, tools could be left inactive, such as the TAF is now, with no specific preannounced conditions under which it would be used again.	93.0	999.0
201611	156	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Slide 17 discusses the breadth of the counterparty framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	157	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	In normal times, a narrow set of counterparties may reduce the risk of distorting markets but could be seen as providing privileges to a few institutions.	93.0	999.0
201611	158	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	A broader set of counterparties for liquidity provision tools could be viewed as more inclusive but might also increase the risk of moral hazard or of political scrutiny.	93.0	999.0
201611	159	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	However, in times of stress and perhaps in normal times, it might be advantageous to have broader reach in markets, for both OMO and liquidity facilities, to help with interest-rate control and transmission.	93.0	999.0
201611	160	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	These tradeoffs would need to be considered as the Committee moves forward with building a long-run framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	161	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	I will now turn the discussion over the David to begin the presentation of the balance sheet workgroup’s findings.	93.0	999.0
201611	162	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Thank you, Antoine.	93.0	999.0
201611	163	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Debby and I will now present findings made by the balance sheet workgroup, which we co-led with Fabio Natalucci.	93.0	999.0
201611	164	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	As noted on slide 19, we were tasked with exploring a range of issues that are relevant in determining the longer-run size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.	93.0	999.0
201611	165	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	I will start with a discussion of the roles that you might want the balance sheet to play in the long-run framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	166	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	These roles include interest rate control, achieving macroeconomic objectives, and supporting financial stability.	93.0	999.0
201611	167	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Debby will then discuss the implications that choices about the balance sheet objectives may have for the design of the System Open Market Account as well as the fiscal and political economic considerations related to use of the balance sheet as an active policy tool.	93.0	999.0
201611	168	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In slide 20, if effective interest rate control is the only role assigned to the balance sheet, its size would likely be determined primarily by currency in circulation, other autonomous factors, and the level of reserve balances associated with the central bank’s operating regime.	93.0	999.0
201611	169	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	As Jane and Antoine illustrated, interest-rate control can be achieved with either a small or a large balance sheet.	93.0	999.0
201611	170	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Just as the choice of the operating regime can influence the size of the balance sheet, decisions to use the balance sheet as an active policy tool to achieve macroeconomic goals or promote financial stability may also have implications for the operating regime.	93.0	999.0
201611	171	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	For instance, if policymakers wished to maintain elevated levels of reserves to foster financial stability, they would need to rely heavily on policy tools such as IOER, overnight RRP, or voluntary reserve targets to control interest rates effectively.	93.0	999.0
201611	172	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Slide 21 addresses the balance sheet’s use to support macroeconomic objectives.	93.0	999.0
201611	173	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	A large research literature has documented the point that, through a number of channels, large-scale purchases of longer-term assets can lower term premiums and long-term bond yields and boost prices of various other financial assets.	93.0	999.0
201611	174	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	These changes in financial conditions support stronger economic growth and higher inflation.	93.0	999.0
201611	175	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	The experience of central banks since the crisis suggests that asset purchases have appreciable macroeconomic benefits when the effective lower bound binds, especially in the event of stressed market conditions.	93.0	999.0
201611	176	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Economic theory would suggest using all available tools, especially in the presence of multiple goals.	93.0	999.0
201611	177	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	However, policymakers would have to coordinate the use of multiple policy tools.	93.0	999.0
201611	178	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Communicating the nature of the central bank’s multidimensional “policy reaction function” could be challenging.	93.0	999.0
201611	179	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Moreover, the ongoing use of asset purchases could affect financial markets in ways that are difficult to anticipate.	93.0	999.0
201611	180	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Policymakers may therefore assess the tradeoffs between the benefits and costs of active use of the balance sheet differently at the effective lower bound versus away from it.	93.0	999.0
201611	181	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	One possible approach would be to use the changes in the size and the composition of the balance sheet to achieve macroeconomic objectives only when the policy rate is constrained at the effective lower bound or during periods of stressed market conditions, and then revert to its passive role and prior structure at other times.	93.0	999.0
201611	182	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	This strategy would seek to preserve space that permitted future use of expanding the balance sheet by holding a relatively small balance sheet and a low level of duration risk outside the effective lower bound episodes.	93.0	999.0
201611	183	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	There may also be benefits of using the balance sheet actively away from the effective lower bound, although the case may be less clear.	93.0	999.0
201611	184	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In a post-crisis “new normal” characterized by a low equilibrium real rate, there will be less room than in the past to cut the policy rate in response to a recessionary shock, and there may be more frequent, and potentially longer, spells at the effective lower bound.	93.0	999.0
201611	185	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	An open question is whether a permanently large balance sheet would permanently reduce the risk premiums and thus it would raise the equilibrium real risk-free rate.	93.0	999.0
201611	186	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	If that is the case, from an ex ante viewpoint, holding a large balance sheet that bears a relatively high level of duration risk away from the effective lower bound might create additional scope to cut interest rates in the event of a recessionary shock.	93.0	999.0
201611	187	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	This strategy might help to limit the frequency of episodes at the effective lower bound.	93.0	999.0
201611	188	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	However, this same strategy could present, ex post, some costs of having less space to expand the balance sheet further should short-term rates still fall to the effective lower bound.	93.0	999.0
201611	189	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In either case, the macroeconomic effectiveness of any purchase or sales program will depend a great deal on the public’s understanding of the Committee’s reaction function and its stopping rule for using balance sheet tools, in conjunction with forward guidance on the short-term interest rate.	93.0	999.0
201611	190	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	I will now turn to ways the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet could be used to promote financial stability.	93.0	999.0
201611	191	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	I would like to preface this discussion by noting that, currently, there is only a small research literature on this topic and no real consensus.	93.0	999.0
201611	192	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	As shown on slide 22, policymakers might consider several financial stability objectives.	93.0	999.0
201611	193	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	During periods of stress in financial markets, asset purchases could be used to promote market liquidity and improve market functioning.	93.0	999.0
201611	194	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	The Federal Reserve’s first asset purchase program, initiated at the height of the crisis, likely helped along these dimensions.	93.0	999.0
201611	195	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Outside periods of stress, the balance sheet might also, in principle, be used preemptively to reduce the vulnerabilities in the financial sector.	93.0	999.0
201611	196	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	One of those vulnerabilities could arise from privately created, short-term, money-like assets.	93.0	999.0
201611	197	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In normal times, investors perceive such assets to be safe and liquid, but sudden changes in investors’ perceptions can lead to stressed market conditions.	93.0	999.0
201611	198	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Those changes were powerful catalysts for instability during the financial crisis.	93.0	999.0
201611	199	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In light of these considerations, a recent literature has suggested that a greater supply of publicly provided money-like assets may be able to crowd out excessive creation of runnable, private money-like assets.	93.0	999.0
201611	200	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Nevertheless, a great deal of additional research would be necessary before we would be able to assess the magnitude of the potential benefits of displacing privately supplied money-like assets.	93.0	999.0
201611	201	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Another vulnerability relates to the potential for excessive private maturity and liquidity transformation that arises from the shape of the yield curve.	93.0	999.0
201611	202	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Some researchers have suggested that the Federal Reserve could flatten the yield curve by buying long-term securities, and therefore, by increasing the costs of short-term borrowing relative to the yields on longer-term assets, reduce the amount of maturity transformation taking place in the private sector.	93.0	999.0
201611	203	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	However, there is very limited evidence on the responsiveness of liquidity and maturity transformation to changes in the yield curve.	93.0	999.0
201611	204	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Finally, some observers have suggested that the Federal Reserve hold relatively few high-quality liquid assets in its portfolio to expand the quantity of the same assets available to financial institutions.	93.0	999.0
201611	205	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Others have suggested that the Federal Reserve can “lean against the wind” in the housing market by adjusting its holdings of agency MBS and therefore influencing mortgage market conditions.	93.0	999.0
201611	206	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	This policy might be beneficial if the housing sector is viewed as an important channel affecting financial stability.	93.0	999.0
201611	207	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Thank you.	93.0	999.0
201611	208	2016-11-02	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Debby will now continue our presentation.	93.0	999.0
201611	209	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Thank you, David.	93.0	999.0
201611	210	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	David reviewed a number of roles the balance sheet could potentially play in the Federal Reserve’s future operating framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	211	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Your eventual decisions about these roles will have implications for the design of the SOMA portfolio.	93.0	999.0
201611	212	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Some instructive cases are summarized on slide 23.	93.0	999.0
201611	213	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	A simple case might be to use the balance sheet passively to support short-term interest rate control and to deploy it as an active tool only when short-term rates are constrained by the ELB or during times of financial stress.	93.0	999.0
201611	214	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Maintaining a portfolio in normal times that is somewhat greater than currency in circulation and other autonomous factors—but not substantially so—and that has a short average duration would preserve capacity to conduct maturity extension or large-scale asset purchase programs.	93.0	999.0
201611	215	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Active use of the balance sheet at the ELB or in stressed market conditions would then mean expanding the portfolio’s size, lengthening its maturity, or changing its asset composition—then reverting to its previous structure when conditions warrant.	93.0	999.0
201611	216	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	A limitation of this strategy is its assumption that the balance sheet can be normalized before it is expanded again.	93.0	999.0
201611	217	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Under this approach, the portfolio’s size and composition are not necessarily choice variables; they depend on economic developments.	93.0	999.0
201611	218	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	With a persistently low r* suggesting that spells at the ELB may become more frequent or persistent, there is a risk of an ever-increasing balance sheet.	93.0	999.0
201611	219	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Using the balance sheet to support macroeconomic objectives while away from the ELB or to promote financial stability in normal times would likely entail a relatively large balance sheet—driven by needs to supply a large quantity of Federal Reserve liabilities or to hold a large stock of assets—in order to achieve desired objectives.	93.0	999.0
201611	220	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Different objectives, though, lead to different portfolios.	93.0	999.0
201611	221	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	For example, using the balance sheet as a macroeconomic tool away from the ELB might suggest holding a large amount of longer-term securities in order to apply downward pressure on term premiums.	93.0	999.0
201611	222	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	In contrast, positioning the portfolio to be able to flatten the yield curve suggests holding a large stock of shorter-term securities that could then be sold when the need arises.	93.0	999.0
201611	223	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Meanwhile, a desire to increase the quantity of HQLA available to the private sector suggests weighting securities holdings toward agency MBS.	93.0	999.0
201611	224	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	In slide 24, policymakers might consider a range of possible guiding principles for portfolio management, particularly insofar as there is some leeway in determining the composition of SOMA assets within the narrow limits established by the Federal Reserve Act.	93.0	999.0
201611	225	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Three principles that guided portfolio management before the crisis were safety, market neutrality, and liquidity.	93.0	999.0
201611	226	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	The weight each of these concepts holds in a future portfolio will depend in part on your choices about operating regimes and long-run balance sheet objectives.	93.0	999.0
201611	227	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Strategies that require substantial holdings of longer-term Treasury securities or agency MBS mean accepting some financial risk and potentially distorting relative prices or promoting credit allocation across sectors in order to achieve their policy objectives.	93.0	999.0
201611	228	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	While portfolio liquidity provides flexibility to sell assets in response to shocks, the need for sterilization capacity may be less important in an operating regime in which IOER and ON RRP can provide interest rate control.	93.0	999.0
201611	229	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Even so, maintaining some short-term liquid assets in the portfolio might remain a priority if you see such holdings as potentially helpful in meeting policy goals in some economic or market circumstances.	93.0	999.0
201611	230	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Maintaining operational readiness in key financial markets might conceivably be considered a new principle, perhaps suggesting ongoing maintenance of at least a small agency MBS portfolio if you believe you could need to operate in this market sometime in the future.	93.0	999.0
201611	231	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Return and transparency could conceivably become more prominent principles if the Federal Reserve runs a permanently large balance sheet.	93.0	999.0
201611	232	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Transparency about balance sheet policies is important not only to enhance policy effectiveness, as David mentioned, but also to enhance accountability, by enabling the public and the Congress to judge whether the Federal Reserve’s actions are consistent with its stated objectives.	93.0	999.0
201611	233	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	This is all the more important in light of possible fiscal and political economy issues that could accompany certain balance sheet strategies.	93.0	999.0
201611	234	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	As noted on slide 25, monetary policy has fiscal implications regardless of the size and composition of the central bank’s balance sheet.	93.0	999.0
201611	235	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	However, maintaining a persistently large balance sheet and using it as an active policy tool would accentuate fiscal and political economy issues.	93.0	999.0
201611	236	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	One issue is the division of responsibility for debt management decisions between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury.	93.0	999.0
201611	237	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Changes in the size and composition of the central bank’s balance sheet can alter the liability structure and funding costs of the government.	93.0	999.0
201611	238	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Different goals for the central bank and fiscal authority may, in certain circumstances, lead each to act in ways that are at cross purposes with one another.	93.0	999.0
201611	239	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	A second set of issues pertains to the costs of funding a permanently large central bank balance sheet.	93.0	999.0
201611	240	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Interest paid by the central bank to its counterparties can generate political pressures if such payments are viewed as unfair, unwarranted, or a subsidy.	93.0	999.0
201611	241	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Additionally, to the extent that interest payments on central bank liabilities are simply a component of the government’s overall interest expense, one might ask whether central bank liabilities are the least expensive way to finance the public debt.	93.0	999.0
201611	242	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Another set of issues arises when one considers the Federal Reserve as an independent entity that generates a stream of remittances to the Treasury.	93.0	999.0
201611	243	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	If the term premium is positive, a larger and longer-duration balance sheet should lead to levels of income and remittances that are higher on average, but possibly more variable.	93.0	999.0
201611	244	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Purchasing assets while term premiums are negative across the yield curve implies expectations of future negative net income associated with those assets.	93.0	999.0
201611	245	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Of course, monetary policy has general equilibrium effects that have broad fiscal implications, including effects on public revenues and expenditures and rates at which the government finances its debt.	93.0	999.0
201611	246	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Simulation results presented in our memo show how the overall fiscal impact of a large balance sheet can remain positive even when Federal Reserve income is weak.	93.0	999.0
201611	247	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Moreover, negative net income is not an impediment to executing monetary policy so long as losses are not so large as to impair the central bank’s solvency— measured by the sum of net worth and the expected present discounted value from seigniorage.	93.0	999.0
201611	248	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Nonetheless, balance sheet strategies that heighten the risk of losses could jeopardize the Federal Reserve’s independence or ability to pursue its policy mandate should concerns about income losses call into question policymakers’ commitment to raising rates when economic and financial conditions call for it.	93.0	999.0
201611	249	2016-11-02	meeting	LEONARD	Thank you, and Thomas will now conclude the briefing.	93.0	999.0
201611	250	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Debby.	93.0	999.0
201611	251	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	As Troy mentioned, the staff memos and presentations prepared for this meeting and for the July FOMC meeting are the culmination of over a year of effort by a large number of staff across the System.	93.0	999.0
201611	252	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	In total, the staff delivered over 500 pages of analysis on a very wide-ranging and complex set of topics.	93.0	999.0
201611	253	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	There will be a quiz before lunch on the details of these staff memos.	93.0	999.0
201611	254	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	[Laughter]	93.0	999.0
201611	255	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Apart from the memos, over the past year the staff also hosted a number of research and policy conferences and other events to build a broader and deeper understanding of the issues; to draw on the insights and perspectives not only of staff throughout the Federal Reserve System, but also academics, market participants, and analysts at other central banks; and to inform the public.	93.0	999.0
201611	256	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	As you might imagine, a project this large and complex required a more formal and extensive project management approach than is typical of FOMC projects.	93.0	999.0
201611	257	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	On behalf of the Executive Committee, co-chaired by Simon and myself, I’d like to thank everyone who helped keep the long-run framework trains running on time, including all the members of the Operating Committee—and particularly Julie Remache, the OC chair.	93.0	999.0
201611	258	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	I’d also thank all of the workgroup leads, the project management office, and a number of staff that helped with information technology and other technical and meeting support.	93.0	999.0
201611	259	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	The very broad focus of the long-run framework project has provided a strong foundation for the analysis of related issues in coming years.	93.0	999.0
201611	260	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	The possible questions we provided for your discussion, shown on slides 27 to 29, are intended to elicit your views on any tentative conclusions you draw from the materials we presented so far.	93.0	999.0
201611	261	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Going forward, we expect that follow-on work will be more targeted and focused on particular topics.	93.0	999.0
201611	262	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	These more targeted efforts will likely be conducted following the usual approach of convening a relatively small group of System staff as necessary to work on particular topics over an FOMC cycle or two.	93.0	999.0
201611	263	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	And with that, we’d be happy to take your questions.	93.0	999.0
201611	264	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	999.0
201611	265	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Before beginning our discussion, I, too, would like to express my sincere thanks to all of the staff across the System who have contributed to the long-run framework project.	93.0	65.0
201611	266	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	A great deal of thoughtful work has gone into this project, and the documents we received for this meeting are clear, well organized, and highly informative.	93.0	65.0
201611	267	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	As we complete this phase of our work on the long-run framework, I would like to congratulate the staff for a tremendous effort.	93.0	65.0
201611	268	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	To set the stage for a discussion, I think it’s useful to review the timeline for when decisions about our longer-run implementation framework will likely need to be made.	93.0	65.0
201611	269	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Clearly, there is no urgency at the moment.	93.0	65.0
201611	270	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Our current implementation framework is working well and should continue to work well for the foreseeable future.	93.0	65.0
201611	271	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	So when might we need to act to either change or affirm our framework?	93.0	65.0
201611	272	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	It seems highly unlikely that we would need to take action while we are continuing our reinvestment policy.	93.0	65.0
201611	273	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And even after we cease reinvestments, it will be quite some time until shrinkage of the balance sheet would force decisions.	93.0	65.0
201611	274	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	As noted in Tealbook B, the staff assumes that reinvestments will cease once the target range for the federal funds rate reaches 1¼ to 1½ percent.	93.0	65.0
201611	275	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Under the baseline, this occurs in the third quarter of next year.	93.0	65.0
201611	276	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thereafter, reserve balances decline at a pace of roughly $650 billion per year.	93.0	65.0
201611	277	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	In the Tealbook projection, it will not be until late 2019 that reserve balances move below $1 trillion, a level that is probably still ample enough to keep us operating on the flat portion of the reserve demand curve, as in our current floor-based system.	93.0	65.0
201611	278	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Now, waiting until reserves become scarce to make any decisions is surely not advisable, particularly as the public will long before then want some idea of where we are headed.	93.0	65.0
201611	279	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	That said, we still have much to learn about the future operation of money markets in the new regulatory environment, including gaining insight into the factors that will affect the supply and demand for reserves.	93.0	65.0
201611	280	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	The significant changes in money markets over the past few months in response to the reforms affecting money market mutual funds is a good reminder that the world may look quite different in some important respects a year or two down the road.	93.0	65.0
201611	281	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Many of the questions that are before us today need not, and probably should not, be settled now.	93.0	65.0
201611	282	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	That being said, I think it is important that we remain engaged in considering these issues, and it’s my hope that we can identify some specific areas for improvement in our implementation framework that will yield benefits regardless of our longer-run decisions.	93.0	65.0
201611	283	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	It will also be useful to get a sense of your general views on the bigger-picture questions regarding the choice of our policy rate, the operating regime, and use of the balance sheet.	93.0	65.0
201611	284	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I am looking forward to hearing your views on these important issues.	93.0	65.0
201611	285	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And with those remarks, let’s start off with Q&A, and then we will go into a round of comments.	93.0	65.0
201611	286	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Any questions for the staff?	93.0	65.0
201611	287	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	93.0	65.0
201611	288	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I agree with all that you said, Madam Chair, in terms of not having to make decisions right now.	93.0	96.0
201611	289	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	But presumably there are some decisions that you might want to make now, just because there might be consensus and there might be a deadweight loss of not making that decision.	93.0	96.0
201611	290	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The one that seems most obvious to me, potentially, is the reserve requirement.	93.0	96.0
201611	291	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	It doesn’t seem, in the current regime, that required reserves has any great value, and it has administrative costs.	93.0	96.0
201611	292	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	It results in fewer high-quality liquid asset sales.	93.0	96.0
201611	293	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I have a general question for the staff or anyone else.	93.0	96.0
201611	294	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Do people feel like all this has to necessarily be deferred if there is consensus on issues like required reserves?	93.0	96.0
201611	295	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I presume a determination on required reserves is a Board decision.	93.0	96.0
201611	296	2016-11-02	meeting	MARTIN	Certainly, if the Committee felt comfortable raising them again later, should it decide to operate on the steep part of the demand curve, there would be a number of benefits to setting them to zero temporarily or permanently.	93.0	999.0
201611	297	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	I also think a significant amount of time would be required to get from here to a place like that.	93.0	999.0
201611	298	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	You could actually ask the staff for a proposal for what would be needed to get from here to there and continue thinking about it.	93.0	999.0
201611	299	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	So you wouldn’t have to necessarily make a formal decision immediately.	93.0	999.0
201611	300	2016-11-02	meeting	IHRIG	You could ask the staff for further work.	93.0	999.0
201611	301	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The only thing I would say is that it might signal something that you don’t want to signal.	93.0	999.0
201611	302	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	So there have to be some overall context, I think, for a decision like that.	93.0	999.0
201611	303	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	93.0	96.0
201611	304	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions for the staff?	93.0	65.0
201611	305	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	93.0	65.0
201611	306	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, this is an opportunity to comment.	93.0	65.0
201611	307	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I think, more or less, everybody has indicated that they would like to comment, so let’s begin our go-round.	93.0	65.0
201611	308	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	93.0	65.0
201611	309	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	93.0	96.0
201611	310	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I very much appreciate all of the work the staff has done on the long-run framework.	93.0	96.0
201611	311	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I thought it was an extremely thoughtful and comprehensive, an absolutely excellent piece of work.	93.0	96.0
201611	312	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it is important to consider where we’re headed, because it will influence what capabilities we have to have in the future.	93.0	96.0
201611	313	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	As the Chair has said, obviously time is on our side here, because we’ll likely be in the current floor system for several years at a minimum, and any consensus that was reached by this Committee wouldn’t necessarily be binding on future Committees.	93.0	96.0
201611	314	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So that’s relevant as well.	93.0	96.0
201611	315	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	But I still think it’s worthwhile to do the work to have a good sense of where we’re headed.	93.0	96.0
201611	316	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	To answer the most important question, I think we should have a regime in which there are sufficient reserves in the banking system so we’re operating on the flat portion of the demand curve.	93.0	96.0
201611	317	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	In my mind this type of regime has several important advantages.	93.0	96.0
201611	318	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	First, it’s operationally quite simple.	93.0	96.0
201611	319	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	One doesn’t have to forecast all of the autonomous factors that affect reserve balances and then add and drain reserves each day or week to keep the supply of reserves in balance with demand.	93.0	96.0
201611	320	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, it enables the financial system to operate more efficiently.	93.0	96.0
201611	321	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Excess reserves facilitate larger liquidity buffers and reduce payment frictions.	93.0	96.0
201611	322	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	It also reduces the amount of interbank activity in which reserves are created from bank to bank.	93.0	96.0
201611	323	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The memos talked about the robustness of the money markets.	93.0	96.0
201611	324	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I think having robust money markets makes sense, but I don’t see any bank activity per se as having a lot of value.	93.0	96.0
201611	325	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	It adds complexity to the system, but I don’t think it adds value to the financial system.	93.0	96.0
201611	326	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	There are some regimes in which there’s a lot of activity that takes place in moving reserves from banks that are long in reserves over to banks that are short of reserves that I don’t think actually ends up generating a lot of benefits to the economy at large.	93.0	96.0
201611	327	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Third, a floor regime is robust at the effective lower bound on short-term interest rates.	93.0	96.0
201611	328	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	If you had a corridor system, reserves added by QE and special liquidity programs would have to be drained in order to maintain monetary control, and we saw in 2008 that this can be difficult to do.	93.0	96.0
201611	329	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Sometimes you can actually lose monetary policy control.	93.0	96.0
201611	330	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, I think a corridor regime has one important negative aspect that maybe could be highlighted a little bit more.	93.0	96.0
201611	331	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	In 2007 and 2008, we were reluctant to enact large programs, and we didn’t enact programs that were open-ended, because we were worried about how we would actually offset, by corresponding draining operations, the reserves added through such programs.	93.0	96.0
201611	332	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this is important, because open-ended backstop programs may actually be more effective than programs that are finite in magnitude in terms of supporting financial stability.	93.0	96.0
201611	333	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s because such backstops encourage private market participants to stay engaged rather than pull away, and the fact that they want to stay engaged, I think, does reduce the risk of financial panic somewhat.	93.0	96.0
201611	334	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Under a floor regime, we can expand the balance sheet without risk of losing monetary policy control or needing to conduct offsetting reserve draining operations, and I think that’s important.	93.0	96.0
201611	335	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, clearly, we don’t need a $4.5 trillion balance sheet to have such a regime.	93.0	96.0
201611	336	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I agree with the staff that the amount of excess reserves could come down considerably.	93.0	96.0
201611	337	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	In conversations I’ve had with the staff, the general view has been that if you had $1 trillion of excess reserves, you’d be highly confident that you’d have more than sufficient reserves to ensure that you’d stay on the flat part of the demand curve in a wide range of environments.	93.0	96.0
201611	338	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I think you want to have enough with a margin of safety, and that would make a lot of sense.	93.0	96.0
201611	339	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to some of the other issues raised in the long-run framework memos, many of them are second order relative to this issue of floor versus corridor system.	93.0	96.0
201611	340	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, I think we could target any number of short-term interest rates, or we could have an administered rate, such as the IOER rate or the overnight repo rates, to serve as our short-term interest rate target.	93.0	96.0
201611	341	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	At the margin I prefer using an administered rate, such as the IOER rate or the overnight RRP rate.	93.0	96.0
201611	342	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	In enacting monetary policy, we don’t care about the level of money market rates per se, but instead we care about the effects of our policy stance on financial market conditions more generally.	93.0	96.0
201611	343	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So moving to an administered rate would appropriately shift the focus away from any particular level of a particular money market rate.	93.0	96.0
201611	344	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I understand the IOER rate raises some governance issues, but I don’t see why the Board of Governors wouldn’t just decide to defer to the FOMC on this matter or decide that the IOER rate would be set at a given spread relative to the overnight RRP rate.	93.0	96.0
201611	345	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	If we were to decide not to use an administered rate, which is my preference, I would prefer to shift away from the federal funds rate to another money market rate.	93.0	96.0
201611	346	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The federal funds rate has become increasingly idiosyncratic.	93.0	96.0
201611	347	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	For me, I would either prefer the overnight bank funding rate or the GC Treasury repo rate.	93.0	96.0
201611	348	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Due to my preference to make a floor system permanent, I would also be completely in favor, as I said in my question earlier, of eliminating the reserve requirement, and I don’t really see why we wouldn’t just get on with that right now, because it does create a deadweight loss in the sense that it has a lot of administrative complexity, and required reserves, unlike excess reserves, don’t count as high-quality liquid assets.	93.0	96.0
201611	349	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me like there’s a real gain in just getting rid of the reserve requirement.	93.0	96.0
201611	350	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think that if we were to adopt a floor system on a permanent basis, it might be worthwhile to review whether reserves should be part of the leverage ratio calculation.	93.0	96.0
201611	351	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	As I see it, there are two reasons to consider excluding reserves from the leverage-ratio calculation.	93.0	96.0
201611	352	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	First, the banking system does not control how many excess reserves it must hold.	93.0	96.0
201611	353	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	We do that by our policy decisions.	93.0	96.0
201611	354	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I’d like to have a regime in which we didn’t have to worry about whether a quantitative easing program would lose its effectiveness because the expansion of bank balance sheets was causing the leverage ratio to bite, thereby undermining the incentives that banks had to expand their lending.	93.0	96.0
201611	355	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, excluding excess reserves from the leverage-ratio calculation would create greater incentives to arbitrage the gap between other money market rates, such as the federal fund rate and the interest rate paid on excess reserves, and this would make monetary policy more efficient in that we’d be paying banks a lower interest rate for any given degree of monetary policy stringency.	93.0	96.0
201611	356	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Banks that hold more excess reserves are not riskier.	93.0	96.0
201611	357	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Including such reserves in the leverage ratio calculation in my mind doesn’t achieve any meaningful benefit in terms of safety and soundness of the banking system that we oversee.	93.0	96.0
201611	358	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So, two final thoughts.	93.0	96.0
201611	359	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	First, I’m not a big fan of actively using the balance sheet as a tool of policy when we’re not at the effective lower bound on interest rates.	93.0	96.0
201611	360	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	While I understand we could, in theory, use the balance sheet to affect the shape of the yield curve, I think this benefit is offset by the fact that having two active tools would make communications more difficult.	93.0	96.0
201611	361	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I also worry about our ability to anticipate how expectations would be affected by such balance sheet operations.	93.0	96.0
201611	362	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	If we were to change the balance sheet, would the reaction be mild or would we generate a taper tantrum?	93.0	96.0
201611	363	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The balance sheet is simply a tool that we don’t have much experience with.	93.0	96.0
201611	364	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	My preference is to keep it mostly in the background, except when we’re at the lower bound and it is most needed.	93.0	96.0
201611	365	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, I do think we should continue to work on what we can do to rehabilitate our lender-of-last-resort facilities.	93.0	96.0
201611	366	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not sure what the right way forward is, but getting rid of stigma would be useful.	93.0	96.0
201611	367	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	One option would be to operate the TAF auctions on a regular basis, presumably at very small volumes at a rate slightly above the IOER rate.	93.0	96.0
201611	368	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	This would be similar to the foreign exchange swap operations that take place around the world today.	93.0	96.0
201611	369	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	They’re little used during normal times but available to be used as needed if stress increases.	93.0	96.0
201611	370	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Having a standing facility eliminates the tough decision of whether to bring it back or not and the difficult signal that it sends, because it would already be there.	93.0	96.0
201611	371	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that has a benefit.	93.0	96.0
201611	372	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Another issue with respect to the lender of last resort is our inability to lend to broker- dealers outside of setting up a special 13.3 facility.	93.0	96.0
201611	373	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s obviously no easy solution here.	93.0	96.0
201611	374	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t see the Congress as readily giving us this authority, but I do wonder whether the FDIC might be more amenable to discussing Section 23(a) waivers now that it is on the hook when a SIFI with a broker-dealer has to be resolved under Title II, Single Point of Entry resolution.	93.0	96.0
201611	375	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	In the current regime, the inability to get funds to a distressed broker-dealer without invoking 13.3 remains a real vulnerability.	93.0	96.0
201611	376	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	96.0
201611	377	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	378	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	93.0	65.0
201611	379	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	81.0
201611	380	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The materials provided by the work groups make clear that there are a number of alternative monetary operating regimes that achieve very similar results with regard to interest-rate control.	93.0	81.0
201611	381	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	When comparing alternatives, I place considerable importance on simplicity and transparency, because these characteristics facilitate clear communication with the public and support monetary policy independence.	93.0	81.0
201611	382	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	So I find myself drawn to a relatively parsimonious regime in which the interest rate on excess reserves, an administered rate, is our main policy instrument and enough reserves are supplied so as to operate constantly on the flat portion of the demand curve.	93.0	81.0
201611	383	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Such a regime would achieve our interest-rate control goals in a way that is easy to communicate and requires little or no supplementary tools.	93.0	81.0
201611	384	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Such a regime would also minimize operational challenges and complexity, and the admittedly limited evidence we have suggests that the link between interest on reserves and other short-term interest rates is quite strong.	93.0	81.0
201611	385	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	This type of parsimonious framework could work with a balance sheet that is small relative to where we currently are but relatively large compared with the pre-crisis balance sheet.	93.0	81.0
201611	386	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Based on the preliminary quantitative assessments provided by the work groups, the volume of reserves needed may fall somewhere in the $600 billion to $800 billion range.	93.0	81.0
201611	387	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	We would be able to learn, though, as we implemented such a regime, more about how much is required, and the exact amount might vary over time.	93.0	81.0
201611	388	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	But we should be able to manage it with a program of just occasional outright purchases and sales of Treasury securities and without having to conduct day-to-day market interventions, as we did with our previous regime.	93.0	81.0
201611	389	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	There are a number of valuable features of this parsimonious regime.	93.0	81.0
201611	390	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	It would obviate the need for reserve requirements.	93.0	81.0
201611	391	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I endorse Vice Chairman Dudley’s suggestion that we get on with that if we can.	93.0	81.0
201611	392	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	It would also obviate the need for the overnight reverse repurchase program, which I think is superfluous in the current set-up.	93.0	81.0
201611	393	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	A particularly valuable feature is that the volume of reserve balances should be enough to accommodate the System’s payment settlement needs without much use of daylight credit from the Federal Reserve.	93.0	81.0
201611	394	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	This would make for a more efficient payments system and would reduce the risk of large credit extensions necessitated by operational failures, as occurred in 1985 or on 9/11.	93.0	81.0
201611	395	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I also believe that flexibility and resilience are important because it can be hard to predict how the financial system is going to evolve.	93.0	81.0
201611	396	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The ongoing shift from prime to government money market funds you mentioned, Madam Chair, is a good example.	93.0	81.0
201611	397	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Another is the erosion of Eurodollar volume that is now necessitating a reexamination of scope of our newly minted overnight bank funding rate.	93.0	81.0
201611	398	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	A framework that relies on an administered rate in the flat portion of the demand for reserves seems more likely to be robust to potential changes in the structure of money markets or banking regulations that might affect the behavior or economic significance of various market rates.	93.0	81.0
201611	399	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Of course, using an administered rate as our main policy rate does not mean that we have to ignore market rates.	93.0	81.0
201611	400	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	It might make sense, perhaps for an interim period, to continue to articulate our expectations that certain market rates will trade in a certain range determined by the IOER rate.	93.0	81.0
201611	401	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	But if so, I think that we should state such expectations broadly enough to make clear that we do not take much signal from highly transitory fluctuations in particular rates, such as the blips we often see at quarter-end.	93.0	81.0
201611	402	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Although we should be attentive and well informed about such fluctuations, they can have many sources, and most have little or no implications for the stance of monetary policy.	93.0	81.0
201611	403	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Another reason to set policy in terms of an administered rate is the fact that there are counterparty credit risk premiums embedded in many market rates.	93.0	81.0
201611	404	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	These may be generally negligible in normal times, but at other times, movements in market rates reflect changes in the distribution of risk premiums charged to private-sector borrowers.	93.0	81.0
201611	405	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	August 2007 was a good example of an episode in which broad shifts in perceived credit risk affected market rates that were usually virtually risk free.	93.0	81.0
201611	406	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The interest rate on reserves, by contrast, allows us to conduct monetary policy by managing a clearly risk-free overnight rate whose interpretation is unobscured by changes in the creditworthiness of market participants.	93.0	81.0
201611	407	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Just a word about governance.	93.0	81.0
201611	408	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I agree with Vice Chairman Dudley.	93.0	81.0
201611	409	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The one drawback you might see to a purely administered rate regime that depends on the interest rate on excess reserves is the awkwardness of the IOER rate being set by the Board of Governors and not the FOMC.	93.0	81.0
201611	410	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	But, similarly to the way we’ve handled the discount window rate since 2003, I think a solid commitment by the Board to follow the lead of the FOMC should suffice.	93.0	81.0
201611	411	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	And you could always pursue legislation, but I hesitate to recommend that.	93.0	81.0
201611	412	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	A simple floor mechanism would allow us to control a risk-free short-term interest rate with essentially no routine Federal Reserve credit extension—that is, no standing lending facility.	93.0	81.0
201611	413	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	It would represent essentially an agnostic stance with regard to balance sheet policies and lending programs.	93.0	81.0
201611	414	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	In contrast, some other regimes may require a standing lending facility to establish a ceiling, perhaps a soft one, on targeted market rates, although I would argue that in the pre-crisis regime, the discount rate played virtually no material role in controlling the market interest rates we cared about, such as one-year borrowing rates.	93.0	81.0
201611	415	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	So, for me, it’s not obvious that it was integrated in any meaningful sense.	93.0	81.0
201611	416	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	It was there, and I’m not sure what a discount rate that hadn’t been integrated would look like.	93.0	81.0
201611	417	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	It seems like it would look pretty much the same as the one we had.	93.0	81.0
201611	418	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	So it seems to me as if it’s sort of tangential to interest rate control for our purposes.	93.0	81.0
201611	419	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	More broadly, a parsimonious regime would allow us to cleanly separate decisions about our monetary policy interest rate and how we control that from decisions about other potential uses of our balance sheet, such as purchasing assets to compress yield spreads or intervening in credit markets in response to either market developments or institution-specific risks.	93.0	81.0
201611	420	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	In a parsimonious regime, our decisions about such programs would be unencumbered by fear of interfering with our control of risk-free short-term interest rate.	93.0	81.0
201611	421	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The benefit of separating decisions about balance sheet programs and credit market intervention from our interest rate targeting mechanism stems from the fact that there are really distinct considerations that are involved for each.	93.0	81.0
201611	422	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	For one, interest rate control is aimed at macroeconomic objectives, and credit market interventions are presumably aimed at microeconomic objectives.	93.0	81.0
201611	423	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I think one clear lesson arising from the crisis is that credit programs are clearly more politically controversial than interest rate setting.	93.0	81.0
201611	424	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Credit market programs have distributional effects that seem different in nature from the distributional effects associated with changing our interest-rate target.	93.0	81.0
201611	425	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The latter have differential effects on borrowers and savers, which have come to be widely regarded as unavoidable consequences of the central bank’s core monetary policy role.	93.0	81.0
201611	426	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The former, the distributional effects of credit market programs, have differential effects on different classes of borrowers.	93.0	81.0
201611	427	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	They’re less familiar to the public and are inessential to the control of risk-free interest rates.	93.0	81.0
201611	428	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Setting aside political considerations, assessments of the economic effects of interest rate setting and credit programs are on far different footings as well.	93.0	81.0
201611	429	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	There’s an enormous research literature on central bank interest rate policy.	93.0	81.0
201611	430	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The efficacy of central bank credit market interventions is another matter entirely, and I think it’s quite fair to say that the subject can hardly be regarded as settled.	93.0	81.0
201611	431	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Most of you know I’m not a big fan of central bank lending, but this isn’t the time and place to rehash that.	93.0	81.0
201611	432	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I certainly understand that many people came away from the crisis with strongly held beliefs about the utility of central bank credit market intervention, but this Committee has never really discussed a comprehensive retrospective assessment of cost and benefits.	93.0	81.0
201611	433	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	This area is likely to be the subject of a great deal of additional research in coming decades.	93.0	81.0
201611	434	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	In the meantime, we can avoid having to take a stand by choosing a parsimonious mechanism for controlling interest rates and leaving as a separate matter the fascinating debate about other uses of our balance sheet.	93.0	81.0
201611	435	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	81.0
201611	436	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	437	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	93.0	65.0
201611	438	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	88.0
201611	439	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Let me add my thanks to the staff for the excellent suite of memos and the presentation we just heard, which was helpful and very clear.	93.0	88.0
201611	440	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	In approaching the subject of the implementation framework for policy in the long run, my first reaction to the questions was to limit comments to purely practical considerations under the assumption that the balance sheet will likely be large—that is, on the flat part of the demand curve—for quite some time.	93.0	88.0
201611	441	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I am a little skeptical about constructing a long-term framework that’s disconnected from the feasible time horizon for its implementation.	93.0	88.0
201611	442	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	If this time horizon is long, our implementation practices are likely to become institutionalized and impractical to abandon.	93.0	88.0
201611	443	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Options that might seem easy to implement in the abstract could be more difficult and costly in reality.	93.0	88.0
201611	444	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Ease of transition may be a consideration in designing a long-term framework.	93.0	88.0
201611	445	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	In later discussions down the road, the Committee may want to engage the question of the transition path.	93.0	88.0
201611	446	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Nonetheless, the more my team and I worked through the memos and questions, the more I saw some value in laying out tentative thoughts on an idealized framework, even if short-term considerations could make its implementation elusive.	93.0	88.0
201611	447	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	In thinking about such a framework, I am inclined to narrow the options to just those that focus on an unsecured interbank funding rate.	93.0	88.0
201611	448	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Although I can see some merit in expanding the focus to the broader market represented by the secured rate option, I think issues like volatility argue for sticking closer to the status quo.	93.0	88.0
201611	449	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	In an ideal situation, I lean toward operating with the quantity of reserves at or near a point on the flat part of the demand curve in which the volume of reserves is smallest and the balance sheet is, accordingly, as small as possible.	93.0	88.0
201611	450	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I am inclined to avoid operating at positions on the curve with more reserve scarcity because of the concern about payment systems efficiency.	93.0	88.0
201611	451	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I also prefer to operate in the area on the curve of smallest balance sheet consistent with ample reserves—that is, the flat region—for reasons related to the concerns of financial stability and the functioning of short-term funding markets.	93.0	88.0
201611	452	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	As a safeguard of global liquidity in various states of the world, I think the Federal Reserve should hold as small a fraction of outstanding safe assets as feasible.	93.0	88.0
201611	453	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	One other reason to operate with the smallest possible balance sheet, consistent with being in the flat region of the curve, is mitigation of political economy concerns that could arise with sizable payments to financial institutions.	93.0	88.0
201611	454	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Conditions associated with the balance sheet setting I’ve described are likely to make an active federal funds market less viable, so I envision moving in the direction of the OBFR as the policy target.	93.0	88.0
201611	455	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	A framework that stays on the flat part of the curve would necessarily involve the IOER rate as an implementation tool.	93.0	88.0
201611	456	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	With the OBFR as the policy target, it makes sense to me to maintain an ongoing overnight reverse repo facility with the aim of enhancing monetary control by providing a deposit facility for a wider set of participants in short-term money markets, including the Eurodollar market.	93.0	88.0
201611	457	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	An ongoing ON RRP facility would serve as a complement or even a replacement, in time, for the IOER rate.	93.0	88.0
201611	458	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding balance sheet composition at my preferred position on the demand curve, I envision a relatively neutral asset side of the balance sheet.	93.0	88.0
201611	459	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	By “neutral,”	93.0	88.0
201611	460	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I mean holdings are distributed across maturities in rough apportionment to outstanding issues.	93.0	88.0
201611	461	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	And in my idealized framework, I prefer an asset portfolio in steady state being close to composed exclusively of Treasury securities, as that avoids any credit allocation.	93.0	88.0
201611	462	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	That said, I could see maintaining a small MBS operation as a form of contingency readiness.	93.0	88.0
201611	463	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	One final thought:  Some of the options we are considering include elements in conflict with our earlier public positions.	93.0	88.0
201611	464	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I think it’s advisable for the Committee to consider when and how to indicate any shift in thinking about these previous positions presented in the September 2014 normalization principles as well as public statements on the overnight reverse repo facility.	93.0	88.0
201611	465	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	88.0
201611	466	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	467	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	93.0	65.0
201611	468	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	102.0
201611	469	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I, too, found the briefings and the memos very valuable.	93.0	102.0
201611	470	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, I have a somewhat different take on where we are on these issues.	93.0	102.0
201611	471	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I noticed that in the briefing it was described as the “long-run monetary policy implementation framework,” and that was the task that you were assigned and carried out.	93.0	102.0
201611	472	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I actually think we need to be thinking much more seriously about the long-run monetary policy framework itself, and this ties into a lot of the comments that David López-Salido made in his presentation.	93.0	102.0
201611	473	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m going to focus primarily on macro stabilization and macroeconomic objectives, and my main concern, as always, is how are we going to conduct monetary policy successfully, achieving our inflation goal and our macroeconomic goals, in a world of a very low r*?	93.0	102.0
201611	474	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’ll note the staff’s view today is that the equilibrium nominal funds rate is 2¾ percent.	93.0	102.0
201611	475	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with that.	93.0	102.0
201611	476	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	If you look at the recent research that Kathryn Holston, Thomas Laubach, and I have done, and at research by economists at central banks around the world using similar methods, many people are finding that r* is much lower today than in the past in many countries.	93.0	102.0
201611	477	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And it’s a global phenomenon.	93.0	102.0
201611	478	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	This brings me to concerns about our monetary policy framework.	93.0	102.0
201611	479	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	First, if you think about our balance sheet of more than $4 trillion and the massive QE in other countries, that is presumably adding, at least according to our models and our analysis, quite a bit of stimulus to the US economy and to the global economy more generally.	93.0	102.0
201611	480	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	If you look at the methods for actually estimating r*, whether it is the model with Thomas and Kathryn or models, such as those developed at the Richmond Federal Reserve, DSGE models, and others, they generally do not take into account the effects of QE on demand.	93.0	102.0
201611	481	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s just part of where the IS curve is, if you will.	93.0	102.0
201611	482	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Then, if you actually think about going from massive QE stimulus in the United States and around the world and taking that away, going back to the baseline, you’re talking about reducing a significant amount of stimulus in the global economy and the US economy in particular, which arguably, using the methodology either of the work of my work with Thomas or other people’s work or DSGE models or whatever, generally would imply that r* will be lower in the future, not where it is today.	93.0	102.0
201611	483	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I am really picking up on what David López-Salido said.	93.0	102.0
201611	484	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	He described it the opposite way; a large balance sheet will boost r*.	93.0	102.0
201611	485	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	But if you actually look at how the methodology of these research papers work, because they don’t take into account the balance sheet generally, it actually is arguing that that boost to r* is already built into our estimate.	93.0	102.0
201611	486	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I would argue that there is up to ½ percentage point lower r* out there once we take away QE in the United States, and more generally globally, which would argue a nominal neutral federal  funds rate maybe of 2 or 2¼ percent or so.	93.0	102.0
201611	487	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And that does bring a huge challenge to carrying out monetary policy.	93.0	102.0
201611	488	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	If we keep the balance sheet elevated to keep r* higher, like David López-Salido said, we don’t have as much room to use QE to stimulate.	93.0	102.0
201611	489	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	If you look at the very nice paper by Dave Reifschneider a few months ago, it does point out, if we can get our balance sheet back down and if r* isn’t lower, we actually have a lot of room for stimulus.	93.0	102.0
201611	490	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	But in my interpretation, I fear that there’s not nearly as much room for stimulus.	93.0	102.0
201611	491	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	There are limits to how far QE can go in terms of the assets that we can buy under current law and the amount of outstanding MBS.	93.0	102.0
201611	492	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	These considerations make me think that, really, we need to be seriously discussing the monetary policy framework.	93.0	102.0
201611	493	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And we should be focusing our discussions and our decisionmaking on that framework, meaning what our inflation target should be and whether we should be thinking about price-level or nominal GDP targeting or other approaches to overcome the effective lower bound.	93.0	102.0
201611	494	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And from that will flow naturally some of the decisions about what’s the right size of the balance sheet, what’s the right policy framework.	93.0	102.0
201611	495	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	From my point of view, I agree with the Chair that we are not in a rush to make these decisions about what I think of as mostly tactical aspects of the operational sides of monetary policy.	93.0	102.0
201611	496	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think instead we should not be making public statements about what our operational or implementation side of our framework would be until we really have thought through some of these longer-run issues in connection with what our objectives and our actual monetary policy framework itself should be.	93.0	102.0
201611	497	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	93.0	102.0
201611	498	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	499	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	93.0	65.0
201611	500	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	90.0
201611	501	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	My comments actually follow very closely those of President Williams.	93.0	90.0
201611	502	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would say there does seem to be a surprising amount of consensus when the Presidents to my right and left actually agree on being on the flat part of the demand curve.	93.0	90.0
201611	503	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	[Laughter].	93.0	90.0
201611	504	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	There does seem to be somewhat of an emerging consensus.	93.0	90.0
201611	505	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	There was an awful lot of material.	93.0	90.0
201611	506	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	The staff did a fantastic job pulling it all together.	93.0	90.0
201611	507	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’m going to deal with only part of that, because I’m trying to keep my comments parsimonious.	93.0	90.0
201611	508	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	[Laughter]	93.0	90.0
201611	509	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Let me start by focusing on the balance sheet and make some conditioning assumptions.	93.0	90.0
201611	510	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I assume that if and when we again hit the effective lower bound, tools other than negative interest rates will be our first line of defense.	93.0	90.0
201611	511	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I make this assumption for three reasons.	93.0	90.0
201611	512	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	First, I view the results arising from the experience of other nations as quite mixed.	93.0	90.0
201611	513	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Second, I do not believe that currency will be eliminated or retail deposits will stop being sticky at a zero rate.	93.0	90.0
201611	514	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Third, these regimes disproportionately affect banks, which in turn affect monetary policy transmission and financial stability, often in perverse ways.	93.0	90.0
201611	515	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I also make the assumption that in the near term, this Committee will not be willing to raise the inflation target, even though I personally think we set the inflation target too low.	93.0	90.0
201611	516	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Finally, I take as given that the short-term equilibrium interest rate will remain lower than it has been historically.	93.0	90.0
201611	517	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	In a world with low equilibrium interest rates, it is worth revisiting how frequently short- term rates are likely to hit zero and how long they may stay there.	93.0	90.0
201611	518	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	The business cycle is unlikely to have been tamed.	93.0	90.0
201611	519	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we look at the Tealbook and private forecasters’ assessments of the probability of a recession in the next few years, it would be risky to assume that no recession occurs over that horizon.	93.0	90.0
201611	520	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, it is reasonably likely that even if we were to shrink the balance sheet relatively soon, the next recession could easily occur before the current surplus of excess reserves is fully removed.	93.0	90.0
201611	521	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	With a low real interest rate and a low 2 percent inflation target, we will not have much room to lower short-term rates.	93.0	90.0
201611	522	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	This may well cause us to, once again, hit zero short-term rates and to need alternative monetary policies to stimulate the economy, most likely by engaging in large-scale asset purchases to lower longer-term rates and rates other than on Treasury securities.	93.0	90.0
201611	523	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, if my assumptions are right, I think it is, at the least, prudent risk management to assume that large- scale asset purchases, in conjunction with hitting zero for short-term rates, will be our standard recession-fighting tools.	93.0	90.0
201611	524	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, I see the balance sheet varying but with high average excess reserves that grow during recessions and recede during recoveries.	93.0	90.0
201611	525	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we are quite likely to have a large balance sheet, then our operating framework should make clear and seek to optimize policy in a framework that acknowledges that we will be operating in a world of large excess reserves.	93.0	90.0
201611	526	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	What factors other than the business cycle should be considered in determining the size and composition of the balance sheet?	93.0	90.0
201611	527	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would continue to hold some long-term Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, the latter in order to maintain operational expertise in preparation for economic downturns, when we may resume large purchases or sales.	93.0	90.0
201611	528	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Also, we have successfully used the size, composition, and duration of the balance sheet to support the economy during recessions.	93.0	90.0
201611	529	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Some of the staff memos point out that such purchases may have smaller effects during expansions, in part because they will not be helping to improve market function.	93.0	90.0
201611	530	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	But there is no reason to believe that these factors can affect the economy only during economic downturns or only in one direction.	93.0	90.0
201611	531	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, I would maintain sufficient balance sheet compositional mix and duration to address both macroeconomic stabilization and financial stability concerns.	93.0	90.0
201611	532	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, to signal or influence these concerns, we would need to continue to hold MBS and long-duration securities in our portfolio.	93.0	90.0
201611	533	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would prefer to have a broader discussion on rates once we have more clarity on the balance sheet strategy.	93.0	90.0
201611	534	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	My current thinking is to communicate policy primarily through the administered rate that we control.	93.0	90.0
201611	535	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because the only administered rate controlled by the FOMC is the overnight RRP rate, I would focus on that rate as a floor unless the interest rate on excess reserves at some point in the future becomes a tool of the FOMC.	93.0	90.0
201611	536	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	My own view is that we closely monitor short-term rates but not necessarily target them.	93.0	90.0
201611	537	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would postpone the discussion of liquidity facilities.	93.0	90.0
201611	538	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think we should make decisions about the balance sheet first.	93.0	90.0
201611	539	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	In particular, what are the size, composition, and duration of our balance sheet going to be should we experience a long period of recovery, knowing that in a recession the size, duration, and composition of the balance sheet will likely be altered by the severity and nature of that recession?	93.0	90.0
201611	540	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	How we need to think about liquidity facilities depends on the decisions that we make about the balance sheet during good times.	93.0	90.0
201611	541	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	90.0
201611	542	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	543	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	93.0	65.0
201611	544	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	104.0
201611	545	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I’ll go through the three sets of questions expeditiously, if not parsimoniously.	93.0	104.0
201611	546	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The first set of questions asked for views on the key design elements, and I would want to start with a rate that’s highly robust and likely to remain so over time.	93.0	104.0
201611	547	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Although our current system is working at the moment, I think that for the longer term, the federal funds rate is unlikely to meet that test.	93.0	104.0
201611	548	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	There are a couple of near-term problems with the arbitrage trade that represents nearly all of the current activity in the federal funds market.	93.0	104.0
201611	549	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	First, the spread between the IOER rate and the federal funds rate generates criticism that it’s subsidizing banks, mainly large foreign banks.	93.0	104.0
201611	550	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Second, the arbitrage trade is vulnerable and could easily disappear, thanks to potential market concerns about European banks, or, for that matter, the banks themselves could pull back if regulatory changes make a trade unprofitable.	93.0	104.0
201611	551	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	If the federal funds rate does become idiosyncratic or goes away entirely, we’ll be left without a viable policy rate as well as with $11 trillion or $12 trillion of OIS swaps that are priced off the federal funds rate.	93.0	104.0
201611	552	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The plan developed in our work with the alternative reference rate committee is to move new OIS trading to either a GC repo rate or the overnight bank funding rate, depending on which rate that committee picks, we expect, in early 2017.	93.0	104.0
201611	553	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	For existing OIS trades, we will then work with the industry and with ISDA to get the chosen rate into swap agreements as a backup in case federal funds fails.	93.0	104.0
201611	554	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	But the fact that we’re even talking about this says nothing good about the quality of federal funds as a benchmark.	93.0	104.0
201611	555	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Bottom line:  I would be inclined to look for a more robust alternative.	93.0	104.0
201611	556	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Of the two possible administered rates, either of them could make sense to me.	93.0	104.0
201611	557	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The IOER rate could work particularly, I think, in a narrower spread to overnight RRP, which probably means a larger RRP.	93.0	104.0
201611	558	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	And I agree with others that the governance issues there could easily be managed.	93.0	104.0
201611	559	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	We could also pick the overnight repo rate if that facility is to be with us for the longer term, a possibility that is more real to me now in a lower-for-longer world.	93.0	104.0
201611	560	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	As for market rates, the overnight bank funding rate is a plausible alternative, although OBFR transaction volumes have fallen by roughly half this year, thanks to money market reform, and, as I think Antoine indicated, it would probably be necessary to broaden the scope of that rate.	93.0	104.0
201611	561	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The most robust rate—and I guess this makes me a case 3 person—and most relevant as a source of funding could well be a GC Treasury repo rate, depending on whether it’s triparty or includes bilateral transactions.	93.0	104.0
201611	562	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The size of the underlying market could run anywhere from $300 billion to $700 billion or more per day, and unlike the markets associated with the unsecured overnight rates, the repo market is and is likely to remain an important source of funding for a wide set of financial institutions.	93.0	104.0
201611	563	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Of course, if we do target a repo rate, it would make sense to deal with an expanded set of counterparties that are active in the market, and I’m fine with an operating framework that recognizes that we’re no longer mainly dependent on banks for financial intermediation.	93.0	104.0
201611	564	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The memo asks next whether we would prefer to operate on the flat or steep part of the demand curve for reserves, and I’m well aligned with essentially all that’s been said on this.	93.0	104.0
201611	565	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	We face both a larger balance sheet and interest rates that will be well below historical norms for the foreseeable future, and this reality has important implications for the operating framework.	93.0	104.0
201611	566	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I do lean toward a world of plentiful reserves, but one that is no larger than it needs to be.	93.0	104.0
201611	567	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	But, regardless of what one might see as the ideal end state, the long-run framework, I believe, should assume that we’re going to be operating indefinitely in a world of plentiful reserves.	93.0	104.0
201611	568	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I frankly think that the Tealbook balance sheet projections—I understand how they’re derived and appropriately derived from the mechanical interest rate rule and assumptions based on what the Committee has said—are out of touch with market expectations as well as the latest SEP numbers.	93.0	104.0
201611	569	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The surveys of the primary dealers and market participants that came out last week suggest that reinvestments will continue in full until April 2018 and estimate that the SOMA will be at $3 trillion at year-end 2019, unless there’s a return to the effective lower bound, in which case the SOMA will have increased to $4.9 trillion.	93.0	104.0
201611	570	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Of course, in the Tealbook we achieve equilibrium and there are no recessions—again, a perfectly natural assumption—but there will be a recession, and if one happens, think about this for a second:  If you just roll over the probability of recession for a few years, there’s roughly a two-out-of-three chance that there will be a recession in the next four years.	93.0	104.0
201611	571	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The SEP says that we’ll start from a low level of rates.	93.0	104.0
201611	572	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	We’ll go back to the effective lower bound.	93.0	104.0
201611	573	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I strongly suspect that we’ll be there for an extended stay and ultimately resort to another LSAP, and then we’ll be very cautious about liftoff and move gradually in raising rates.	93.0	104.0
201611	574	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	If you add all that up, what you get is a balance sheet that is probably just about as likely to grow as to shrink in the years ahead.	93.0	104.0
201611	575	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	That is not a world that I embrace or want.	93.0	104.0
201611	576	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	But it just seems to me that is the likely world in which we live.	93.0	104.0
201611	577	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	So reserves are likely to remain abundant, even allowing for some uncertainty with respect to the level at which they would become scarce.	93.0	104.0
201611	578	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Now, I think that does suggest that the overnight RRP will need to be more long lasting than I had anticipated, and I’m inclined to consider that.	93.0	104.0
201611	579	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	So far, it has provided an effective floor and done so without distorting markets.	93.0	104.0
201611	580	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I think we will need a dynamic cap on the facility if it’s going to be around for longer, and I also think we should consider narrowing the corridor between the IOER rate and the overnight RRP rate in order to address that perception of subsidization.	93.0	104.0
201611	581	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The second set of questions, more briefly, relates to the possible alternative liquidity arrangements that could mitigate stigma and create a ceiling, and let me say I’m open to any changes that would help lower the stigma of borrowing from the central bank.	93.0	104.0
201611	582	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	It isn’t clear to me that the suggestions in the staff memos could accomplish that, because it’s hard to avoid stigma when you’re borrowing at a penalty rate.	93.0	104.0
201611	583	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	But I encourage that these ideas receive more examination and analysis.	93.0	104.0
201611	584	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I also think it may be worth considering the idea of price liquidity along lines similar to what the Reserve Bank of Australia does.	93.0	104.0
201611	585	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The idea would be to require US banks to pay ex ante for discount window access, and then because they paid for it, they ought to be able to use it without stigma.	93.0	104.0
201611	586	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I’m sure there are problems and holes with that, but it’s another idea that I’m sure we have considered and should continue to do so.	93.0	104.0
201611	587	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	In the meantime, I don’t see it as particularly necessary to have a solid ceiling if we’re in a floor system.	93.0	104.0
201611	588	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I think that’s less of a consideration, and we didn’t particularly, I think, as other have pointed out, have a hard ceiling in our previous regime.	93.0	104.0
201611	589	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The third set of questions relates to the long-run size and composition of the balance sheet.	93.0	104.0
201611	590	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I strongly prefer that we use LSAPs only at the effective lower bound.	93.0	104.0
201611	591	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I think we’ve learned that it’s easier to grow a big balance sheet than it is to return to normal size.	93.0	104.0
201611	592	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	So I would use LSAPs only when conventional policy is exhausted.	93.0	104.0
201611	593	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I am open to the idea that a larger balance sheet could have some financial-stability benefits, but these are relatively new ideas, and as David López-Salido said, this is a new and fascinating literature and small literature that has not reached a real consensus.	93.0	104.0
201611	594	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	So I think it’s premature to get close to embracing anything like that.	93.0	104.0
201611	595	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	As I’ve mentioned, in any case, I think we’re going to have a larger balance sheet.	93.0	104.0
201611	596	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I am open to the idea of continuing to hold a residual amount of MBS for the reasons that President Lockhart suggested—in other words, only to maintain a certain amount of expertise.	93.0	104.0
201611	597	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	It’s not something I feel strongly about.	93.0	104.0
201611	598	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	And I’m not attracted to the idea of intervening to manipulate the shape of the yield curve for financial-stability reasons.	93.0	104.0
201611	599	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Finally, I would look at the idea of gradually shortening the duration of the portfolio mainly to diminish our effect on fiscal outcomes.	93.0	104.0
201611	600	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I do realize this is a form of tightening, and I would look at it longer term, and I would want to do it gradually and in consideration of the fact that it is a form of tightening.	93.0	104.0
201611	601	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	And with that, I’m done.	93.0	104.0
201611	602	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Thank you.	93.0	104.0
201611	603	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	604	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	93.0	65.0
201611	605	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	91.0
201611	606	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I have a set of relatively small and idiosyncratic comments.	93.0	91.0
201611	607	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I’m going to deliver them anyway.	93.0	91.0
201611	608	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	93.0	91.0
201611	609	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I will say they feel smaller after hearing President Williams’s and President Rosengren’s comments.	93.0	91.0
201611	610	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I think they really hit on a very important issue.	93.0	91.0
201611	611	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I think President Williams is right.	93.0	91.0
201611	612	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	It’s very important to assess our monetary policy framework if we’re expected to be in a low-r* environment.	93.0	91.0
201611	613	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Both President Rosengren and President Williams pointed to the fact that, in our present position, there’s not a lot of room to reduce short-term policy rates, and that’s going to be the case even if we get it up somewhat.	93.0	91.0
201611	614	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	So compared with our past experience, I think that’s likely to continue to be a problem.	93.0	91.0
201611	615	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I know it’s not popular, but having a discussion about whether or not we have the right inflation objective or some other price level targeting regime would be very useful, especially in view of where we are with the long-run framework.	93.0	91.0
201611	616	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Back to the idiosyncratic comments.	93.0	91.0
201611	617	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Thanks to everyone involved in producing these insightful analyses and memos.	93.0	91.0
201611	618	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	My staff and I had a good dialogue that challenged my understanding and preferences regarding possible future policy frameworks.	93.0	91.0
201611	619	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	In particular, the memos clarified a number of operational issues related to our monetary framework, and I found this useful.	93.0	91.0
201611	620	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	However, most of my comments today will reflect either a curmudgeonly nostalgia [laughter] for our previous operational framework or concerns about strategic risks that would come with a big change in our operating regime.	93.0	91.0
201611	621	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	The memos touched on many of these questions as well.	93.0	91.0
201611	622	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	First, the operational issues.	93.0	91.0
201611	623	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I previously expressed sympathy for a framework with a smaller balance sheet and scarce reserves so that we can go back to targeting the market rate in a sufficiently well-ordered federal funds market.	93.0	91.0
201611	624	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Such plans seem consistent with the Committee’s June 2011 exit principles as well as their update in September 2014.	93.0	91.0
201611	625	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Back then, the Committee indicated that when increases in policy rates are well under way, we will cease reinvesting maturing securities and let the balance sheet gradually shrink.	93.0	91.0
201611	626	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Many observers likely have assumed that this would lead to reserves becoming scarce and the funds rate tightening relative to the IOER rate.	93.0	91.0
201611	627	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	If this occurred, we’d be back to something similar to our previous operating system.	93.0	91.0
201611	628	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	But the long-run framework analysis suggests it’s quite possible that a robust federal funds market may not reemerge even if we return to a scarce reserves environment.	93.0	91.0
201611	629	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	One reason is that some elements of the post-crisis regulatory environment appropriately favor secured or term funding to meet the liquidity coverage ratio.	93.0	91.0
201611	630	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	As a result, depositories seem likely to rely less on unsecured overnight borrowing on the federal funds market to meet reserve requirements, and without a vibrant market, it may not be desirable to target the federal funds rate.	93.0	91.0
201611	631	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	If it’s impractical or undesirable to return to a tightly controlled target for the federal funds rate or the overnight bank funding rate, then it seems like we are led to using the IOER rate or an overnight secured rate like the Treasury repo rate as our formal policy target.	93.0	91.0
201611	632	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I understand the arguments in favor of running such a system with a large balance sheet, and I can appreciate that operating on the flat part of the reserves demand curve is appealing from the point of view of interest rate control.	93.0	91.0
201611	633	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I spent a good deal of time with my staff discussing something close to the third illustrative framework, an operating regime in which the target was a range for the repo rate and which included IOER, a large balance sheet, and a floor and ceiling facilities.	93.0	91.0
201611	634	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	While I won’t say that this is my preferred outcome, mulling over this regime highlighted a number of general framework issues for me.	93.0	91.0
201611	635	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	For example, our paramount aim is to pick a target rate that we can hit accurately as well as one that is a root pricing kernel for the interest rates that determine the degree of accommodation or restraint in the real economy.	93.0	91.0
201611	636	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	From a technical market standpoint, I see that targeting a repo rate and working with a broad set of counterparties has some appeal.	93.0	91.0
201611	637	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	But I wonder whether such a choice also could have implications for financial markets beyond basic monetary policy control.	93.0	91.0
201611	638	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	So I think there are benefits arising from better understanding the scale and composition of the financial market activities that we would be encouraging under these frameworks.	93.0	91.0
201611	639	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	For example, would our actions inadvertently change risk spreads in a way that might not be socially optimal?	93.0	91.0
201611	640	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	If our actions change risk spreads, we have to ask whether such changes in our framework are necessary for us to achieve our policy transmission goals, and if they are, whether we can communicate them in a way that the public would not perceive as simply promoting the interests of Wall Street.	93.0	91.0
201611	641	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Herein lies one of my main concerns, and perhaps this is just the nostalgia I mentioned at the outset for a simpler, smaller operating system, nostalgia for a system in which banks, both large and small, can see the way monetary policy interacts with them by a familiar and transparent federal funds market.	93.0	91.0
201611	642	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I think the memos plausibly describe how we will achieve monetary policy control with our operating procedure targets, something like a Treasury repo rate and a floor system with IOER.	93.0	91.0
201611	643	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Dealers and large and small banks will all see their funding conditions tightening or easing together as we alter our policy rates.	93.0	91.0
201611	644	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	So technically it all should work, but I worry that shifting the public focus of policy from well-known interactions with depositories to rates in the repo market might be seen as primarily benefiting Wall Street with no material benefit to Main Street.	93.0	91.0
201611	645	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	This would be a perception problem.	93.0	91.0
201611	646	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	A long US history of criticizing central banks centers precisely on issues like this.	93.0	91.0
201611	647	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Go back to the founding of the Federal Reserve and remember the contentious issues related to city versus country banks, as recounted in Friedman and Schwartz.	93.0	91.0
201611	648	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Admittedly, even in the pre-crisis period, explaining monetary policy transmission was not an easy task.	93.0	91.0
201611	649	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Still, the required reserve constraint that banks faced was relatively easy to describe to the public.	93.0	91.0
201611	650	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	In contrast, the Treasury repo rate transmission mechanism might conjure up to the naïve, like myself, visions of subsidies to Wall Street or meddling with capital market pricing adjustments.	93.0	91.0
201611	651	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Finally, I worry about the political economy risks to our independence if we run a large balance sheet.	93.0	91.0
201611	652	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Fiscal authorities have proven adept at discovering new pots of funding that do not obviously disadvantage their constituents the way that higher taxes do.	93.0	91.0
201611	653	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Even when the balance sheet was smaller, the Federal Reserve was sometimes used as a piggybank to finance expenditures.	93.0	91.0
201611	654	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	A scarce reserve system is not a panacea, but surely the risk is higher under a large balance sheet.	93.0	91.0
201611	655	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	To sum up, I’m coming around to the idea that the future might look more like the present.	93.0	91.0
201611	656	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	However, I think my fonder memories of our old operating framework are more than simply curmudgeonly nostalgia.	93.0	91.0
201611	657	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	My misgivings underscore some risks that we may need to better understand and assess.	93.0	91.0
201611	658	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	91.0
201611	659	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	660	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	93.0	65.0
201611	661	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	94.0
201611	662	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Let me thank the staff for these valuable summaries of key issues facing the Committee.	93.0	94.0
201611	663	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I know a lot of work went into this, and I think this is going to provide fodder for thought for the Committee for a long time.	93.0	94.0
201611	664	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I have a broad comment, and then I’m going to get to more specific comments.	93.0	94.0
201611	665	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I think my broad comment is consistent with what many around the table are saying, but perhaps my statement will be a bit stronger.	93.0	94.0
201611	666	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Normalization, as originally conceived by this Committee, is not proceeding as planned.	93.0	94.0
201611	667	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	The pace at which we are going, which is about one 25 basis point increase per year, is almost imperceptibly slow.	93.0	94.0
201611	668	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	The balance sheet is unlikely to decline via ceasing reinvestment any time soon.	93.0	94.0
201611	669	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I think it would be better for the Committee to state that we are not thinking in terms of a normalization program and that we instead think that the current level of the policy rate and the current size of the balance sheet are approximately correct, in light of the macroeconomic situation prevailing today and likely to prevail over the forecast horizon.	93.0	94.0
201611	670	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	In my view, this makes many of the issues addressed in the long-run framework project somewhat less urgent, as it appears that it may be many years before we are in a policy situation that is meaningfully different from the one that exists today.	93.0	94.0
201611	671	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	And in this I agree with Governor Powell’s assessment just a moment ago and those of many others around the table.	93.0	94.0
201611	672	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	At a minimum, I think that these issues would need to be discussed in detail when we are closer to a decision point on how we want to deviate from what we’re doing currently.	93.0	94.0
201611	673	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	That said, I’ll now turn to some brief comments centered on the questions posed to the Committee.	93.0	94.0
201611	674	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Regarding the first question, the so-called key design elements, I have a mild preference for a floor system with no reserve requirements and in which we use the overnight reverse repo rate as the policy rate.	93.0	94.0
201611	675	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I would prefer no gap between the overnight reverse repo rate and the IOER rate—the so-called no subsidies condition.	93.0	94.0
201611	676	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Concerning liquidity provision, the second question, I prefer to leave the discount window operations as they are.	93.0	94.0
201611	677	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I would be willing to consider a continually operational TAF with periodic testing, which could then be more fully utilized in the event of severe financial stress.	93.0	94.0
201611	678	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Finally, considering asset purchases as a policy tool for the future, I think it is a reality that asset purchases are the Committee’s most effective tool once the zero bound has been reached and are likely to be implemented by the Committee should we return to recession in the years ahead.	93.0	94.0
201611	679	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	However, because this is a discussion about the FOMC’s long-run policy framework, we may want to put more weight on three possibilities that could provide partial substitutes for asset purchases:  number one, price-level targeting; number two, nominal GDP targeting; and number three, targeting long-term interest rates more directly.	93.0	94.0
201611	680	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	It seems to me that the future of the Committee probably lies in one of these directions more than in the asset purchase direction, or at least as much probability should be assigned to these possibilities as to extensive use of asset purchases over the next decade or so, let’s say.	93.0	94.0
201611	681	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Now, if I turn back to limiting the discussion just to the balance sheet question, I have three further comments.	93.0	94.0
201611	682	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Number one, I think we should turn to asset purchases only after the effective lower bound has been reached, as several here have said.	93.0	94.0
201611	683	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I would rank asset purchases well ahead of a negative nominal interest rate policy in terms of likely effectiveness.	93.0	94.0
201611	684	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Number two, concerning the balance sheet as a financial-stability tool, as the staff suggested, I think this deserves further study.	93.0	94.0
201611	685	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I found former Governor Stein’s comments at the Jackson Hole symposium interesting, but the topic requires additional research.	93.0	94.0
201611	686	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	And, finally, on the long-run composition of the balance sheet, I would like to go with all Treasury securities, with an average duration under five years.	93.0	94.0
201611	687	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	94.0
201611	688	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	689	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	93.0	65.0
201611	690	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	999.0
201611	691	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	I’d also like to thank the team for some great work.	93.0	999.0
201611	692	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	You provided a real wealth of information that was very thought-provoking, so I want to thank you.	93.0	999.0
201611	693	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	In my thinking, we can start making some progress by first identifying some design aspects that appear desirable across a wide range of frameworks and, thus, once selected, would not constrain our choices in the future.	93.0	999.0
201611	694	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Second, I would like to pose some questions and offer some thoughts on the higher-level issues.	93.0	999.0
201611	695	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Progress on these issues has the potential to drive the design of much of the long-run framework and, thus, substantially narrow our choices.	93.0	999.0
201611	696	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	In doing that, I will comment on the questions posed by Thomas and Simon’s memo.	93.0	999.0
201611	697	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	What are the possible aspects of the framework that are desirable pretty much independently over the overall design and that could occur sooner rather than later, not waiting for the full implementation of a long-run framework?	93.0	999.0
201611	698	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Some of these have already been mentioned.	93.0	999.0
201611	699	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	In my view, it seems desirable to get rid of remaining reserve requirements.	93.0	999.0
201611	700	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	They are outdated, impose a costly burden on both banks and us, and foster avoidance practices.	93.0	999.0
201611	701	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Reserve requirements may only be essential in a corridor system with a very small balance sheet such as we employed before the crisis, and I don’t envision returning to that system any time soon.	93.0	999.0
201611	702	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Second, I think that the memo’s discussion of alternative arrangements for liquidity provision belongs in this category.	93.0	999.0
201611	703	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	We should better delineate the goals of interest rate control and liquidity provision, both broad and idiosyncratic, into separate facilities.	93.0	999.0
201611	704	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	In terms of establishing a ceiling on rates, whether one prefers a deposit institution repo facility or the financial institution repo facility, may depend on the overall framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	705	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	But in any case, a separate facility designed exclusively for interest-rate control would potentially avoid stigmatizing borrowing.	93.0	999.0
201611	706	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Similarly, as others have said, I view the TAF as the best way to provide broad liquidity, as it avoids stigma, and it should be kept operationally ready for situations deemed appropriate by the Committee.	93.0	999.0
201611	707	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Further, the discount window should be used exclusively for those idiosyncratic liquidity needs.	93.0	999.0
201611	708	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Finally, as others have mentioned, I think it’s important that we’re ready to move away from the federal funds rate to the overnight bank funding rate, the OBFR, because we may actually find ourselves with no choice but to do so.	93.0	999.0
201611	709	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	The federal funds market is basically one change in business practices, either by the Federal Home Loan Banks or foreign banks, from pretty much disappearing.	93.0	999.0
201611	710	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	We should continue the effort spearheaded by the New York Federal Reserve to expand data coverage to onshore deposits, which would facilitate communication and avoid the perception that the Eurodollar market is a foreign market.	93.0	999.0
201611	711	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	In contrast, I am particularly uncomfortable with the general level of rates option.	93.0	999.0
201611	712	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	It may be difficult to achieve, as various rates can diverge from time to time, and communicating why a particularly weighted composite average is good policy would not be easy, as I don’t think we have any idea what those weights should be.	93.0	999.0
201611	713	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Let me now delve into some of the higher-level questions and some tentative answers that could help drive many of the operational choices we face.	93.0	999.0
201611	714	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	An important question is whether we should actively use the balance sheet for financial stability concerns in normal times.	93.0	999.0
201611	715	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	If so, then many aspects of the operating regime will be subservient to financial-stability issues.	93.0	999.0
201611	716	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	For example, decisions on how much public money-like assets should be provided would basically determine the size of the balance sheet, and concerns over maturity transformation would affect this composition in terms of maturity.	93.0	999.0
201611	717	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	I think, as the staff emphasized, we know very little about how the size and composition of our balance sheet affects financial stability.	93.0	999.0
201611	718	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Furthermore, providing for an allocation of government liabilities with a particular term structure would require coordination with the Treasury, which I find to be problematic.	93.0	999.0
201611	719	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Similarly, I would also avoid buying MBS or other credit market assets, as doing so distorts asset allocation and opens up the door to political pressures for supporting various borrowers and lenders at the expense of others.	93.0	999.0
201611	720	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	More generally, I would not be in favor of the balance sheet being an instrument in normal times.	93.0	999.0
201611	721	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Coordinating both tools would pose challenges, and it would be difficult to communicate the exact reasoning for any policy mix, because, theoretically and empirically, we don’t know with enough certainty what the effects of the balance-sheet changes will be.	93.0	999.0
201611	722	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Another issue that others have discussed surrounds the use of negative interest rates as opposed to LSAPs as the primary alternative tool for additional policy accommodation at the effective lower bound.	93.0	999.0
201611	723	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	If we view negative rates as our first line of defense at the lower bound, then the operating regime must be ready for them.	93.0	999.0
201611	724	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	I am not a big fan of negative interest rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	725	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	They may send alarming signals, could be politically unpalatable, and are potentially damaging to commercial banks’ balance sheets.	93.0	999.0
201611	726	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	When necessary, I would much rather resort to asset purchases, but that implies that we must be willing to unwind past LSAPs as part of the normalization process or we could end up with an excessively large balance sheet, with negative remittances and their associated political risk becoming increasingly likely.	93.0	999.0
201611	727	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Another central question for me is the use of voluntary reserve targets.	93.0	999.0
201611	728	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Theoretically, they appear attractive because they can be used at any desired level of the balance sheet, expanding our choices while providing for an active interbank market.	93.0	999.0
201611	729	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	An active interbank market would allow us to return to money market conditions—maybe I am a curmudgeon, too, President Evans—that prevailed before the crisis and still allow for fairly precise control over short-term rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	730	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	In the language of the memo, we would be able to operate on the steep part of the demand for reserves at the level of our choice.	93.0	999.0
201611	731	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	VRT would, thus, also put policy on familiar grounds and separate considerations of balance sheet size from interest rate adjustments.	93.0	999.0
201611	732	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	But— and I emphasize “but”	93.0	999.0
201611	733	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	—there are issues concerning whether the VRT chosen by the banks will always be consistent with our desired level of reserves.	93.0	999.0
201611	734	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	It is not totally clear whether the Desk will need to perform large and frequent open market operations for the funds rate to be consistent with the desired target.	93.0	999.0
201611	735	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	The extent to which this had the potential to cause problems will depend on the degree of interest-rate volatility we are prepared to accept.	93.0	999.0
201611	736	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Thus, VRT is not “ready for prime time,” but I do think it’s worth further study.	93.0	999.0
201611	737	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	My final big-picture issue is whether actively targeting a repo rate is really a viable alternative to targeting the OBFR.	93.0	999.0
201611	738	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Such a move would potentially have large implications for the operating regime and balance sheet size.	93.0	999.0
201611	739	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Although the memo circulated made a good start on this complex topic, I don’t consider this a viable option at present.	93.0	999.0
201611	740	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Basically, I don’t think we possess a deep enough understanding of the changing regulatory environment and the market structure effects of a permanent Federal Reserve presence in the repo market to proceed confidently at this moment.	93.0	999.0
201611	741	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	999.0
201611	742	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	743	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	93.0	65.0
201611	744	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to the working group for this great work.	93.0	110.0
201611	745	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Let me mention three aspects of discussions I have had with my team as we wrestled through some of these issues.	93.0	110.0
201611	746	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	The number one issue we talked about was how hard it is to discuss these issues separately from talking about the realities of monetary policy.	93.0	110.0
201611	747	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	In particular, and to return to what President Williams talked about on r*, our view is that unless there are fiscal policy structural reforms, infrastructure spending, or other actions, r*, all things being equal, is going to be low for an extended period of time.	93.0	110.0
201611	748	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	If that’s going to be the reality, it’s harder to have this discussion.	93.0	110.0
201611	749	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Assuming there are other economic policy actions that help improve prospective economic growth rates and, therefore, give us more operating maneuverability, my team and I totally agree with an objective to operate on the flat part of the demand curve for reserves, with a balance sheet ideally smaller than the one we have today—and I might even go so far as to say as small as possible, but certainly smaller than the one we have today—with the Federal Reserve owning as small a percentage of safe assets as is feasible.	93.0	110.0
201611	750	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Like others, I’m much more comfortable with our owning Treasury securities than MBS.	93.0	110.0
201611	751	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	The Treasury market is a big liquid market, and the Federal Reserve owning sizable portions of Treasury securities is unlikely to affect the dynamics of that market materially.	93.0	110.0
201611	752	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	My concern is that we could have a big effect, and we probably already are, in the MBS market.	93.0	110.0
201611	753	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	So while we may have some minimum working level of MBS, I’d prefer to keep it as small as possible.	93.0	110.0
201611	754	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	With those objectives, we also came to the view that an administrative rate or the OBFR might make more sense as a target than the federal funds rate.	93.0	110.0
201611	755	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	And, clearly, we would need to employ other tools, such as the IOER rate.	93.0	110.0
201611	756	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	The biggest issue we wrestled with, though, is—I guess I’ve learned a new acronym, PE—the effect on the political economy.	93.0	110.0
201611	757	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	In particular, we debated extensively the need for the Federal Reserve to be independent and the importance to this country of a strong, independent central bank.	93.0	110.0
201611	758	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	My concern is that if the Fed’s balance sheet stays large and there’s a prospect of it getting larger, certainly away from a crisis, we are likely to induce accusations that the Federal Reserve has overstepped its bounds, which I fear will reduce our scope to act in a crisis when action is actually needed.	93.0	110.0
201611	759	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I think a large balance sheet, or a sizable balance sheet, is probably going to be accompanied by calls for review of our communication practices, transparency, and how we deal with our various constituencies.	93.0	110.0
201611	760	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	So all things being equal, I, for one, would like to see us take every opportunity to reduce the size of the balance sheet, and I’m very leery of alternatives that would call for a larger balance sheet, for fear that it might ultimately reduce our independence and our ability to act when there is a crisis.	93.0	110.0
201611	761	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	110.0
201611	762	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	763	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	93.0	65.0
201611	764	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	97.0
201611	765	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I’d like to associate myself with the perspective introduced by Presidents Rosengren and Williams and echoed, at least briefly, by Presidents Evans and Kaplan.	93.0	97.0
201611	766	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	That is to say, I think the most important thing for us to be focusing on now is, as President Williams said, not necessarily the implementation framework but the framework.	93.0	97.0
201611	767	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	President Williams’s point, which he made today and has made in his paper, is that in a world of low r*, one needs to think about what your monetary policy framework is and consider alternatives that heretofore haven’t been particularly attractive to people.	93.0	97.0
201611	768	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I think what President Rosengren did in complementing President Williams’s approach was basically to ask us to hypothesize that some external event causes a recession in the relatively near term and ask how we would respond.	93.0	97.0
201611	769	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Those are somewhat distinct things to ask about, but I think they fit together.	93.0	97.0
201611	770	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And, indeed, those concerns have informed my position on meeting-to-meeting monetary policy, that is, my concern that we have relatively few tools to deploy—or at least attractive tools to deploy—in the event that we were to get a recession.	93.0	97.0
201611	771	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	So I very much agree with them and with President Williams’s point that a lot of the implementation issues will, if not fall easily out of that analysis, be a little bit more obvious and the choices perhaps a bit more circumscribed.	93.0	97.0
201611	772	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I might note, in that regard, that I thought Rob framed it exactly right.	93.0	97.0
201611	773	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	We can hope that other things happen—that there’s fiscal stimulus, that there’s structural reform—but we can’t count on it, and so we need to be thinking about options.	93.0	97.0
201611	774	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And a related point is, it’s not enough to say, “Oh, gee, there are downsides to some of the options that are out there.”	93.0	97.0
201611	775	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Well, yes, negative interest rates have downsides.	93.0	97.0
201611	776	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	A higher inflation rate has a downside.	93.0	97.0
201611	777	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Nominal interest rate targeting has a downside.	93.0	97.0
201611	778	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But so, too, as many people have pointed out, does further growth of the balance sheet have a downside, and it might not even be particularly efficacious if the slope of the yield curve hasn’t risen very much.	93.0	97.0
201611	779	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Another LSAP may well not even do the trick were we to take on some of the additional political vulnerability.	93.0	97.0
201611	780	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	So I just want to reinforce the most important point to focus on.	93.0	97.0
201611	781	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	As a corollary, I will say I wouldn’t dismiss all of the balance sheet issues out of hand— even though I agree with those who have said that it’s sort of provisional and we don’t really know about the effects—precisely because of my first point, which is we just don’t know what kind of tools we’re going to have and what the downsides of those tools are going to be.	93.0	97.0
201611	782	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I think looking at some of the issues associated with maintaining a larger balance sheet or at whether there would be utility in having different durations on the balance sheet and buying and selling those is very much worth consideration, precisely because we might find ourselves constrained in our overall monetary policy and have to use a tool that does have some costs but whose benefits might be more important.	93.0	97.0
201611	783	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I do have one quite discrete suggestion, though, in the context of the particular memos that the staff has done.	93.0	97.0
201611	784	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	There was a passing reference in one of the memos to the possibility of changing the qualifications for those who participate in the ON RRP program, and some of you may recall that my concern at the outset of our institution of the ON RRP was the potential for counterparties using the Federal Reserve as a place to run from other short-term funding destinations when stress built up in the economy.	93.0	97.0
201611	785	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I was particularly concerned about prime money market funds doing that, yanking their CP from large banks and sticking it in the Federal Reserve at the first sign of stress.	93.0	97.0
201611	786	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	The SEC’s reform package, coupled with the reaction of the industry and of investors, which was, I will say, greater than what I certainly had anticipated has provided an opportunity now, as prime funds are what, Simon?	93.0	97.0
201611	787	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Down to about 200?	93.0	97.0
201611	788	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Institutional funds, 200.	93.0	999.0
201611	789	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Yes, institutional prime down to about 200.	93.0	97.0
201611	790	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	So this may be an opportunity for us to narrow the formal qualifications for being a counterparty, for example, to a fund that invests only in government securities, but to do so in a fashion that doesn’t have an enormous practical effect, because that’s what most of the funds are now.	93.0	97.0
201611	791	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I would hope that maybe we could pursue that a little bit in the shorter term, so that we don’t lose the opportunity to do it, particularly if the prime funds have a bit of a resurrection over the next year or so if investors perhaps come back or spreads change or something of the sort.	93.0	97.0
201611	792	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	The other thing I’d say is that neither of the issues that Vice Chairman Dudley raised at the end of his comments—that is, to make a change in the leverage ratio or regulatory requirement, or to be able to lend to broker-dealers—is within the authority of this Committee.	93.0	97.0
201611	793	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	So I don’t feel the need to comment at length.	93.0	97.0
201611	794	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But at least on the leverage ratio point, I did want to say I’m not quite sure I would have framed the issue the way Vice Chairman Dudley did.	93.0	97.0
201611	795	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	First, the whole purpose of a leverage ratio conceptually is not to focus on issues of risk.	93.0	97.0
201611	796	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	So the risk-free nature of reserves is not really relevant to the conceptualization of a leverage ratio as part of a complementary set of capital requirements.	93.0	97.0
201611	797	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Second, although it is true that the banking system as a whole does not have the ability to affect the amount of reserves in the system, the activities and conduct of any particular bank do have an effect on the relative reserve holdings that it has, and there are regulatory benefits that come from having those reserves.	93.0	97.0
201611	798	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	So, in some sense, as in many areas, this is a balancing that the banks need to engage in.	93.0	97.0
201611	799	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But third, and maybe most importantly, it seems to me premature to draw any judgments on this right now not only because of the debate that’s going on in this room today, but also because, not having implemented all of the risk-based reform requirements, we don’t really yet have a good picture as to the degree to which the large banks that very much want a change in the leverage ratio will be scraping up against that in a way that we would regard as counterproductive.	93.0	97.0
201611	800	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	So it’s obviously something that people are watching, but there are other ways to deal with a problem that may be established over the years other than the exclusion of one asset from the denominator.	93.0	97.0
201611	801	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And that’s sort of the way in which regulators, particularly those from noncentral banks, have leaned, even though central bankers sort of like the idea that their asset is the one that would get excluded.	93.0	97.0
201611	802	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Finance ministries like the idea that their asset is the one that would get excluded.	93.0	97.0
201611	803	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And you can see why, as a conceptual matter, academics have tended to say that’s why you don’t exclude anything.	93.0	97.0
201611	804	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	97.0
201611	805	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	806	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	93.0	65.0
201611	807	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	103.0
201611	808	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	I, too, thank the staff for their work over the past year to bring the discussions we’ve had in July and today.	93.0	103.0
201611	809	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	I will also jump on the President Williams bandwagon, because as I looked at this material, I found the various tradeoffs left me thinking about what’s the appropriate starting point for a framework, in view of the realities we face today.	93.0	103.0
201611	810	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	I think there are many ways we could go about it, as some have already suggested, but I thought about it in the context of the size of our balance sheet in the longer run as one approach.	93.0	103.0
201611	811	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	In light of the importance of this issue, it’s worth certainly more discussion among this Committee to get a sense of where we’re ultimately going.	93.0	103.0
201611	812	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	As it relates to the questions the staff asked, I see the benefits of a leaner balance sheet.	93.0	103.0
201611	813	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Political issues that arise with payment of interest on a large stock of reserves and credit allocation pose a number of risks that come with a very large balance sheet.	93.0	103.0
201611	814	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, if the equilibrium real rate remains low, a leaner balance sheet would give us more scope to use large-scale asset purchases if we are, again, at the lower bound, rather than expanding the balance sheet further into uncharted territory or contemplating negative policy rates.	93.0	103.0
201611	815	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Of course, transitioning to a leaner balance sheet poses its own challenges.	93.0	103.0
201611	816	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	While I understand this work is about the framework in the long run, it seems one part of the discussion that could be missing is talking about the costs and benefits of a possible transition to a leaner balance sheet.	93.0	103.0
201611	817	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	A lean balance sheet, however, does not need to resemble its pre-crisis composition.	93.0	103.0
201611	818	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	From this standpoint, I’m not sure we necessarily need to operate on the steep portion of the demand curve for reserves.	93.0	103.0
201611	819	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	If we remain on the flat portion, then it may make sense to consider an alternative policy rate, including the OBFR.	93.0	103.0
201611	820	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	In this case, a reconsideration on the longer-run plans regarding the overnight RRP facility is also warranted.	93.0	103.0
201611	821	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	I could imagine a scenario with a leaner balance sheet, a standing ON RRP facility, and the OBFR as the target.	93.0	103.0
201611	822	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	The leaner balance sheet would provide a lower cap on the ON RRP facility, and that would give me more comfort if it were to be integrated into our framework on a more permanent basis.	93.0	103.0
201611	823	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Of course, there would be significant changes that would require a communication to the public and a revisiting of the current normalization principles and plans.	93.0	103.0
201611	824	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of the liquidity provision options, the tradeoffs between providing backstop lending, interest rate control, and moral hazard are not new ones.	93.0	103.0
201611	825	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	I think further analysis would be needed, and I’m interested in how separate facilities might support different liquidity needs in the future.	93.0	103.0
201611	826	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	And as some have commented, I, too, believe that thinking about the TAF as a standing facility has some merit.	93.0	103.0
201611	827	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	103.0
201611	828	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	829	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	93.0	65.0
201611	830	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	999.0
201611	831	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I am going to add my two thumbs up to the Federal Reserve System staff for their efforts and insights.	93.0	999.0
201611	832	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Obviously, it was a Herculean effort, and the memos that you provided are very useful in helping guide us through a lot of these issues.	93.0	999.0
201611	833	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I think the memos make a fairly compelling case that a number of different long-run frameworks would allow us to implement monetary policy effectively with sufficient interest rate control and transmission to market rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	834	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	So the choices are dependent on our preferences about other issues, and a few of those issues loom large for me.	93.0	999.0
201611	835	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	First, I would prefer that the Federal Reserve not have a large footprint across markets in normal times.	93.0	999.0
201611	836	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Our design of the framework will affect financial market participants’ behavior and the structure of financial markets.	93.0	999.0
201611	837	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	While the Federal Reserve should promote the orderly functioning of markets, we should not choose a framework that will lead us to displace private- sector financial markets.	93.0	999.0
201611	838	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I don’t think the Federal Reserve should be the main intermediary.	93.0	999.0
201611	839	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	We should be the lender of last resort, not first resort.	93.0	999.0
201611	840	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	For example, I believe if the Federal Reserve were to crowd out all private-sector maturity transformation with an aim of promoting financial stability, as discussed in the staff’s balance-sheet memo, we might actually find ourselves with less financial stability, as firms wouldn’t be taking actions to ensure they could obtain liquidity from the markets, nor would they have incentives to monitor one another.	93.0	999.0
201611	841	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Also, it’s an open question as to what the efficient size of the financial sector is.	93.0	999.0
201611	842	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	If an excessive volume of private short-term Treasury security-like liabilities are being created in the market, we need to know more about why these assets are being demanded.	93.0	999.0
201611	843	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	It is not clear to me that, if the Federal Reserve were always to meet the market’s demand for such assets, we wouldn’t be engendering inefficient expansion of the financial sector and encouraging more risk- taking, not less.	93.0	999.0
201611	844	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Associated with this, I lean toward frameworks that are less complex—I guess “parsimonious,” perhaps.	93.0	999.0
201611	845	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Rather than a single structure that can handle all possible contingencies and that would be costly to maintain, I prefer a framework that would work fairly well in normal times but be nimble enough to be augmented by additional tools during times of market dysfunction and stress.	93.0	999.0
201611	846	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I support the Desk’s efforts to expand the number of counterparties with which we normally engage, but I don’t think we should broadly expand all of the types of financial institutions with which we engage in normal times.	93.0	999.0
201611	847	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	With the equilibrium interest rate expected to remain lower than it was before the crisis, the probability of returning to the effective lower bound on the policy rate has increased.	93.0	999.0
201611	848	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	We need to be operationally prepared to engage in asset purchases in these situations when we’ve reached the lower bound.	93.0	999.0
201611	849	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	But, in normal times, I prefer not using asset purchases as a standard tool of policy.	93.0	999.0
201611	850	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	We have less experience with this tool, and it isn’t clear how to achieve appropriate coordination of the policy rate and asset purchases away from the lower bound.	93.0	999.0
201611	851	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	So I’d prefer the simpler approach:  keeping asset purchases for extraordinary times.	93.0	999.0
201611	852	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Second, political economy issues loom large for me.	93.0	999.0
201611	853	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I’d like to maintain the separation between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury to the extent we can.	93.0	999.0
201611	854	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I believe that if we run policy with a large balance sheet, we have to acknowledge that we would more likely be subjecting ourselves to increased political pressures to take on a wider array of assets than I’d feel comfortable with.	93.0	999.0
201611	855	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The Federal Reserve’s long-standing desire to avoid allocating credit to particular market segments has served to protect the independence of monetary policy from short-run political influence, and I believe this independence has served the public well.	93.0	999.0
201611	856	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Our commitment to avoid this type of pressure would be to bring the asset composition of the balance sheet back to comprising solely Treasury securities.	93.0	999.0
201611	857	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	This is the goal stated in the Committee’s published normalization principles.	93.0	999.0
201611	858	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	An all-Treasuries portfolio is feasible in a corridor framework, but it isn’t clear to me whether such a portfolio is feasible in a large-balance-sheet floor framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	859	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The staff memo says there’s uncertainty about the level of reserves at which the demand curve for reserves flattens out.	93.0	999.0
201611	860	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	It would be good to have some numerical estimates of the shape of this demand curve and how it might change with the level of interest rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	861	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Banks currently hold $2.3 trillion in reserves.	93.0	999.0
201611	862	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	What’s the effective minimum size of reserves for our being able to run an effective floor system?	93.0	999.0
201611	863	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	And, in such a system, would the Federal Reserve be able to operate with a portfolio of only Treasury securities without holding a very high share of outstanding and new issues of Treasury securities, which we would want to avoid?	93.0	999.0
201611	864	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I think we need to know more about this before we can make some tactical choices about the framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	865	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The political economy issues that would arise if the Federal Reserve were to issue its own short-term liabilities, so-called Federal Reserve bills or Fed bills, also makes going down that path undesirable to me.	93.0	999.0
201611	866	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	And, as I mentioned earlier, I’m not convinced they would necessarily lead to more-stable financial markets.	93.0	999.0
201611	867	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Third, communications issues are also important to me.	93.0	999.0
201611	868	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I appreciate the memo on communications that was circulated to the research directors.	93.0	999.0
201611	869	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Communications considerations also lead me to think simplicity is better.	93.0	999.0
201611	870	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Even if we were to choose an administered rate as our target, we will need to provide the public with some guidance on a market rate by which we gauge the stance of policy.	93.0	999.0
201611	871	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I think communications would be simpler if we use a market rate as our target.	93.0	999.0
201611	872	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	If we opt for a floor system, then the IOER rate would be an important tool for implementation, but our communications would focus on the market rate.	93.0	999.0
201611	873	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I’d be interested in further work on how the public would understand a shift in the interest rate we might choose as a target, perhaps drawing on foreign experience.	93.0	999.0
201611	874	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Associated with communications is governance related to our choice of the interest rate target.	93.0	999.0
201611	875	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Since gaining the ability to pay interest on reserves, we have successfully dealt with the governance issue arising from the fact that the IOER rate is set by the Board of Governors, while the FOMC has purview over monetary policy.	93.0	999.0
201611	876	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Our normalization principles are clear that the FOMC sets the target range for the funds rate and uses the IOER rate to move the funds rate into that target range.	93.0	999.0
201611	877	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Even though we internally agree that the FOMC is responsible for monetary policy, I’d be concerned about the communications issues that would arise if the IOER rate were chosen as our target rate.	93.0	999.0
201611	878	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	That is another reason I prefer choosing a market rate as our target.	93.0	999.0
201611	879	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The funds rate is most familiar, but using it as a target would depend on whether the interbank market remains robust enough so that the rate is tied to other market rates.	93.0	999.0
201611	880	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Finally, I support the approach we’ve taken of first focusing on the long-run framework and evaluating the costs and benefits of each option.	93.0	999.0
201611	881	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	But before we can make a final choice, we’re going to need to have a better understanding of the transition costs when moving to the desired framework.	93.0	999.0
201611	882	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	For example, if we desire to move back to a corridor system, we’d need to shrink the balance sheet substantially.	93.0	999.0
201611	883	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	What would be the appropriate transition path?	93.0	999.0
201611	884	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	What would be the costs?	93.0	999.0
201611	885	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Perhaps a lower equilibrium real funds rate, as discussed earlier, would be the outcome.	93.0	999.0
201611	886	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	These considerations are important.	93.0	999.0
201611	887	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	We need to think about the transition costs and paths, and I would welcome the staffs to begin to work on that.	93.0	999.0
201611	888	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	It may be that some things are going to be ruled out because we really can’t get there from here within any appropriate time frame.	93.0	999.0
201611	889	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	And I also would appreciate thinking more about what would be our appropriate long-run framework in a low-r* environment.	93.0	999.0
201611	890	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I think there are other aspects, other than the operational issues that the memos cover, that are important.	93.0	999.0
201611	891	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	999.0
201611	892	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	893	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	93.0	65.0
201611	894	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair, and I’d like to thank the staff as well for the excellent work.	93.0	111.0
201611	895	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I appreciate a lot of the comments around the table about focusing first on the broader framework and then on the implementation issues.	93.0	111.0
201611	896	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I think that would be worth spending time exploring.	93.0	111.0
201611	897	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	One thing that I’m struggling with—and this may be a topic more for tomorrow than for today—is that many people around the table are concerned that we are in a low-r* environment for the foreseeable future, yet at the same time there seems to be momentum building for raising rates.	93.0	111.0
201611	898	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I find those two things somewhat inconsistent, but maybe we can talk about that tomorrow.	93.0	111.0
201611	899	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	In terms of implementation, it strikes me that switching costs are high because there’s a big downside risk if something doesn’t work.	93.0	111.0
201611	900	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	So we shouldn’t make changes unless there is a compelling reason to make changes.	93.0	111.0
201611	901	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	The FOMC had compelling reason during the crisis to switch from a corridor system to a floor system, and that shift was successful.	93.0	111.0
201611	902	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	But in light of that, as the staff said, all the various frameworks seem to work, and what we are doing now seems to be working pretty well, there doesn’t seem to be a compelling reason to make a big change any time soon.	93.0	111.0
201611	903	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I think the Chair mentioned this in her comments.	93.0	111.0
201611	904	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	For me, when I look at where we are and where we’re going, I favor a more passive framework, something that requires lower-frequency activity and lower cost.	93.0	111.0
201611	905	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	And that pushes me toward staying in the floor environment, preferably with an administered rate, under which we focus our market rates expressed in a range, so that we’re not in and out of the markets very actively.	93.0	111.0
201611	906	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	To me, like many others, this also raises governance questions, but I think they can be addressed.	93.0	111.0
201611	907	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	And I would encourage the staff to do some work to see how we could maintain the FOMC’s role in that environment.	93.0	111.0
201611	908	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Like many others, I do think the discount window seems to be broken, and I would encourage us to do more work on what reforms could look like.	93.0	111.0
201611	909	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	In terms of the balance sheet, I, too, view the large-scale asset purchases as a tool to use when we are at the effective lower bound or in periods of market stress.	93.0	111.0
201611	910	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I’d like to see the balance sheet return to maybe not pre-crisis levels, but as small as necessary to stay in the floor environment.	93.0	111.0
201611	911	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I am not excited about getting into the active yield curve management business.	93.0	111.0
201611	912	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I think it’s hard enough to manage short-term interest rates and to express our reaction function to markets, let alone actively managing the yield curve.	93.0	111.0
201611	913	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I think it implies a level of wisdom that maybe we may or may not have.	93.0	111.0
201611	914	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Finally, I am skeptical that a large balance sheet is necessarily good for financial stability.	93.0	111.0
201611	915	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I understand the theory of crowding out maturity transformation, but if we’re simultaneously pushing up asset prices, it isn’t at all clear that a large balance sheet is a net benefit for financial stability.	93.0	111.0
201611	916	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	But, again, it’s worth doing more work on.	93.0	111.0
201611	917	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	111.0
201611	918	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	919	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	93.0	65.0
201611	920	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	108.0
201611	921	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Like everyone, I am grateful to the staff for its work in producing this comprehensive set of documents.	93.0	108.0
201611	922	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	This is an important stage in thinking through how we’re going to move ahead and where we’re heading.	93.0	108.0
201611	923	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I’m sure that wherever we’re heading is not a final destination, but that there’s going to be many more changes in the financial system as time goes by.	93.0	108.0
201611	924	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I’m certainly happy, for the moment, to live with the current system, the IOER rate floor with abundant reserves combined with the overnight RRP facility.	93.0	108.0
201611	925	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	That system seems to be working pretty well at the moment and should continue to be a viable option for some time into the future.	93.0	108.0
201611	926	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And I’d guess that it may be close to the system to which we converge 5 to 10 years down the road.	93.0	108.0
201611	927	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	But we should acknowledge the potential political cost of paying interest on a large stock of reserves as well as another PE problem, which is that a large balance sheet is a standing invitation to even the most financially conservative of governments to raid the central bank.	93.0	108.0
201611	928	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Two of the central banks that were raided were the Swiss central bank and the German central bank, whose gold reserves got to be worth too much and the government took funds away.	93.0	108.0
201611	929	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Big balance sheets are politically problematic at times, and we need to be careful about that.	93.0	108.0
201611	930	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I’d support efforts to shrink the size of the balance sheet, but it’s not clear how far we should go, and we’re going to have to work on that in the months and even years ahead.	93.0	108.0
201611	931	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	In doing that, I was interested, as the study points out, that Australia and other countries are actually doing different things.	93.0	108.0
201611	932	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	For example, the DIRF and the FIRF, the standing facilities that allow either depository institutions or financial institutions to run a balance at the central bank, are being used in the United Kingdom and in Europe.	93.0	108.0
201611	933	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	It would be interesting to know how useful they are in determining the size of the reserves.	93.0	108.0
201611	934	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Similarly, the statement that was made about how Australia is dealing with stigma was very interesting.	93.0	108.0
201611	935	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I think it’s very similar to the main proposal that’s made in Mervyn King’s recent book on how to reform the entire financial system.	93.0	108.0
201611	936	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Again, we need to know how well these things are working, if they’ve started to work at all.	93.0	108.0
201611	937	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The Australian one sounds particularly interesting, because I couldn’t quite figure out how the three proposals we had for different facilities that would handle different uses of reserves would deal with the stigma problem.	93.0	108.0
201611	938	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I think that is absolutely critical because when a bank has a good reason for running into trouble and we don’t want it to collapse, lending to it makes sense, and it would be useful not to have the stigma.	93.0	108.0
201611	939	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	On the LSAPs and when we use them, I’m not quite sure of the logic of what we’re saying.	93.0	108.0
201611	940	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	If we are going to be prepared to use LSAPs, I don’t see why we should run ourselves all the way down to zero and then start using the LSAPs.	93.0	108.0
201611	941	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	That means we’re more likely to hit the effective lower bound than we would be otherwise, and I’m not sure we want to be there if reasonably sized operations in the assets that we have could be used to prevent us getting to zero.	93.0	108.0
201611	942	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I think we need to rethink the view that we have to change regimes very sharply rather than slide into them with the hope that by sliding, you increase the probability that you’re not going to get to where it looks like you’re going.	93.0	108.0
201611	943	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I want to talk a little bit more about the balance sheet as a tool for managing financial stability concerns.	93.0	108.0
201611	944	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	There are suggestions that we should structure the balance sheet in such a way that it makes it easier for us to intervene in a variety of circumstances or in a variety of industries that might get into trouble.	93.0	108.0
201611	945	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Obviously the one that is clear is housing, and we’re already doing that as part of our portfolio.	93.0	108.0
201611	946	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think we should go too far on this because we’re going to look like micromanagers of the economy if we’ve got this little fund for that industry and another little fund for another industry, and so forth.	93.0	108.0
201611	947	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Anyway, the financial markets kept working to some extent even during the Great Financial Crisis.	93.0	108.0
201611	948	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	So I think that our normal mode of operation, which is to set the interest rate and to leave it to the markets to decide on the allocation of the resulting changes in credit, is the right mode, both politically and economically.	93.0	108.0
201611	949	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And the politics are very complicated.	93.0	108.0
201611	950	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We’re not elected officials, and when we start deciding that we should be intervening in this industry or the other, we would be making decisions that are much closer to being political than what we do when we deal with the overall balance sheet.	93.0	108.0
201611	951	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think it’s a big problem if the balance sheet, which obviously would continue to include short-term government obligations, included long bonds.	93.0	108.0
201611	952	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	This is related to the fact that the model that we use for most of our simulations and forecasts actually relies on the long rate to affect output and not the short rate.	93.0	108.0
201611	953	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Now, either the model is wrong, and possibly that’s the end of that story, or if the model is right, then I think having long-term bonds could be useful.	93.0	108.0
201611	954	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And then, at least at present I don’t think we should get rid of the MBS in a given morning, but I’m not sure we want to keep a big supply of MBS there.	93.0	108.0
201611	955	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We can intervene in that market, if the need arises, with our general balance sheet.	93.0	108.0
201611	956	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I also suspect that the more we go into specific areas, the more political problems we’re going to have, and that we just shouldn’t do it.	93.0	108.0
201611	957	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Monetary policy should be macroeconomic, not microeconomic.	93.0	108.0
201611	958	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	93.0	108.0
201611	959	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201611	960	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	93.0	65.0
201611	961	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	107.0
201611	962	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Let me join everybody else in thanking the staff for the very thoughtful memos.	93.0	107.0
201611	963	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	The key considerations associated with our longer-run framework entail important tradeoffs, and the information needed to weigh them is necessarily very incomplete as a result of the unusual circumstances, which we still find ourselves in today, that led to the expansion of the balance sheet and a number of fundamental changes that have taken place concurrently.	93.0	107.0
201611	964	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Short-term money markets continue to evolve, as does the demand for reserves, while the effect of our balance sheet on liquidity and maturity transformation and on economic activity more generally is difficult to estimate.	93.0	107.0
201611	965	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	This is especially true because the regulatory environment affecting money markets changed dramatically during the same time period, and technology is changing these markets in important ways.	93.0	107.0
201611	966	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	I want to associate myself with the consideration introduced by President Lockhart that in this environment, it’s very difficult to evaluate the desired end state without taking into account the initial conditions that we’re starting from and considerations associated with the transition path.	93.0	107.0
201611	967	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	I also would associate myself with the sentiment introduced by President Williams that it is impossible to separate these considerations from considerations regarding the appropriate monetary policy and macroeconomic framework.	93.0	107.0
201611	968	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Indeed, it was the dawning recognition of the substantial change in the neutral rate of interest that led us initially to change the language in paragraph 5 last December to say, essentially, that we would not contemplate any reinvestment until normalization was well under way.	93.0	107.0
201611	969	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	And I think markets have responded to that as we anticipated.	93.0	107.0
201611	970	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	I will, having said that, try to assess the thought experiment that you put on the table for us.	93.0	107.0
201611	971	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	But, again, I hope that, as we go forward, we’ll be able to integrate those different elements.	93.0	107.0
201611	972	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Let me just briefly touch on the balance sheet.	93.0	107.0
201611	973	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	I agree with our current principles, which state that the balance sheet should be no larger than necessary to effectively conduct monetary policy.	93.0	107.0
201611	974	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	But it is very uncertain what this minimally necessary level is, and I doubt it is as small as levels maintained before the financial crisis, for many reasons.	93.0	107.0
201611	975	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Money markets have changed materially, with significant activity outside the interbank funds market.	93.0	107.0
201611	976	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	We will want to maintain our ability to influence these markets, which will likely require having a larger balance sheet in steady state.	93.0	107.0
201611	977	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, the demand for safe assets is higher than in the pre-crisis period, and the crisis brought into sharp relief the risks associated with private-sector money-like instruments.	93.0	107.0
201611	978	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Together, these developments suggest that the demand for reserves is likely to remain elevated above pre-crisis levels.	93.0	107.0
201611	979	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, the need for accommodation in the proximity of the effective lower bound will likely be greater, because the neutral rate is markedly lower than before the financial crisis.	93.0	107.0
201611	980	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	And this means we will likely want to leave space for balance sheet expansion under exigent circumstances.	93.0	107.0
201611	981	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Echoing sentiments expressed by others, I would observe that this, perhaps, is the best tool under those circumstances.	93.0	107.0
201611	982	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	When considering the operating regime, I would prioritize maintaining and, where appropriate, enhancing the facilities we have for interest rate control and, importantly, for liquidity provision.	93.0	107.0
201611	983	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Maintaining several tools will be useful, regardless of the interest rate target we choose.	93.0	107.0
201611	984	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Of course, we will want to continue with the interest rate on reserves, which will likely continue to be an important tool.	93.0	107.0
201611	985	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	The second is the overnight RRP facility.	93.0	107.0
201611	986	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	As a great deal of money market activity takes place outside the interbank market, it will be important to continue operating this facility or at least maintain it in a state of operational readiness, although I prefer the first.	93.0	107.0
201611	987	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	I’d also be open to creating an RRP facility to enhance interest rate control, though I regard this as somewhat less important.	93.0	107.0
201611	988	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	We also need liquidity facilities, as the crisis made clear.	93.0	107.0
201611	989	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s not clear that the discount window can be fully adequate because of the stigma associated with it.	93.0	107.0
201611	990	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	One possibility that many have supported, and I do too, would be to supplement the discount window with a standing auction facility.	93.0	107.0
201611	991	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, as we learned from the crisis, in certain circumstances it may be important to be operationally ready to act as a lender of last resort to a wider range of financial market entities beyond our traditional counterparties.	93.0	107.0
201611	992	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Ensuring that our operating tools can achieve interest rate control, access to liquidity, and financial stability will likely mean working with a wider range of counterparties while structuring these interactions to minimize moral hazard.	93.0	107.0
201611	993	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Regarding the target rate, the current configuration of the funds market is highly unusual.	93.0	107.0
201611	994	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s difficult to say how stable the market will be in the period ahead, but it seems unlikely the funds rate will be the most effective way to implement and communicate policy.	93.0	107.0
201611	995	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Certainly we wouldn’t have chosen the funds rate if we had started from scratch in today’s conditions.	93.0	107.0
201611	996	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	The same appears to be true of the OBFR.	93.0	107.0
201611	997	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Eurodollar lending has dropped noticeably of late as money market reform has gone into effect.	93.0	107.0
201611	998	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s also hard to imagine moving at this juncture to a regime in which we choose the repo rate as our target.	93.0	107.0
201611	999	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	This strikes me as a quite dramatic change, and so, of necessity, given the initial conditions, it seems likely we’re going to remain in circumstances in which we have several rates.	93.0	107.0
201611	1000	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Finally, again, I want to say that the analysis did a very nice job on abstracting from current circumstances.	93.0	107.0
201611	1001	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	It really helped to clarify some of the tradeoffs.	93.0	107.0
201611	1002	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Now that we’ve seen that analysis, as we go forward we’ll probably benefit greatly from having analysis that integrates considerations of the monetary policy framework with the long-run operating framework as well as taking into account possible transition costs.	93.0	107.0
201611	1003	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	107.0
201611	1004	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, and thanks to everyone for your thoughtful comments and suggestions.	93.0	65.0
201611	1005	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I’ll wrap up our discussion with a few comments of my own on the three questions.	93.0	65.0
201611	1006	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	However, I want to say at the outset that I agree with Presidents Bullard, Rosengren, Williams, and other participants who have weighed in on the larger issues pertaining to our monetary policy framework.	93.0	65.0
201611	1007	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I certainly agree that in light of our growing recognition that the equilibrium real funds rate is likely to remain low for a long time, we need to think about a broader range of issues.	93.0	65.0
201611	1008	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Let me just say, I am more than open to further work and discussion on these topics in the coming months.	93.0	65.0
201611	1009	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Turning to the questions, regarding the first one, I, like most of you, prefer a floor system that involves us operating on the flat portion of the demand curve for reserves.	93.0	65.0
201611	1010	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Such a system is very simple to operate, and it may foster an efficient payments system.	93.0	65.0
201611	1011	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	In view of the likelihood that we may again hit the effective lower bound in response to future adverse shocks, it’s clearly advantageous that such a system seamlessly accommodates large-scale asset purchases.	93.0	65.0
201611	1012	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I certainly hope that we will have a chance to shrink our balance sheet substantially before that happens—namely, another adverse shock—but it’s something we can’t count on.	93.0	65.0
201611	1013	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I think that reducing mandatory reserve requirements to zero also seems worthy of further evaluation, especially in light of improved liquidity regulation.	93.0	65.0
201611	1014	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to the choice of a policy rate, I don’t yet have a clear preference, although selecting an administered rate has considerable appeal for the reasons Vice Chairman Dudley articulated.	93.0	65.0
201611	1015	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	There is no particular short-term interest rate that is invariably especially relevant to the transmission mechanism.	93.0	65.0
201611	1016	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	That depends on the overall state of financial conditions.	93.0	65.0
201611	1017	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	The federal funds market is idiosyncratic and vulnerable to structural changes and shifts in the business models of Federal Home Loan Banks, and I worry that activity may erode further over time.	93.0	65.0
201611	1018	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	However, I do think we need to think carefully about possible unintended consequences of making changes—for example, something a couple of you mentioned, a tightening of the overnight RRP–IOER rate spread that could significantly alter the functioning of the federal funds market and other unsecured markets.	93.0	65.0
201611	1019	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	One issue that featured prominently in our earlier normalization discussions was whether there would be market or legal ramifications stemming from the drying up of activity in that market, as many financial contracts reference the effective federal funds rate.	93.0	65.0
201611	1020	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	As Governor Powell mentioned, there may be solutions—I hope there are—to this potential problem, especially if we communicate our intentions well in advance of any change.	93.0	65.0
201611	1021	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	But I think it is important to proceed carefully.	93.0	65.0
201611	1022	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	On the second question on liquidity provision, it’s possible that facilities like the depository institution repo facility, or DIRF, could enhance interest rate control by providing an effective ceiling on short-term interest rates, although providing such a ceiling is less important in a floor system.	93.0	65.0
201611	1023	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	That said, stigma and reluctance to borrow at the discount window have been long-standing issues, and we may need to do more work in this area before settling on appropriate options.	93.0	65.0
201611	1024	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Regarding the financial institutions repo facility, or FIRF—I think that’s a novel idea and might be useful in some frameworks.	93.0	65.0
201611	1025	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	But I do think we need to be cautious about using our authorities for open market operations when they could be viewed as lending facilities for nonbank firms.	93.0	65.0
201611	1026	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Turning to broad-based liquidity strains, the term auction facility did prove to be quite effective during the crisis, because its design features helped overcome stigma, and I think in light of that experience, the TAF should remain part of our toolkit.	93.0	65.0
201611	1027	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Whether it should be a standing facility or a contingent one is an open question, although in either case, it appears that the facility could be rapidly deployed if needed.	93.0	65.0
201611	1028	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	A problem with contingent facilities is that the act of using them may be taken as a dire signal and reinforce negative market dynamics.	93.0	65.0
201611	1029	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	But a standing facility also could have costs, including increasing moral hazard and altering the current role of Federal Home Loan Banks in the financial system.	93.0	65.0
201611	1030	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	As I can foresee a role for the TAF regardless of our future choice of long-run framework, we could consider whether any enhancements are worth making in the next couple of years and whether some regular small- value testing of the facility is appropriate.	93.0	65.0
201611	1031	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	But again, hereto, I don’t think there is much urgency.	93.0	65.0
201611	1032	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, on the third question, as I articulated in my speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, I believe large-scale asset purchases are an essential part of our toolkit.	93.0	65.0
201611	1033	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	They played an important role in fostering recovery from the crisis, and we very well may need to use this tool again in the future, particularly if scope for conventional interest rate cuts remains limited.	93.0	65.0
201611	1034	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	My inclination at this point would be to deploy asset purchases in conjunction with hitting the effective lower bound on the policy rate, rather than as a separate tool.	93.0	65.0
201611	1035	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Regarding financial stability, I do support using the balance sheet to address acute stress in the financial system, as we did during the crisis, but I really think the bar should be quite high for using the balance sheet as a routine tool to pursue financial stability objectives.	93.0	65.0
201611	1036	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Maintaining a large balance sheet to crowd out private money-like assets and flatten the yield curve is intellectually intriguing, but from a practical perspective, our knowledge in this area remains very limited.	93.0	65.0
201611	1037	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And, as a general point:  Sustaining any proactive use of our balance sheet requires the understanding and support of the public—which is no small thing.	93.0	65.0
201611	1038	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Even in times of crisis, when the cost of inaction loomed large, our actions drew a great deal of criticism.	93.0	65.0
201611	1039	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	In normal times, pursuing such policies could simply lead to a change in our statutory authority.	93.0	65.0
201611	1040	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Such an outcome would be particularly unfortunate, because it could eliminate our ability to use the full range of tools when they are most needed.	93.0	65.0
201611	1041	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there.	93.0	65.0
201611	1042	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	As I noted at the outset, we need not be in a hurry to make decisions about our long-run framework, and our deliberations will surely be informed by another year or two of experience.	93.0	65.0
201611	1043	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	As we wrap up this phase of work on the long-run framework, let me again express my gratitude to the staff.	93.0	65.0
201611	1044	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And, at this point, I would suggest that the senior staff, based on the views expressed today, consider any potential areas in which we could make improvements over the next year or two without materially constraining our choices down the road.	93.0	65.0
201611	1045	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I think we have had a very good discussion, and we are entitled to take a break for lunch [laughter], which is available next door.	52.0	65.0
201611	1046	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	We will reconvene in a little bit less than an hour, at 1:30.	52.0	65.0
201611	1048	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I think we are ready to get going again, and we are going to now move to “Financial Developments and Open Market Operations.”	61.0	65.0
201611	1049	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s call on Simon to begin the presentation.	61.0	65.0
201611	1050	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201611	1051	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period, domestic asset prices were largely range-bound, although inflation compensation increased amid a rise in oil prices.	61.0	999.0
201611	1052	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Markets have largely priced in a December rate hike with little drama, and market participants appear focused on global risks, including concerns over the sustainability of monetary policy stances abroad and political and financial stability in Europe and China.	61.0	999.0
201611	1053	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period, the market-implied probability of an increase in the target federal funds rate at or before the December FOMC meeting drifted higher.	61.0	999.0
201611	1054	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The probability is currently around 70 percent, as shown by the dark blue line in the top-left panel of your first exhibit, about 30 percentage points above the level seen just before the October 2015 meeting, the light blue line.	61.0	999.0
201611	1055	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The current market-implied probability of a hike at or before the December FOMC meeting is arguably about as high as can be expected, in view of the time remaining ahead of the December meeting and intervening risk events, which include the US election and two employment reports.	61.0	999.0
201611	1056	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	In the Desk’s most recent surveys, the average probability of a hike by December was a touch lower, at about 60 percent.	61.0	999.0
201611	1057	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Meanwhile, the market- and survey-implied probabilities of a rate hike occurring at this meeting are essentially zero, with market participants pointing to the lack of a press conference and the upcoming election as effectively eliminating the possibility of a rate hike.	61.0	999.0
201611	1058	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Looking past 2016, the market-implied path of the target federal funds rate is little changed over the last few months, as shown in the top-right panel, and continues to suggest that investors expect a very gradual normalization path.	61.0	999.0
201611	1059	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The expected path implied by the Desk surveys, the pink diamonds, is also little changed.	61.0	999.0
201611	1060	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Both the market- and survey-implied rate paths remain well below the path implied by the median SEP diamonds, especially over the longer horizon.	61.0	999.0
201611	1061	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	As we have discussed, a large portion of this gap is attributable to the SEP being a median of modal paths based on continued economic expansion, while Desk survey responses represent a mean expectation for the path of the policy rate.	61.0	999.0
201611	1062	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Indeed, respondents to the Desk’s surveys continue to assign a roughly 25 percent probability of a return to the effective lower bound before the end of 2019.	61.0	999.0
201611	1063	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Market participants continue to debate the notion of tightening in an era of unconventional monetary policy.	61.0	999.0
201611	1064	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Some investors date the first tightening step by the FOMC to May 2013, the so-called taper tantrum, while others look to the end of balance sheet expansion two years ago.	61.0	999.0
201611	1065	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Of course, a more conventional view is that the first tightening took place last December.	61.0	999.0
201611	1066	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The middle-left panel shows how indicators of financial conditions have changed since two possible dates for the start of tightening.	61.0	999.0
201611	1067	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Two indicators stand out: first, the consistent decline in the 10-year Treasury yield, and, second, the large increase in the exchange value of the dollar before liftoff.	61.0	999.0
201611	1068	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	These movements could, at least in part, be explained by the evolving policy stance of advanced economy central banks.	61.0	999.0
201611	1069	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	But market participants are still working to understand the implications of a tightening that to date is more reflected in exchange rates than interest rates for the reserve currency.	61.0	999.0
201611	1070	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period the dollar appreciated broadly, as shown in the middle-right panel, but only ¾ percent on a trade-weighted basis.	61.0	999.0
201611	1071	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Some special factors produced this modest trade-weighted appreciation.	61.0	999.0
201611	1072	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	For example, the Mexican peso appreciated 4 percent because of shifts in expectations for the outcome of the US presidential election, and the Russian ruble appreciated roughly 3 percent, in large part because of an 8 percent increase in oil prices.	61.0	999.0
201611	1073	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The increase in oil prices also contributed to a rise in measures of inflation compensation, as shown in the bottom-left panel, with the five-year, five-year- forward breakeven up about 20 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201611	1074	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	While acknowledging the disconnect with theory, market participants continue to emphasize that spot inflation affects far- forward inflation compensation, as long tenors offer the most liquidity and are thus traded most actively.	61.0	999.0
201611	1075	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Inflation compensation also increased in other G-4 countries, as shown in the decomposition of changes in 10-year nominal sovereign yields in the bottom-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201611	1076	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	While the increase in oil prices was reportedly the primary driver of these changes, investors also noted a perceived shift in the willingness of global monetary policymakers to tolerate higher levels of inflation.	61.0	999.0
201611	1077	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Market participants highlighted Chair Yellen’s discussion of the merits of running a “high-pressure economy,”	61.0	999.0
201611	1078	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Bank of England Governor Carney’s comments on his willingness to overshoot the inflation target, and the BOJ’s explicit commitment to overshoot its inflation target.	61.0	999.0
201611	1079	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Nevertheless, forward measures of inflation compensation remain well below target levels, except in the United Kingdom, and market participants remain focused on the efficacy and sustainability of monetary policy stances abroad, especially for the Bank of Japan and the ECB.	61.0	999.0
201611	1080	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The top-left panel of your second exhibit summarizes recent policy announcements from the Bank of Japan and the ECB.	61.0	999.0
201611	1081	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Overnight, the Bank of Japan announced no change in its stance but acknowledged that inflation would take longer to reach the target than previous forecasts.	61.0	999.0
201611	1082	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	In addition to announcing a commitment to overshoot its inflation target in September, the Bank of Japan introduced a yield-curve-control framework of targeting a 10-year nominal JGB yield of around 0 percent.	61.0	999.0
201611	1083	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Doubts remain over whether the Bank of Japan can reach its inflation target, and many suggest there is tension between the 10-year yield target and the Bank of Japan’s commitment to expand the monetary base by around ¥80 trillion per year—that is, both a price and quantity target for its asset purchases.	61.0	999.0
201611	1084	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	As part of its new regime, the Bank of Japan introduced a fixed-rate operation to purchase mainly on-the-run JGBs with no pre- specified limit.	61.0	999.0
201611	1085	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	However, this tool has yet to be used, as the 10-year rate has remained around zero.	61.0	999.0
201611	1086	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The ECB made no changes to its policy framework.	61.0	999.0
201611	1087	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	However, most market participants expect that at its next meeting in December, it will formally extend its asset purchase program past March 2017.	61.0	999.0
201611	1088	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	An extension would require adjustments to the program parameters to increase the universe of eligible assets for purchase.	61.0	999.0
201611	1089	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	These adjustments could include a removal of the minimum yield floor, an increase in the issue and issuer share limits, or a shift in the distribution of purchases away from the capital key.	61.0	999.0
201611	1090	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Outside of concerns over the effectiveness of monetary policy, a series of other medium- to long-term risks continue to garner attention.	61.0	999.0
201611	1091	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	In the United Kingdom, a considerable amount of uncertainty remains regarding Brexit—specifically, what the implications will be for the UK economy and political cohesion in Europe.	61.0	999.0
201611	1092	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period, comments from elements of the UK government increased the perceived likelihood of a hard exit from the European Union, which would significantly reduce economic linkages between the regions.	61.0	999.0
201611	1093	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	This increased likelihood of a so-called hard Brexit led to a broad-based depreciation of the pound, including 6 percent against the dollar, and contributed to the roughly 50 basis point widening in 10-year UK inflation breakevens, as shown in the top-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201611	1094	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	In addition, the British pound experienced a flash-type event during the early hours of the Asian trading session on October 7, depreciating abruptly by roughly 9 percent against the dollar before retracing in a matter of minutes.	61.0	999.0
201611	1095	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The event follows similar sharp moves in the dollar–yen and euro–dollar currency pairs last year and reinforces concerns some have about the robustness of liquidity in the world’s most heavily traded currency pairs.	61.0	999.0
201611	1096	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Despite uncertainty associated with Brexit, UK and euro-area economic data have been quite resilient in the wake of the referendum, at least thus far.	61.0	999.0
201611	1097	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Some investors speculate that if Brexit appears positive for the UK economy in the short- term, other European countries may face similar internal political upheavals.	61.0	999.0
201611	1098	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Market participants view the December constitutional amendment referendum in Italy and elections in Germany and France next year as key risk events for the euro area and broader European project.	61.0	999.0
201611	1099	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	On top of these political risks, investors had renewed concerns about the stability of the European financial sector.	61.0	999.0
201611	1100	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Over the period, market participants were focused on Deutsche Bank and its capital adequacy.	61.0	999.0
201611	1101	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The bank’s stock hit a multidecade low and its CDS widened well above its peers, as shown in the middle-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201611	1102	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Deutsche Bank has experienced deterioration in market participants’ assessment of its business model, recently highlighted by reports of hedge fund clients moving relationships away from it amid speculation over the level of a settlement with the US Department of Justice.	61.0	999.0
201611	1103	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	While there have been limited spillovers from Deutsche Bank thus far, the concerns over its capital adequacy are symptomatic of Europe’s broader banking- sector challenges.	61.0	999.0
201611	1104	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The middle-right panel shows that the price-to-tangible book ratio for Europe’s banking sector—a common valuation metric—remains well below ratios for US banks.	61.0	999.0
201611	1105	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	The low valuation reflects concerns about European banking business models amid low or negative interest rates and an oversaturation of banks in the region.	61.0	999.0
201611	1106	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Euro-area banking assets account for roughly 300 percent of GDP, compared with about 100 percent of GDP in the United States.	61.0	999.0
201611	1107	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Michael Palumbo and Steve Kamin will talk further about banking-sector valuations in their briefings.	61.0	999.0
201611	1108	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Outside of Europe, market participants remained attentive to China.	61.0	999.0
201611	1109	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-left panel, the RMB depreciated 1½ percent against the dollar over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201611	1110	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Meanwhile, the RMB declined about ½ percent on a trade- weighted basis.	61.0	999.0
201611	1111	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Market participants have become less focused on the short-term financial stability risks that China poses to the rest of the globe, largely because they seem more comfortable with the new exchange rate policy and the official sector’s general capacity to control short-term stress.	61.0	999.0
201611	1112	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	However, many view the continued depreciation of the RMB against the dollar as reflective of ongoing capital outflow pressures.	61.0	999.0
201611	1113	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Market participants suggest mainland Chinese investors are increasingly searching for offshore investment opportunities in anticipation of continued currency depreciation and the possibility of enhanced capital controls.	61.0	999.0
201611	1114	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	In the face of these capital outflow pressures, China’s foreign reserves have declined notably since 2014, as shown in the bottom-right panel, as substantial FX intervention has been used to slow the pace of depreciation.	61.0	999.0
201611	1115	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	While fears of another sharp devaluation in the near term are reportedly minimal, if the dollar were to appreciate in the coming months, many expect that capital outflows from China would accelerate and could ignite global financial market instability.	61.0	999.0
201611	1116	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Finally, investors are keenly focused on the Party Congress next fall when the extent of President Xi’s power is likely to be revealed.	61.0	999.0
201611	1117	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	This could have important implications for further financial liberalization in China.	61.0	999.0
201611	1118	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Lorie will continue the briefing.	61.0	999.0
201611	1119	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	In exhibits 3 and 4, I’ll cover money markets and Desk operations.	61.0	999.0
201611	1120	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	The implementation of SEC money fund reform continued to be the primary focus in money markets over the intermeeting period, with the compliance deadline for the reforms on October 14 passing without material disruption in funding markets.	61.0	999.0
201611	1121	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	However, the large reallocation of assets away from prime funds over the past year and the corresponding shift in liquidity management of the remaining prime fund assets have significantly affected the structure of some short-term markets and the cost of funding for some borrowers.	61.0	999.0
201611	1122	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel, while the overall size of the money fund industry has remained relatively stable, prime fund assets under management have fallen roughly $1 trillion over the past year.	61.0	999.0
201611	1123	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	This decline exceeded the average of expectations reported in earlier surveys taken in late May and early September.	61.0	999.0
201611	1124	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	The bulk of the outflows moved into government funds, with their assets under management reaching $2.1 trillion.	61.0	999.0
201611	1125	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As shown by the dashed lines in the panel, respondents to our most recent survey of money funds expect only a small portion of these flows to reverse.	61.0	999.0
201611	1126	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As shown by the blue line in the top-right panel, the weighted average maturity of prime institutional funds has declined significantly over the past year, though it has rebounded slightly since October 14, as prime fund managers’ uncertainty about additional investor withdrawals decreased.	61.0	999.0
201611	1127	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As shown by the blue dashed line, survey respondents expect the weighted-average maturity to continue to increase but remain well below historical levels.	61.0	999.0
201611	1128	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Prime funds responded to the decline in assets under management by reducing holdings of all major asset classes.	61.0	999.0
201611	1129	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-left panel, prime fund holdings of commercial paper and bank deposits fell more than $700 billion over the past year.	61.0	999.0
201611	1130	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As prime fund lending in unsecured term money markets declined, the banks borrowing in these term markets, which are largely foreign banking organizations, have had to pay higher rates.	61.0	999.0
201611	1131	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-right panel, the spreads of three-month CP, CD, and LIBOR rates over three-month OIS have widened around 30 basis points since late last year, and Desk survey respondents project the spread to narrow only modestly.	61.0	999.0
201611	1132	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Part of the decline in bank deposits was a sharp reduction in overnight Eurodollar volumes, which are shown in the bottom-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201611	1133	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Prime funds have historically accounted for more than 80 percent of lending in the overnight Eurodollar market.	61.0	999.0
201611	1134	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Importantly, overnight Eurodollar volumes could fall further still, if, as is expected by survey respondents, prime funds shift away from existing overnight investments to reextend their weighted-average maturities.	61.0	999.0
201611	1135	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Meanwhile, volumes in the overnight federal funds market, shown in light blue, have remained steady.	61.0	999.0
201611	1136	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	The decline in overnight Eurodollar volumes appears to have exerted only modest upward pressure on the overnight bank funding and effective federal funds rates.	61.0	999.0
201611	1137	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Both rates averaged 41 basis points over the intermeeting period, excluding month- ends, compared with 40 basis points last period.	61.0	999.0
201611	1138	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	One explanation for the relative lack of effect on these overnight rates is that many bank borrowers have been conducting these trades for arbitrage purposes and have little need for overnight funding at the margin.	61.0	999.0
201611	1139	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	They have therefore responded to the shift in supply of funds by reducing overnight borrowing rather than paying higher rates.	61.0	999.0
201611	1140	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	However, as shifts in the Eurodollar market have the potential to affect the federal funds market, we will continue to monitor these developments closely.	61.0	999.0
201611	1141	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	While the reallocation from prime to government funds has been substantial, government funds have been able to invest the new cash without major effects on related market rates.	61.0	999.0
201611	1142	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the bottom-right panel, most of the funds have been placed in repos and in US Treasury bills.	61.0	999.0
201611	1143	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	The smooth transition has been attributed, to a large degree, to the availability of repo investments, including the overnight RRP facility, as well as to sizable increases in the Treasury bill supply.	61.0	999.0
201611	1144	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	While the roughly $500 billion increase in net supply of US Treasury bills over the past year has helped absorb a large portion of the new demand, it’s important to note that bill supply is expected to decline significantly ahead of the next debt ceiling deadline in March.	61.0	999.0
201611	1145	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel of your final exhibit, some of the increase in repo investment has been in the overnight RRP facility, which, excluding quarter-end, averaged about $190 billion, $110 billion higher than last period’s average.	61.0	999.0
201611	1146	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Looking ahead, Desk survey respondents expect overnight RRP usage over the next year to remain somewhat higher than historical averages.	61.0	999.0
201611	1147	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants had noted some concern for potential stresses at the September quarter-end, due to the combination of money-fund reform and typical quarter-end balance sheet adjustments.	61.0	999.0
201611	1148	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Market functioning was orderly across money markets though, with changes in rates and volumes on the quarter-end date broadly similar to what we’ve observed in previous periods.	61.0	999.0
201611	1149	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	However, as you can see in the top-left panel, overnight RRP usage increased to a greater extent than typical in the days around quarter-end, largely the result of government funds temporarily placing reform-related inflows into the facility.	61.0	999.0
201611	1150	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Usage reached $413 billion on the quarter- end date, with nearly all of the increase coming from government funds.	61.0	999.0
201611	1151	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	In addition to the usual quarter-end dynamics, uncertainties related to both money market reform and the concerns related to Deutsche Bank reportedly put upward pressure on the FX swap basis.	61.0	999.0
201611	1152	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-right panel, the three-month basis of key US dollar currency pairs widened in the run-up to September quarter- end.	61.0	999.0
201611	1153	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Similarly to previous periods, we saw demand at recent ECB, and to a lesser extent, BOJ dollar auctions over quarter-end as well as sporadically over the weeks following, as shown in the middle-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201611	1154	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Demand has fallen at the most recent auctions, with banks demanding just over $1 billion from the ECB.	61.0	999.0
201611	1155	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Shifting to the SOMA portfolio, Treasury and agency MBS reinvestment operations continue to proceed smoothly.	61.0	999.0
201611	1156	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Similarly to previous cycles, reinvestment purchases of agency MBS were elevated, driven primarily by the ongoing low level of mortgage interest rates and resulting pickup in refinancing activity.	61.0	999.0
201611	1157	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	On the Desk’s policy surveys, the median expectation for the timing of a first change in the Committee’s reinvestment policy stands at 18 months ahead, or in the second quarter of 2018, as shown on the left-hand side of the middle-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201611	1158	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	The expected timing of the first change has moved out considerably since liftoff last year, when the median respondent expected a change to the reinvestment policy approximately 12 months forward, or around December of this year.	61.0	999.0
201611	1159	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Many respondents appear to view the timing of a change as linked to the level of the target federal funds rate, and, consequently, the expected timing has been pushed out, as expectations for the pace of policy rate normalization have become more gradual.	61.0	999.0
201611	1160	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the right-hand side of the panel, the median response for the level of the federal funds rate when a change in reinvestment policy first occurs has remained steady this year at 1.38 percent.	61.0	999.0
201611	1161	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Regarding the foreign portfolio, early last month the Desk began a three-month process of reinvesting maturing euro proceeds to match the new target asset allocation, which, as shown in the bottom-left panel, will result in an increase in cash and longer-term securities.	61.0	999.0
201611	1162	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	In addition to continued purchases of French and German sovereign debt, we are now buying Dutch sovereign securities, and these new transactions have proceeded smoothly.	61.0	999.0
201611	1163	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	For the yen portfolio, as we still receive an interest rate of zero on Bank of Japan deposits, we are leaving maturing proceeds and coupons from securities holdings on deposit with the Bank of Japan for the time being.	61.0	999.0
201611	1164	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Lastly, as we briefed the Committee at the December 2015 FOMC meeting and as discussed in a memo circulated last week, the staff has been exploring the production and publication of an overnight Treasury general collateral repo benchmark rate, in coordination with the Treasury Department’s Office of Financial Research.	61.0	999.0
201611	1165	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	This work is summarized in the bottom-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201611	1166	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	In pursuing the development of a Treasury GC repo rate, the staff had three main objectives: first, to improve the amount and quality of information on the repo market available to the public; second, to produce a rate aligned with the IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks that could be considered as a reference rate in financial contracts; and, third, to produce a rate that is correlated with other money market rates, resilient to market evolution, and could be considered as a potential backup monetary policy rate.	61.0	999.0
201611	1167	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	In order to achieve these goals, the staff is currently proposing the publication of three daily secured benchmark rates:  one comprising triparty transactions collected from Bank of New York Mellon; a second comprising the triparty transactions as well as GCF data collected from the DTCC; and a third comprising the triparty transactions, the GCF transactions, and the Fed’s repo-based open market operations.	61.0	999.0
201611	1168	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	All three rates would be calculated as a volume-weighted median.	61.0	999.0
201611	1169	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	A Desk statement scheduled for publication Friday will describe the three potential benchmark rates, the motivation and purpose for their publication, and the proposed calculation methodology.	61.0	999.0
201611	1170	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	A draft of that statement was included in the memo circulated before the meeting.	61.0	999.0
201611	1171	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	The staff also intends to release a Federal Register notice asking for public comment on the proposed rates.	61.0	999.0
201611	1172	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	To conclude, your appendix contains a summary of operational tests performed over the intermeeting period and those planned during the next period.	61.0	999.0
201611	1173	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you, that concludes my prepared remarks.	61.0	999.0
201611	1174	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Questions?	62.0	65.0
201611	1175	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	62.0	65.0
201611	1176	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	97.0
201611	1177	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I have two factual questions, and I think they are both on Lorie’s part of the presentation.	62.0	97.0
201611	1178	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Lorie, I infer from what you said that the roughly $1 trillion in prime fund investments that flowed out was not replaced euro-for-euro or dollar-for-dollar by the former recipients of those investments.	62.0	97.0
201611	1179	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But to the degree that there was replacement, what were the sources of the funding that they got that had formerly been provided by the prime funds?	62.0	97.0
201611	1180	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	If banks were getting investments from the money market funds, they may not have replaced dollar-for-dollar what they were getting, as you explained.	62.0	97.0
201611	1181	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But they obviously replaced some significant proportion of what they were getting.	62.0	97.0
201611	1182	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Who was making those investments?	62.0	97.0
201611	1183	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	One of the other things I noted was the widening in the FX basis swap, and I think some of the foreign banking organizations turned to the dollar swap market to obtain dollars by swapping out yen or euros or something into dollars, and that was putting pressure on that swap.	62.0	999.0
201611	1184	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	So I think they turned to that type of investment product as one alternative.	62.0	999.0
201611	1185	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I see.	62.0	97.0
201611	1186	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But does that mean that the balance sheets of the European banks were, on net, reduced, because they were just swapping assets rather than getting new funding?	62.0	97.0
201611	1187	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	I think, in the term markets, they tried to replace some of that.	62.0	999.0
201611	1188	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	I think, in the overnight markets, a lot of that was arbitrage trading taking place in Eurodollars, and I don’t think they replaced that.	62.0	999.0
201611	1189	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Okay, got it.	62.0	97.0
201611	1190	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	62.0	97.0
201611	1191	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	The second question is on the take-up of ON RRP.	62.0	97.0
201611	1192	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Again, I think I’m trying to read between the lines of what you did say, but I want to make sure I understand it.	62.0	97.0
201611	1193	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	The quarter-end take-up was substantially larger than the past couple of quarter-ends, which I found, when I first looked at the chart, a bit counterintuitive.	62.0	97.0
201611	1194	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I thought one of the reasons why the quarter-end spiked in the past was that the European banks that are operating under this system of “it’s the last day of the quarter that matters for your capital ratios” would want to reduce their balance sheets at that time.	62.0	97.0
201611	1195	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But that, presumably, should be less the case when the ON RRP market is dominated by government money market funds.	62.0	97.0
201611	1196	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	You said that some of these government money market funds had parked the funds in the ON RRP initially.	62.0	97.0
201611	1197	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But does that mean you expect that subsequent quarters will not have this kind of spike?	62.0	97.0
201611	1198	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	I think we’re still going to learn a lot from the quarter-ends, but I think we have also been seeing that type of balance sheet reduction take place in repo, particularly on the part of some of those European broker-dealers.	62.0	999.0
201611	1199	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	So some of these government funds are invested in repo, and those balance sheets reduce as well.	62.0	999.0
201611	1200	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Oh, I see.	62.0	97.0
201611	1201	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Those would still be affected, yes.	62.0	97.0
201611	1202	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	And I think the government funds are still having to do some replacement in the overnight RRP around quarter-end.	62.0	999.0
201611	1203	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	We just saw the same thing on month-end, that the government funds were a large part of the increase around the prime funds.	62.0	999.0
201611	1204	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	So that’s consistent with Lorie’s story.	62.0	999.0
201611	1205	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I know it’s hard to predict, but if one had to, would one predict an end- of-quarter spike that was somewhere between the spike at the end of September and those of the previous couple of quarters?	62.0	97.0
201611	1206	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	It’s hard to know.	62.0	999.0
201611	1207	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	I think year-end also has its own thing, so that could be larger.	62.0	999.0
201611	1208	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	What I was trying to emphasize was that we saw higher usage around just the quarter-end date—a couple of days before and a couple of days after.	62.0	999.0
201611	1209	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	And I think those were higher than typical because of the placement temporarily.	62.0	999.0
201611	1210	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	On the quarter-end itself, from what we’ve heard from market participants, it’s largely dominated by government now.	62.0	999.0
201611	1211	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	It still could spike— maybe not quite this high, but higher than it was before—from the repo balance sheets being used.	62.0	999.0
201611	1212	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Okay.	62.0	97.0
201611	1213	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	62.0	97.0
201611	1214	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	62.0	65.0
201611	1215	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Call on Eric first.	62.0	81.0
201611	1216	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201611	1217	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	62.0	65.0
201611	1218	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I wanted to follow up where Governor Tarullo just was.	62.0	90.0
201611	1219	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	In the earlier discussion, Governor Tarullo had made the comment about no longer using the prime money market funds for the overnight RRP.	62.0	90.0
201611	1220	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	And when I look at this chart, it highlights that they are not a particularly essential part of the overnight RRP.	62.0	90.0
201611	1221	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	What are the costs versus benefits of no longer using them?	62.0	90.0
201611	1222	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I can think of one benefit from a financial stability standpoint, which is that having less prime money market funds may be, overall, stabilizing over time, and getting them out of the overnight RRP might be an effective signal of that.	62.0	90.0
201611	1223	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	But are there countervailing costs that we ought to be thinking about when we consider who should have access to the overnight RRP?	62.0	90.0
201611	1224	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	I should note that of the remaining assets under management for prime, $131 billion of it is institutional, and I think that institutional amount is the part that we are more concerned would be flightier.	62.0	999.0
201611	1225	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	So it’s a fairly small number now.	62.0	999.0
201611	1226	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	I think it’s possible to consider either adding caps or eliminating prime funds as counterparties, and it’s something we should study over the coming months.	62.0	999.0
201611	1227	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	And I do think there is still this competitive arbitrage that may still be supporting interest rate control even at those low amounts.	62.0	999.0
201611	1228	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	But it’s also possible that they could seek access through government funds if they needed to use the overnight RRP as competitive pressure to the other rates they’re receiving in money markets.	62.0	999.0
201611	1229	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	So I think we should definitely look at it.	62.0	999.0
201611	1230	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	62.0	90.0
201611	1231	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	62.0	65.0
201611	1232	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	62.0	81.0
201611	1233	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	His question was more interesting than mine.	62.0	81.0
201611	1234	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	62.0	81.0
201611	1235	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	On the overnight bank funding rate, we understand that there is work going on to broaden its coverage to perhaps include bank deposits and stuff about where the Eurodollar funding is going.	62.0	81.0
201611	1236	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I was interested in the prospects for that:  Is that going to be easy?	62.0	81.0
201611	1237	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Are there impediments?	62.0	81.0
201611	1238	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Is it going to be hard?	62.0	81.0
201611	1239	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	As we said in chart 15, most of that decline we think is related to money fund reform.	62.0	999.0
201611	1240	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	We’re aware that about $20 billion to $30 billion of that total decline might be related to moving some deposits on shore.	62.0	999.0
201611	1241	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	It’s a small portion of the total amount, but it is something we’re studying.	62.0	999.0
201611	1242	2016-11-02	meeting	LOGAN	I think it would be quite complicated to get the instructions right, to capture the right amount of onshore deposits that we’d want for this type of reference rate, but it’s definitely something that we’re studying carefully right now.	62.0	999.0
201611	1243	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	This market is still much more diverse than the federal funds market in the sense that there are a lot more types of lenders rather than one type of lender for 95 percent of federal funds.	62.0	999.0
201611	1244	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Can I ask a follow-up?	62.0	81.0
201611	1245	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	What would be hard about it?	62.0	81.0
201611	1246	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I’m sort of thinking naively that $10 million on deposit is $10 million on deposit.	62.0	81.0
201611	1247	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	Jim.	62.0	999.0
201611	1248	2016-11-02	meeting	CLOUSE	One thing that’s hard about it is that in the one case in which we had Eurodollar deposits move from a Cayman Islands branch to a domestic office, the deposits at the domestic office were classified as “demand deposits.”	62.0	999.0
201611	1249	2016-11-02	meeting	CLOUSE	So we have a deposit that is a money market instrument, but it’s lumped in with many other types of retail deposits.	62.0	999.0
201611	1250	2016-11-02	meeting	CLOUSE	As a result, you have to figure out, as Lorie was noting, how to write the instructions to capture the types of deposits that you would not want to use for monetary policy purposes.	62.0	999.0
201611	1251	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Why wouldn’t you want to use them?	62.0	81.0
201611	1252	2016-11-02	meeting	CLOUSE	Well, many of the deposits are retail liquid deposits, and we have rates on all kinds of liquid deposits right now that we are not using for the purposes of the OBFR.	62.0	999.0
201611	1253	2016-11-02	meeting	CLOUSE	The purpose of the OBFR is to try to capture a money market rate, not a retail deposit rate, and the rates on demand deposits, as you know very well, are just very heavily dominated by factors such as the market power of banks in retail deposit markets.	62.0	999.0
201611	1254	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	62.0	81.0
201611	1255	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I’m just thinking that it was not necessarily the case that you want to limit it to capturing what was in Eurodollars, because obviously some wholesale funding goes on with deposit markets in the United States as well.	62.0	81.0
201611	1256	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Thanks for that explanation.	62.0	81.0
201611	1257	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	We are working on it.	62.0	999.0
201611	1258	2016-11-02	meeting	POTTER	We will try our best to capture wholesale transactions rather than retail.	62.0	999.0
201611	1259	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Sure.	62.0	81.0
201611	1260	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201611	1261	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Are there further questions?	62.0	65.0
201611	1262	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62.0	65.0
201611	1263	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201611	1264	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	If not, I need a motion to ratify domestic open market operations.	63.0	65.0
201611	1265	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So moved.	63.0	96.0
201611	1266	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	63.0	65.0
201611	1267	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	63.0	65.0
201611	1268	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Now we’re ready to move on to the “Economic and Financial Situation,” and let me call on Eric Engen to get us started.	11.0	65.0
201611	1269	2016-11-02	meeting	MADIGAN	If I could interrupt just before we get started, in the financial stability package of briefings, on exhibit 2, you’ll see that there’s a missing panel.	50.0	999.0
201611	1270	2016-11-02	meeting	MADIGAN	Corrected versions with the panel included are coming around right now.	50.0	999.0
201611	1271	2016-11-02	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you.	50.0	999.0
201611	1272	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201611	1273	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	I will be referring to the exhibits in the handout titled “Material for Briefing on the US Outlook.”	11.0	999.0
201611	1274	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	And I’m hoping that my exhibits are all included there in your packet.	11.0	999.0
201611	1275	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	As shown in panel 1 of the forecast summary exhibit, we continue to see real GDP growth picking up in the second half of this year from its subdued first-half pace.	11.0	999.0
201611	1276	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	However, we did trim our near-term outlook for GDP growth in the October Tealbook from our September projection.	11.0	999.0
201611	1277	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Most notably, the incoming data on consumer spending have been somewhat weaker than we were expecting, and we put through a modest downward revision to our near-term PCE forecast.	11.0	999.0
201611	1278	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Our medium- term projection of real GDP is also a bit lower than in September, primarily reflecting the effects of the somewhat higher paths of the dollar and crude oil prices in this forecast.	11.0	999.0
201611	1279	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Last Friday, after the Tealbook had closed, we received the BEA’s advance estimate of third-quarter GDP.	11.0	999.0
201611	1280	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	As shown by the blue dot, the BEA’s estimate came in a little above our Tealbook forecast, as stronger-than-expected net exports and inventory accumulation more than offset weaker-than-expected growth in consumer spending and business fixed investment.	11.0	999.0
201611	1281	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	With an essentially unrevised set of supply-side assumptions, the slightly weaker path of output in this forecast yields a projected path of the output gap—the black line in panel 2—that is a little lower than in September.	11.0	999.0
201611	1282	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	That said, we see the output gap as currently closed and continue to expect that aggregate demand will rise faster than aggregate supply over the next couple of years, leaving the level of real GDP more than 1 percent above potential by 2019.	11.0	999.0
201611	1283	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Turning to the labor market, the employment report for September indicated that job market conditions continued to improve and were broadly as we had expected.	11.0	999.0
201611	1284	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	As shown in panel 3, the projected unemployment rate still declines over the next couple of years, but this path is a bit higher than in our previous forecast, reflecting the slightly smaller positive output gap.	11.0	999.0
201611	1285	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Likewise, as indicated in panel 4, we have edged down our forecast of monthly payroll job gains over the medium term, with total payrolls expected to rise over the rest of this year and next year an average of around 170,000 jobs per month.	11.0	999.0
201611	1286	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	As projected real GDP growth slows, average payroll gains are expected to move down to 130,000 jobs per month in 2018 and to 100,000 jobs per month in 2019.	11.0	999.0
201611	1287	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	This 2019 forecast is consistent with a “neutral pace” of payroll gains, in which the unemployment rate is stable and the participation rate is declining in line with its trend.	11.0	999.0
201611	1288	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	The next two panels provide a closer look at developments in the labor market by plotting the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate for several broad racial and ethnic groups.	11.0	999.0
201611	1289	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	In line with the aggregate unemployment rate—the black line in panel 5—the unemployment rates for these various groups are now quite close to the levels seen just before the last recession.	11.0	999.0
201611	1290	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Similarly, the differentials in jobless rates between the groups are close to their pre-recession levels.	11.0	999.0
201611	1291	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Panel 6 plots participation rates, where I have focused on persons between the ages of 25 and 54 as a rough way of controlling for the differing age composition of these racial and ethnic groups.	11.0	999.0
201611	1292	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Here the hint of an upturn that we have recently seen in the aggregate participation rate—the black line in the figure—is easily seen in a corresponding rise in the participation rate for whites—the green line.	11.0	999.0
201611	1293	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	The measured participation rates for African Americans and Hispanics—the blue and red lines—are more volatile, but they appear to have been either moving sideways or also edging up recently.	11.0	999.0
201611	1294	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	The panels on the next page summarize the inflation outlook.	11.0	999.0
201611	1295	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Our near-term projection of headline PCE price inflation—panel 7—is somewhat higher than we had written down in September, largely reflecting an upward revision in the expected path of gasoline prices.	11.0	999.0
201611	1296	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	However, core PCE price inflation—panel 8—has come in a little higher than expected as well.	11.0	999.0
201611	1297	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Part of the upward surprise in core was in nonmarket components of the index.	11.0	999.0
201611	1298	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Although we typically take little signal for future inflation from quarter-to-quarter movements in these prices, our review of recent price trends suggests that nonmarket PCE price inflation has been running at a somewhat higher average pace than we had previously been assuming.	11.0	999.0
201611	1299	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	We therefore marked up our forecast of nonmarket inflation in coming quarters.	11.0	999.0
201611	1300	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Therefore, while we continue to expect that core PCE price inflation will move lower in the second half of this year—a pattern that is partially attributable to the presence of some residual seasonality in the published price data—the anticipated step-down is not as pronounced as in our September forecast.	11.0	999.0
201611	1301	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Beyond the near term, the inflation projection is very little different from our previous forecast.	11.0	999.0
201611	1302	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	In panels 7 and 8, I have again used blue dots to show the BEA’s advance third- quarter estimates for total and core PCE price inflation, which we received last Friday after the Tealbook closed.	11.0	999.0
201611	1303	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	As you can see, these estimates came in about as expected.	11.0	999.0
201611	1304	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	In addition, yesterday we received the BEA’s personal income release for September, which included monthly data for PCE prices.	11.0	999.0
201611	1305	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	The report implies that total PCE prices rose 1.2 percent over the 12 months ending in September, with a corresponding 12-month change for core prices of 1.7 percent.	11.0	999.0
201611	1306	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Looking ahead, we expect the 12-month change in the total PCE price index to step up to about 1.6 percent by the end of the year, while the 12-month change in core prices is projected to remain roughly flat around 1¾ percent in the coming months.	11.0	999.0
201611	1307	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	The next two panels reproduce the inflation monitor exhibits from the October Tealbook, which parse out the cumulative revisions that we have made to our projections of total and core PCE price inflation since December of last year, when you first raised the funds rate target 25 basis points.	11.0	999.0
201611	1308	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Total PCE price inflation, panel 9, is now projected to come in 0.3 percentage point higher this year as a result of the upward revisions to core inflation and energy prices that we made this round.	11.0	999.0
201611	1309	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	The revision to this year’s forecast of core inflation, which is parsed out in panel 10, is concentrated in the category labeled “other,” the yellow portion of the bar, and is not attributable to a change in any fundamentals but simply reflects the fact that we have been surprised by the data this year—both the surprisingly high core inflation readings early in the year and the upward revisions we made this round in response to the recent price data.	11.0	999.0
201611	1310	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	As shown in panel 11, the final October reading on the median measure of longer- run inflation expectations from the Michigan survey—the red line—was 2.4 percent, the lowest level on record for this series.	11.0	999.0
201611	1311	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	This measure can be quite noisy from month to month, but a smoothed trend of the series—the blue line—still shows a relatively steady decline over the past few years.	11.0	999.0
201611	1312	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	However, we continue to think that a portion of the decline in this expectations measure may be attributable to the low rates of headline inflation seen over the past few years.	11.0	999.0
201611	1313	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	When we try to control for the effect of changes in food and energy prices, the resulting estimate of the trend— the green line—doesn’t decline as much lately and remains within the historical 70 percent range for the series, the gray shaded area.	11.0	999.0
201611	1314	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Of course, this result does not rule out the possibility that longer-run inflation expectations have moved down somewhat.	11.0	999.0
201611	1315	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Thus, we continue to closely monitor these and other measures of inflation expectations and to assess the implications of their recent behavior for our inflation projection.	11.0	999.0
201611	1316	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Panel 12 shows three of the measures of labor compensation that we follow.	11.0	999.0
201611	1317	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	After the October Tealbook closed, we received the BLS’s estimate of the ECI for September, and we updated our estimate of compensation per hour with our translation of the third-quarter personal income data.	11.0	999.0
201611	1318	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Both measures are roughly what we had expected.	11.0	999.0
201611	1319	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	In general, nominal labor compensation growth has remained relatively modest, with just a hint of a pickup evident in some measures.	11.0	999.0
201611	1320	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Finally, the last page uses our October Tealbook projection to update a table that provides a high-level summary of some of the key pieces of information that will be available to you at the next couple of FOMC meetings.	11.0	999.0
201611	1321	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	I won’t walk you through the details, though I would note that at the December meeting, the gold-shaded portion, we will have two more months of labor market data but only one additional month of PCE price data—for October—beyond yesterday’s release for September.	11.0	999.0
201611	1322	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	In addition, the November CPI will not be released until the day after the December FOMC meeting concludes.	11.0	999.0
201611	1323	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Steve will now continue our presentation.	11.0	999.0
201611	1324	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Thank you, Eric.	11.0	999.0
201611	1325	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	I’ll be referring to the materials labeled “Materials for Briefing on the International Outlook.”	11.0	999.0
201611	1326	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	I’ll start by addressing the question that is doubtless on all of your minds right now:  Where is Wallonia, and why did it represent the greatest threat to globalization since Brexit?	11.0	999.0
201611	1327	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	As panel 1 shows, Wallonia is the French-speaking half of Belgium.	11.0	999.0
201611	1328	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	It has virtual veto power over foreign policy decisions made by Belgium and also, it turns out, the European Union, which would not sign its seven-years-in-the-making free trade agreement with Canada, known as CETA, unless all 28 of its member governments agreed.	11.0	999.0
201611	1329	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	So 3½ million Walloons, worried about the effect of CETA on their dairy industry, had been blocking the 500-million-person European Union from concluding its trade agreement with Canada.	11.0	999.0
201611	1330	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Wallonia finally caved last week after Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau canceled his trip to Brussels.	11.0	999.0
201611	1331	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	But to the UK and EU negotiators who will spend the next couple of years hammering out a new trade agreement, all I can say is: Good luck with that! As you may gather, I am stalling in an effort to avoid discussing our projection of foreign GDP, which is little revised from the September Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201611	1332	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	As can be seen in panel 2, foreign GDP growth plunged in the second quarter, reflecting transitory weakness in Canada and Mexico, major trading partners with large weights in our foreign GDP aggregate.	11.0	999.0
201611	1333	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	As we’d expected, third-quarter data suggest that activity in both countries rebounded, pushing total foreign growth back to 3 percent.	11.0	999.0
201611	1334	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	In the current quarter, GDP growth steps back down a bit as Canada’s and Mexico’s rebounds are completed and Brexit worries further slow the UK economy.	11.0	999.0
201611	1335	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Thereafter, the AFEs tread water while EME growth edges up as South America limps out of its persistent deep recession.	11.0	999.0
201611	1336	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Total foreign growth, the black line, barely budges.	11.0	999.0
201611	1337	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	We have been anticipating reaching the completion of the economic recovery abroad for eight years now, and it’s dispiriting to think that we’ve finally gotten here.	11.0	999.0
201611	1338	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	But we’ve marked down our estimate of potential economic growth abroad to 2½ percent, compared with over 3 percent before the Global Financial Crisis.	11.0	999.0
201611	1339	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Much of that reflects declines in productivity growth, demographic changes, and structural shifts that are unlikely to turn around anytime soon.	11.0	999.0
201611	1340	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	So, for now, our sense is that this is about as good as it’s going to get.	11.0	999.0
201611	1341	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	With foreign economic growth and interest rates looking likely to remain subdued for the foreseeable future, there are a host of uncertainties for the foreign outlook.	11.0	999.0
201611	1342	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	First, what will be the consequences of further divergence of monetary policies?	11.0	999.0
201611	1343	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	As indicated in panel 3 by the solid blue lines, the staff forecast has the federal funds rate rising to 3 percent by the end of 2019, while an average of AFE interest rates edges up to ½ percent.	11.0	999.0
201611	1344	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Market expectations, shown by the dashed red lines, are for much less divergence over the next three years, mainly because they expect less FOMC tightening.	11.0	999.0
201611	1345	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	In our baseline forecast of the dollar, shown in panel 4, we project that FOMC tightening surprises will contribute to a rise in the broad real dollar—that’s the black solid line—of some 5 percent over the forecast period.	11.0	999.0
201611	1346	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	This is based on our estimates that the broad dollar index rises 2.2 percent for each 100 basis points of surprise increase in the federal funds rate.	11.0	999.0
201611	1347	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	But this elasticity has varied significantly over time, and as illustrated by the alternative dollar scenario discussed in the Tealbook, which assumes a 7.5 percent dollar move for 100 basis points of interest rate surprise in part as emerging markets are roiled by FOMC tightening, a much stronger rise in the dollar is entirely possible.	11.0	999.0
201611	1348	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Besides its effect on the dollar, policy divergences may have implications for longer-term interest rates.	11.0	999.0
201611	1349	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Panel 5 shows that surprise increases in US 10-year yields around FOMC announcements tend to boost German government yields about half that amount.	11.0	999.0
201611	1350	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Such developments would further complicate the tasks of many foreign central banks trying to keep financial conditions highly accommodative.	11.0	999.0
201611	1351	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	By the same token, however, as shown in panel 6, foreign monetary policies tend to spill over to US yields.	11.0	999.0
201611	1352	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Our forecast of rising longer-term Treasury yields incorporates some restraint from low yields abroad, but the restraint could be larger than we anticipate.	11.0	999.0
201611	1353	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	If the consequences of policy divergence are one major source of uncertainty, another is prospects for foreign monetary policy itself, especially by the BOJ and ECB.	11.0	999.0
201611	1354	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	As indicated by the black lines in panels 7 and 8 on your next exhibit, both institutions are struggling with inflation rates that are near or below zero and well below their 2 percent targets.	11.0	999.0
201611	1355	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	This represents a clear rationale for further stimulus.	11.0	999.0
201611	1356	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	But at the same time, both institutions are concerned about the effects of further asset purchases on market functioning as well as the consequences of low interest rates for profitability in the financial sector.	11.0	999.0
201611	1357	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Finally, in both economies, the threat of recession or severe economic slack has receded:  Japanese unemployment, the red line in panel 7, has fallen to 3 percent, its lowest level in decades.	11.0	999.0
201611	1358	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Unemployment remains high in the euro area, at 10 percent, but is trending down as euro-area GDP expands at a lackluster 1½ percent pace.	11.0	999.0
201611	1359	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Under these circumstances, we see both the Bank of Japan and ECB maintaining their highly accommodative policies but not adding a great deal more stimulus.	11.0	999.0
201611	1360	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	On the second day of your September meeting, the Bank of Japan announced that it would target the 10-year yield near zero (a bid to keep the yield curve from flattening further and thus protect bank profits) and it would plan on overshooting its inflation target (a bid to get inflation expectations up).	11.0	999.0
201611	1361	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	In the event, market settings were little changed by the announcement.	11.0	999.0
201611	1362	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Investors likely figured that, in view of the troubles the Bank of Japan was having getting anywhere close to its inflation target, a commitment to overshoot it didn’t count for much.	11.0	999.0
201611	1363	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Meanwhile, the ECB is working through its own issues as it considers how to loosen its self-imposed constraints on asset purchases in order to continue those purchases beyond their notional ending point next March.	11.0	999.0
201611	1364	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	We expect the ECB to extend its program through later next year but to keep its deposit rate unchanged at negative 40 basis points.	11.0	999.0
201611	1365	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	All told, accommodative policy in both economies leads inflation to move up over the forecast period but remain shy of the 2 percent target.	11.0	999.0
201611	1366	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Are worries about the financial system reason enough for central banks to forgo further stimulus?	11.0	999.0
201611	1367	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Many concerns have been raised that monetary accommodation, especially when rates are near or below zero, may lower bank net interest margins both because deposit rates cannot be lowered as much as loan rates and because shallower yield curves reduce profits from maturity transformation.	11.0	999.0
201611	1368	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	One of our staff members, Nick Coleman, estimated the equation shown in panel 9 for European banks and confirmed that both declines in the level of short-term interest rates and shallower yield curves tend to lower net interest margins.	11.0	999.0
201611	1369	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	But he also found that the negative interest rates and very shallow yield curves prevailing in Europe explain only a small part of why these net interest margins are so low.	11.0	999.0
201611	1370	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Moreover, the low profitability of European banks likely reflects other factors besides low NIMS, such as excess capacity, failure to cut costs, low GDP growth, and legacy of nonperforming loans.	11.0	999.0
201611	1371	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, protecting the financial system is probably not a sufficient reason to forgo further stimulus.	11.0	999.0
201611	1372	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Instead, what Japan and especially Europe need are assertive measures to restore banking system health, including cutting costs, consolidation, and concerted capital raising.	11.0	999.0
201611	1373	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	The inadequate capital and profitability of Europe’s banks pose two threats to the outlook.	11.0	999.0
201611	1374	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	First, they may constrain lending, leading to lower investment and growth.	11.0	999.0
201611	1375	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Second, they raise the likelihood of bank failure.	11.0	999.0
201611	1376	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	The Tealbook features an alternative scenario in which the deterioration in the financial position of a large systemic bank in Europe requires its resolution.	11.0	999.0
201611	1377	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Obviously, it’s very difficult to predict the consequences of such an event.	11.0	999.0
201611	1378	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	In our scenario, the failure of the authorities to bail out the bank, concerns that other banks may have similar problems, and difficulties implementing the resolution process trigger disruptive spillovers and a retreat from risk in global financial markets.	11.0	999.0
201611	1379	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Europe falls back into recession, and—as shown in panels 10 through 12—the dollar appreciates, US GDP growth slows, and the federal funds rate rises more slowly.	11.0	999.0
201611	1380	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	While we are on the topic of financial stability, I’d like to briefly remind you of a new product developed by the International Finance Division that was presented in the QS financial stability report a couple of weeks ago: the International Financial Stability Matrix, or IFSM.	11.0	999.0
201611	1381	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	As shown in your final exhibit, the IFSM provides evaluations of financial vulnerability for 12 countries based on both quantitative data and judgmental assessments and, like the matrix for the US economy, is built up from assessments of various key sectors.	11.0	999.0
201611	1382	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	You may have noticed that I spoke about uncertainties in the foreign outlook for 10 minutes without discussing China.	11.0	999.0
201611	1383	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Indeed, China is one of the countries highlighted in our matrix as being especially vulnerable to financial disruptions, but describing its many issues would take at least another 10 minutes and would in any case cover pretty familiar ground.	11.0	999.0
201611	1384	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	I will cede that time to Michael, who will discuss US financial-stability issues.	11.0	999.0
201611	1385	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Thank you, Steve.	11.0	999.0
201611	1386	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I’m going to refer to the second handout titled “Material for Briefing on Financial Stability.”	11.0	999.0
201611	1387	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I’m going to review the staff’s latest assessment of vulnerabilities in the US financial system, drawing on the quarterly quantitative surveillance report (QS) you received two weeks ago.	11.0	999.0
201611	1388	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	As the report highlights, we continue to judge overall vulnerabilities in the financial system as moderate, due importantly to strong regulatory capital and liquidity positions among our largest banks, an absence of widespread valuation pressures across major asset categories, moderate growth of credit in the nonfinancial sector, and the effects of new money market fund rules that have lessened some key vulnerabilities associated with maturity and liquidity transformation.	11.0	999.0
201611	1389	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Turning to exhibit 1, the implementation of the new rules for prime money market funds has had a dramatic effect on the industry, as Lorie showed.	11.0	999.0
201611	1390	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	The first panel shows that money fund managers and investors have shifted about $1 trillion over the past year from prime funds, the red and blue lines, to government funds, in black.	11.0	999.0
201611	1391	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	As a result, the volume of confidence-sensitive, short-term private borrowing financed by money funds—the black line to the right—has plunged.	11.0	999.0
201611	1392	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	While this is good news for financial stability, we want to be attentive to how fund managers and borrowers adjust over time to the new environment.	11.0	999.0
201611	1393	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	For example, as shown by the red line, as government money fund assets have grown, these funds have substantially increased their holdings of Federal Home Loan Banks’ short-term paper.	11.0	999.0
201611	1394	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Moreover, the FHLBs appear to be increasing their own maturity transformation, as they have continued to lend at longer maturity to banks and nonbanks, including insurance companies.	11.0	999.0
201611	1395	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	In addition, financial institutions that used to rely on prime money funds appear to be turning more to funding secured by Treasury and agency collateral from government money funds, which is an increase in the funds’ counterparty risk.	11.0	999.0
201611	1396	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Finally, it is far too soon to know whether the current elevated level of government fund assets under management will ultimately migrate to other higher-yielding lending vehicles, which may be more run-prone than government funds.	11.0	999.0
201611	1397	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	So, for now, we lowered our assessment of the vulnerability to the financial system stemming from maturity and liquidity transformation by just half a notch to “between low and moderate” from just “moderate” in July.	11.0	999.0
201611	1398	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Turning to financial-sector leverage, we continue to assess this vulnerability as low.	11.0	999.0
201611	1399	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	As shown by the black line in the middle-left panel, the most systemically important US banks are currently holding high levels of regulatory capital.	11.0	999.0
201611	1400	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Their average Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio is now the same as that for smaller non- CCAR banks, the dotted blue line, and the largest banks currently meet their fully phased-in Basel III capital requirements, including their G-SIB surcharges.	11.0	999.0
201611	1401	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Large banks have been able to add capital in recent years even as net interest margins at the CCAR banks—the black line in the panel to the right—have been at very low levels, reflecting the effects of low short-term interest rates and a relatively flat yield curve.	11.0	999.0
201611	1402	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	A reasonable question is whether these banks have shifted their activities so as to be susceptible to rising rates in the future, but the answer seems to be “not particularly.”	11.0	999.0
201611	1403	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	The largest banks have been subject to such interest rate shocks in past stress tests, and the projected resulting losses have been manageable relative to capital—and much smaller than the losses generated under the severely adverse macroeconomic scenarios in the tests.	11.0	999.0
201611	1404	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	In terms of market indicators, premiums on credit default swaps for the largest domestic banks—plotted in the bottom-left panel—have remained relatively low in recent months, suggesting little concern among investors about the solvency of these firms.	11.0	999.0
201611	1405	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	In equity markets, as shown to the right, equity price-to-book ratios have edged down this year, on net—the purple bars are a touch below the green bars for each firm—and are below 1 for some of these firms, reflecting ongoing investor concerns regarding profitability in the context of low interest rates, slow economic growth, and more-stringent regulation.	11.0	999.0
201611	1406	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	The foreign banks shown in the figure have experienced noticeably larger drops in price-to-book this year, and the tenuous situation facing Deutsche Bank that Simon and Steve mentioned is reflected in its ratio of only 0.3.	11.0	999.0
201611	1407	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Spillovers from Deutsche Bank to the United States have been modest to date, consistent with our view that the financial system is resilient.	11.0	999.0
201611	1408	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	However, severe stress at the firm would be a stiffer test, and we included a box in the QS assessment describing some of the financial market channels through which the firm’s distress could be transmitted to the United States.	11.0	999.0
201611	1409	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	This QS round, we again spent a lot of time debating the assessment of systemic vulnerabilities associated with valuation pressures across a range of domestic asset markets.	11.0	999.0
201611	1410	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	The top panel of exhibit 2 tries to convey the dilemma.	11.0	999.0
201611	1411	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	The left-hand column of colors indicates that some key valuation metrics—the price-earnings ratio for S&P 500 firms, a “price index” for corporate bonds (reflecting the inverse of their yields), and the capitalization rate for recent commercial real estate transactions—all currently appear in the upper portions of their historical ranges, indicating “notable”	11.0	999.0
201611	1412	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	However, as shown in the right-hand column, relative to the unusually low level of Treasury yields, valuation pressures are “moderate”	11.0	999.0
201611	1413	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Thus, while the QS community generally agrees that low Treasury yields have continued to provide considerable support for risky asset prices, opinions are mixed about how resilient prices will prove to be.	11.0	999.0
201611	1414	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	In addition, we think a sharp rise in Treasury term premiums toward historic norms would present a significant risk to valuations.	11.0	999.0
201611	1415	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Our assessment framework for valuation pressures also includes monitoring nonprice developments, including lending standards and other indicators of investor risk appetite.	11.0	999.0
201611	1416	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	For corporate debt and commercial real estate mortgages, we see those as having moderated, on balance, over the past year or so.	11.0	999.0
201611	1417	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	In addition, exposures to credit losses from a drop in commercial real estate values are more significant for smaller banks than larger ones.	11.0	999.0
201611	1418	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	All told, we ended up maintaining our assessment that, on balance, vulnerabilities from valuation pressures are moderate at present.	11.0	999.0
201611	1419	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	The remainder of exhibit 2 plots a few indicators of vulnerabilities from nonfinancial-sector leverage, which we also gauge to be moderate overall.	11.0	999.0
201611	1420	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Debt in the private nonfinancial sector expanded a touch faster than GDP in the second quarter, so the credit-to-GDP ratio, the purple line, inched up but remained well below its estimated long-run trend, the black line.	11.0	999.0
201611	1421	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Not all of us view that trend as representing benign developments in the US financial system, however, so it is also worth noting that the current credit-to-GDP ratio is as high as it was in the middle of 2005.	11.0	999.0
201611	1422	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	In terms of the components of nonfinancial debt, aggregate leverage in the corporate sector has continued to be quite high by historical standards.	11.0	999.0
201611	1423	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	However, as shown in the bottom-left panel, growth over the past year in the total amount of higher-risk debt (junk bonds and leveraged loans, measured here in real terms) owed by US nonfinancial corporations has been slowing noticeably for several quarters and was unchanged, on net, over the past year.	11.0	999.0
201611	1424	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Moving to the right, you can see that the moderate aggregate rise in household debt has continued to accrue to borrowers with very high credit scores, the orange line.	11.0	999.0
201611	1425	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Exhibit 3 is the QS heat map, which, for the most part, resembles the version we presented in July.	11.0	999.0
201611	1426	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	The exception is the maturity and liquidity transformation category of vulnerabilities, toward the bottom on the right, which we changed from yellow to half-yellow and half-green to reflect the consequences of prime money market fund reform.	11.0	999.0
201611	1427	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Finally, the Board voted last week to affirm the current level of 0 percent for the countercyclical capital buffer for Advanced Approaches banks, based on the qualitative assessment that systemic vulnerabilities are not meaningfully greater than normal at present, so that large banking organizations do not need additional capacity to absorb above-normal losses at this stage of the credit cycle.	11.0	999.0
201611	1428	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Several quantitative guides based on nonfinancial credit growth, asset prices, and selected financial-sector indicators that we maintain currently prescribe a value of zero for the countercyclical capital buffer.	11.0	999.0
201611	1429	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201611	1430	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	That concludes our presentations, and we’ll be happy to take your questions.	11.0	999.0
201611	1431	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Questions?	12.0	65.0
201611	1432	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	12.0	65.0
201611	1433	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	12.0	81.0
201611	1434	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I’d like to hear more about this upgrade.	12.0	81.0
201611	1435	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	What caught my ear was the increase in maturity transformation activity at Federal Home Loan Banks.	12.0	81.0
201611	1436	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Let me just verify that they’re not off the table or out of bounds because they’re quasi-government.	12.0	81.0
201611	1437	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	If they’re risky, it counts as risk for you, right?	12.0	81.0
201611	1438	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201611	1439	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I want to verify that, but I also wanted to ask whether you have a quantitative sense that net or gross maturity transformation has decreased?	12.0	81.0
201611	1440	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	It seems like it has gone from some places to some other places.	12.0	81.0
201611	1441	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Right.	12.0	999.0
201611	1442	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	But is there is less of it now, or do you know that?	12.0	81.0
201611	1443	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I wouldn’t say there’s less of it.	12.0	999.0
201611	1444	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I’d say we think it’s in a little bit more stable, less run-prone form.	12.0	999.0
201611	1445	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	The FHLBs, I think, are a bit of an open question.	12.0	999.0
201611	1446	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	That’s another area in which I think we’re engaged in discussions among ourselves and in new research and analysis to think about, if that developed, how we would feel about it over time.	12.0	999.0
201611	1447	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Personally, I think anything that doubles in size over the course of a year is worth giving some attention to, and we are.	12.0	999.0
201611	1448	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	And I know we’ve got some decent understanding and knowledge about the FHLB systems and how they’re interacting with other money markets.	12.0	999.0
201611	1449	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	But I think that’s an area in which work is now going to be ongoing.	12.0	999.0
201611	1450	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	But they’re not off the table, so we wouldn’t say that because they’re agencies with implicit government support, we don’t need to consider their activities in the context of the system.	12.0	999.0
201611	1451	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Right.	12.0	81.0
201611	1452	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	So that’s definitely not true, and we’re just trying to see, compared with the highly run-prone prime money funds—which was, you know, from our perspective, a horrible vehicle for maturity transmission to take—whether this is a little bit of a better place to be.	12.0	999.0
201611	1453	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	But that’s why we’re half yellow and half green, because we haven’t really come down firmly on that particular question.	12.0	999.0
201611	1454	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Can I follow up?	12.0	81.0
201611	1455	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Is it like a dollar-for-dollar wash— why is it a better place?	12.0	81.0
201611	1456	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	The mutualization of the prime money funds with the rounded NAV provided a first-mover advantage for highly sophisticated investors that evidently were unwilling to take chances on receiving their money a few weeks after they thought they were promised it.	12.0	999.0
201611	1457	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	That was a very dangerous and run-prone vehicle.	12.0	999.0
201611	1458	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	12.0	81.0
201611	1459	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	The FHLBs themselves are doing a lot of maturity transformation and more than they were a year ago because they’ve been adding short-term debt, and they’ve not, as best we can tell, shortened their asset side at all, or at least not meaningfully.	12.0	999.0
201611	1460	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	So it’s worth looking at, but it is different.	12.0	999.0
201611	1461	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I don’t know a lot about the FHLBs, but they have the ability to take very senior positions in the debt structure of their lending.	12.0	999.0
201611	1462	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Again, that means that for better or worse, they do move up the seniority structure.	12.0	999.0
201611	1463	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	So in that sense, they should be, at high frequency, a little more stable.	12.0	999.0
201611	1464	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	But I think, as you might recall, FHLB discount notes’ spreads soared in the financial crisis.	12.0	999.0
201611	1465	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	They went to something like 150 basis points very quickly, and government money funds are not necessarily always going to be well positioned to absorb those price changes if they occurred.	12.0	999.0
201611	1466	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	If the confidence in the FHLBs were to erode, then I think it could be a problem.	12.0	999.0
201611	1467	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	12.0	81.0
201611	1468	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I remember learning suddenly about FHLBs when I discovered that the Atlanta one had a $50 billion credit to Countrywide and a total balance sheet of $120 billion.	12.0	81.0
201611	1469	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	That caught my attention.	12.0	81.0
201611	1470	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	How do you feel about the governance of these things?	12.0	81.0
201611	1471	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	How do you feel about their incentives and how well they’re run?	12.0	81.0
201611	1472	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	And do you monitor their investment side?	12.0	81.0
201611	1473	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Do you have visibility into that?	12.0	81.0
201611	1474	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I think we have visibility.	12.0	999.0
201611	1475	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	It’s a growth area for us.	12.0	999.0
201611	1476	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I’d say four months ago, the FHLBs were just entering the radar screen.	12.0	999.0
201611	1477	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Four months from now, I think we’ll be able to, with much more confidence than I could do today, have a more definitive stance about what the issues are and how we feel about them.	12.0	999.0
201611	1478	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	You wouldn’t criticize me for putting a little asterisk against this upgrade, would you?	12.0	81.0
201611	1479	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	No.	12.0	999.0
201611	1480	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Again, the half-green, half-yellow is signaling an asterisk from our perspective.	12.0	999.0
201611	1481	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	If I could make one comment.	12.0	999.0
201611	1482	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	On the decline in the black line, the CD + CP + ABCP, I think you asked about where that funding has gone.	12.0	999.0
201611	1483	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	We’re not able to totally quantify it.	12.0	999.0
201611	1484	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	Certainly, some of the European or Japanese institutions have termed out— gone a little bit longer.	12.0	999.0
201611	1485	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	We’ve heard them going to other asset managers or to insurance companies for slightly longer paper.	12.0	999.0
201611	1486	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	It makes us feel a little better.	12.0	999.0
201611	1487	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	That would be one.	12.0	999.0
201611	1488	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	In part, they are using the FX swap market, as Lorie said.	12.0	999.0
201611	1489	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	So that’s a plus, but we clearly wanted to show there are offsets here that need to be looked at.	12.0	999.0
201611	1490	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	We think, on net, it’s a little bit better.	12.0	999.0
201611	1491	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Right.	12.0	81.0
201611	1492	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	12.0	65.0
201611	1493	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Is yours a two-hander or one?	12.0	90.0
201611	1494	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I just wanted to talk about the Federal Home Loan Banks for a second.	12.0	96.0
201611	1495	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Okay.	12.0	90.0
201611	1496	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	We met with Federal Home Loan Bank of New York in a week or two ago.	12.0	96.0
201611	1497	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	A couple of points.	12.0	96.0
201611	1498	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	One, the incentive system is pretty good in the sense that they’re run as cooperatives.	12.0	96.0
201611	1499	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	They’re not trying to make profits for shareholders.	12.0	96.0
201611	1500	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So you don’t have the Fannie and Freddie issues that you saw for the GSEs.	12.0	96.0
201611	1501	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Two, their capital is sort of self- created.	12.0	96.0
201611	1502	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	As people take advances, it automatically creates capital.	12.0	96.0
201611	1503	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	And the point that Mike made about them being super senior is really important.	12.0	96.0
201611	1504	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	They’re collateralized loans, but they’re actually ahead of the FDIC in the capital stack.	12.0	96.0
201611	1505	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So if the depository were to fail, they actually have a claim senior to the FDIC.	12.0	96.0
201611	1506	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	They presumably could get in trouble from an asset quality issue, but they’re super senior.	12.0	96.0
201611	1507	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	They could get in trouble from an interest rate or transformation issue, but I think they’d have to take a lot of interest rate risk to really get into great difficulty.	12.0	96.0
201611	1508	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So I guess my bottom line after talking to them and looking at their performance during the financial crisis is, it could always be a risk, but it doesn’t seem to be something I’d put pretty high up on my list.	12.0	96.0
201611	1509	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s one person’s view.	12.0	96.0
201611	1510	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	12.0	65.0
201611	1511	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Mike, I also have a question for you.	12.0	90.0
201611	1512	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	It’s on exhibit 2, and I’m trying to figure out in my own mind how much comfort I should take from the change between the “level” and the “adjusted for Treasuries.”	12.0	90.0
201611	1513	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	One way to think of this chart is, if we were in a bubble world, the orange-red-red would more than likely be orange-red-red in the second column, and that would be a bubble.	12.0	90.0
201611	1514	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	If instead the mechanism was “reach-for-yield,” then it might look a lot like the column that you actually have there.	12.0	90.0
201611	1515	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	So I was trying to ask, in my own mind, is there an inherent reason why the risk of price reversal is greater in an asset-bubble world than it is for a “reach-for-yield” one, and should I take comfort in the difference between these two columns?	12.0	90.0
201611	1516	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Well, I can’t say that you shouldn’t.	12.0	999.0
201611	1517	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I think the reason we presented it this way is that, necessarily, you cannot feel better about the right-hand column than the left- hand column.	12.0	999.0
201611	1518	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	As a group, we frankly ended up splitting the difference.	12.0	999.0
201611	1519	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	And I tried to allude to that a little bit in my remarks, but I think we’re of two minds.	12.0	999.0
201611	1520	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	If you’re just somebody who’s discounting cash flows, and you’re using a risk-free rate and you don’t mind a rate that has a negative term premium in it to do your discounting, then, again, that’s the sense in which the right-hand column gives you more comfort, and I think neither of these have super predictive power for what the future price changes are going to be, but, on average, there’s probably a little bit of evidence for the right-hand side versus the left-hand side.	12.0	999.0
201611	1521	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	But I think it’s just a case in which we don’t know.	12.0	999.0
201611	1522	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	And I would say, to me, the low-term premiums as part of the calculus is part of the reason that I would be more inclined to hedge away from the right column toward the middle column.	12.0	999.0
201611	1523	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	That’s really an unusual pricing situation for these asset markets, and I guess I wouldn’t want to be too confident about how that would play out with a shock or even maybe with something that’s not even so shocking.	12.0	999.0
201611	1524	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	12.0	65.0
201611	1525	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Jeff—	12.0	102.0
201611	1526	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Yes, a two-hander.	12.0	81.0
201611	1527	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	He had a two-hander.	12.0	90.0
201611	1528	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Oh, did you want to—	12.0	81.0
201611	1529	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have a two-hander.	12.0	102.0
201611	1530	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	It’s a tie.	12.0	91.0
201611	1531	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	We tied.	12.0	102.0
201611	1532	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I think mine’s reasonably interesting.	12.0	81.0
201611	1533	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	12.0	81.0
201611	1534	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Is one way to interpret this that if you look at the valuations all by themselves of these risky assets, they look overvalued?	12.0	81.0
201611	1535	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	If you believe longer-term Treasury securities are at their right value, then these are not overvalued.	12.0	81.0
201611	1536	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	And so then my next question is, is that a fair description?	12.0	81.0
201611	1537	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	It’s certainly a description that you hear and that many people believe.	12.0	999.0
201611	1539	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	It seems implied by your colors, doesn’t it?	12.0	81.0
201611	1540	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I’m sure investors are taking many different approaches for valuations.	12.0	999.0
201611	1541	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Can you guess my next question?	12.0	81.0
201611	1542	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Are Treasury securiries overvalued?	12.0	81.0
201611	1543	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I don’t think Treasury securities are necessarily overvalued, but the term premium is out of its historical range.	12.0	999.0
201611	1544	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	So I have to think about it a little bit more as an empiricist rather than a theorist.	12.0	999.0
201611	1545	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Of course, a year ago we said it was out of its historical range, more likely to rise than to fall, and subsequently we’ve been marking down our forecast of what Treasury yields would do and what term premiums would do, because it seems like the world is different than the one we expected.	12.0	999.0
201611	1546	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	So that does set me up.	12.0	102.0
201611	1547	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	There are a couple of issues about whether Treasury securities are properly priced.	12.0	102.0
201611	1548	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	One issue is just this issue of very low r*.	12.0	102.0
201611	1549	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	How do you take that into account if you really think we’re in this world of very low rates?	12.0	102.0
201611	1550	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Then that obviously changes your view about what interest rates should be relative to the SEP.	12.0	102.0
201611	1551	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	But the second issue is the term premium itself.	12.0	102.0
201611	1552	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	In our earlier discussion today, I think we kind of came around to realizing that we’re probably going to have a big balance sheet for a long time despite our earlier public statements that we’re going to normalize the balance sheet.	12.0	102.0
201611	1553	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	So that could be an argument for a low term premium for a very long time.	12.0	102.0
201611	1554	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	In addition, I think there’s a growing recognition that the pricing of risk in the Treasury securities market has changed fundamentally from the 1980s and 1990s, when the risk you were protecting against was high inflation.	12.0	102.0
201611	1555	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	The market seems to be, at least based on what I’ve seen, pricing the downside scenario in terms of what you’re really worried about.	12.0	102.0
201611	1556	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And that is just going to push the term premium associated with a 10-year Treasury security from a high positive value to a potentially very low positive value or even a negative value.	12.0	102.0
201611	1557	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Getting back to President Lacker’s question:  How do you take into account both a very low r* and, probably because of a low r*, a shift in the equilibrium term premium when you do this kind of assessment?	12.0	102.0
201611	1558	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	As best we can.	12.0	999.0
201611	1559	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay.	12.0	102.0
201611	1560	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	We’re thinking about things very much the way that you are.	12.0	999.0
201611	1561	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	As I mentioned a second ago, over time, in the Tealbook baseline outlook, we’ve both lowered not just the r* in the forecast—which we’ve taken down, as you know, quite a bit—but we’ve also materially lowered where we think the term premium will end up over the long term, though it’s still well above where it is now.	12.0	999.0
201611	1562	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	We’ve also flattened out the trajectory.	12.0	999.0
201611	1563	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	We’ve elongated the time it will take for today’s term premium to migrate toward whatever we think its long-run equilibrium would be.	12.0	999.0
201611	1564	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	We did that all in the context of recognizing that the pricing is different, that the global equilibrium rates around the world are lower, and that’s going to have very persistent consequences.	12.0	999.0
201611	1565	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	So we’ve factored that in as best we can.	12.0	999.0
201611	1566	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes, but by implication, if I do the subtraction of the colors—if I can do this in my head—the Treasury securities are red, right?	12.0	102.0
201611	1567	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Well, maybe.	12.0	999.0
201611	1568	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	[Laughter]	12.0	999.0
201611	1569	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I wouldn’t necessarily put it that way.	12.0	999.0
201611	1570	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	It depends.	12.0	999.0
201611	1571	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I think we have people on the team who would say that longer-term Treasury yields could stay where they are today and stock prices could fall 15 percent over the next seven months if the economy evolves the way we think it will—if there are no surprises—just because the valuations that are implicit in today’s prices will prove to be unsustainable by themselves.	12.0	999.0
201611	1572	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Again, that’s not everybody on the team, it’s the position of people I respect.	12.0	999.0
201611	1573	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I don’t think it’s a ridiculous place to be, I guess.	12.0	999.0
201611	1574	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	It’s not like it’s only those people.	12.0	999.0
201611	1575	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	You read about that in other spheres as well.	12.0	999.0
201611	1576	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thomas.	12.0	65.0
201611	1577	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Perhaps merely to add the detail that, of course, we think that part of the low term premium is thanks to the large asset holdings.	12.0	999.0
201611	1578	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Right now, for example, the Kim-Wright model, which is informed by survey expectations as best as we can tell, is at about negative 50 basis points.	12.0	999.0
201611	1579	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	We think that the current effect of the balance sheet is about in the range of 85 basis points.	12.0	999.0
201611	1580	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	That would get you to an adjusted level of about 35 basis points.	12.0	999.0
201611	1581	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Certainly, that’s still low by historical standards, but as you point out, it might reflect a different perception of the hedging properties of long-term nominal safe assets.	12.0	999.0
201611	1582	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	12.0	65.0
201611	1583	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Just two questions.	12.0	108.0
201611	1584	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	First, why do you show the level of debt on a ratio scale?	12.0	108.0
201611	1585	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	What happens if you show debt service?	12.0	108.0
201611	1586	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Doesn’t everything look very different?	12.0	108.0
201611	1587	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Yes, debt service does look very different.	12.0	999.0
201611	1588	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	The debt service ratio for households is basically lower than it was between 1980 and 2013.	12.0	999.0
201611	1589	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I guess one reason we do it this way is that in 2006, the debt service ratio was also not looking particularly high, and so we think that—especially when you think about it in terms of originations—it’s also useful to track just the overall positions of households.	12.0	999.0
201611	1590	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Again, we do both, typically.	12.0	999.0
201611	1591	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	12.0	108.0
201611	1592	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	You said it’s also useful to track the overall positions, but the ones with the income are not shown.	12.0	108.0
201611	1593	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Right.	12.0	999.0
201611	1594	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	It’s hard for us to do income, because the data that we’re showing here are the credit-records data.	12.0	999.0
201611	1595	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	And, unfortunately, we get to see a lot about debt, but we don’t get to see much about income.	12.0	999.0
201611	1596	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	In these data, we don’t even get to see much about payments or risk—only a little bit about payments.	12.0	999.0
201611	1597	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	But the point I was trying to make here is a different one, which is that even insofar as we do see real increases in debt owed by households, it’s accruing to these households who have, in the data, virtually no delinquency rates or default rates.	12.0	999.0
201611	1598	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	It’s just a way to characterize, again, the overall likelihood of the sustainability of those balance sheet positions.	12.0	999.0
201611	1599	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	That’s the only thing I was trying to do there.	12.0	999.0
201611	1600	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And the second question:  Was it intentional that you showed “adjusted for Treasuries” in the national colors of Brazil?	12.0	108.0
201611	1601	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	12.0	108.0
201611	1602	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	No.	12.0	999.0
201611	1603	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	If you look at the legend, which is in probably a 4.5-point font beneath that table, you can see what we were trying to do is gauge where they were located in the historical distribution.	12.0	999.0
201611	1604	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	He’s just giving you a hard time.	12.0	97.0
201611	1605	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I know.	12.0	999.0
201611	1606	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	12.0	65.0
201611	1607	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I’d like to return to the top of exhibit 2 and the color chart and ask about the equity ratio valuation.	12.0	88.0
201611	1608	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I’ve been reading recently about growing concern over the changing structure of equity markets with exchange-traded funds and other aggregations of equities that are perhaps more vulnerable to runs.	12.0	88.0
201611	1609	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Two things are going on:  Exchange-traded funds are growing and the, let’s say, in the battle between passive and active management, passive is winning.	12.0	88.0
201611	1610	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Both suggest that in a really bad market, very disruptive runs could occur.	12.0	88.0
201611	1611	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Is that factored into your valuation here or is this just a P/E ratio effect?	12.0	88.0
201611	1612	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Here, this is just a P/E ratio.	12.0	999.0
201611	1613	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Now, again, when we’re thinking more broadly about the valuation pressures in the domestic equity markets, we do take a much broader view, and we certainly would entertain the possibility that changes in the microstructure of the markets were either reducing or adding to pressures beyond what we would see in our traditional or historical metric.	12.0	999.0
201611	1614	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	So that’s part of the perspective that we take.	12.0	999.0
201611	1615	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	I think, though, it’s fair to say that in the US broad stock markets today, I haven’t heard people really emphasizing that the active versus the passive investors are particularly causing trouble evaluating the resilience of prices.	12.0	999.0
201611	1616	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	And I guess I don’t know much about the exchange- traded funds, but I have colleagues that do.	12.0	999.0
201611	1617	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Some people like the exchange traded fund as an instrument.	12.0	999.0
201611	1618	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	It depends on how these—what are the dealers called in the ETFs?	12.0	999.0
201611	1619	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	“Authorized participants.”	12.0	999.0
201611	1620	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	Authorized participants.	12.0	999.0
201611	1621	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	It depends on how they’re going to behave in a period of stress, but in principle, investors can’t just pull their money out of those funds the way they can out of an open-ended long-term mutual fund.	12.0	999.0
201611	1622	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	So there’s a sense in which they may have more robustness than the long-term mutual fund model.	12.0	999.0
201611	1623	2016-11-02	meeting	PALUMBO	We’ve thought about that a lot in the context of loan funds and bond funds, but it could even be true in equity funds in principle.	12.0	999.0
201611	1624	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	12.0	65.0
201611	1625	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	91.0
201611	1626	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Is it okay to ask questions on the economic situation?	12.0	91.0
201611	1627	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	12.0	91.0
201611	1628	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Go ahead.	12.0	65.0
201611	1629	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	It’s a question for Eric about inflation expectations on exhibit 11.	12.0	91.0
201611	1630	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	We had taken note of the fact that, as you pointed out, the Michigan survey had dropped down to a historical low for inflation expectations, and then you did the trend-augmented calculation, taking into account food and energy inflation.	12.0	91.0
201611	1631	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	So I was staring at that for a little while, and I guess I have a question and an observation.	12.0	91.0
201611	1632	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	My question is whether or not the shaded region corresponds to the same type of uncertainty as it does for the other data.	12.0	91.0
201611	1633	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	The observation is, as I stared at it, that the other times the green line had sort of touched down on the bottom were both periods when the FOMC was either adding a lot of accommodation or had just recently added accommodation.	12.0	91.0
201611	1634	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	One was August 2003, when we did forward guidance by saying it’ll be a considerable period of time before we increase the funds rate.	12.0	91.0
201611	1635	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	The other one looks like it was the fall of 2012 when we started the open-ended asset purchases, QE3.	12.0	91.0
201611	1636	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	So as we’re on the downward slope here and perhaps haven’t touched bottom on that green line, I wonder if the circumstances aren’t a little bit different than just “it’s within the normal historical experience.”	12.0	91.0
201611	1637	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201611	1638	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	The gray shaded region is the 70 percent range for just the historical observations, unadjusted for anything, and so the green line being in that range is just an observation.	12.0	999.0
201611	1639	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	All the green line controls for, other than estimating a simple trend, is essentially movements in food and energy prices both contemporaneous and 12 months previous and 24 months previous.	12.0	999.0
201611	1640	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	That’s the lag structure.	12.0	999.0
201611	1641	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	And the estimated cofficients on these variables are all significant.	12.0	999.0
201611	1642	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	The coefficients on both the contemporaneous and the 12-month lags are of roughly equal size.	12.0	999.0
201611	1643	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	So that lag structure does seem to matter.	12.0	999.0
201611	1644	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	You raise a possibility that there may be something else in there.	12.0	999.0
201611	1645	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	We haven’t looked at that, but at least sort of walking through some of the history could be something we could consider to see if it does further explain the trend.	12.0	999.0
201611	1646	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Now, it’s also going to be the case that, looking ahead, if we do get the rise in food and energy prices that’s in the forecast, this measure should be kind of bottoming out and then moving up, if that’s what’s going on here.	12.0	999.0
201611	1647	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Right.	12.0	91.0
201611	1648	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	The way you did the presentation, I might have had the takeaway that looks like this is not that unusual, but recognizing those two episodes, I wonder about that.	12.0	91.0
201611	1649	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Sounds like it’s up for grabs, at least.	12.0	91.0
201611	1650	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Yes, point well taken.	12.0	999.0
201611	1651	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Any other questions?	12.0	65.0
201611	1652	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	12.0	65.0
201611	1653	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12.0	65.0
201611	1654	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	We now have an opportunity for people to comment, if they’d like, on financial-stability issues, and a few of you have indicated your desire to do so.	94.0	65.0
201611	1655	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s start with President Rosengren.	94.0	65.0
201611	1656	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	90.0
201611	1657	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	My comments on financial stability usually highlight increased risks to financial stability.	94.0	90.0
201611	1658	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Today I wanted to highlight that one risk associated with the shadow banking system has clearly declined, as was mentioned in the Tealbook and the presentations we just heard.	94.0	90.0
201611	1659	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	The recent trillion-dollar movement out of prime money market funds into government-only money market funds represents a relatively rare instance in which we have been successful in intentionally reducing risk in the shadow banking system.	94.0	90.0
201611	1660	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Prime money market funds were a source of great instability during the financial crisis.	94.0	90.0
201611	1661	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	The promise of a fixed NAV on a fund for which investments for a significant credit duration risk turned out to be a promise they could not necessarily keep, especially in the wake of Lehman’s failure.	94.0	90.0
201611	1662	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	A very substantial movement into government funds as a result of regulatory changes to prime money market funds should give us some hope that, with sufficient perseverance, we will be able to identify other significant areas of instability in the shadow banking system, discuss them publicly, and get them changed.	94.0	90.0
201611	1663	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	94.0	90.0
201611	1664	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	94.0	65.0
201611	1665	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I just want to make a few comments on one of the risks that’s already been highlighted by several different people on the staff, which is Deutsche Bank.	94.0	96.0
201611	1666	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	As I see it, there are multiple problems here:  a bad business model, poor execution, undercapitalization, and multiple legal cases that will result in large fines that will certainly put even greater pressure on the bank’s capital.	94.0	96.0
201611	1667	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	And the situation is made worse because of the lack of visibility about when the legal cases will be settled and the amount of fines that will ultimately be assessed.	94.0	96.0
201611	1668	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The firm is apparently waiting to settle its RMBS case with the Department of Justice before unveiling its new strategy, which apparently is going to be to shrink to a smaller, more reasonable footprint supplemented by a large equity capital raise.	94.0	96.0
201611	1669	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	But the problem is that, in the meantime, the franchise is eroding, which undercuts the firm’s future profitability prospects.	94.0	96.0
201611	1670	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	This also makes it more difficult for the firm to raise the necessary equity to shore up its balance sheet.	94.0	96.0
201611	1671	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I think someone remarked that it’s selling at 0.3 times book value currently.	94.0	96.0
201611	1672	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So the firm is very fragile, and even though it announced its earnings last week and nothing really bad happened, the risk of an abrupt loss of confidence seems to still be very, very high.	94.0	96.0
201611	1673	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I remember the summer of 2008 when there were weeks and months when there were firms that looked okay.	94.0	96.0
201611	1674	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	That didn’t mean that they turned out to be okay.	94.0	96.0
201611	1675	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, one might argue that the German government will not let Deutsche Bank fail because it is their largest bank, and that could be correct, but I think it does ignore two constraints, one political and one legal.	94.0	96.0
201611	1676	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The political constraint is that a German government bailout of Deutsche Bank would be very unpopular politically, and that’s particularly relevant in the current environment, in light of the upcoming German election and the fact that Angela Merkel’s popularity is already somewhat diminished.	94.0	96.0
201611	1677	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The German government has said they will not do a recap, but it’s unclear what their appetite would be if there was actually no alternative.	94.0	96.0
201611	1678	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The legal constraint is the European Union’s bank competition policy, which sharply constrains the ability of national governments to recapitalize, as opposed to resolve, their troubled institutions.	94.0	96.0
201611	1679	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	In a resolution, bank debt has to be built in, which means large losses for investors and a heightened risk of contagion.	94.0	96.0
201611	1680	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So they’re in a difficult place.	94.0	96.0
201611	1681	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Although the financial system is a lot stronger today than it was in 2008, I believe that the failure of a firm the size and complexity of Deutsche Bank would have significant consequences for the stability of the global financial system.	94.0	96.0
201611	1682	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Deutsche Bank has a huge derivatives book, and a significant portion of this book is still cleared on a bilateral rather than centrally settled basis.	94.0	96.0
201611	1683	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Moreover, the risk of failure really isn’t priced in to any significant degree, although Deutsche Bank’s five-year CDS is elevated relative to other institutions.	94.0	96.0
201611	1684	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s only trading in a range of 200 to 250 basis points, which is far lower than a number of institutions that actually did not fail during the 2008 financial crisis.	94.0	96.0
201611	1685	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think that if Deutsche Bank did fail, it would be a pretty big surprise, and so the shock would be even more intensified.	94.0	96.0
201611	1686	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I also don’t think it would be viewed as a purely idiosyncratic event, because there are other firms that are challenged in terms of profitability, business model, and uncertain legal liabilities, including banks like Credit Suisse and Barclays.	94.0	96.0
201611	1687	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, on the positive side, I think those firms have some core businesses that are well functioning and actually do have fundamentally stronger franchises, but I have little doubt that if Deutsche Bank failed, it would put significant pressure on several other major banking institutions.	94.0	96.0
201611	1688	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Of course, what’s frustrating about all of this is, what do we do about it sitting here in the United States?	94.0	96.0
201611	1689	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, there’s not much we can do but to ensure that Deutsche Bank has sufficient liquidity in the United States so there is no late-day funding shortfall, and to press Deutsche Bank and the ECB, which is its supervisor, to have Deutsche Bank settle its RMBS case with the Department of Justice as swiftly as possible.	94.0	96.0
201611	1690	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Settlement of the case, I think, would be important, because it would encourage Deutsche Bank to then go forward and announce its new strategy, quickly followed by a raising of capital.	94.0	96.0
201611	1691	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think if those two things could happen, we might be in a somewhat better place.	94.0	96.0
201611	1692	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	But where we’re sitting today is not something that makes me very confident.	94.0	96.0
201611	1693	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	94.0	96.0
201611	1694	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201611	1695	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	94.0	65.0
201611	1696	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks.	94.0	108.0
201611	1697	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Could I ask a question?	94.0	110.0
201611	1698	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	There is a two-hander there.	94.0	108.0
201611	1699	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Oh.	94.0	65.0
201611	1700	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, President Kaplan.	94.0	65.0
201611	1701	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	This discussion begs the obvious question, which I guess I’ll just ask.	94.0	110.0
201611	1702	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I am familiar with the bank, and it does have profitability.	94.0	110.0
201611	1703	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	And, although there are other issues, the accelerant to this is a $14 billion fine for a $13 billion-less-market-cash company.	94.0	110.0
201611	1704	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	That is just the Department of Justice’s opening offer.	94.0	96.0
201611	1705	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	That doesn’t mean that’s where it will end up.	94.0	96.0
201611	1706	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	But it has created substantial instability because of the uncertainty about where they are ultimately going to settle.	94.0	110.0
201611	1707	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	What I’m asking is—although I guess you may not agree with that premise—if that were true, what could we do?	94.0	110.0
201611	1708	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Is there something that should be discussed so we don’t manufacture a crisis?	94.0	110.0
201611	1709	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	No, I don’t think there is anything for us to do, in that sense.	94.0	96.0
201611	1710	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The Department of Justice has to do what it has to do, and I don’t think there is any role for us.	94.0	96.0
201611	1711	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Okay.	94.0	110.0
201611	1712	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	There is the case, then there is the amount of the fine, and then there is the way it is being negotiated.	94.0	110.0
201611	1713	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Even though the ultimate negotiation may ultimately wind up being a far smaller number, the headline will do a lot of damage.	94.0	110.0
201611	1714	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The problem here is lack of clarity.	94.0	96.0
201611	1715	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The lack of clarity means that people have no visibility about when it will be resolved.	94.0	96.0
201611	1716	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	And in the meantime, the franchise value of this company is eroding because of the wide level of uncertainty .	94.0	96.0
201611	1717	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I know.	94.0	110.0
201611	1718	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I watch it every day.	94.0	110.0
201611	1719	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	So you can argue that there is some sort of combination of size of settlement and speed of settlement that are both probably relevant here.	94.0	110.0
201611	1720	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Nellie.	94.0	65.0
201611	1721	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	I just wanted to add that Deutsche Bank has been an ongoing issue for most of this year.	94.0	999.0
201611	1722	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	It wasn’t just this settlement.	94.0	999.0
201611	1723	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	I think its stock price fell about 50 percent in January, and it has not recovered.	94.0	999.0
201611	1724	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	So it has got a thin capital cushion.	94.0	999.0
201611	1725	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	It is not only the DOJ.	94.0	999.0
201611	1726	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	And there are other cases besides the current RMBS case that are relevant here, which makes it even more complicated.	94.0	96.0
201611	1727	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	94.0	65.0
201611	1728	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	108.0
201611	1729	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The quantity of QS that has been presented by the Financial Stability Division is really very good, and it raises a lot of questions and answers a lot of questions.	94.0	108.0
201611	1730	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Let me say a few words first about the IFSM, the International Financial Stability Matrix, which extends the assessment of the Financial Stability Division to 12 foreign countries and produces a very colorful quilt for us to look at.	94.0	108.0
201611	1731	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	It is extremely ambitious.	94.0	108.0
201611	1732	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	It is a lot of work, but there is one big reason you want to know about other countries, and that is how the system as a whole will work and what the dynamics of the system will be.	94.0	108.0
201611	1733	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And that’s a whole other level of difficulty in looking at this.	94.0	108.0
201611	1734	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And you might ask at some point whether you actually need to have 13 countries in this system of equations or whether you can manage with fewer.	94.0	108.0
201611	1735	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	But it’s a very ambitious, very bold, and, at this stage, very interesting piece of work.	94.0	108.0
201611	1736	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Congratulations.	94.0	108.0
201611	1737	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Then the first part is the regular QS of the US financial system, which starts with Deutsche Bank.	94.0	108.0
201611	1738	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	So I am going to say a few things related to what Vice Chairman Dudley just said, which is, so far, nothing seems to be happening in the standoff between the Department of Justice and Deutsche Bank.	94.0	108.0
201611	1739	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I suppose you could call this a phony war, but I also suppose that actually there is a lot going on in the background.	94.0	108.0
201611	1740	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	One of the things we do know is that if the dynamics that the staff has looked at continue, then Deutsche Bank would find itself, after eight weeks, with very little left in the way of liquidity.	94.0	108.0
201611	1741	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Well, what happens then?	94.0	108.0
201611	1742	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Either Deutsche Bank is rescued from bankruptcy or from the hands of the regulators in some fashion, or the international system—and that means especially the European financial system—faces a very difficult situation.	94.0	108.0
201611	1743	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Now, I don’t know the inside details to the extent that Vice Chairman Dudley probably does, but it’s standard in games of chicken—and this is one of them—that there is a lengthy period of confrontation, but they end.	94.0	108.0
201611	1744	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	How will it end?	94.0	108.0
201611	1745	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We don’t know.	94.0	108.0
201611	1746	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We are dealing with a German government that was thought to be playing a game of chicken with Greece and didn’t actually blink very much in that entire process.	94.0	108.0
201611	1747	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And it is trying to set an example for the rest of Europe, but it is not going to want Deutsche Bank to go broke.	94.0	108.0
201611	1748	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	So it is going to be a very interesting and a very closely run thing.	94.0	108.0
201611	1749	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And one of the troubles with a game of chicken is that, occasionally, neither side withdraws, and then you get a crash.	94.0	108.0
201611	1750	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And I don’t know, and don’t think any of us can know, what is going to happen.	94.0	108.0
201611	1751	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	There is a very good box later in the paper on how Deutsche Bank’s problems would affect us, and it ends on a sober note, which I think actually is the note that was read to us earlier, which says that holding bank capitalization and the intensity of regulation constant, all these factors—and I will tell you what they are in a moment—should make the equity and subordinated debt of a large bank appear substantially riskier now than before the crisis.	94.0	108.0
201611	1752	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	What are these factors?	94.0	108.0
201611	1753	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Well, we now know that house prices can drop at the national level, and they did drop 25 percent.	94.0	108.0
201611	1754	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We also know that financial crises can happen more than once.	94.0	108.0
201611	1755	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And, finally—this is a very delicate way that you put it—the support for too-big-to-fail policies might have weakened considerably.	94.0	108.0
201611	1756	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	So it is a different situation, and much of history is not entirely relevant.	94.0	108.0
201611	1757	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And I don’t think we know very much about what is going to happen, and we probably all have the feeling that President Kaplan has, but we don’t interfere in the Department of Justice, and we hope they don’t interfere here, and that’s it.	94.0	108.0
201611	1758	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The matrix on exhibit 3, which we have talked about a little bit, shows considerable stability.	94.0	108.0
201611	1759	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	In the last year, there have been only two changes in color, and they might amount to only one and a half changes.	94.0	108.0
201611	1760	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	But both are improvements, so the last year has been good for the financial stability of the United States.	94.0	108.0
201611	1761	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The overall assessment over the year has been steady.	94.0	108.0
201611	1762	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The bottom line, the one that is all yellow, says that the level of vulnerability of the US financial system is moderate, which is a good level, because if it was much better, we would have to begin worrying about complacency.	94.0	108.0
201611	1763	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	94.0	108.0
201611	1764	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	But I doubt that that is what will happen with Nellie’s troops, even after she has gone.	94.0	108.0
201611	1765	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Another few comments.	94.0	108.0
201611	1766	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The reform of the prime money market funds seems to have gone very well, and congratulations to all involved, many of them in this room.	94.0	108.0
201611	1767	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Second, on valuation pressures—this is a very complicated section of the report, and we have had some discussion of the complications already.	94.0	108.0
201611	1768	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The report says valuation pressures are moderate.	94.0	108.0
201611	1769	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	It says estimates of expected Treasury security yields are more or less in line with past experience, which surprised me.	94.0	108.0
201611	1770	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	But it then says that, even so, a risk that a sharp rise in interest rates not driven by improving economic conditions could trigger broad declines in asset prices.	94.0	108.0
201611	1771	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And that is a question I think, again, that we have all been asking ourselves.	94.0	108.0
201611	1772	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We know we reduced the interest rate to get asset prices up.	94.0	108.0
201611	1773	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We assumed, at least I assumed, that as the economy improved, we would just move into a situation with a higher interest rate, which justified, more or less, the higher level to which prices have gotten.	94.0	108.0
201611	1774	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	But we haven’t seen the economy improving to that extent, and so I suppose that is what is being said.	94.0	108.0
201611	1775	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	If we get into a situation in which interest rates rise for a reason not driven by improving economic conditions, we are going to be in a difficult situation.	94.0	108.0
201611	1776	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Nonetheless, the bottom line is, broad indicators of household solvency have remained within historical norms.	94.0	108.0
201611	1777	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Now, just four concluding comments.	94.0	108.0
201611	1778	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	One was almost said by President Rosengren.	94.0	108.0
201611	1779	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	There isn’t a whole lot on the shadow banking system.	94.0	108.0
201611	1780	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Second, the task of a monitoring agency is a very difficult one.	94.0	108.0
201611	1781	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	If you keep on monitoring and your brilliant interventions prevent anything happening, no one knows unless you go out and boast about it, but you shouldn’t.	94.0	108.0
201611	1782	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	But if you keep on monitoring and a crisis occurs, everyone knows, and that’s why it is difficult.	94.0	108.0
201611	1783	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The equilibrium of this process, however, is likely to result in an excess of crises called over the number that actually occur, and that actually may be an optimal outcome.	94.0	108.0
201611	1784	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Third, in evaluating financial stability, we should presumably also try to describe what is likely to happen in the way of damages and in the way of policies to mitigate the resultant crises.	94.0	108.0
201611	1785	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We could ask the FS Division to do one or two case studies of how a crisis would be dealt with, and it is very close to what you did in the case of Deutsche Bank in the box.	94.0	108.0
201611	1786	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And that was not a comforting analysis, and we might find that about other potential crises.	94.0	108.0
201611	1787	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Fourth and finally, as the Chair announced, this is Nellie’s last FOMC meeting.	94.0	108.0
201611	1788	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Nellie, you will leave the Federal Reserve with the gratitude of those with whom you have worked over the past 30 years, and with the gratitude of some with whom you have worked only over the last 2 years.	94.0	108.0
201611	1789	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And you will end your service at the Fed having transformed a small office into a mighty Division of Financial Stability.	94.0	108.0
201611	1790	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	When someone asks the Chair how many economic divisions she has [laughter], she can say, “Thirty-three percent more than I had last year.”	94.0	108.0
201611	1791	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And she will add, “And it’s a damn good division, too.”	94.0	108.0
201611	1792	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We thank you for everything you have done, Nellie, together with your colleagues in the FS Division and in cooperation with other divisions.	94.0	108.0
201611	1793	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	You have done it extraordinarily well.	94.0	108.0
201611	1794	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Good luck as you move on.	94.0	108.0
201611	1795	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We will miss you.	94.0	108.0
201611	1796	2016-11-02	meeting	LIANG	Thank you very much.	94.0	999.0
201611	1797	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	94.0	65.0
201611	1798	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’re ready now to go into our round on economic comments.	13.0	65.0
201611	1799	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And our first speaker is President Williams.	13.0	65.0
201611	1800	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	All right.	13.0	102.0
201611	1801	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m losing half my audience.	13.0	102.0
201611	1802	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	102.0
201611	1803	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Real GDP growth in the third quarter was strong.	13.0	102.0
201611	1804	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	The economy grew almost twice as fast as my estimate of its sustainable trend, which is about 1½ percent.	13.0	102.0
201611	1805	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, we have to remember that the quarterly numbers can be volatile, and they’re subject to one-off transitory factors such as the spike in soybean exports and residual seasonality.	13.0	102.0
201611	1806	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, in the past, some people, including my good friend who sits here to my right, have claimed that I only talk about seasonal adjustment problems when the real GDP number is weak.	13.0	102.0
201611	1807	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	So to prove him wrong, let me wade back into the weeds of residual seasonality one more time when residual seasonality is, in fact, likely giving us an overly optimistic read on the economy.	13.0	102.0
201611	1808	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Just to recall, the main problem is that, on average, first-quarter real GDP growth has been weaker than growth in other quarters even after seasonal adjustment.	13.0	102.0
201611	1809	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, this seems to reflect the BEA’s bottom-up methodology, which seasonally adjusts the individual subcomponents instead of the aggregate number directly.	13.0	102.0
201611	1810	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	But small amounts of seasonal variation at the granular level when aggregated can affect the top-line GDP numbers.	13.0	102.0
201611	1811	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the past, to correct for this residual seasonality, my staff has applied a second line of seasonal adjustment to the published aggregates, taking, in effect, a top-down approach.	13.0	102.0
201611	1812	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Recently, the BEA has taken some steps to reduce residual seasonality, and in this summer’s annual revision, it implemented several improvements to its seasonal adjustment methodology.	13.0	102.0
201611	1813	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	That creates a little bit of a problem, because in that annual revision, the BEA only provided us with three and a half years of historical data using these new procedures, and that short sample means it’s hard to calculate a precise magnitude of any remaining residual seasonality.	13.0	102.0
201611	1814	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, furthermore, a complete sample of the consistently revised GDP data won’t be available until 2018 when we get the next comprehensive NIPA revision.	13.0	102.0
201611	1815	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	So until then, I won’t go so far as to say that we’re flying blind on this important issue, but our windshield is still fogged up.	13.0	102.0
201611	1816	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	In view of the likelihood of some remaining residual seasonality, it seems appropriate to focus even more on the four-quarter growth rates of real GDP and prices.	13.0	102.0
201611	1817	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And on that basis, both real GDP growth and core PCE inflation appear likely to be around 1¾ percent this year, which is in line with the September SEP—that is, on balance, the recent data have been consistent with our expectations.	13.0	102.0
201611	1818	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, much of the economic and policy discussions focus on the balance of risks associated with the forecast and the management of those risks.	13.0	102.0
201611	1819	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	One risk that has been highlighted in the Tealbook and in the presentation today is that future interest rate hikes and the associated divergence in global monetary policies may cause an appreciation of the dollar.	13.0	102.0
201611	1820	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	For example, the Tealbook currently expects the dollar to rise almost 5 percent over the next couple of years as market participants’ expectations of FOMC rate actions are revised up.	13.0	102.0
201611	1821	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Underlying this projection, the Tealbook assumes that each 100 basis point funds rate surprise leads to a 3 percent appreciation in the dollar.	13.0	102.0
201611	1822	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	This effect—the “bang for the buck,” if you will—is based on recent dollar responses that are somewhat larger than historical averages.	13.0	102.0
201611	1823	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	In looking into this issue, my staff investigated the robustness of the estimated dollar response across several different specifications to get a sense of how much larger or smaller it could be.	13.0	102.0
201611	1824	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And while the dollar has shown greater sensitivity to interest rate movements since 2014, overall, this change isn’t statistically significant one account is taken of the wide empirical confidence intervals surrounding these estimates.	13.0	102.0
201611	1825	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, these wide confidence intervals also imply that there is a risk that the exchange value of the dollar may appreciate even more than assumed in the Tealbook.	13.0	102.0
201611	1826	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I don’t lose too much sleep over this risk, because it can be fairly easily mitigated by an adjustment in the path of policy.	13.0	102.0
201611	1827	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	For example, if we raise interest rates a bit and we see a larger-than-expected rise in the dollar, we can offset this jump by postponing future funds rate increases appropriately.	13.0	102.0
201611	1828	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	We don’t need to let risk-management caution turn into paralysis.	13.0	102.0
201611	1829	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And it’s important to see the risks on both sides.	13.0	102.0
201611	1830	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	There are downside risks to inflation from an outsized appreciation in the dollar, but there are also notable upside risks.	13.0	102.0
201611	1831	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	The divergence between the PCE and CPI inflation rates may get resolved in favor of the CPI.	13.0	102.0
201611	1832	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	That may happen, for example, if the unusually weak PCE health-care price inflation starts to rise next year.	13.0	102.0
201611	1833	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Also, there’s no question that wage growth is picking up.	13.0	102.0
201611	1834	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	If you look at the apples-to- apples measure like the Atlanta Fed Wage Growth Tracker, that’s been increasing, but other labor cost measures are firming somewhat as well.	13.0	102.0
201611	1835	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And if these upside risks play out, inflation could easily overshoot our 2 percent target next year.	13.0	102.0
201611	1836	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t think that would be such a big problem, because in that case, monetary policy should be positioned to shift to a much less accommodative stance.	13.0	102.0
201611	1837	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	For the real economy, the risks look fairly balanced.	13.0	102.0
201611	1838	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	While the improvement in labor force participation this year has bought us some time, I see a low probability of a repeat performance next year.	13.0	102.0
201611	1839	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	So it seems more likely that job gains will outpace labor force growth, and the unemployment rate will go back to edging down to somewhere between 4½ and 4¾ percent.	13.0	102.0
201611	1840	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	To sum up, the economic expansion looks like it’s on track.	13.0	102.0
201611	1841	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	The labor market is strong and shows solid momentum, inflation is moving back toward our 2 percent goal, and we’re well positioned for a gradual increase in interest rates.	13.0	102.0
201611	1842	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13.0	102.0
201611	1843	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	1844	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	13.0	65.0
201611	1845	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201611	1846	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I expect the economy will likely reach 2 percent core PCE inflation and my estimate of full employment, which is 4.7 percent, sometime next year.	13.0	90.0
201611	1847	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Achievement of both parts of our mandate in 2017 is likely, conditional on my forecast of continued above-potential economic growth over the next couple of years.	13.0	90.0
201611	1848	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	We are already relatively close to full employment, and with projected output growth above potential next year, we may well see the unemployment rate continue to decline gradually , although this, of course, depends on the evolution of labor force participation, a topic to which I will now turn.	13.0	90.0
201611	1849	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	One reason to be skeptical that labor markets will tighten further might be the constancy of the unemployment rate over the course of this year.	13.0	90.0
201611	1850	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Of course, a relatively flat unemployment rate, despite reasonably strong payroll employment growth, is a good sign for the economy, as it implies that the labor force has grown strongly over the past year.	13.0	90.0
201611	1851	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, there is reason to believe that this good news on labor force growth is unlikely to persist too far into the future.	13.0	90.0
201611	1852	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	At the Boston Federal Reserve conference last month, papers by Robert Hall and Alan Krueger each emphasized important secular trends in labor force participation.	13.0	90.0
201611	1853	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	In particular, the paper by Krueger suggests that the scope for further increases in labor force participation may be limited by the fact that a large portion of the working-age male population currently out of the labor force reports having a serious health condition that is a barrier to work.	13.0	90.0
201611	1854	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is also worth noting that while the recent increase in labor force participation can be interpreted as evidence of slack in the labor market, participation does feature a cyclical component.	13.0	90.0
201611	1855	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	From a cyclical perspective, the rise in labor force participation, rather than a sign of slack, could well be taken as a sign of a labor market that is nearing full employment.	13.0	90.0
201611	1856	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I hope that the recent increase in labor force participation at this juncture of the business cycle will prove persistent, it is also important to be mindful that the historical experience in the United States is not especially supportive of such a view.	13.0	90.0
201611	1857	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Work by my staff indicates that workers entering the labor force at age 25 or older in a good labor market do not exhibit a significantly higher permanence, measured over a 12-year span, in the labor force than similar workers entering the labor market at other stages of the business cycle.	13.0	90.0
201611	1858	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	In all, we should not be overly confident that output growth above potential will continue to entice new entrants into the labor force, nor that those who enter will remain for long.	13.0	90.0
201611	1859	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	With the aging of the baby boom and its entrance into retirement, along with the limited evidence that labor force growth is likely to continue, I expect that output growth above its potential rate will result in a gradual decline in the unemployment rate.	13.0	90.0
201611	1860	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Turning to potential signals of labor market tightness, evidence suggests that both wages and prices seem to be gradually rising.	13.0	90.0
201611	1861	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Core PCE prices over the past year have risen 1.7 percent.	13.0	90.0
201611	1862	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	If, in fact, we reach 2 percent inflation by next year, it will likely have an effect on financial market prices and the relative stability we have enjoyed over the past year.	13.0	90.0
201611	1863	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	The Tealbook is forecasting a fairly gradual rise in the 10-year Treasury rate.	13.0	90.0
201611	1864	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I hope that is the outcome, I am worried that the long rate response may be more unruly than the Tealbook envisions as markets realize that their assumed funds rate path is inconsistent with having achieved our dual mandate, with the prospect of further labor market tightening still to come.	13.0	90.0
201611	1865	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	In sum, we are currently quite close to achieving our dual mandate.	13.0	90.0
201611	1866	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Both my forecast and that in the Tealbook expect the unemployment rate to undershoot the natural rate.	13.0	90.0
201611	1867	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Our ability to pursue a path of gradual tightening will be dependent on when we resume raising rates.	13.0	90.0
201611	1868	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Tomorrow I will discuss in more detail why delaying too long could be costly.	13.0	90.0
201611	1869	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201611	1870	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	1871	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13.0	65.0
201611	1872	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201611	1873	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I think everyone shares the intuition that monetary policy operates with a lag, although I would note, in passing, that this means that a central bank may keep tightening for too long as well as that it may wait too long to begin tightening.	13.0	97.0
201611	1874	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But saying we shouldn’t wait too long is almost tautological and not particularly helpful in deciding when to move.	13.0	97.0
201611	1875	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	There have been suggestions in some quarters going back several years or more about the existence of lags, arguing for raising rates relatively soon after the suggestion was made.	13.0	97.0
201611	1876	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And, of course, many more people have been voicing this view in the past year or so.	13.0	97.0
201611	1877	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I certainly didn’t find this view convincing two or three or four years ago.	13.0	97.0
201611	1878	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But as I mentioned at our previous meeting, although I haven’t yet been persuaded—and, thus, I haven’t been in favor of incurring the costs of the marginal jobs and economic growth that would not be realized with another rate hike taking place sooner rather than later—I have found the case a closer one over the past few meetings.	13.0	97.0
201611	1879	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Because not moving won’t be the right position forever, except perhaps if secular stagnation has gripped the economy with a vengeance, I have tried to define for myself with a little more specificity when the intuition of a preemptive move should click in.	13.0	97.0
201611	1880	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	There doesn’t seem to be a consensus answer to the question of how long the implementation lag may be.	13.0	97.0
201611	1881	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I’ve seen everything from three months to two years, with relatively more views in the two-to-three- quarter range.	13.0	97.0
201611	1882	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And I should note that, if one’s concern is financial stability, the implementation lag may be a good bit shorter than that affecting real economic activity.	13.0	97.0
201611	1883	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And, of course, the length of the implementation lag isn’t the only important question.	13.0	97.0
201611	1884	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Also important are the relative degree of certainty that conditions are emerging that will recommend a monetary policy response and the relative magnitude of the risks associated with dealing with possible adverse outcomes that suggest ex post it would have been better to have followed the policy road not taken.	13.0	97.0
201611	1885	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	While I suppose the implementation lag may have changed even in the past year or so, I think it would be very difficult to determine with any certainty whether that’s been the case.	13.0	97.0
201611	1886	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And I don’t think that what I’ve regarded as the asymmetric balance of risks or the relevance of a low r* that may remain low indefinitely have changed materially in recent months.	13.0	97.0
201611	1887	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	In examining whether my own position should change, I focused mostly on the questions of the relative degree of confidence that conditions will emerge, counseling a rate increase, and the relative magnitude of risks associated with possible adverse outcomes in both directions.	13.0	97.0
201611	1888	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I’m not going to repeat my self-described pragmatic view, which you’ve all probably heard plenty of times.	13.0	97.0
201611	1889	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But let me mention a few developments that have affected my assessment as to whether we are closer to the point at which a failure to remove more accommodation would begin to carry sufficiently high risks that it is worth the admittedly hard-to-quantify opportunity costs of some number of additional jobs being created.	13.0	97.0
201611	1890	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	On the labor market front, I continue to believe there is more slack—that is, that the trend of the past year or more of job creation well above the number of new entrants with an essentially flat unemployment rate can continue.	13.0	97.0
201611	1891	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Again, though, this view won’t be right forever.	13.0	97.0
201611	1892	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And even though the flat Phillips curve means that the pass-through from potentially increased nominal wage growth to price inflation is not all that direct, I think nearly everyone agrees that, directionally at least, there is some correlation.	13.0	97.0
201611	1893	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	So I’ve been watching for some indication in the data that this trend may be nearing its end.	13.0	97.0
201611	1894	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think there’s too much in wage patterns yet.	13.0	97.0
201611	1895	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Here, not much has changed in the past year.	13.0	97.0
201611	1896	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	There is one measure suggesting we have begun to see some increased distance between industries in which wages are growing faster and those in which they are not—something that, in the past, has been correlated with later acceleration across the board.	13.0	97.0
201611	1897	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But this is the measure based on three-digit industry codes, and even then it’s not that significant a move.	13.0	97.0
201611	1898	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	The more granular four-digit industry code measure shows no change at all.	13.0	97.0
201611	1899	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Our labor economists did, however, point out something that might prove to be a harbinger of the end of the aforementioned trend.	13.0	97.0
201611	1900	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	At the height of past business cycles, the labor force participation rate has increased somewhat above its trend but, with the exception of the halcyon period of very high growth in the late 1990s, not for more than a couple of quarters.	13.0	97.0
201611	1901	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Under the staff’s current estimate of trend labor force participation, actual labor force participation has, for the first time since the financial crisis, exceeded the trend, albeit by a very small margin.	13.0	97.0
201611	1902	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Now, I think the staff would agree that we shouldn’t have a high degree of confidence in current estimates of trend, as they have debated it so much among themselves.	13.0	97.0
201611	1903	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	If it’s actually higher than the staff estimate, which does fall below some other estimates I’ve seen, then we’re still not back to trend.	13.0	97.0
201611	1904	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And the fact that we have been below trend for so long— nearly eight years—may mean that past correlations won’t hold up in current circumstances.	13.0	97.0
201611	1905	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But it is something I’ll be watching.	13.0	97.0
201611	1906	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Another thing I want to note in passing—and I think people have commented on this before, but it’s something we should probably keep in mind—is that the change in the labor force participation rate, contrary to the instinct I think we all have, is not principally due to a lot more people being pulled back into the labor force.	13.0	97.0
201611	1907	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	It’s actually due to people making decisions not to leave the labor force in greater numbers than they had previously—I guess it’s a double positive—which may affect our sense of the future trend, particularly when you’re talking about people who are hitting an age that, in the past, has been a retirement age—that is, it may be a little bit more sustainable.	13.0	97.0
201611	1908	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to inflation, I’ve been focused on seeing some tangible developments on the inflation front that would credibly promise nontransitory attainment of the inflation target, with due consideration to the symmetrical nature of that target.	13.0	97.0
201611	1909	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	It does seem as though the disinflationary effects of the stronger dollar and energy prices are waning, though it’s less clear whether the dollar is done strengthening.	13.0	97.0
201611	1910	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And the recent core inflation reading has come in a little higher than anticipated, I gather reflecting, in part, slightly larger effects from now-rising energy prices and some nonmarket services components.	13.0	97.0
201611	1911	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t place an enormous amount of weight on such a modest change, particularly any that is attributable to those pesky nonmarket components, but now, at least, the uncertainty with respect to inflation’s path is a little more tilted in an upward direction.	13.0	97.0
201611	1912	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	To conclude, as you can tell, I find the situation to have considerably more nuance than was the case just six months ago.	13.0	97.0
201611	1913	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t find the case for another increase yet to be compelling and certainly not urgent, in view of the still mixed nature of incoming data.	13.0	97.0
201611	1914	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Moreover, I don’t think there should be concern about some overshooting of the 2 percent target, something that could actually have favorable medium-term effects.	13.0	97.0
201611	1915	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But I do find it arguable that we’re getting to the point at which some further modest, cautious removal of accommodation may be a reasonable response to the continuing diminution of slack in the economy and the labor market.	13.0	97.0
201611	1916	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201611	1917	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	1918	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	13.0	65.0
201611	1919	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201611	1920	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Overall, there’s been very little change in the moderate growth picture of the Fourth District economy since our previous meeting.	13.0	999.0
201611	1921	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	District contacts report largely stable economic conditions.	13.0	999.0
201611	1922	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The Bank’s diffusion index of business contacts reporting better versus worse conditions edged down to minus 6 from minus 4 at the time of our previous meeting.	13.0	999.0
201611	1923	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Manufacturing remained weak, but contacts in the energy sector reported a pickup in activity.	13.0	999.0
201611	1924	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Retailers reported a slowdown in activity, but many cited ongoing pressures associated with the transformation of the sector from bricks and mortar to online sales rather than a drop in overall demand.	13.0	999.0
201611	1925	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	As has been true for some time, labor market conditions in the District remain healthy.	13.0	999.0
201611	1926	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland staff estimates that year- over-year growth in District payrolls was 1 percent in September, essentially the same pace as seen over the past five months.	13.0	999.0
201611	1927	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The District’s unemployment rate has remained low and stable at 5 percent all year.	13.0	999.0
201611	1928	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	District contacts continue to report increasing upward wage pressures, particularly for relatively low-skilled positions, over the past few months.	13.0	999.0
201611	1929	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	A national labor leader who is on our Cincinnati Branch board noted that a very high volume of union contracts are being renegotiated this year.	13.0	999.0
201611	1930	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	He reports that the negotiations involving his organization have gone relatively smoothly, with average wage increases of 3 to 4 percent.	13.0	999.0
201611	1931	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	He also noted that there’s a growing sentiment among companies that they must invest in workforce development at the entry level and upgrade skills of experienced workers.	13.0	999.0
201611	1932	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	In fact, several of our directors have reported that they’re allocating additional resources for worker training and apprenticeships aimed at strengthening their staffing pipeline.	13.0	999.0
201611	1933	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	On the inflation front, overall, District firms report that prices received and nonlabor costs continue to rise but at a somewhat slower pace than in September.	13.0	999.0
201611	1934	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Turning to the national economy, overall, my outlook for the US economy over the medium run is unchanged since our previous meeting.	13.0	999.0
201611	1935	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I expect output growth to be at or slightly above trend, the unemployment rate to fall below its longer-run rate, and inflation to continue to rise gradually toward our longer-run objective of 2 percent.	13.0	999.0
201611	1936	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	In my view, the incoming data have been supportive of this projection.	13.0	999.0
201611	1937	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Output growth picked up in the third quarter from its weaker first-half pace.	13.0	999.0
201611	1938	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The pattern of growth was about as expected.	13.0	999.0
201611	1939	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Consumer spending remains solid, but nonresidential investment remains weak.	13.0	999.0
201611	1940	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I continue to anticipate some pickup in investment as the expansion continues.	13.0	999.0
201611	1941	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Oil drilling activity is rising in response to higher oil prices, and low corporate bond spreads are supportive of increased investment spending.	13.0	999.0
201611	1942	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	A stronger pace of capital deepening would help boost labor productivity growth from recent low levels.	13.0	999.0
201611	1943	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Labor markets continue to improve.	13.0	999.0
201611	1944	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	A broad set of indicators are consistent with labor market strength.	13.0	999.0
201611	1945	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Since the start of the year, monthly gains in payroll employment have averaged nearly 180,000 jobs, a pace well above trend.	13.0	999.0
201611	1946	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The unemployment rate has been relatively stable at estimates of its longer-run level.	13.0	999.0
201611	1947	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Measures of underutilization have decreased, the labor force participation rate has edged up, and average hourly earnings and other measures of wages have accelerated somewhat.	13.0	999.0
201611	1948	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	My view, like the Tealbook’s, is that we are essentially at full employment from the standpoint of what monetary policy can do.	13.0	999.0
201611	1949	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	With respect to the other part of our dual mandate, I view incoming data as consistent with the Committee’s anticipation that inflation would begin to rise as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate.	13.0	999.0
201611	1950	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Oil and gasoline prices have risen back to their levels of a year ago, and nonpetroleum import prices have moved up over the past six months and are now less than 1 percent below year-ago levels.	13.0	999.0
201611	1951	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	As a result, year-over-year PCE inflation is now 1¼ percent, 1 percentage point above its level from a year ago.	13.0	999.0
201611	1952	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Over the past six months, PCE inflation has risen at an annual pace of slightly more than 2 percent.	13.0	999.0
201611	1953	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Core inflation measures have been stable to up slightly over the past several months and are above year-ago levels.	13.0	999.0
201611	1954	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Core PCE inflation, measured year over year, is now 1.7 percent, up from 1.4 percent a year ago.	13.0	999.0
201611	1955	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The Dallas Federal Reserve trimmed mean inflation rate is also running at 1.7 percent, up slightly from a year ago.	13.0	999.0
201611	1956	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Core CPI inflation has been slightly over 2 percent all year.	13.0	999.0
201611	1957	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland Federal Reserve median CPI measure has been at or above 2½ percent for the past five months.	13.0	999.0
201611	1958	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland Federal Reserve staff’s near-term inflation model is forecasting inflation to rise for the remainder of the year, closing in on the 2 percent objective.	13.0	999.0
201611	1959	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	In December, the model predicts year-over-year PCE inflation to be 1.7 percent, a significant increase from the current level, and core PCE inflation to be 1.9 percent.	13.0	999.0
201611	1960	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Admittedly, there is a fairly wide confidence band around these point forecasts, but the rise being predicted is consistent with what the FOMC has been anticipating.	13.0	999.0
201611	1961	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	In my view, inflation expectations remain reasonably stable.	13.0	999.0
201611	1962	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Our Reserve Bank’s 10- year and 5-year, 5-year-forward measures have been stable.	13.0	999.0
201611	1963	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The 5-year, 5-year-forward breakeven rates moved up a bit since the previous meeting, but we have to be cautious in reading too much into this, as the move may have reflected changes in liquidity and inflation risk premiums rather than inflation expectations.	13.0	999.0
201611	1964	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The University of Michigan survey measure of inflation expectations over the next 5-to-10 years fell in October to a record low of 2.3 percent, but as I discussed at our previous meeting, this measure has been trending down since 2013, and the distribution in responses has been changing as well, with fewer respondents reporting expected inflation rates at 5 percent and at 10 percent.	13.0	999.0
201611	1965	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The downward movement in the Michigan survey bears watching and further investigation, but at this point I’m not taking a strong signal from it.	13.0	999.0
201611	1966	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	So I anticipate inflation will gradually return to our 2 percent goal over the next couple of years as the drag due to earlier declines in oil prices and the appreciation of the dollar pass through.	13.0	999.0
201611	1967	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Output growth continues to be at or slightly above trend, labor markets continue to be healthy, and inflation expectations remain stable.	13.0	999.0
201611	1968	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I continue to project that a gradual upward path of interest rates over the forecast horizon will be appropriate in view of my outlook and the risks associated with it.	13.0	999.0
201611	1969	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I see those risks as broadly balanced at this time.	13.0	999.0
201611	1970	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	However, failure to move interest rates up gradually from the current low level will increase the risks over time.	13.0	999.0
201611	1971	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	These risks include risks to financial stability from search-for-yield behavior and potential asset price bubbles.	13.0	999.0
201611	1972	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The staff’s QS report suggests that commercial real estate prices continue to rise and are somewhat overvalued in some markets.	13.0	999.0
201611	1973	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The risks also include risks to macroeconomic stability from potentially getting “behind the curve,” generating excessive inflation, and then having to take more aggressive action than currently anticipated, which would shorten the expansion.	13.0	999.0
201611	1974	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Some private-sector economists who see the macro risks as low at this point have been advocating that until inflation moves up to or above our goal, the FOMC should run the economy “hot” in order to bring more people into the labor force and drive down the unemployment rate further, perhaps even lowering the structural unemployment rate.	13.0	999.0
201611	1975	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	First, setting aside the risks, it isn’t clear that that strategy would work.	13.0	999.0
201611	1976	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The historical data suggest that labor force participation is not very cyclical.	13.0	999.0
201611	1977	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	In addition, running the unemployment rate well below its natural rate would entail supply-side costs—for example, inefficient matching that could lower productivity growth.	13.0	999.0
201611	1978	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	In a typical DSGE model, these costs are reflected in the welfare-based loss function, which is well approximated by the familiar quadratic loss function that penalizes both positive and negative deviations of inflation from its target and of unemployment from its natural rate.	13.0	999.0
201611	1979	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Second, history tells us that this “hot economy strategy” is quite risky.	13.0	999.0
201611	1980	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Now, if we could rely on the Phillips curve remaining flat and inflation expectations remaining anchored, then the risk of engendering excessive inflation following this strategy would be relatively low.	13.0	999.0
201611	1981	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	We might expect outcomes like in the first alternative scenario in the Tealbook.	13.0	999.0
201611	1982	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	But what if the Phillips curve turns out not to remain linear and flat so that as the unemployment rate falls further, wage growth picks up significantly and inflation expectations don’t remain anchored?	13.0	999.0
201611	1983	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Then the cost of this hot economy strategy could be very high.	13.0	999.0
201611	1984	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	We could find ourselves well “behind the curve” because of our deliberate actions and then have to take aggressive action in response to bring inflation down.	13.0	999.0
201611	1985	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	We risk turning the hot economy strategy into a cold economy strategy if we end up in a recession.	13.0	999.0
201611	1986	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The second alternative scenario in the Tealbook captures part of this possibility, but it’s more benign because inflation expectations remain anchored.	13.0	999.0
201611	1987	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Even so, that scenario ends up with inflation above our goal and the unemployment rate eventually higher than in the baseline.	13.0	999.0
201611	1988	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Third, the discussion at the March 2004 FOMC meeting echoes some of our recent discussions.	13.0	999.0
201611	1989	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	At that point in time, interest rates had been on hold at 1 percent for some time, and some on the Committee believed low inflation and economic slack meant that the costs if economic growth turned out to be stronger than expected were lower than the costs if it turned out to be weaker than expected.	13.0	999.0
201611	1990	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Subsequent data revisions revealed that inflation was actually quite a bit higher and the output gap considerably smaller than the Committee believed at the time, so policy was considerably more accommodative than they believed it to be.	13.0	999.0
201611	1991	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	This type of measurement risk heightens the risk of attempting the hot economy strategy.	13.0	999.0
201611	1992	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	These considerations leave me believing that a gradual process of raising rates is actually the prudent course at this point.	13.0	999.0
201611	1993	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	It allows us to continue to monitor and respond to unanticipated changes in economic conditions and allows us to better calibrate our policy over time as we learn more about the underlying longer-run structural aspects of the economy, such as the natural rate of unemployment, potential output growth, structural productivity growth, and the natural real rate of interest.	13.0	999.0
201611	1994	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201611	1995	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	1996	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13.0	65.0
201611	1997	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Thank you very much, Madam Chair.	13.0	81.0
201611	1998	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Economic conditions in the Fifth District appear to have changed little since September.	13.0	81.0
201611	1999	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	There are a couple of exceptions.	13.0	81.0
201611	2000	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	First, Hurricane Matthew caused extensive flooding in areas of North and South Carolina, although major cities were spared, and that sparked the usual rebuilding efforts.	13.0	81.0
201611	2001	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	And, second, a number of survey participants and other contacts mentioned the upcoming election as a reason that businesses were hesitant to place orders.	13.0	81.0
201611	2002	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Otherwise, conditions looked very similar to what we’ve seen recently.	13.0	81.0
201611	2003	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	For example, manufacturing indicators were somewhat mixed this month, as has been the case for the past few months.	13.0	81.0
201611	2004	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	October survey results indicated continued contraction, although with some improvement from September.	13.0	81.0
201611	2005	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The composite index rose 4 points to negative 4.	13.0	81.0
201611	2006	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	More manufacturers saw wage increases in October, and the wage index, which rose to plus 18, has been in double digits for the past 11 months.	13.0	81.0
201611	2007	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The services sector continued to expand in October, according to our survey results and comments from contacts.	13.0	81.0
201611	2008	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Difficulty finding qualified workers persists as an issue cited by directors and other contacts.	13.0	81.0
201611	2009	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	For example, a staffing company reported seeing a sizable shift toward orders for permanent rather than temporary hires, reflecting a desire to lock in qualified workers rather than risk losing them.	13.0	81.0
201611	2010	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The wage components across all of our surveys are elevated and have increased notably for the retail sector.	13.0	81.0
201611	2011	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Turning to residential real estate markets, they continue to improve in many areas of the District.	13.0	81.0
201611	2012	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	For the most part, comments on housing were upbeat, and the CEO of a leading national building products supplier reported strong gains for September and October after several flat months in the late spring and summer and was expecting that strength to continue through year-end.	13.0	81.0
201611	2013	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The outlook for commercial real estate is more mixed, according to our contacts.	13.0	81.0
201611	2014	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	In most markets, the demand for multifamily construction remains strong, although there was a good deal of commentary about financing constraints.	13.0	81.0
201611	2015	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Banks that are close to their CRE guidance thresholds are reportedly pulling out of many markets and leaving borrowers to choose among only one or two lenders rather than four or five as had been typical.	13.0	81.0
201611	2016	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Turning to the national economy, the most notable change in the staff’s medium-term outlook since our previous meeting was the reduction of the GDP path.	13.0	81.0
201611	2017	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Growth in 2017 is projected to be 2.2 percent versus 2.4 percent in the September Tealbook.	13.0	81.0
201611	2018	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Some markdown seems appropriate, I think, even though third-quarter GDP growth was a bit above the staff’s estimate, because in that report final sales to domestic purchasers were weaker than expected.	13.0	81.0
201611	2019	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Growth in real consumer spending, which dominates that category, slowed to an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the third quarter, but that’s right in line with growth in real disposable income.	13.0	81.0
201611	2020	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The staff’s assessment is that we are at full employment, and that output growth will exceed its trend rate for the next couple of years.	13.0	81.0
201611	2021	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	But I think there’s a good chance that real GDP growth will converge to its trend rate more rapidly than the Tealbook projects.	13.0	81.0
201611	2022	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I think we’re already seeing some signs of supply-side constraints on growth.	13.0	81.0
201611	2023	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Reports of difficulty finding skilled workers have broadened noticeably over the past year or so.	13.0	81.0
201611	2024	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	We hear many instances of firms limiting current production as a result.	13.0	81.0
201611	2025	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	In several areas in our District, we’ve heard that single-family housing construction is being limited by labor constraints as well as by a limited supply of buildable lots, and we’re hearing that many firms are coping with labor shortages by increasing overtime hours for existing workers and by hiring unskilled workers and putting them through training.	13.0	81.0
201611	2026	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	As I mentioned earlier, we’ve also heard reports recently of reduced lending for multifamily construction in response to the regulatory burdens.	13.0	81.0
201611	2027	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	So I would not be surprised to see real GDP growth fall below 2 percent over the near term as we converge to trend, and a corollary of lower real GDP growth is that employment growth will almost certainly be lower as well.	13.0	81.0
201611	2028	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	In fact, it would not surprise me if employment growth fell to below 10,000 jobs per month in the near term.	13.0	81.0
201611	2029	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Did you mean 100,000?	13.0	91.0
201611	2030	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	You said 10,000 per month.	13.0	97.0
201611	2031	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I said 10,000?	13.0	81.0
201611	2032	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Well, so, you know, if 60,000 per month would keep labor force participation rates constant, and there’s a significant amount of noise about 60,000, maybe under 10,000 would be realized as well.	13.0	81.0
201611	2033	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I did mean to say 100,000, though.	13.0	81.0
201611	2034	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	13.0	81.0
201611	2035	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Turning to inflation, core inflation has averaged 1.7 percent over the past four quarters, up from 1.3 percent four quarters ago.	13.0	81.0
201611	2036	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Many forecasters have been surprised by the strength of core readings this year.	13.0	81.0
201611	2037	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The Tealbook, for example, last December predicted that core inflation would be at an annual rate of 1.4 percent in the first quarter.	13.0	81.0
201611	2038	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	It turned out to be 2.1 percent.	13.0	81.0
201611	2039	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Similarly, in March, core inflation was predicted to be 1.5 percent in the second quarter, but the latest estimate is 1.8 percent for the second quarter.	13.0	81.0
201611	2040	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	And in June, core inflation was predicted to be 1.3 percent in the third quarter, but on Friday we learned it was 1.7 percent.	13.0	81.0
201611	2041	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The Tealbook still has inflation remaining below 2.2 percent for three more years, though.	13.0	81.0
201611	2042	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	For me, this year’s experience suggests that we seem to be likely to hit 2 percent more rapidly than we otherwise would have thought.	13.0	81.0
201611	2043	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	13.0	81.0
201611	2044	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	2045	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13.0	65.0
201611	2046	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201611	2047	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	The reports from my directors and other business contacts were mixed this round.	13.0	91.0
201611	2048	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	The consensus seems to be that economic growth is proceeding slowly and steadily.	13.0	91.0
201611	2049	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Although nearly everyone had some commentary about the near-term uncertainty, nothing concrete seemed to be flashing red.	13.0	91.0
201611	2050	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I did hear a few more reports of larger wage increases this round, but, in general, the gains were still moderate and not expected to have much of an effect on inflation.	13.0	91.0
201611	2051	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Many employers say they don’t have the pricing power to pass along more than minimal cost increases to their customers.	13.0	91.0
201611	2052	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Others expect productivity enhancements to offset their higher wages, and pretty much everyone is expecting to be living in a low-inflation world for the foreseeable future.	13.0	91.0
201611	2053	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	My financial market contacts also had little new to report, although I did hear from one large nonfinancial firm as well as from a small business owner that the increase in LIBOR over the intermeeting period had raised their short-term borrowing costs about 25 basis points.	13.0	91.0
201611	2054	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	With regard to the national outlook, recent data seem reasonably consistent with our previous economic projections.	13.0	91.0
201611	2055	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Overall, third-quarter GDP growth was in line with our forecast, although private domestic final purchases were a little softer than we anticipated and are something to keep an eye on.	13.0	91.0
201611	2056	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	But we still think that consumer fundamentals are good and that GDP growth will continue to run modestly above potential over the next couple of years.	13.0	91.0
201611	2057	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Our GDP growth numbers are somewhat stronger than the Tealbook’s, but our basic forecast narratives are quite similar.	13.0	91.0
201611	2058	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	However, our estimate for the natural rate of unemployment in 2016 is 4.7 percent, and the labor force participation rate is currently below our estimate of its trend.	13.0	91.0
201611	2059	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	So our Chicago outlook envisions a bit more resource slack remaining in the economy than the Tealbook does.	13.0	91.0
201611	2060	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	We also see less overshooting in potential output later in the projection period.	13.0	91.0
201611	2061	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	The news on inflation has been a bit encouraging, and like the Tealbook, we’ve nudged up our forecast of core PCE inflation to 1.7 percent this year and see it remaining there in 2017.	13.0	91.0
201611	2062	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I would take more comfort from the higher inflation numbers if we were also seeing better news on inflation expectations.	13.0	91.0
201611	2063	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	The recent uptick in TIPS breakevens is a small move in the right direction, but the levels of breakevens and other financial market measures of inflation compensation are still pointing quite loudly toward downside risks.	13.0	91.0
201611	2064	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	And the Michigan survey of household inflation expectations has hit a new low.	13.0	91.0
201611	2065	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	All in all, we seem to be on a steady-as-you- go tack at the moment, and I’m not seeing any significant changes to economic conditions that alter my views on appropriate policy for tomorrow’s decision or for the near future.	13.0	91.0
201611	2066	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I apologize for the brevity of my comments today.	13.0	91.0
201611	2067	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	It’s been hard to get my staff to help lately because of late-night World Series games.	13.0	91.0
201611	2068	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	13.0	91.0
201611	2069	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	It’s going to end soon.	13.0	97.0
201611	2070	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Well—	13.0	91.0
201611	2071	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	One way or the other.	13.0	97.0
201611	2072	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	13.0	97.0
201611	2073	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	2074	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13.0	65.0
201611	2075	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	The data since we last met have been mixed but consistent, overall, with gradual progress toward our goals.	13.0	107.0
201611	2076	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	On the labor market, recent payroll gains, averaging around 180,000 per month, are likely sufficient to gradually increase resource utilization, although they are below last year’s pace.	13.0	107.0
201611	2077	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Even so, I have yet to see clear indications of binding resource constraints.	13.0	107.0
201611	2078	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	The unemployment rate has moved sideways over the past year at around 5 percent, and increases in labor demand have been met by further cyclical improvement in the participation rate.	13.0	107.0
201611	2079	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	The participation rate is up ½ percentage point on a year ago.	13.0	107.0
201611	2080	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Even so, the prime-age participation rate remains 1½ percentage points below pre-crisis levels.	13.0	107.0
201611	2081	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Both the recent data on average hourly earnings and the employment cost index suggest nominal wage growth of around 2¼ to 2½ percent, up somewhat from earlier in the recovery but still quite modest relative to pre-crisis trends.	13.0	107.0
201611	2082	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s noteworthy that the improvement in the labor market has likely been of most benefit to individuals and families in the bottom part of the income distribution.	13.0	107.0
201611	2083	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, the gains in the participation rate over the past year have gone disproportionately to those with relatively little education.	13.0	107.0
201611	2084	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	And, as David Wilcox’s research has shown, incremental improvements in the labor market tend to have the largest effects on minority households.	13.0	107.0
201611	2085	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Over the past year, the unemployment rate for African Americans, for instance, has fallen 1 full percentage point as the overall rate has held steady.	13.0	107.0
201611	2086	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	We also learned over the intermeeting period that the poverty rate declined 1.2 percentage points last year, the largest reduction since the onset of the Global Financial Crisis.	13.0	107.0
201611	2087	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Median household income rose more than 5.2 percent for the first time since the financial crisis, and you can see the improvement across all racial and ethnic groups.	13.0	107.0
201611	2088	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	The improvement in median incomes was greatest for households at or close to the bottom of the income distribution.	13.0	107.0
201611	2089	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Thus, the continued gradual improvement in the labor market is increasingly benefiting those individuals and communities most in need.	13.0	107.0
201611	2090	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Turning to aggregate spending, the latest data have been mixed but, overall, suggest a continued moderate pace of expansion.	13.0	107.0
201611	2091	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Private domestic consumption and fixed investment, the most forward-looking components of GDP, rose at only 1.6 percent annual rate in the third quarter, down from average growth of 3 percent over the previous several years.	13.0	107.0
201611	2092	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Consumer spending appears to have slowed.	13.0	107.0
201611	2093	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	The level of single-family housing permits, likely our best indicator of housing activity, has changed little, on net, over the past year.	13.0	107.0
201611	2094	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	This slowing in consumption and housing is noteworthy because these two sources of demand have more than accounted for GDP growth since the end of 2013.	13.0	107.0
201611	2095	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	After contributing 2½ percentage points, on average, in 2014 and 2015, consumption and housing contributed only 1¾ percentage points in the first three quarters of this year.	13.0	107.0
201611	2096	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Business fixed investment, which declined over the first half of this year, has shown some tentative signs of turning up.	13.0	107.0
201611	2097	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Turning to the international environment, this relatively weak domestic momentum is of some concern because recent events remind us of the significant downside risks coming from abroad.	13.0	107.0
201611	2098	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Increasingly, markets are assuming that the most that can be expected from the ECB and the Bank of Japan is that they can hold the line in terms of the degree of accommodation because they face increasingly unattractive tradeoffs in the absence of large fiscal changes.	13.0	107.0
201611	2099	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent communications suggesting the United Kingdom is pursuing a so-called hard Brexit from the EU led to a sharp, 6 percent decline in the pound and a markdown of medium-term growth prospects in the United Kingdom and the EU.	13.0	107.0
201611	2100	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, as we just discussed, during the intermeeting period market concerns about Deutsche Bank increased as anticipation of fines for past violations led to a reassessment of its profitability, which was already under pressure, and some counterparties began to limit their exposure to the bank, which was deemed by the IMF to be the world’s most systemically risky.	13.0	107.0
201611	2101	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	These developments remind us that fragile banks and low economic growth in Europe could feed off each other, with potentially destabilizing effects on the European economy and spillovers to our financial markets.	13.0	107.0
201611	2102	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Indeed, the concerns about a hard Brexit and about Deutsche, which have emerged in sharp relief in the intermeeting period, are somewhat at odds with our characterization of risks in the statement.	13.0	107.0
201611	2103	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Finally, while relatively buoyant Chinese economic growth so far this year has reduced near-term risks, the quality of that growth has been quite poor, with the debt-to-GDP ratio and corporate indebtedness in particular already at extremely elevated levels and continuing to climb.	13.0	107.0
201611	2104	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	This poses important medium-term risks.	13.0	107.0
201611	2105	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	These downside risks coming from abroad remind us of the importance of asymmetry and risk-management considerations, a subject to which we return tomorrow.	13.0	107.0
201611	2106	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Turning to inflation, the most recent data offer hints that inflation may indeed be moving toward our goal after a very long period of underperformance.	13.0	107.0
201611	2107	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	People have noted the 12-month change in core PCE prices in September was 1.7 percent, at the upper end of the range of values occupied since mid-2012.	13.0	107.0
201611	2108	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Inflation compensation, as measured by TIPS and by yields on nominal Treasury securities, has increased about 20 basis points since our previous meeting, which is also welcome.	13.0	107.0
201611	2109	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	However, these tentative signs of improvement come against a backdrop of persistent shortfalls from our 2 percent target.	13.0	107.0
201611	2110	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, five-year inflation compensation five years ahead remains very low at 1.6 percent—1 percentage point below levels prevailing before mid-2014—and survey measures of longer-term household inflation expectations are still very low.	13.0	107.0
201611	2111	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Thus, although the recent news has been positive, getting back to a credibly symmetric 2 percent target will require continued progress in the labor market and the absence of adverse shocks from abroad.	13.0	107.0
201611	2112	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	To conclude, I’ve been wrestling with this question we’ve discussed of the wisdom of preemptive tightening to guard against the risks of allowing the labor market to experience material further improvement.	13.0	107.0
201611	2113	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	And I know some who’ve looked at past episodes of low unemployment have cautioned that further improvement would bring with it significant recessionary risks.	13.0	107.0
201611	2114	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	I think it’s important to realize that today’s circumstances are importantly different.	13.0	107.0
201611	2115	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In the past, low levels of unemployment have been associated with relatively rapid increases in inflation.	13.0	107.0
201611	2116	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	A key channel was likely inflation expectations, which, starting in the mid-to-late 1960s, likely began to move higher and became unanchored.	13.0	107.0
201611	2117	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s also helpful to recall that some of these episodes, certainly in the 1970s, contained dramatic supply-side boosts to inflation, which may have made policymakers more reluctant to move early due to the unattractive tradeoffs.	13.0	107.0
201611	2118	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Thus, when policy eventually tightened, it may have been importantly influenced by the need to reduce inflation expectations.	13.0	107.0
201611	2119	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Circumstances could not be more different today.	13.0	107.0
201611	2120	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Unlike in the previous episodes, inflation expectations are well anchored to the upside.	13.0	107.0
201611	2121	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Indeed, they have been stubbornly low for eight years, and some measures of expectations have moved lower.	13.0	107.0
201611	2122	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, we’ve observed that other major advanced foreign economies that have allowed persistently weak demand to affect inflation expectations haven’t been able to achieve their inflation mandates despite their extraordinary efforts.	13.0	107.0
201611	2123	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, there has been legitimate concern that when the unemployment rate falls too far, financial stability risks are heightened.	13.0	107.0
201611	2124	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Here, too, I think it’s worth noting that the financial system today is much different than before the crisis.	13.0	107.0
201611	2125	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Capital levels have doubled at the largest banks; liquidity is higher; regulatory oversight is considerably more intense; and in cases in which risks have arisen, we have a much better framework for identifying them earlier, as we just saw in the previous session.	13.0	107.0
201611	2126	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	For example, in leveraged lending and CRE, regulatory guidance has pushed back, and there are some signs that it has been effective.	13.0	107.0
201611	2127	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In short, we must continue to be vigilant against signs of undue risk-taking in financial markets, but we should also recognize that the tradeoff between the kind of high-quality improvement in the labor market that I discussed earlier and low-quality growth in the financial sector that has sometimes occurred as expansions mature is not inevitable.	13.0	107.0
201611	2128	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	107.0
201611	2129	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201611	2130	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And I think this would be a good time for a short break.	13.0	65.0
201611	2131	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we return at 4:15, in about 15 minutes.	13.0	65.0
201611	2133	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, folks.	13.0	65.0
201611	2134	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s resume the economic go-round, and President Bullard is on.	13.0	65.0
201611	2135	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201611	2136	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Incoming intermeeting data seem to be consistent with the regime-based view of the state of the US and Eighth District economies.	13.0	94.0
201611	2137	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	The regime is characterized by relatively slow real GDP growth at 2 percent per year; stable unemployment, which remains in the 4½ to 5 percent range over the forecast horizon; and an inflation forecast roughly centered on the Committee’s inflation target of 2 percent.	13.0	94.0
201611	2138	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	That is, looking at a chart, once uncertainty is taken into account, it would look like 2 percent is roughly in the middle of the probability distribution for the forecast.	13.0	94.0
201611	2139	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	You could look at panels 7 and 8 on the US outlook, which were just handed out, to see examples of that.	13.0	94.0
201611	2140	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	District contacts emphasized a relatively weak agribusiness sector, along with weakness in some heavy manufacturing.	13.0	94.0
201611	2141	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Some contacts at large firms stressed that slow growth and low interest rates would continue to make mergers and acquisitions the top business strategy for the future.	13.0	94.0
201611	2142	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Housing market contacts reported relatively strong results.	13.0	94.0
201611	2143	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	District labor markets appear to have outperformed national labor markets in recent months.	13.0	94.0
201611	2144	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Commentary from the health- care sector was mixed.	13.0	94.0
201611	2145	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Nationally, the third-quarter real GDP estimate of 2.9 percent was about as expected, according to tracking estimates on the eve of the announcement.	13.0	94.0
201611	2146	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Most tracking estimates for the current quarter are lower.	13.0	94.0
201611	2147	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	The median of tracking estimates around the Federal Reserve System is currently about 2.1 percent for Q4.	13.0	94.0
201611	2148	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	This means that the real GDP growth rate for the year as a whole will likely be somewhat below 2 percent, perhaps 1.7 or 1.8 percent, once we have all available information.	13.0	94.0
201611	2149	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Many forecasts for 2017 real GDP growth are close to 2 percent.	13.0	94.0
201611	2150	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I regard these available data and forecasts as consistent with a regime of 2 percent growth in real GDP over the forecast horizon, and this is likely the current trend pace of growth for the US economy.	13.0	94.0
201611	2151	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	In light of this outlook for real GDP growth, I continue to expect unemployment to remain in the 4½ to 5 percent range over the next several years, and I expect inflation to be centered on the 2 percent target.	13.0	94.0
201611	2152	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I think this outcome can be supported with a policy rate setting only slightly higher than currently.	13.0	94.0
201611	2153	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	In short, unlike many around the table, I would not interpret the current situation in cyclical terms.	13.0	94.0
201611	2154	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I do not see the current situation changing unless at least one of two things happens: Number one, there is a switch to a higher-productivity-growth rate regime, which would be associated with faster real GDP growth and a higher real rate of return on safe assets; number two, the large liquidity premium associated with safe assets abates and switches to a value more consistent with historical pre-crisis experience, which would also drive the real rate of safe assets higher; or both.	13.0	94.0
201611	2155	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I do not expect either one of these switches to occur over the forecast horizon, but I will keep my eyes open and watch the data carefully.	13.0	94.0
201611	2156	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201611	2157	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	2158	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13.0	65.0
201611	2159	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201611	2160	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The incoming data continue to show moderate GDP growth, a healthy pace of labor market tightening, and inflation gradually moving up to 2 percent.	13.0	104.0
201611	2161	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The expected pickup in real GDP growth over the second half of the year seems to be materializing, thanks to the waning effects of oil prices on business investment and an end of the inventory correction.	13.0	104.0
201611	2162	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I expect output growth to continue at about 2 percent in 2017 and productivity growth to remain weak, with reasonably strong job growth continuing as well—in essence, a continuation of the trends that we’ve seen for the past several years.	13.0	104.0
201611	2163	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	That does imply significant ongoing labor market tightening.	13.0	104.0
201611	2164	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	So far this year, that tightening has taken the form of higher participation as the unemployment rate has moved sideways—a welcome development, as it shows that the economy has had a bit more “room to run.”	13.0	104.0
201611	2165	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	For the period ahead, I expect that participation will remain about flat, on net, for a while longer or perhaps decline slightly, as that margin of slack has probably been used up, and that job growth will again show through to the unemployment rate, which I expect to decline to the mid-4s over the next year.	13.0	104.0
201611	2166	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	It’s worth remembering again that participation has been volatile this year and can move around two- or three-tenths and it can be noise.	13.0	104.0
201611	2167	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	If participation had declined as forecast by the Tealbook last December, unemployment would now be 4.3 percent, holding all else equal.	13.0	104.0
201611	2168	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Wages have continued their gradual upward climb.	13.0	104.0
201611	2169	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	With low inflation and de minimis productivity growth, real wage increases are now quite healthy.	13.0	104.0
201611	2170	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Real unit labor costs have been increasing since early 2014, and this should put some upward pressure on prices.	13.0	104.0
201611	2171	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Trailing 12-month core inflation has increased 0.4 percentage point over the past year— now it’s at 1.7 percent—and total inflation is forecast in the Tealbook to reach that level in the first quarter of next year.	13.0	104.0
201611	2172	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	In the staff narrative, inflation remains at 1.7 percent next year, despite tightening labor markets and the waning of the drags that I mentioned, because of the unwinding of some transitory factors that are temporarily boosting inflation this year.	13.0	104.0
201611	2173	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Overall, inflation has been in line with our forecast for some time, albeit a little higher.	13.0	104.0
201611	2174	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The Michigan survey notwithstanding, there does seem to me to be evidence of a change in inflation sentiment, with higher nominal yields, higher market-based inflation compensation, and market chatter about a modest overshoot.	13.0	104.0
201611	2175	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I regard this as a healthy development and hope that it will be sustained.	13.0	104.0
201611	2176	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	For me, there is good reason to expect that inflation will continue to move gradually up to 2 percent, with a reasonable likelihood that this will happen faster than in the forecast.	13.0	104.0
201611	2177	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	While the US economy remains on a healthy track, the global picture remains a source of risk, whether it is excessive credit growth in China or a hard Brexit or weak European banks or just low economic growth and low inflation.	13.0	104.0
201611	2178	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Perhaps with global risks in mind, by a straight read, the market continues to price in only about one rate increase per year, assuming a zero term premium.	13.0	104.0
201611	2179	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Of course, term and risk premiums are probably negative, especially at longer durations.	13.0	104.0
201611	2180	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Even so, markets are clearly pricing in significant risks of low economic growth and inflation outcomes.	13.0	104.0
201611	2181	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I’m supportive of allowing a modest undershoot of the natural rate of unemployment.	13.0	104.0
201611	2182	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	With inflation having run below our 2 percent inflation objective every single month since I joined the Board four and a half years ago, I do not expect to feel alarmed if inflation moves modestly above 2 percent, except in what, in my view, is the the highly unlikely case in which longer-run inflation expectations move up excessively.	13.0	104.0
201611	2183	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I believe that this approach may help repair some of the residual labor market damage at little risk to price stability.	13.0	104.0
201611	2184	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I have supported a patient approach to policy, and I believe that that approach has paid dividends and continues to do so.	13.0	104.0
201611	2185	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I do also believe, however, that the risks are now becoming more two sided, and more on that tomorrow.	13.0	104.0
201611	2186	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201611	2187	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	2188	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13.0	65.0
201611	2189	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201611	2190	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	My presentation will be divided into three unequal parts—the labor market, inflation, and economic growth—and if much of what I have to say induces a sense of déjà vu, I plead guilty, for the economic situation and the key economic issues have not changed by much since our September decision.	13.0	108.0
201611	2191	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	First, the labor market.	13.0	108.0
201611	2192	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Nonfarm payroll employment has been continuing to grow at a good pace, averaging 178,000 per month so far this year.	13.0	108.0
201611	2193	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	There’s been one interesting development with respect to the employment data since our September meeting.	13.0	108.0
201611	2194	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The headlines about the 151,000 estimated net new hires in August were distinctly gloomy.	13.0	108.0
201611	2195	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Those about the 156,000 estimate of net new hires in September were neutral to positive, so much so that I was asked in an interview in mid-September whether the economy was now in a “Goldilocks” situation.	13.0	108.0
201611	2196	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I was tempted to answer “yes,” with the proviso that Goldilocks isn’t what he or she used to be [laughter], but instead switched the topic to the slow growth rate of GDP.	13.0	108.0
201611	2197	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	It’s not clear why public reactions to almost identical data between September and October were different, but whatever the reason, we need to emphasize that the rate of hiring required to prevent the unemployment rate from rising depends on changes in the participation rate, and that staff estimates of the required rate of hiring range between 75,000 and 150,000.	13.0	108.0
201611	2198	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Otherwise, we would be faced with unnecessary public and market disappointment about numbers that could, in fact, be fully consistent with the continuation of the strong performance of the labor market.	13.0	108.0
201611	2199	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Over the course of the past two years, we’ve been concerned about the effect of a variety of negative shocks on the US economy, including the Chinese devaluation, the market turbulence in the first six weeks of this year, the May pothole, Brexit, and more.	13.0	108.0
201611	2200	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	US employment has resumed robust growth after each temporary slowdown.	13.0	108.0
201611	2201	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	This has been, and continues to be, a powerful recovery in terms of one of our two main targets: employment.	13.0	108.0
201611	2202	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Second, inflation.	13.0	108.0
201611	2203	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We’ve not heard many complaints about the low rate of inflation from the general public.	13.0	108.0
201611	2204	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The 2 percent inflation target was set originally as a tradeoff between the many costs of positive inflation and the increased efficiency of reallocation in the labor market that a moderate rate of inflation makes possible.	13.0	108.0
201611	2205	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I do not recall that the costs associated with the greater probability of being at the ELB with a low rate of inflation was taken into account at the time.	13.0	108.0
201611	2206	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	It was the early and mid-1990s when the 2 percent inflation target started becoming the received wisdom.	13.0	108.0
201611	2207	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The core rate of PCE inflation has been increasing—slowly, to be sure—and is now close to our 2 percent target.	13.0	108.0
201611	2208	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	In view of the imprecision of our estimates of the optimal rate of inflation, we should be happy to be as close to the target as we are, particularly when the Phillips curve appears to be so flat.	13.0	108.0
201611	2209	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The CPI rate of core inflation has been above 2 percent, but that is not the inflation rate we target, even if it is the rate of inflation with which the public is most familiar.	13.0	108.0
201611	2210	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Further, the rate of nominal wage increase has been rising—an indication that the Phillips curve lives, if not with the same vigor as it has in the past.	13.0	108.0
201611	2211	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	On balance, I believe we are close to meeting our inflation target.	13.0	108.0
201611	2212	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Let me discuss a few other aspects of the inflation target.	13.0	108.0
201611	2213	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	One is the argument that because we set 2 percent as our target, that’s the number we have to hit if we are to remain credible.	13.0	108.0
201611	2214	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I give this argument some weight, though I do not believe we need to hit precisely 2 percent, and I believe that the public and the markets will treat small divergences both above and below 2 percent as consistent with our being credible.	13.0	108.0
201611	2215	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Taking into consideration the wide confidence interval associated with the economic costs of diverging from the 2 percent target, I still believe it would have been better to define an optimal range for the inflation rate, possibly 1.5 to 2.5 percent, rather than an optimal point estimate.	13.0	108.0
201611	2216	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Finally, on inflation, the jury is still out on whether there’s been a permanent downward revision in the level of r*, something that’s extremely difficult to predict, for the future is long and the standard deviation of r* is large.	13.0	108.0
201611	2217	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	However, as we’ve been saying, if r* remains low for a relatively long time, monetary policy will be constrained by the ELB during that period more frequently than in the past.	13.0	108.0
201611	2218	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Should we, therefore, raise the target inflation rate?	13.0	108.0
201611	2219	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Well, of course, the optimal rate of inflation is an area of active research and debate.	13.0	108.0
201611	2220	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	But actually changing the target rate is a serious matter not to be entered into lightly.	13.0	108.0
201611	2221	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	There are welfare costs associated with higher inflation, especially the advent of more widespread indexation, which kicks in at a relatively low rate of inflation.	13.0	108.0
201611	2222	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	There is, further, the credibility cost of changing the target inflation rate, something that done once becomes a permanent credibility-reducing part of history.	13.0	108.0
201611	2223	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	If such a step were nevertheless taken, it should include a formal mechanism for dealing with future changes in the target rate—for instance, the mechanism used by Canada in which the inflation target can, in principle, be reset every five years.	13.0	108.0
201611	2224	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	All this is to say that core PCE inflation is, indeed, approaching the 2 percent level, that real wages are rising more rapidly than earlier in the post–Great Recession period, and that we need to think very hard before changing the monetary framework to solve a problem that is likely to be solved within a year or two without changing the inflation target.	13.0	108.0
201611	2225	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Third, economic growth.	13.0	108.0
201611	2226	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Here I need to mention that I support everything that President Mester said about what happened at her directors’ meeting because I was there, and I was greatly struck by the fact that almost everyone there was complaining about some aspect of information technology.	13.0	108.0
201611	2227	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	There were the people who were in the automobile industry who were petrified about driverless cars.	13.0	108.0
201611	2228	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	There were guys in the retail industry who were petrified about Amazon, which was building some huge depot in—was it in Cleveland or in Pittsburgh?	13.0	108.0
201611	2229	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	In Cleveland.	13.0	999.0
201611	2230	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	In Cleveland, and that was going to put them all out of business.	13.0	108.0
201611	2231	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And they said, “There are no more malls being built.	13.0	108.0
201611	2232	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	All you have are strip malls.”	13.0	108.0
201611	2233	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	There have been only three malls built in the United States since the Great Recession, and that’s a result of the revolution that’s taking place in the retailing industry.	13.0	108.0
201611	2234	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	So I really began to wonder whether there’s something going on slowly in the background, and whether we’re sort of close to the 1990s solum line when a lot of thing are happening, but we’re not seeing much effect of them at this stage, and maybe it could happen later.	13.0	108.0
201611	2235	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you for the visit.	13.0	108.0
201611	2236	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	It was very interesting.	13.0	108.0
201611	2237	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Now, on economic growth, with a first estimate of third-quarter growth at 2.9 percent, it’s tempting to say that the period of very slow growth and negative productivity growth from which we’ve been suffering for several quarters should no longer be relevant to our thinking about the growth of the economy in the next few years.	13.0	108.0
201611	2238	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	That’s especially so, because the 2.9 percent real GDP growth was probably accompanied by positive productivity growth, and that estimated productivity growth could soon return to the 1¼ percent rate that the staff now regards as its long-run level.	13.0	108.0
201611	2239	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Well, those could be the directions in which data on, and expectations of, growth will move in the next quarter or two, but the data of one quarter do not make a trend.	13.0	108.0
201611	2240	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Tealbook A forecasts that total labor productivity will increase at a rate of 1.1 percent in 2017 and 2018 and 1.2 percent in 2019.	13.0	108.0
201611	2241	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We’ll have to wait and see whether that’s what happens—namely, whether productivity over the next few years will grow at a rate close to 1.1 percent or possibly even a little higher.	13.0	108.0
201611	2242	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And as we wait to see whether productivity growth increases, we’ll need to monitor the situation closely, to look at the details of growth, and be prepared to change policy in either direction should that become necessary.	13.0	108.0
201611	2243	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	If productivity growth, in fact, increases, we’ll have to remember the standard warning that the IMF dispenses when things are going well: Complacency must be avoided.	13.0	108.0
201611	2244	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	But, truth to tell, the FOMC is a committee that shows few signs of succumbing to the disease of complacency.	13.0	108.0
201611	2245	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	13.0	108.0
201611	2246	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The slow growth of the economy since the Great Recession is due mainly to the extremely low rate of productivity growth, for which the low rate of physical investment, despite the near-zero short-term interest rate, bears the significant share of the responsibility.	13.0	108.0
201611	2247	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	But there’s not much that we in the Federal Reserve can do that directly affects productivity growth except to maintain conditions conducive to investment and productivity growth—which one thought were low interest rates—by giving confidence to investors in the stability of the economy, especially the stability of the financial system, and by continuing to support the excellent research on productivity growth of several of our Federal Reserve economists.	13.0	108.0
201611	2248	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Now, each of us probably asks herself or himself from time to time why the outstanding employment performance of the economy in the period since the fall of Lehman Brothers and the essential role of the Federal Reserve in producing that result are so underappreciated.	13.0	108.0
201611	2249	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Well, almost certainly, the slow rate of real GDP growth during that period and the phenomena that indicate animal spirits are low are both important factors in this regard.	13.0	108.0
201611	2250	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	For some time, answers to two questions in public opinion surveys have presented an interesting contrast.	13.0	108.0
201611	2251	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Asked whether they’re satisfied or dissatisfied about the way things are going or similar questions, a large majority of the public is dissatisfied.	13.0	108.0
201611	2252	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Yet University of Michigan and Conference Board consumer satisfaction polls say that Americans are just as happy or optimistic as they were before the Great Recession.	13.0	108.0
201611	2253	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Ben Bernanke took up this contrast in a June blog and Alan Blinder wrote about it in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal on October 25.	13.0	108.0
201611	2254	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Ben concluded—and here I quote Alan Blinder’s article that agrees with Ben—that it “might be the increasingly shrill, partisan nature of our politics, not the state of the economy” that has so disappointed Americans, or, as the headline to Alan Blinder’s article says, “It’s Not the Economy, Stupid.	13.0	108.0
201611	2255	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	It’s the Political Gridlock.”	13.0	108.0
201611	2256	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	All that is by way of suggesting that people don’t feel as bad about the economy as many, certainly including me, have for some time felt that they do.	13.0	108.0
201611	2257	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, and more tomorrow.	13.0	108.0
201611	2258	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	2259	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	13.0	65.0
201611	2260	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201611	2261	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Since the previous FOMC meeting, there’s been a conceptual agreement, well documented or publicized, between OPEC nations to limit production levels, and we believe this agreement for a time has had some positive effect on oil prices.	13.0	110.0
201611	2262	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	However, on the basis of on discussions with our contacts, we believe that the details of this agreement may be very tough to work out.	13.0	110.0
201611	2263	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	And until the details are explicitly agreed upon, we are quite skeptical as to whether this agreement will ultimately translate into actual supply reductions among OPEC nations.	13.0	110.0
201611	2264	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Despite this backdrop, it continues to be our belief that global supply and demand are moving toward balance.	13.0	110.0
201611	2265	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	And while there’s some disagreement regarding the exact timing, we believe that the market should get into global balance during the first half of 2017.	13.0	110.0
201611	2266	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	This judgment, again, is based on our estimate that the growth of global supply is slowing and that global demand is growing at approximately 1.2 million barrels a day this year and should grow at a similar rate in 2017.	13.0	110.0
201611	2267	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	We believe that price volatility will persist, in view of the imperfect nature of supply–demand information in this market as well as the fact that excess inventories continue to stand at record levels.	13.0	110.0
201611	2268	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	But, while we expect continued price volatility, it’s likely to occur in an overall context of firming prices.	13.0	110.0
201611	2269	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	The rig count in Texas and across the nation is continuing to build, but based on discussions with our contacts, we believe the rig count will not accelerate until producers become more confident that oil prices can reach between $55 and $65 a barrel within the next year or two.	13.0	110.0
201611	2270	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Long-lived projects will take longer to be initiated, not only because they require higher breakeven oil prices but also because the priority for many integrated oil companies is to maintain their dividend levels rather than allocate resources to capital expenditures.	13.0	110.0
201611	2271	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	In the meantime, though, we expect more bankruptcies, mergers, and restructurings in the industry for the remainder of 2016, and, in fact, one significant one was announced this week.	13.0	110.0
201611	2272	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	And we see three reasons for this:  One, a number of companies are highly leveraged; two, the current market price is still below breakeven for many fields; and, three, lenders are increasingly focusing on cash flow versus asset values in decisions to extend credit.	13.0	110.0
201611	2273	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	In terms of the District, Texas employment growth was a bit under 1 percent at an annual rate over the first six months of 2016.	13.0	110.0
201611	2274	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Our forecast, though, is that the rate of job growth will rebound to approximately a 2 percent rate in the second half of this year and continue at a similar pace in 2017.	13.0	110.0
201611	2275	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	As headwinds from weak energy and a strong dollar continue to dissipate, we are seeing some stabilization and even modest growth in manufacturing as well as in exports from the State of Texas.	13.0	110.0
201611	2276	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Texas continues to benefit from migration of people and firms to the state.	13.0	110.0
201611	2277	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	In our surveys, the District is seeing not only building wage pressures in skilled trades in industries like construction, truck driving, nursing, IT, and the like but also broader evidence of labor shortages in the District.	13.0	110.0
201611	2278	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	The state’s high schools and colleges are increasingly offering skilled trade degrees to their students in an effort to address the state’s skills gap.	13.0	110.0
201611	2279	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	In addition, there’s a growing effort to address lagging educational attainment levels in the state by focusing on improving pre-K literacy levels for at-risk populations.	13.0	110.0
201611	2280	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	The Dallas Fed, as well as many other Federal Reserve Banks around this table, is playing an active leadership role in order to spur more of these efforts in our District.	13.0	110.0
201611	2281	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Regarding the nation, I have not materially changed my economic forecast since the previous meeting.	13.0	110.0
201611	2282	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	On the basis of our expectation of a strong US consumer, the Dallas Federal Reserve continues to estimate that GDP growth for the year will be somewhere between 1¾ and 2 percent.	13.0	110.0
201611	2283	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	We expect this growth to be sufficient to produce a further reduction in labor market slack in the economy.	13.0	110.0
201611	2284	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	The Dallas trimmed mean, as some of you have already noted, is currently running at approximately 1.7 percent—it’s been running at that level basically all year—and we continue to believe that we will gradually reach our 2 percent objective in the medium term.	13.0	110.0
201611	2285	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	The main focus for our research team and myself continues to be to try to understand several key persistent economic headwinds.	13.0	110.0
201611	2286	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	The first is aging demographics in the United States as well as in almost all other advanced economies.	13.0	110.0
201611	2287	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	The second trend we continue to try to understand is globalization, particularly excess global capacity and high levels of debt in China, which is having and will have an effect on global economic growth and inflation as well as creating vulnerability to periodic bouts of financial instability.	13.0	110.0
201611	2288	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	As Governor Fischer just mentioned, technology-enabled disruption is a third trend we are working heavily to try to understand.	13.0	110.0
201611	2289	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	In our view, it’s happening across almost every industry.	13.0	110.0
201611	2290	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	It’s having the effect of reducing pricing power, squeezing margins, and increasing uncertainty, which in turn is likely affecting the propensity of companies to allocate resources to capital expansion and capital spending.	13.0	110.0
201611	2291	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	And the last big trend is high levels of government debt to GDP across most major economies, which at a minimum is squeezing out the capacity for fiscal policy and other actions like infrastructure spending that could help improve GDP growth.	13.0	110.0
201611	2292	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	One last comment regarding business tone—and I guess I’ll refer to this as “CEO tone”— draws from discussions with CEOs in our District and some scattered CEOs across the nation.	13.0	110.0
201611	2293	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	At the previous meeting, I mentioned the issue of rising shareholder activism and the generally shorter investor time horizons that I’m observing.	13.0	110.0
201611	2294	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Let me say another word about this.	13.0	110.0
201611	2295	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	As Dennis Lockhart mentioned earlier, more money is going into passive funds—that’s well documented—with very low fees.	13.0	110.0
201611	2296	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	As a result, active managers who remain are under increasing pressure to outperform and justify high fees.	13.0	110.0
201611	2297	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	In that context, activism has increased because it’s a way for active managers to demonstrate outperformance.	13.0	110.0
201611	2298	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	It’s also putting much more pressure on active managers to show performance more quickly because they’re under regular pressure from the threat of investor redemptions.	13.0	110.0
201611	2299	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	This trend of shorter time frames and greater activism—combined with high rates of technology-enabled disruption, higher levels of regulation, and sluggish global demand—is making it tougher for CEOs to choose capital spending over share repurchase or dividends or cash mergers.	13.0	110.0
201611	2300	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	As I said in the September meeting, I think this trend is intensifying and, in my opinion, may be one reason why capital spending levels have been very sluggish and disappointing.	13.0	110.0
201611	2301	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I don’t see this trend reversing unless we experience higher rates of GDP growth or see potentially greater tax and other incentives for capital spending or both.	13.0	110.0
201611	2302	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201611	2303	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	2304	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	13.0	65.0
201611	2305	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201611	2306	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Over the intermeeting period, overall economic activity in the Third District continues to be a bit sluggish, with economic growth a bit below trend.	13.0	999.0
201611	2307	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Job growth continues to lag the nation, with year-over-year employment growth at a mere 0.4 percent in September, less than half that of the nation.	13.0	999.0
201611	2308	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	The unemployment rate remained at 5.5 percent, a full ½ percent higher than a year ago.	13.0	999.0
201611	2309	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	That said, the region’s higher unemployment rate is largely due to higher labor force participation than the nation as a whole, and almost all of the increase in regional unemployment has occurred in Pennsylvania.	13.0	999.0
201611	2310	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	In addition, the sectors facing the stiffest challenges remain mining and drilling in the Marcellus shale region, and job growth remains somewhat weak in manufacturing.	13.0	999.0
201611	2311	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Our region’s relatively weak labor market is reflected in our state coincident indexes that, with the exception of Delaware, are measurably less robust than the national average.	13.0	999.0
201611	2312	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	For example, over the 12 months ending in September, Pennsylvania’s coincident index increased 1.6 percent, compared with a 2.9 percent increase for the nation as a whole.	13.0	999.0
201611	2313	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Manufacturing activity, however, appears to be on a slight upward trend, with October’s general activity index in our Business Outlook Survey remaining in positive territory for the third straight month.	13.0	999.0
201611	2314	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	At 9.7 in October, the index is exactly at its nonrecessionary average.	13.0	999.0
201611	2315	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Both the new orders and shipments indexes are now in positive territory as well, but employment has yet to show signs of picking up.	13.0	999.0
201611	2316	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Survey respondents remain upbeat, with all of the forward-looking indexes showing substantial optimism.	13.0	999.0
201611	2317	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Now, while we’re not generally seeing strong growth in the region, a few areas of the District are doing modestly well.	13.0	999.0
201611	2318	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	One such area is auto sales, which are holding up at high levels, and the value of residential construction continues at a pace that is somewhat stronger than earlier in the year.	13.0	999.0
201611	2319	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Permits are also up, but that increase is largely due to, again, the multifamily sector of the market.	13.0	999.0
201611	2320	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Unlike the nation, we have yet to see any firming in single- family permits.	13.0	999.0
201611	2321	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Additionally, nonresidential construction has weakened a bit recently, and, like the nation, we are seeing less strength in our retail sector.	13.0	999.0
201611	2322	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Regarding Third District consumers, the pace of activity has diminished somewhat, which was reflected in the general activity index in our nonmanufacturing survey remaining slightly below its nonrecessionary average.	13.0	999.0
201611	2323	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	But consumer confidence remains high and retailers continue to be optimistic.	13.0	999.0
201611	2324	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Overall, the Third District is seeing, and should continue to see, steady if unspectacular economic growth, and contacts remain upbeat about the future.	13.0	999.0
201611	2325	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Turning to the nation as a whole, we appear to have gotten the bounceback in third- quarter activity that most of us were expecting, but the details were a bit weaker than the headline number, with growth in final sales not particularly robust.	13.0	999.0
201611	2326	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	I find little to disagree with in the Tealbook forecast, although I anticipate a bit more slowing in employment growth and a bit more of a pickup in inflation.	13.0	999.0
201611	2327	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Basically, I see the current unemployment rate at about its natural rate, and economic fundamentals are in line with continued consumption growth.	13.0	999.0
201611	2328	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	And I agree with the staff that growth in investment may turn positive.	13.0	999.0
201611	2329	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	But it could remain at troubling low levels.	13.0	999.0
201611	2330	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	My main worry remains the lack of productivity growth, as others have mentioned, without which it will be difficult to maintain our economic momentum.	13.0	999.0
201611	2331	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Overall, conditions remain consistent with a rate move this year, but I’ll return to that thought tomorrow.	13.0	999.0
201611	2332	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201611	2333	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	2334	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13.0	65.0
201611	2335	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	103.0
201611	2336	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	The 10th District economy continues to feel the effects of last year’s decline in energy and agricultural commodity prices.	13.0	103.0
201611	2337	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Job growth is modest or slipping in all of our states except Colorado, and unemployment in Oklahoma and Wyoming is now 1 full percentage point higher than a year ago.	13.0	103.0
201611	2338	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Tax revenues also continue to worsen in most District states, creating the potential for future drags on state and local government spending.	13.0	103.0
201611	2339	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Construction has slowed in the region, but office vacancies and the inventory of unsold homes remain low, and mortgage delinquencies in energy states have not shown any concerning increase.	13.0	103.0
201611	2340	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Agricultural commodity prices also remain low and have continued to weigh on farm income, farm spending, and economic activity in rural parts of the District.	13.0	103.0
201611	2341	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	On the positive side, consumer spending is rising in most District states, and capital spending plans have improved moderately outside of the ag sector.	13.0	103.0
201611	2342	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Our manufacturing survey posted its second consecutive expansionary reading in October, the first back-to-back increase in almost two years, due in part to a somewhat brighter outlook in the energy sector.	13.0	103.0
201611	2343	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Current oil prices are around the level firms say they need, on average, to be profitable, and energy firms in our region have continued to modestly increase drilling activity and are planning further expansion in 2017.	13.0	103.0
201611	2344	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	My outlook for the national economy is little changed since September.	13.0	103.0
201611	2345	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	I continue to expect a moderate pace of economic growth led by consumer spending.	13.0	103.0
201611	2346	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Business fixed investment is also likely to begin making a modest contribution to output growth, as the recent rise in energy prices support new drilling activities, with additional oil rigs contributing to investment in structures.	13.0	103.0
201611	2347	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Recent data on shipments and orders for core capital goods also suggest some gains in equipment investment.	13.0	103.0
201611	2348	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Labor markets appear well positioned to support consumer-led growth.	13.0	103.0
201611	2349	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Nonfarm payrolls have grown, resulting in nearly 2.5 million new jobs on net.	13.0	103.0
201611	2350	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Nominal wage growth has picked up this year, with the Atlanta Fed Wage Growth Tracker indicating median wage growth above 3 percent for all of 2016 and accelerating in recent months.	13.0	103.0
201611	2351	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Most recently, it nearly matches the pace of wage gains at the peak of the last expansion.	13.0	103.0
201611	2352	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Perhaps most encouraging is that the labor force has increased by 3 million since September 2015, which is the strongest growth in the labor force since 2000.	13.0	103.0
201611	2353	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	This solid growth in the labor force over the past year is a welcome development.	13.0	103.0
201611	2354	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	But as Governor Tarullo highlighted, the increase in the labor force does not reflect a strong pull of workers from the sidelines into the labor market.	13.0	103.0
201611	2355	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	In fact, the number of labor market entrants has slowed from 6.7 million in September 2015 to 6½ million entrants in September of this year.	13.0	103.0
201611	2356	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	On the other hand, the number of people exiting the labor force over the past year has declined substantially.	13.0	103.0
201611	2357	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Over the past year, the number of workers exiting has fallen from 6.6 million to 6.2 million.	13.0	103.0
201611	2358	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Therefore, the growth in the labor force largely reflects slowing in outflows of workers rather than an increase in the flow of workers coming in from the sidelines.	13.0	103.0
201611	2359	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	The decline in exits suggests workers are now more attached to the labor force compared with earlier years in the recovery.	13.0	103.0
201611	2360	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, I see inflation advancing toward the 2 percent goal, supported by higher energy prices.	13.0	103.0
201611	2361	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Headline inflation increased at an annual rate of 2.1 percent over the past six months compared with 1.3 percent over the past 12 months.	13.0	103.0
201611	2362	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased, as have flows into investments offering inflation protection.	13.0	103.0
201611	2363	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	13.0	103.0
201611	2364	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	2365	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13.0	65.0
201611	2366	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201611	2367	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	The narrative on which I would premise a near-term increase in the policy rate anticipates GDP growth in the neighborhood of 2 percent for the medium term.	13.0	88.0
201611	2368	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	This modest pace of growth ought to be sufficient to absorb any remaining slack in labor markets and provide support for nudging inflation up to target.	13.0	88.0
201611	2369	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I believe my outlook is in the mainstream of this Committee, and it is broadly consistent with the forecast presented in this meeting’s Tealbook.	13.0	88.0
201611	2370	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Although Friday’s third-quarter GDP report carried mixed messages, the top-line number in last week’s GDP report was in line with my expectation of a stronger second half.	13.0	88.0
201611	2371	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	The uneven composition of growth was attention getting, but Friday’s GDP report did not set off any alarm bells, in my estimation.	13.0	88.0
201611	2372	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I would say that, overall, I’m satisfied the economy remains on narrative.	13.0	88.0
201611	2373	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	The third-quarter personal consumption number was soft but on the heels of second- quarter strength.	13.0	88.0
201611	2374	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Consumer-savvy contacts in my District reported for the most part that consumer spending continues to grow at a moderate pace.	13.0	88.0
201611	2375	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Most expect flat-to-slightly-higher holiday sales.	13.0	88.0
201611	2376	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	One contact offered that consumers are tending to make their purchases later in the holiday shopping season, the implication being that we may not know much about holiday sales results until rather late in December.	13.0	88.0
201611	2377	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Translating to the Committee’s concerns, we may not have much of a read on fourth-quarter spending at our December meeting.	13.0	88.0
201611	2378	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	It’s widely recognized that online retailers are experiencing strong sales at the expense of their mostly brick-and-mortar competitors.	13.0	88.0
201611	2379	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	In response to this trend, our director from a large global package delivery company reported adding a record number of new jumbo jet aircraft to the company’s fleet and aggressively expanding its number of facilities.	13.0	88.0
201611	2380	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	This encouraging business investment report was in contrast, however, to most of what we heard over the past few weeks.	13.0	88.0
201611	2381	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Business investment continues to be soft, particularly in the bellwether equipment spending category.	13.0	88.0
201611	2382	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Most reports confirm the signal coming from the data.	13.0	88.0
201611	2383	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding net exports, we did not pick up in our interviews this cycle any expectation of ongoing strength in exports.	13.0	88.0
201611	2384	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I think Friday’s result is best interpreted as a one-off quarter of better numbers, not a trend.	13.0	88.0
201611	2385	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	The soybean factor was apparently decisive.	13.0	88.0
201611	2386	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m looking for a headline:  “Export Report Full of Beans.”	13.0	88.0
201611	2387	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	[Laughter]	13.0	88.0
201611	2388	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Our District soundings for unemployment and labor market conditions continue to be suggestive of a tightening market, and businesses still report little in the way of pricing power.	13.0	88.0
201611	2389	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	I consider the risks to be balanced, and, to summarize, neither our interpretation of the incoming data nor the economic intelligence collected in my District have challenged my basic narrative enough to reconsider a policy move at this or the next meeting.	13.0	88.0
201611	2390	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201611	2391	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	2392	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	13.0	65.0
201611	2393	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	111.0
201611	2394	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Employers in the Ninth District continue to report trouble finding workers.	13.0	111.0
201611	2395	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	There is some anecdotal evidence that wages for low-skilled jobs are rising.	13.0	111.0
201611	2396	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	For example, some lower-skilled health-care positions have moved from about $12 an hour to between $14 and $15 an hour in the past year.	13.0	111.0
201611	2397	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	We’ve also heard that jobs at customer service centers have seen wages go up from $12 to $14 an hour to about $16 to $18 an hour.	13.0	111.0
201611	2398	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Meanwhile, inflation pressures have remained muted.	13.0	111.0
201611	2399	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Looking nationally, Friday’s GDP release contains little evidence to me and our staff of strong forward momentum in the US economy.	13.0	111.0
201611	2400	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	The headline GDP number for Q3 was decent, but, as many others have noted, domestic demand came in weak and fixed investment continues to decline, signaling little business confidence.	13.0	111.0
201611	2401	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	With 1.1 percent real GDP growth in the first half, overall growth for 2016 is likely to be subpar, even for the post-recession period.	13.0	111.0
201611	2402	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	When I turn to inflation, the news is somewhat better.	13.0	111.0
201611	2403	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	The latest data show a small uptick in core PCE inflation, which I’m happy about.	13.0	111.0
201611	2404	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Core inflation in Q3 came in at 1.7 percent, and the Tealbook has marked up the both 2016 and 2017 core PCE projections from 1.6 to 1.7 percent.	13.0	111.0
201611	2405	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Market-based inflation expectations have also ticked up recently.	13.0	111.0
201611	2406	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Meanwhile, wage growth remains moderate.	13.0	111.0
201611	2407	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Now, these are welcome developments, but I, like many of you, am also concerned that both market- and survey-based measures of inflation expectations remain extremely low by historical standards.	13.0	111.0
201611	2408	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	For me, I don’t know whether this uptick is a signal or noise.	13.0	111.0
201611	2409	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I hope it’s a signal, but I’d like to see more evidence before I draw any firm conclusions.	13.0	111.0
201611	2410	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Meanwhile, in the global economy, world inflation and global economic growth remain subdued.	13.0	111.0
201611	2411	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Now, regarding the labor market, US employment continues to rise strongly.	13.0	111.0
201611	2412	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	The optimistic narrative that I and several of us around the table have been emphasizing this year is that the United States can continue to add a lot of jobs without driving unemployment uncomfortably low as long as we can keep adding to the labor force, which we’ve been doing.	13.0	111.0
201611	2413	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	The headline rate even ticked up just slightly.	13.0	111.0
201611	2414	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	This has been the story over the past 12 months, a period during which the unemployment rate has barely budged, while prime-age labor force participation, ignoring demographic effects, has risen about 1 percentage point.	13.0	111.0
201611	2415	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	So the big question for me is, how much longer can this play out?	13.0	111.0
201611	2416	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Prime-age labor force participation fell very sharply during the recession, and it’s still about 1½ percentage points below where it was in the mid-2000s.	13.0	111.0
201611	2417	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Prime-age male labor force participation is also very low in the United States compared with most other OECD countries.	13.0	111.0
201611	2418	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	So there’s a very real possibility—it’s not impossible—that prime-age labor force participation could continue to rise back to levels seen in the 2000s.	13.0	111.0
201611	2419	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	If prime-age labor force participation rose another 1 percentage point over the next 12 months, as it did over the past 12 months, that would be another 1.25 million Americans in the labor force.	13.0	111.0
201611	2420	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	And many people around the table have said the narrative is about people reentering the labor force.	13.0	111.0
201611	2421	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	It’s not that.	13.0	111.0
201611	2422	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	It’s people not leaving.	13.0	111.0
201611	2423	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I’ll take it either way, and I know all of you agree.	13.0	111.0
201611	2424	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Either way, it’s a net positive for the country.	13.0	111.0
201611	2425	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	My conclusion is, my baseline outlook is more of the same:  modest GDP growth, subdued inflation.	13.0	111.0
201611	2426	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	It’s very possible we’ll see continued decent job growth supported by rising labor force participation without seeing much in terms of inflation.	13.0	111.0
201611	2427	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Again, we just don’t know, and until I start seeing some signs of that process petering out, I’d like to give it more time to run.	13.0	111.0
201611	2428	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Overall, risks remain tilted to the downside.	13.0	111.0
201611	2429	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	We’re currently not well placed to respond to the next negative shock that pushes us back onto the lower bound.	13.0	111.0
201611	2430	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	13.0	111.0
201611	2431	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201611	2432	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13.0	65.0
201611	2433	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201611	2434	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	On the economic growth side, I’m pretty much with everyone else.	13.0	96.0
201611	2435	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I anticipate that the economy will continue to expand at a slightly above-trend pace.	13.0	96.0
201611	2436	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I agree with others that Q3 GDP probably overstates that strength a bit because of the big rise in exports, which was so narrowly based on the soybean factor, and because we had a sharp swing from inventory liquidation back to accumulation, which probably won’t be repeated in the fourth quarter.	13.0	96.0
201611	2437	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	When I look at the economy, I think the good news is that it seems to be relatively well balanced.	13.0	96.0
201611	2438	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The drag arising from the collapse in oil and gas drilling activity looks to be over.	13.0	96.0
201611	2439	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Household income is rising.	13.0	96.0
201611	2440	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The household saving rate and household balance sheets appear supportive of continued gains in consumption.	13.0	96.0
201611	2441	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Both residential and nonresidential investment seems likely to expand gradually, with, presumably, business fixed investment getting some lift once the uncertainty surrounding next week’s election is resolved.	13.0	96.0
201611	2442	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Of course, it depends on how that uncertainty is resolved.	13.0	96.0
201611	2443	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I’ll have more on that in a minute.	13.0	96.0
201611	2444	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	At the same time, I don’t see what would cause the economy to expand much more quickly.	13.0	96.0
201611	2445	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Cyclically, the expansion seems to be relatively mature at this point.	13.0	96.0
201611	2446	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So, for example, if you look at cyclical sectors such as motor vehicles, they seem close to their cycle peaks.	13.0	96.0
201611	2447	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Housing, though, seems to be a bit of an exception, and why housing starts aren’t stronger is a little unclear to me.	13.0	96.0
201611	2448	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the election, the concern of market participants appears to be the tail risk—either a sweep by the Democrats or a sweep by the Republicans.	13.0	96.0
201611	2449	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	We had our buy-side advisory group in a couple of weeks ago, and the prevailing view was that if we had control by either party of both the Congress and the White House, that would increase uncertainty and would lead to an equity market selloff.	13.0	96.0
201611	2450	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	In contrast, if current expectations were realized—a Clinton victory and a Republican House, with the Senate uncertain—the view among this group was generally on the side that this would be considered a continuation of the status quo and there wouldn’t be much of a market response.	13.0	96.0
201611	2451	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	There does also seem to be, however, some sentiment that, regardless of the outcome, the Congress would be more willing to move forward with an infrastructure spending program.	13.0	96.0
201611	2452	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	And that’s interesting, because fiscal policy is really not on such a great path.	13.0	96.0
201611	2453	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	But if you add an infrastructure spending program on top of that, the fiscal situation may start to reemerge as an issue.	13.0	96.0
201611	2454	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	It is very quiescent today because interest rates are low, and people don’t see any negative consequence of that.	13.0	96.0
201611	2455	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	If we actually normalize interest rates over time, then the net interest cost on the government debt will start to go back up, and that’ll be another burden.	13.0	96.0
201611	2456	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think the confidence in the sustainability of the fiscal path today is much overstated relative to the path that we’re actually on.	13.0	96.0
201611	2457	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I thought it was interesting that, in New Jersey, we had legislation to raise the gasoline tax by $0.23 per gallon to fund the transportation infrastructure program.	13.0	96.0
201611	2458	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	And the fact that it went through is probably an interesting leading indicator that there is actually more voter support for greater infrastructure spending in this country.	13.0	96.0
201611	2459	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	On the inflation side, I do take some signal from the slight firming in the core inflation trajectory and the fact that some market-based measures of inflation compensation have firmed in recent weeks.	13.0	96.0
201611	2460	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this development does help support the case for tightening monetary policy at our next meeting in December, assuming that the economy stays close to its current trajectory.	13.0	96.0
201611	2461	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	However, I don’t think that there’s any great urgency to tightening.	13.0	96.0
201611	2462	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The economy is growing at only a slightly above-trend pace.	13.0	96.0
201611	2463	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Inflation is still below our target.	13.0	96.0
201611	2464	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	There still may be some excess slack in the labor market, judging from the fact that the above-trend payroll growth hasn’t caused any downward movement in the unemployment rate this year.	13.0	96.0
201611	2465	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	And the pickup in nominal wage growth—I think there has been a pickup—has been very modest.	13.0	96.0
201611	2466	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I thought the third-quarter employment cost index release was interesting in the sense that it showed a 2.3 percent year-over-year rise in total compensation, which was not an acceleration from the previous quarter.	13.0	96.0
201611	2467	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	And 2.3 percent is not a very high rate of increase in employee compensation.	13.0	96.0
201611	2468	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, judging from the modest forward momentum in the economy, it doesn’t look like our nominal federal funds rate target is very far below a neutral monetary policy setting.	13.0	96.0
201611	2469	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I judge the gap today as only about 100 to 150 basis points.	13.0	96.0
201611	2470	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	And that’s a gap we could close relatively quickly, should that prove necessary.	13.0	96.0
201611	2471	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So the lack of urgency implies that there is not a good case for moving at this meeting.	13.0	96.0
201611	2472	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	To do so with the election a week away, the outcome uncertain, and no scheduled press conference would imply an urgency to move that I just don’t think is consistent with the incoming information or the economic outlook.	13.0	96.0
201611	2473	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201611	2474	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks, everyone, for an interesting discussion of the outlook and the risks.	13.0	65.0
201611	2475	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And, if I might, I’d like to wrap up the go-round with some of my own comments on recent data, the near-term outlook, and their implications for our policy actions in December and into next year.	13.0	65.0
201611	2476	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Although we haven’t received much data since our September meeting, what we have received suggests that labor market conditions continue to improve.	13.0	65.0
201611	2477	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Payrolls rose almost 160,000 in September, only a little slower than the roughly 180,000 per month pace seen since the start of the year and well above their longer-run trend.	13.0	65.0
201611	2478	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Labor force participation has continued to move sideways, a favorable development in light of the downward pressure from demographic trends and one that’s allowed the unemployment rate to remain close to 5 percent for the past year amid solid job growth.	13.0	65.0
201611	2479	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Along most other dimensions, labor market conditions are little changed this year.	13.0	65.0
201611	2480	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	The broad U-6 measure of unemployment continues to move sideways, as have JOLTS measures of job openings, hires, separations, and quits.	13.0	65.0
201611	2481	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Business survey readings on net hiring plans and the difficulty of filling jobs have also been flat since January.	13.0	65.0
201611	2482	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	However, household perceptions of job availability have trended up since the start of the year, as has the employment-to-population ratio.	13.0	65.0
201611	2483	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	So, where does that leave us?	13.0	65.0
201611	2484	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	So far, I see few signs of overheating in the labor market.	13.0	65.0
201611	2485	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Reports of worker shortages have increased, particularly for certain occupations and in some sectors.	13.0	65.0
201611	2486	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And in response to a tighter labor market, wage growth has picked up somewhat from a year ago.	13.0	65.0
201611	2487	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Nevertheless, wage gains remain moderate overall, with average hourly earnings and the ECI rising only 2.6 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, over the past 12 months.	13.0	65.0
201611	2488	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	For these and other reasons, I continue to believe that some modest amount of slack remains, and that we should welcome a limited degree of further tightening, particularly with inflation still running below 2 percent.	13.0	65.0
201611	2489	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, I continue to put some weight on the possibility of letting the economy run a bit hot for a time—and let me emphasize here that I mean “hot” in the sense of allowing the unemployment rate to decline a little bit below current estimates of its natural rate—a path that is exactly consistent with the median unemployment projection in our September SEP.	13.0	65.0
201611	2490	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Allowing the economy to run hot in that sense could have favorable supply-side effects, as I noted in a recent speech.	13.0	65.0
201611	2491	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And I was interested that several of you, in your own comments, mentioned the increased efforts that you’ve seen firms make in terms of investing in training and hiring workers who were less skilled and investing in them so that they can occupy jobs for which they’re not able to hire the people with the skills they’d ideally like.	13.0	65.0
201611	2492	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I consider that kind of investment in workforce training and upgrading to be exactly an example of the kind of favorable supply-side effect that I think you would expect to see in a tight labor market.	13.0	65.0
201611	2493	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	But I don’t want to overstate my expectations on this score.	13.0	65.0
201611	2494	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	In the case of the participation rate, I don’t expect it to remain flat for much longer, in view of research within and outside the Federal Reserve suggesting that the current rate is near its longer-run trend, which is clearly headed down.	13.0	65.0
201611	2495	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And, although involuntary part-time employment remains well above its pre-crisis level, I cannot be sure that structural change over the past decade has not resulted in a new, higher norm.	13.0	65.0
201611	2496	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	In light of the uncertainties we face, I would not be especially surprised to see the unemployment rate fall sharply over the next few months even though my baseline forecast has labor utilization tightening more gradually than that.	13.0	65.0
201611	2497	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	This possibility and the fact that monetary policy operates with a lag limit how far we can safely go in probing the economy’s ability to absorb relatively rapid employment growth.	13.0	65.0
201611	2498	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Although we have discovered over the past year that we have somewhat more “running room” than we might have expected regarding the pace at which we need to tighten, the extra room is only so great and could quickly disappear.	13.0	65.0
201611	2499	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I will now turn to real activity more broadly.	13.0	65.0
201611	2500	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	The incoming data have been somewhat mixed but, on balance, suggest that the economy is continuing to expand at a moderate pace.	13.0	65.0
201611	2501	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Although real GDP rose at an annual rate of almost 3 percent in the third quarter, a robust pace by recent standards, much of that strength reflected what’s probably a transitory swing in inventory investment.	13.0	65.0
201611	2502	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And, overall, as several of you noted, real GDP growth was boosted by a surge in soybean exports.	13.0	65.0
201611	2503	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	In other categories of spending, conditions were relatively lackluster.	13.0	65.0
201611	2504	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Growth in consumer spending slowed appreciably from the rapid pace seen earlier in the year and by more than the staff expected.	13.0	65.0
201611	2505	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	The recovery in residential construction seems to have stalled out for reasons that are not clear—raising questions about the sector’s future prospects even if mortgage rates remain low—and business investment continued to be surprisingly soft.	13.0	65.0
201611	2506	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	If we cut through the quarterly ups and downs, real GDP growth over the past year was quite mediocre, only 1½ percent.	13.0	65.0
201611	2507	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I hope we will see some step-up in coming quarters.	13.0	65.0
201611	2508	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Consumer spending is likely to continue to grow at a moderate pace, supported by ongoing employment gains, previous increases in wealth, and low interest rates.	13.0	65.0
201611	2509	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Business investment may also pick up now that drilling activity has finally bottomed out and is starting to rise again.	13.0	65.0
201611	2510	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	But with the dollar still elevated and only lackluster economic growth abroad, there’s not much reason to expect a lot of support from net exports.	13.0	65.0
201611	2511	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Overall, real GDP growth will probably run in the vicinity of 2 percent in coming quarters, enough to keep employment rising somewhat faster than its long-run trend as long as productivity growth continues to be anemic.	13.0	65.0
201611	2512	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Under these conditions, r* is likely to remain low for the foreseeable future.	13.0	65.0
201611	2513	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Regarding inflation, the recent news has been encouraging.	13.0	65.0
201611	2514	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Both headline and core consumer prices have come in somewhat higher than expected in recent months.	13.0	65.0
201611	2515	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, spot oil prices have moved up recently and will almost certainly put significant upward pressure on consumer energy prices in the next few months.	13.0	65.0
201611	2516	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And because the dollar has been stable for some time, core import prices are now rising at a moderate rate rather than falling.	13.0	65.0
201611	2517	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	On the basis of this information, the staff now projects that by the time of the December meeting, the data in hand will show overall PCE prices rising almost 1½ percent on a 12-month basis, with core PCE prices up about 1¾ percent from a year earlier.	13.0	65.0
201611	2518	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Such price increases would represent considerable progress toward our inflation objective since we first raised the federal funds rate late last year.	13.0	65.0
201611	2519	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	At that time, headline PCE inflation was running below ½ percent, and core inflation was only a little above 1¼ percent.	13.0	65.0
201611	2520	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, only time will tell whether these encouraging developments will continue into 2017 and be followed by further progress over time.	13.0	65.0
201611	2521	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	The recent firming of core PCE inflation may signal a persistent acceleration in prices, but it also could represent the transitory effects of special factors such as movements in nonmarket prices.	13.0	65.0
201611	2522	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And we cannot rule out the possibility that developments abroad could again put upward pressure on the dollar and cause oil prices to fall, thereby restraining inflation for a considerable time.	13.0	65.0
201611	2523	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	That said, developments this year have increased my confidence that, with the unemployment rate likely to run a bit below its estimated longer-run level, inflation will move back to 2 percent over the next couple of years.	13.0	65.0
201611	2524	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Let me conclude with a few observations on some of the issues we will face in coming weeks.	13.0	65.0
201611	2525	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	If the data come in about as the staff expects, I think it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate in December.	13.0	65.0
201611	2526	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Employment will have been increasing at a solid pace, accompanied by moderate GDP growth, and inflation will be up noticeably from where it stood when we first raised the federal funds rate.	13.0	65.0
201611	2527	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Furthermore, I anticipate that an increase would be appropriate even if the data come in a little on the weak side over the next few weeks.	13.0	65.0
201611	2528	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	For me, it would take something quite surprising to merit leaving the federal funds rate unchanged in December.	13.0	65.0
201611	2529	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	We’re in a good position to move in December from a communications standpoint.	13.0	65.0
201611	2530	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Market participants currently place the likelihood of a hike at either the November or December meeting at 70 percent.	13.0	65.0
201611	2531	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	This figure strikes me as about right, against the background of the many unexpected things that can happen in this world.	13.0	65.0
201611	2532	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	So we shouldn’t expect and shouldn’t want market participants to view a December move as completely “baked in the cake.”	13.0	65.0
201611	2533	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I think the language of alternative B should succeed in communicating our expectation that we expect to move but are preserving our options, and thus it should not have a marked influence on market expectations in either direction.	13.0	65.0
201611	2534	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	At this point, I’m not overly concerned that the market may misinterpret a December increase as a signal that we no longer intend to move gradually and proceed cautiously in adjusting policy in pursuit of our employment and inflation goals.	13.0	65.0
201611	2535	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Our actions over the past year have amply demonstrated that this Committee is prepared to be patient and will not tighten unless and until it is appropriate to do so.	13.0	65.0
201611	2536	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Nevertheless, we will need to monitor market reactions carefully to make sure that our intentions and strategy are understood.	13.0	65.0
201611	2537	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there.	13.0	65.0
201611	2538	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I think we have plenty of time tomorrow for our policy round, and I think maybe we could stop and have the reception.	53.0	65.0
201611	2539	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Dinner will be ready at 5:30.	53.0	65.0
201611	2540	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	However, let me just mention before we break for dinner that, unfortunately, this dinner will need to be our last regular such event on the evening of the first day of an FOMC meeting.	53.0	65.0
201611	2541	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	As many of you know, the Martin Building is going to be closed starting in December for renovation, so, unfortunately, this is our last regular, normal dinner gathering.	53.0	65.0
201611	2542	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The last supper.	53.0	96.0
201611	2543	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	53.0	96.0
201611	2544	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	“For some time”?	53.0	81.0
201611	2545	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	“An extended period.”	53.0	65.0
201611	2546	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	53.0	65.0
201611	2547	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I appreciate it—thanks.	53.0	81.0
201611	2548	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I knew there was some guidance there.	53.0	81.0
201611	2549	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	It won’t be as long as “extended period” turned out to be.	53.0	65.0
201611	2550	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	We’re hoping for sooner.	53.0	65.0
201611	2551	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	We will reassemble tomorrow at 9:00.	53.0	65.0
201611	2553	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	November 2 Session .	53.0	65.0
201611	2554	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	53.0	65.0
201611	2555	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s get started.	53.0	65.0
201611	2556	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I first want to call on Eric Engen for a brief report on this morning’s data.	11.0	65.0
201611	2557	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201611	2558	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	This morning ADP, in its employment report, estimated that private-sector employment increased 147,000 in October.	11.0	999.0
201611	2559	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	That was very close to our Tealbook forecast of a gain of 150,000, which includes an effect of Hurricane Matthew of minus 10,000, as the hurricane hit during the reference week.	11.0	999.0
201611	2560	2016-11-02	meeting	ENGEN	So the ADP report is very much in line with what we’re expecting will come out on Friday for private-sector employment.	11.0	999.0
201611	2561	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	11.0	65.0
201611	2562	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Let me now turn things over to Thomas for a monetary policy briefing.	21.0	65.0
201611	2563	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201611	2564	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	I’ll be referring to the handout labeled “Material for the Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21.0	999.0
201611	2565	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	As you know, the market currently places roughly two-thirds odds on an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate by the end of this year.	21.0	999.0
201611	2566	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	These odds are significantly higher than the perceived probability, a year ago, of liftoff occurring at the December 2015 meeting.	21.0	999.0
201611	2567	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	No doubt an important contributor to the market’s greater conviction of a rate increase by year-end has been the cumulative progress toward the Committee’s policy objectives, the reduction of near-term risks to the outlook, and the Committee’s acknowledgment in September’s postmeeting statement that the case for an increase in the funds rate had strengthened.	21.0	999.0
201611	2568	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	The drafts of alternatives B and C recognize further progress toward the Committee’s employment objective by reporting that “although the unemployment rate is little changed in recent months, job gains have been solid.”	21.0	999.0
201611	2569	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	In addition, those alternatives not only note the increase in inflation since earlier in the year, but also recognize the likelihood of slightly higher near-term inflation by deleting the earlier statement that “inflation is expected to remain low in the near term.”	21.0	999.0
201611	2570	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	As Eric pointed out in his briefing, the staff revised up its near-term inflation projection in response to the recent rise in energy prices and somewhat higher-than-expected readings on core prices.	21.0	999.0
201611	2571	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative A, by contrast, makes no reference to the increase in inflation.	21.0	999.0
201611	2572	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Regarding the longer-run outlook for inflation, the upper-left panel of the exhibit shows that the risk-neutral probability distribution of headline CPI inflation over the next 10 years implied by inflation caps and floors now shows somewhat greater probability of CPI inflation above 2.5 percent than was the case before your previous meeting and somewhat lower probability of CPI inflation below 1.5 percent.	21.0	999.0
201611	2573	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	In addition, far-forward inflation compensation, which we showed in Monday’s pre-FOMC briefing, has moved up about 20 basis points over the intermeeting period, a change that is highlighted in the drafts of alternatives B and C and that likely reflects, in part, less concern among investors about the risk of a combination of low inflation and low economic growth.	21.0	999.0
201611	2574	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	The staff projects only a temporary boost to headline inflation from recent energy price increases, followed by a gradual return of inflation from below to 2 percent over the next four years.	21.0	999.0
201611	2575	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Accordingly, the drafts of alternatives B and C acknowledge that, even with the increase in inflation since the beginning of the year, inflation is still running below the Committee’s 2 percent objective but is anticipated to rise to 2 percent over the medium term.	21.0	999.0
201611	2576	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative A emphasizes that the return to 2 percent inflation is expected to be gradual.	21.0	999.0
201611	2577	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	However, as discussed in one of the alternative scenarios in Tealbook A, a more rapid and persistent increase in inflation above 2 percent is certainly a possibility—in fact, the inflation path generated by the “Higher Labor Costs” scenario lies well within the 70 percent confidence interval around the baseline projection.	21.0	999.0
201611	2578	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	As indicated in the upper-right panel, the remainder of my briefing examines two potential implications of such an outcome in which inflation is persistently ½ percentage point above baseline: First, how would that higher inflation path, in hindsight, affect your assessment of the stance of monetary policy today?	21.0	999.0
201611	2579	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	And, second, how would it affect not only the path of the federal funds rate, but also financial conditions more broadly?	21.0	999.0
201611	2580	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	To address the first question—how you might change your assessment of the stance of monetary policy today—I am focusing on how much an unfolding of higher inflation outcomes over the next three years would alter your estimate of the neutral federal funds rate at the current juncture.	21.0	999.0
201611	2581	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	To obtain a benchmark against which to assess how the revision to the inflation outlook would affect your current assessment of the neutral rate, I compute the Laubach–Williams estimate of r*, treating the medians of your September SEP forecasts through 2019 as data.	21.0	999.0
201611	2582	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Note that the r* estimates so obtained differ from the SEP-implied r* estimates I presented most recently in my briefing in September, because the estimates presented here use the Laubach–Williams model’s internal estimate of resource utilization rather than the measure inferred from your projected unemployment rate gaps.	21.0	999.0
201611	2583	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	As shown by the green line in the middle-left panel, if the economy evolved over the next three years in line with the SEP medians, this measure of r* would remain near its current estimate of ¼ percent.	21.0	999.0
201611	2584	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	In addition, the estimate of its current value would be nearly unrevised in hindsight, as shown by the proximity of the green and black lines in mid- 2016.	21.0	999.0
201611	2585	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	The middle-right panel shows the path of inflation in the “Higher Labor Costs” scenario when applying the shocks that generate this scenario to the medians of the September SEP forecasts instead of the current Tealbook projection.	21.0	999.0
201611	2586	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	The gap between the two inflation paths widens to about 0.6 percentage point by 2019.	21.0	999.0
201611	2587	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	When using this inflation path, together with the paths of real GDP and the federal funds rate associated with this scenario, as data and re-estimating the Laubach–Williams measure, the path of r*, shown as the blue dashed line in the middle left, shifts up about 25 basis points over the recent history and the projection period.	21.0	999.0
201611	2588	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Thus, if using the real rate gap implied by the Laubach–Williams estimate as a measure of the stance of monetary policy, this alternative scenario would lead in hindsight to only a modest reassessment of the stance of monetary policy.	21.0	999.0
201611	2589	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	The response of the federal funds rate embedded in this scenario is determined by applying the inertial Taylor (1999) rule to the deviations of variables from the SEP baseline.	21.0	999.0
201611	2590	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	As noted in the lower-left panel, the federal funds rate rises to 3 percent by the end of 2019, nearly ½ percentage point above the baseline.	21.0	999.0
201611	2591	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	This funds rate path is importantly conditioned on the transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions embedded in the FRB/US model, including the transmission to longer- term yields and the exchange value of the dollar.	21.0	999.0
201611	2592	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	In particular, the FRB/US model predicts only a muted response of term premiums, and hence longer-term interest rates, to such a scenario.	21.0	999.0
201611	2593	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Due to the gradual response of the federal funds rate and longer-term interest rates, the inflation shock turns out to be highly persistent.	21.0	999.0
201611	2594	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	But would the market response to such an inflation surprise be as subdued as envisaged by the FRB/US model?	21.0	999.0
201611	2595	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	The red line in the lower-right panel shows that the staff’s estimate of the term premium component of the 10-year Treasury yield remains quite depressed.	21.0	999.0
201611	2596	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	This depressed level is due in part to the ongoing effects from the duration risk on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, but much of it presumably reflects the value of longer-term nominal assets as a hedge in an environment of low inflation and in which short-term rates remain near the lower bound.	21.0	999.0
201611	2597	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	A decomposition of the change in the 10-year Treasury yield over the period from June 2014 to June 2016, a period that saw a major disinflationary shock, suggests that roughly 50 of the 70 basis point overall decline of the 10-year yield is due to a decline in the term premium.	21.0	999.0
201611	2598	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Accordingly, if investors came to expect a persistent change in the inflation outlook, as implied by this scenario, the past declines of term premiums could unwind rapidly, leading to a stronger transmission from changes in the policy rate to longer- term interest rates than assumed in the FRB/US model simulation.	21.0	999.0
201611	2599	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	A substantial increase in US longer-term interest rates would in turn likely be associated with dollar appreciation.	21.0	999.0
201611	2600	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	All in all, therefore, the extent to which the tightening of financial conditions in response to a persistent increase in inflation would come about through a steeper federal funds rate path or through other channels is quite uncertain.	21.0	999.0
201611	2601	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201611	2602	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	That completes my prepared remarks.	21.0	999.0
201611	2603	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	The September statement and the draft alternatives are shown on pages 2 to 9 of the handout.	21.0	999.0
201611	2604	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	I’ll be happy to take any questions.	21.0	999.0
201611	2605	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any questions?	22.0	65.0
201611	2606	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	22.0	65.0
201611	2607	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I have a question, Thomas.	22.0	91.0
201611	2608	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	It has to do with the way you described the uncertainty bands relative to the higher labor costs.	22.0	91.0
201611	2609	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I heard you comment about how the red line was within the 70 percent confidence bands.	22.0	91.0
201611	2610	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I think this is an important question for any future discussion we might have about including error bands associated with our projections.	22.0	91.0
201611	2611	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	My concern is, it’s so easy to glibly say, “Oh, here’s a path.	22.0	91.0
201611	2612	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	It falls within this band.”	22.0	91.0
201611	2613	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	And whether you say it or not, it leaves the listener with the impression that there’s not really a significant difference between these.	22.0	91.0
201611	2614	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	The validity of the bands, unless you’re doing something different than I’m familiar with, is point by point by point.	22.0	91.0
201611	2615	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	So it’s only for one particular hypothesis that it’s actually correct.	22.0	91.0
201611	2616	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I think, in my experience in doing some of these research tabulations of things that sort of fit within an error band, if you have a composite hypothesis like the average response or the discrepancy over four different periods, the tabulations might well end up being something significantly different  Do you have any comments on that?	22.0	91.0
201611	2617	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	I have no objection to that statement at all.	22.0	999.0
201611	2618	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	I think it is completely right.	22.0	999.0
201611	2619	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	All I wanted to indicate is our limited ability to actually forecast inflation with precision at such a horizon.	22.0	999.0
201611	2620	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Therefore, it’s really a statement about whether can we rule that out.	22.0	999.0
201611	2621	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Right.	22.0	91.0
201611	2622	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I know you’re aware of that, and I think I raise it in part because I don’t know exactly how likely this particular experiment is without additional tabulations.	22.0	91.0
201611	2623	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	But if we’re contemplating providing bands, I think we need to understand the kinds of statements that we could have firmer confidence in and ones in which we are not quite so sure.	22.0	91.0
201611	2624	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22.0	91.0
201611	2625	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	22.0	65.0
201611	2626	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have a question on the last bullet point in the lower-left box.	22.0	102.0
201611	2627	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I just don’t know what the literature tells us about this last bullet point.	22.0	102.0
201611	2628	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is “Rise in longer-term yields could be associated with dollar appreciation.”	22.0	102.0
201611	2629	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do know that there is a literature that says that if inflation is above expectations, that will cause a reassessment in the market of the future path of interest rates, and that usually, even after you work it all through, it will indicate an appreciation of the currency.	22.0	102.0
201611	2630	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think there is some literature on that.	22.0	102.0
201611	2631	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes.	22.0	999.0
201611	2632	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	So that’s a clean example.	22.0	102.0
201611	2633	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	But what you’re doing here is layering on an additional factor, that somehow the term premium today is at an unusually low level, which might, in addition to or as part of this response, move up quite a bit.	22.0	102.0
201611	2634	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	My question is, first of all, what’s the empirical evidence on that?	22.0	102.0
201611	2635	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, second of all, would an increase in the term premium on longer-term yields, like the 10-year yield, due to fears of higher inflation actually cause an appreciation or a depreciation of the dollar?	22.0	102.0
201611	2636	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	That last bit isn’t as obvious to me as it seems to be stated here.	22.0	102.0
201611	2637	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	I have something quick.	22.0	999.0
201611	2638	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	I apologize for creating work for Steve.	22.0	999.0
201611	2639	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s just a factual question.	22.0	102.0
201611	2640	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Why don’t you go first?	22.0	999.0
201611	2641	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Well, let’s put it this way.	22.0	999.0
201611	2642	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	I actually share some of your curiosity about this issue.	22.0	999.0
201611	2643	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	In principle, of course, if you have an increase in yields that reflects an increase in expected interest rates, that should have a standard effect of appreciating the currency  When you have a change in the term premium, I think it’s logical to expect a different effect.	22.0	999.0
201611	2644	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Because that increase in the term premium in some sense reflects people being less happy to hold the asset, you could imagine that that would actually depreciate the currency.	22.0	999.0
201611	2645	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	But, looking at it from the other side, you could also imagine that by reducing the price of the bonds, the increase in the term premium basically encourages some portfolio shift into those assets that again raises the dollar.	22.0	999.0
201611	2646	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	As far as the empirics go, this is actually a topic of active investigation right now, and there are different ways to slice it.	22.0	999.0
201611	2647	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	One approach is to look at the effect of both, let’s say, shorter-term yields and longer-term yields on the dollar, with the assumption that the longer-term yields hold more term premium in them.	22.0	999.0
201611	2648	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	And at least one study finds very mixed results, looking at different actions of central banks.	22.0	999.0
201611	2649	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	It’s all over the map in terms of which of those affects their currency the most.	22.0	999.0
201611	2650	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Another approach that we’ve been taking is to try to use actual term structure models to look at central bank actions and figure out how much of the resultant change in interest rates after these events reflects the changes in expected rates and changes in term premiums.	22.0	999.0
201611	2651	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Some initial results we found for the Federal Reserve suggest that the expected rate part affects the dollar more than the term premium part, but that’s pretty preliminary.	22.0	999.0
201611	2652	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	But I think the bottom line is that both of those do boost the dollar.	22.0	999.0
201611	2653	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	So the term premium seems to go in the same direction as expected rates.	22.0	999.0
201611	2654	2016-11-02	meeting	KAMIN	Whether it has more of an effect or less seems to be still a matter of research.	22.0	999.0
201611	2655	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thanks.	22.0	102.0
201611	2656	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s helpful.	22.0	102.0
201611	2657	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	22.0	65.0
201611	2658	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Thomas, you noted that these estimates use the internal measure of labor utilization from Laubach–Williams.	22.0	81.0
201611	2659	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	What is the internal measure of labor utilization—I mean numerically—right now?	22.0	81.0
201611	2660	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes.	22.0	999.0
201611	2661	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	First of all, it’s resource utilization.	22.0	999.0
201611	2662	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	We estimate a GDP gap; we don’t have a granular labor market.	22.0	999.0
201611	2663	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	There’s no unemployment rate, for example, in here.	22.0	999.0
201611	2664	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Right now, the estimate from our model for the output gap stands at about 1½ percent.	22.0	999.0
201611	2665	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	One key thing to understand why the gap stays so flat once you add the SEP forecasts is that the Laubach– Williams estimate of the trend rate of potential GDP growth at this point is about 2¼ percent.	22.0	999.0
201611	2666	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	So that means that if the median SEP forecast comes to pass, in fact, the output gap edges down a little bit.	22.0	999.0
201611	2667	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	It does not rise over the projection period.	22.0	999.0
201611	2668	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	That’s a key part.	22.0	999.0
201611	2669	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	At that level, there is a tension here between this model’s view of the world and the SEP medians’ view of the world.	22.0	999.0
201611	2670	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	So what I would like to focus on is basically just the revision in the r* estimate, because that’s an apples-to-apples comparison.	22.0	999.0
201611	2671	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I guess I was also interested in this broader question about r* estimates and whether placing weight on the Laubach–Williams r* should also cause one to place weight on their estimate of the gap and trend growth.	22.0	81.0
201611	2672	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Is that a corollary?	22.0	81.0
201611	2673	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Obviously, these things are estimated with a fair dose of uncertainty.	22.0	999.0
201611	2674	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	So I think, statistically, it’s quite hard to make a strong deduction about whether the output gap now is zero or 1 percent?	22.0	999.0
201611	2675	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	22.0	81.0
201611	2676	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Thanks.	22.0	81.0
201611	2677	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Are there other questions for Thomas?	22.0	65.0
201611	2678	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	22.0	65.0
201611	2679	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I’ll ask one very basic question.	22.0	110.0
201611	2680	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I could see why higher expected GDP growth would raise the term premium, because higher prospective growth might—to me, would—steepen the yield curve.	22.0	110.0
201611	2681	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	In your work, you’re saying that even higher inflation not accompanied by higher prospective GDP growth might raise the term premium.	22.0	110.0
201611	2682	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	And I just want to hear a little bit more about why you would assert that, as opposed to raising the level of the entire curve.	22.0	110.0
201611	2683	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes.	22.0	999.0
201611	2684	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	One line of logic is suggested by what’s known as consumption- based asset pricing models.	22.0	999.0
201611	2685	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	Effectively, you can think about in which circumstances do nominal long-term assets have high payoffs and whether these are circumstances when you value these payoffs most.	22.0	999.0
201611	2686	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	So it’s basically an insurance or hedge property.	22.0	999.0
201611	2687	2016-11-02	meeting	LAUBACH	In a time when you are very concerned about negative surprises about inflation, combined potentially with monetary policy becoming constrained again by the effective lower bound in a period of economic weakness, that would depress the term premium because it would raise demand for these assets.	22.0	999.0
201611	2688	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Okay, got it.	22.0	110.0
201611	2689	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	22.0	110.0
201611	2690	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any further questions?	22.0	65.0
201611	2691	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	22.0	65.0
201611	2692	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	22.0	65.0
201611	2693	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we begin our policy round?	23.0	65.0
201611	2694	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	23.0	65.0
201611	2695	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201611	2696	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I would have preferred to move at the September meeting and I would have gladly supported a move at this meeting, I’m willing to support alternative B today.	23.0	90.0
201611	2697	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	I am comforted that market expectations and the statement are clearly consistent with moving in December unless incoming data dramatically change our forecast.	23.0	90.0
201611	2698	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Had the statement not been consistent with a high likelihood of moving in December, I would not have been able to support alternative B.	23.0	90.0
201611	2699	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because of the slow pace of increases to date, we have the luxury of waiting for a press conference meeting, because a six-week delay under current conditions is unlikely to be particularly costly.	23.0	90.0
201611	2700	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	No econometric model would argue that moving at the beginning of November rather than the middle of December would make a significant economic difference.	23.0	90.0
201611	2701	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, that does not imply that deferring much beyond this meeting would be without costs.	23.0	90.0
201611	2702	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	At the previous meeting, I suggested that there were potential costs to waiting too long to raise rates, and that moving gradually may be possible only if we do not get too far “behind the curve.”	23.0	90.0
201611	2703	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Furthermore, my modal forecast indicates that we risk plunging past full employment rather than gently probing for the natural rate unless we adopt a higher funds rate path than is currently assumed by the market.	23.0	90.0
201611	2704	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	This, in turn, implies a significant risk that, the longer we delay raising rates, the steeper the federal funds rate path will have to be and the more likely that financial markets will overreact to the surprise relative to their expectations.	23.0	90.0
201611	2705	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Moreover, the further we fall below the natural rate, the higher is the probability that our attempts to get back to full employment will entail a more severe slowdown than we expect.	23.0	90.0
201611	2706	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Such a course for policy may thus be much riskier for the economy than a more gradual path that begins sooner.	23.0	90.0
201611	2707	2016-11-02	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201611	2708	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201611	2709	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23.0	65.0
201611	2710	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	102.0
201611	2711	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I favor alternative C.	23.0	102.0
201611	2712	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Economic conditions are ideal for a rate increase.	23.0	102.0
201611	2713	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	The employment and inflation data have been consistent with our forecasts, financial markets are tranquil, and we’re already very close to full employment and on a trajectory to overshoot that mandate.	23.0	102.0
201611	2714	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Both employment and output growth have been well above trend.	23.0	102.0
201611	2715	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Our past decisions to delay tightening have relied on the low pace of inflation, but there are signs that the tide is turning.	23.0	102.0
201611	2716	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	The effects of past dollar appreciation and the drop in oil prices have dissipated.	23.0	102.0
201611	2717	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, energy prices have now turned around and are trending up.	23.0	102.0
201611	2718	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Furthermore, evidence of increased wage pressure is more apparent.	23.0	102.0
201611	2719	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	This suggests that there’s not much more room to run in the labor market.	23.0	102.0
201611	2720	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, several years ago, Chair Yellen compared the state of the economy to a car driving from coast to coast.	23.0	102.0
201611	2721	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	She used metaphors like “We’re about in Kansas now” to convey that, although we’d made a lot of progress, the recovery was far from complete.	23.0	102.0
201611	2722	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of our dual- mandate goals today, the Long Island Sound is now in sight.	23.0	102.0
201611	2723	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	23.0	102.0
201611	2724	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	That contrasts starkly with the stance of policy, for which we seem to have run out of gas somewhere outside of Reno, Nevada.	23.0	102.0
201611	2725	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	The current economic situation favors tightening, and our policy stance has over time built up considerable insurance against unforeseen risks to the downside.	23.0	102.0
201611	2726	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, of course, should we encounter surprises to the downside, those can be offset through normal adjustments in our policy rate.	23.0	102.0
201611	2727	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Given that alternative C is not the decision the Committee is taking today, the language in alternative B does a very good job of acknowledging our progress to date and leaves conditions proximate to warranting renewed policy normalization.	23.0	102.0
201611	2728	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, the last comment I’ll make is, President Kashkari yesterday brought up the issue— and his remarks were partially addressed to me, I felt—of, how can one both be for gradual policy normalization and have a view of very low r* and concerns about our long-run policy framework?	23.0	102.0
201611	2729	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	And it’s a question I’ve been asked a lot, so let me just very briefly comment on that.	23.0	102.0
201611	2730	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	First of all, I think President Rosengren laid out the argument just a minute ago—that is, under our current policy framework, which the Committee has agreed on and has reiterated every January, we have a 2 percent inflation objective with a balanced approach to our dual-mandate goals.	23.0	102.0
201611	2731	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s the strategy we’ve agreed to, and the one that we are making decisions on how to execute—whether we should raise rates or not.	23.0	102.0
201611	2732	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	As President Rosengren explained—and I agree 100 percent with what he said—in that context, how do we best achieve what I would think of as sustainable maximum employment?	23.0	102.0
201611	2733	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	If we allow the economy to overshoot full employment by too much for too long, I think that does create greater risks of a reversal through different possible mechanisms, including the one President Rosengren just laid out—that by, in a sense, going for too low of unemployment, we basically undermine the sustainability of the economic expansion to the harm of achieving our maximum-employment and inflation goals.	23.0	102.0
201611	2734	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I agree completely with Chair Yellen’s characterization—that we want to run a moderately hot economy for some time.	23.0	102.0
201611	2735	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	That will help us get inflation back to 2 percent quicker, and that’s consistent with our strategy.	23.0	102.0
201611	2736	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I just worry that if we try to go too far on running a hot economy too hot for too long, it creates some of the risks that President Rosengren laid out.	23.0	102.0
201611	2737	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I just think, in terms of balancing the risks, a gradual path of policy increases makes sense.	23.0	102.0
201611	2738	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do think that we should be having a serious discussion of the strategy, which I think of as different than the tactical or execution decisions we’re making about whether we should raise rates or not?	23.0	102.0
201611	2739	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think we should have that discussion, and we should involve a lot of experts and economists and others in thinking through this over time.	23.0	102.0
201611	2740	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	That discussion should eventually lead to a decision by the Committee and to a communication of that decision.	23.0	102.0
201611	2741	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Then that might imply different policy decisions in the future.	23.0	102.0
201611	2742	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	But until that discussion has happened and until whatever decisions come out of it, I think it’s important for us to execute on the policy strategy we have laid out.	23.0	102.0
201611	2743	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t think, through our tactical decisions about whether to raise rates in December or not or in September or not, we’re really addressing at all these longer-run issues that I’m raising.	23.0	102.0
201611	2744	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	I mean, I don’t think those are really related to that.	23.0	102.0
201611	2745	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	The longer-run issues are, to me, not just about raising rates or not.	23.0	102.0
201611	2746	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	They’re really more about thinking about what our strategy is and how we communicate that strategy, and then from that follows the actual policy decision.	23.0	102.0
201611	2747	2016-11-02	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23.0	102.0
201611	2748	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201611	2749	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23.0	65.0
201611	2750	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201611	2751	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think it makes sense to change the interest rate this month.	23.0	108.0
201611	2752	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	There’s such a great deal of uncertainty about future nonmonetary economic policies.	23.0	108.0
201611	2753	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	That degree of uncertainty will probably, but not certainly, be reduced by the time of our next meeting, and we should therefore not change the interest rate at this meeting.	23.0	108.0
201611	2754	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Our Committee has been extremely cautious about raising the federal funds rate during the period since 2009.	23.0	108.0
201611	2755	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	That’s an understatement.	23.0	108.0
201611	2756	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Two arguments have carried the day.	23.0	108.0
201611	2757	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The first is that we should not raise the rate, because we could soon be forced to reduce it and return to the effective lower bound, thereby suffering a loss of credibility.	23.0	108.0
201611	2758	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The second is that there’s very little difference between making the decision at this FOMC meeting and making it at a subsequent meeting.	23.0	108.0
201611	2759	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	With regard to the credibility loss of having to return to the ELB, we need to weigh the expectation of that possible loss against the potential credibility loss of hesitating too long.	23.0	108.0
201611	2760	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	The argument I’ve made is liable to be countered by the statement that it’s only because we kept the interest rate so low for so long that the US economy has performed so well since 2009.	23.0	108.0
201611	2761	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I do not disagree with that point, except at the margins.	23.0	108.0
201611	2762	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	It remains to be shown that the performance of the economy would have been significantly worse with an interest rate path that was now 50 or so basis points above the path that actually obtained—and thus 50 basis points or two interest rate decisions further away from the ELB.	23.0	108.0
201611	2763	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We need to consider the possibility that our superlow interest rates have encouraged financial transactions, particularly mergers and acquisitions and stock buybacks, as much as they have encouraged physical investment.	23.0	108.0
201611	2764	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	We have been sending a message that says the US economy still requires the support of superlow interest rates to keep itself growing, even at the moderate 2 percent rate to which we’ve gradually become accustomed.	23.0	108.0
201611	2765	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I do not believe that to be the case, for, as I argued yesterday, the recovery of employment has been powerful, and I should have added that it’s been robust.	23.0	108.0
201611	2766	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I do not believe that maintaining the federal funds rate so close to the ELB for so long sends the right message to potential investors and others facing intertemporal decisions in the economy.	23.0	108.0
201611	2767	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	And I do believe we should very soon take the second step on our gradual path away from the ELB and toward normalization.	23.0	108.0
201611	2768	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Finally, as we look to our December decision, we will be navigating treacherous waters.	23.0	108.0
201611	2769	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	When we make our decision in December, we should be looking ahead and choosing an interest rate that reflects our expectations of future economic policies and of the future state of the economy.	23.0	108.0
201611	2770	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Those expectations will and should reflect our expectations of the nonmonetary economic policies that will be followed in 2017 and later.	23.0	108.0
201611	2771	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Are we, therefore, going to be making decisions that reflect our political preferences?	23.0	108.0
201611	2772	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Absolutely not.	23.0	108.0
201611	2773	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	As the Chair has emphasized, we will be making decisions that the Committee believes, on the basis of its professional judgments, are in the best interests of the United States.	23.0	108.0
201611	2774	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	I’m confident we’ll continue to follow that principle, as is both our legal obligation and our standard practice.	23.0	108.0
201611	2775	2016-11-02	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	23.0	108.0
201611	2776	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201611	2777	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23.0	65.0
201611	2778	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201611	2779	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	My medium-run outlook is unchanged since our September meeting, and I continue to support alternative C, on the basis of realized and projected progress on our dual-mandate goals.	23.0	999.0
201611	2780	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Labor market conditions continue to strengthen, the unemployment rate is at its longer- run level, and labor force participation is at or above trend.	23.0	999.0
201611	2781	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The economy is essentially at full employment from the standpoint of what can be achieved using monetary policy.	23.0	999.0
201611	2782	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The unemployment rate is projected to fall below its longer-run level over the next two years, suggesting that the labor market will continue to strengthen.	23.0	999.0
201611	2783	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Inflation is moving up, and we’re close to our goal.	23.0	999.0
201611	2784	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The risks to the outlook are basically balanced, but they won’t remain that way if we fail to remember a lesson from history—that policy should be forward looking.	23.0	999.0
201611	2785	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Various forecasts, optimal control exercises, and our own statements indicate that, to promote our longer-run policy goals, it’s appropriate that we gradually increase the federal funds rate from its current low level.	23.0	999.0
201611	2786	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	The path anticipated is quite gradual.	23.0	999.0
201611	2787	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	This will allow monetary policy to remain accommodative for some time to come, lending support to the economic expansion in the period ahead, allowing u to fall below u*, and allowing the Committee to calibrate policy better over time as it learns more about the underlying structural aspects of the economy.	23.0	999.0
201611	2788	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I’d be concerned if we started to change our strategy to try to run the economy too hot in an attempt to drive the unemployment rate well below our current estimates of the longer-run rate as a prudent course of action.	23.0	999.0
201611	2789	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	In the 1960s and 1970s, when this was tried, it resulted in poor economic outcomes.	23.0	999.0
201611	2790	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	While there are many differences between today’s economy and the economy back then, I don’t think we should ignore historical episodes that illustrate the risks of trying to use monetary policy to change structural aspects of the economy.	23.0	999.0
201611	2791	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	But if we were going to attempt the “hot economy strategy,” then it would behoove us to change our communications.	23.0	999.0
201611	2792	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Such a strategy is inconsistent with a gradual upward path in interest rates.	23.0	999.0
201611	2793	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	It would more likely entail a much steeper path once rates began to rise.	23.0	999.0
201611	2794	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	So in assessing the costs and benefits of our policy actions, I believe it’s appropriate today to take the next step on the gradual policy rate path we have been communicating is the appropriate one.	23.0	999.0
201611	2795	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I realize that I will likely be in the minority today, and that alternative B will win the day.	23.0	999.0
201611	2796	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	But I anticipate the Committee will take action in December unless economic conditions come in considerably different than expected.	23.0	999.0
201611	2797	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	I believe the language proposed in alternative B is consistent with that anticipated action.	23.0	999.0
201611	2798	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	But at the same time, the language doesn’t pre-commit the Committee to action should the economy evolve in a way that significantly changes our medium-run outlook.	23.0	999.0
201611	2799	2016-11-02	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201611	2800	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201611	2801	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23.0	65.0
201611	2802	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201611	2803	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I’ll vote for alternative B, although the language, particularly as understood in the context of the Chair’s remarks yesterday and what Governor Fischer and Presidents Mester, Rosengren, and Williamshave already said, reflects a higher probability of a rate increase in December than I think likely reflects my own probability of favoring such a move at that time.	23.0	97.0
201611	2804	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	As I intimated yesterday, my own probability is certainly higher than it has been over the course of most of this year, but it’s still not at 70 percent.	23.0	97.0
201611	2805	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I’d like to add a couple of remarks to what I said yesterday.	23.0	97.0
201611	2806	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	First, I want to reiterate my own conclusion, based on having listened to many of you over the course of several meetings and tried to do some of my own work with the help of the staff here, that I don’t think there’s a particularly compelling case to be cited by either side from history regarding why one has to move now or why it would be okay to wait.	23.0	97.0
201611	2807	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I think, actually, the circumstances are different enough today from what they have been in the past that both sides have something they can cite.	23.0	97.0
201611	2808	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But in the end, this is, as I said yesterday, more an intuition than anything else.	23.0	97.0
201611	2809	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	It’s an informed intuition, but it still is, I think, an intuition.	23.0	97.0
201611	2810	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Second, yesterday I concentrated on my own search for tangible indicators that the economy was moving to the point at which circumstances arguably called for an increase in the federal funds rate.	23.0	97.0
201611	2811	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I didn’t put as much emphasis on the other consideration I mentioned, which is the balance of risks with respect to adverse outcomes conditional on the path that we eventually take.	23.0	97.0
201611	2812	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And, as everyone knows, I and others have been concerned with the so-called asymmetric toolbox—or the range of instruments—we have to respond should the economy underperform or fall into recession over the near to medium term, as opposed to whether it might run a little bit hotter than anticipated.	23.0	97.0
201611	2813	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I have to say that yesterday’s conversation on the implementation framework, which I thought took a welcome diversion to thinking in more general terms about monetary policy, reinforced for me the absence of anything approaching a viable consensus on an efficacious response that we would have if the economy slipped into a recession because of some exogenous shock in the near to medium term.	23.0	97.0
201611	2814	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	With the yield curve relatively flat now, it seems as though the utility of an additional LSAP would be quite limited—except perhaps in a very substantial amount, which I’m sure would elicit some concerns for other reasons among members of the Committee.	23.0	97.0
201611	2815	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	I heard yesterday among numerous members of the Committee an aversion to the use of negative rates, the reasons for which I can understand.	23.0	97.0
201611	2816	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	But I was left thinking that we really are not particularly well suited to respond should there be—unexpectedly—a recession.	23.0	97.0
201611	2817	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And as Eric indicated yesterday, if you just go out a couple of years, the risks of a recession are nontrivial.	23.0	97.0
201611	2818	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	So that’s still influencing my thinking as well.	23.0	97.0
201611	2819	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Having said that, alternative A doesn’t quite capture my views, either.	23.0	97.0
201611	2820	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	And I’m not going to propose any changes to the language of alternative B that would make it more compatible with my views, because I’ve already heard enough and I know where everybody else is.	23.0	97.0
201611	2821	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201611	2822	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23.0	65.0
201611	2823	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201611	2824	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Our newer presidents—Harker, Kashkari, and Kaplan—may not be aware that we each have a cumulative word quota for our time on the FOMC.	23.0	88.0
201611	2825	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	And my balance is running low, so I support alternative B and the statement as it stands.	23.0	88.0
201611	2826	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201611	2827	2016-11-02	meeting	LOCKHART	[Laughter]	23.0	88.0
201611	2828	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Wow.	23.0	65.0
201611	2829	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23.0	65.0
201611	2830	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201611	2831	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I support alternative B for today.	23.0	94.0
201611	2832	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	In my view, our normalization program is not proceeding as planned.	23.0	94.0
201611	2833	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	One rate increase per year and no change in the balance sheet is not meaningful in the macroeconomic sense.	23.0	94.0
201611	2834	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I think it’s becoming increasingly apparent that we should de-emphasize the idea of normalization as we go forward.	23.0	94.0
201611	2835	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	My basic recommendation is that we should plan to go ahead with a rate increase at the December meeting.	23.0	94.0
201611	2836	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I think that’s necessary at this point to maintain credibility.	23.0	94.0
201611	2837	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	But I think we should accompany that move with language that further moves in 2017 are not anticipated, and that the next move is as likely to be a decrease in the policy rate as it is to be an increase in the policy rate.	23.0	94.0
201611	2838	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	So let me turn to what I see as the problem with our normalization rhetoric.	23.0	94.0
201611	2839	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Policy is mostly about the intended path of policy and not the level of the policy rate today.	23.0	94.0
201611	2840	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Our rhetoric is that we are on the cusp of a 200 basis point or more move upward in the policy rate.	23.0	94.0
201611	2841	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Our forecast is for economic growth near 2 percent over the forecast horizon.	23.0	94.0
201611	2842	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	In my opinion, this is not meaningfully different from trend, in view of the degree of precision with which we can measure the trend.	23.0	94.0
201611	2843	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Our forecast is also for unemployment near the Committee’s estimate of its longer-run value, and inflation forecasts are generally centered on the Committee’s inflation target.	23.0	94.0
201611	2844	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	The general contours of this forecast are very similar whether one is looking at the Tealbook, the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis Fed forecast, or private-sector forecasts.	23.0	94.0
201611	2845	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	What is different about private-sector expectations is the policy rate path, which is very flat in the private-sector view in order to achieve the same forecast outcomes.	23.0	94.0
201611	2846	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	So let’s take the private-sector perspective for just a moment.	23.0	94.0
201611	2847	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	From that perspective, it looks like any surprise in the form of faster output growth, lower-than-expected unemployment, or higher-than-expected inflation will be seen by this Committee as a reason to embark more rapidly on a 200 basis point normalization program.	23.0	94.0
201611	2848	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	From the private-sector perspective, this would be inappropriate.	23.0	94.0
201611	2849	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	This is like holding a hammer over the economy, as deviations from our forecast expectations will be met very aggressively in the private-sector perception.	23.0	94.0
201611	2850	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I think that this is the wrong approach.	23.0	94.0
201611	2851	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	With the type of forecast that we currently have and the type of private-sector expectations that we can measure, I think we would do much better to characterize current policy settings as approximately correct, in light of the current state of the economy and its expected trajectory.	23.0	94.0
201611	2852	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	To conclude, I would say, go ahead for December, but use that moment to realign expectations for 2017 and beyond.	23.0	94.0
201611	2853	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	In particular, use the December opportunity to get rid of the perception that we are on the precipice of a major policy rate move.	23.0	94.0
201611	2854	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	I just don’t think that that’s an accurate description of the Committee’s intentions.	23.0	94.0
201611	2855	2016-11-02	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201611	2856	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201611	2857	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	23.0	65.0
201611	2858	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201611	2859	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I do believe we’re at the point at which it is appropriate to remove some amount of accommodation.	23.0	110.0
201611	2860	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I would support doing this, if not today, then very soon.	23.0	110.0
201611	2861	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I recommend this in the context of believing that the path of rates over the next few years ought to be very shallow, and the terminal rate is likely to be much lower than we’ve historically experienced.	23.0	110.0
201611	2862	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I believe, therefore, that further removals of accommodation should be done very gradually, with an appropriate amount of patience and caution.	23.0	110.0
201611	2863	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	I also believe that in the absence of other economic policies, such as infrastructure spending, fiscal policy, and other structural reforms, prospective GDP growth is going to be very sluggish.	23.0	110.0
201611	2864	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	This is due to persistent secular headwinds I discussed yesterday that do not appear to be abating.	23.0	110.0
201611	2865	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	All of this means to me that we can afford to be patient regarding further removals of accommodation.	23.0	110.0
201611	2866	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	However, I do believe some amount of removal would be healthy in light of building imbalances I see in terms of the effects on savers as well as the distortions regarding asset allocation and other business decisions.	23.0	110.0
201611	2867	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	These imbalances may not only be difficult to ultimately unwind but also have some behavioral effects that, if allowed to persist, could undermine future sustainable economic growth.	23.0	110.0
201611	2868	2016-11-02	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201611	2869	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201611	2870	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	23.0	65.0
201611	2871	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201611	2872	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Reflecting my view that there remains little to no slack in the labor market and my fairly upbeat outlook for the economy, as well as the persistent gradual progress of inflation moving close to target, I remain committed to the need for a rate hike this year.	23.0	999.0
201611	2873	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Benchmark interest rate rules indicate we are getting behind the historical norm for our interest rate setting.	23.0	999.0
201611	2874	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	The staff’s projection of how policy will proceed over the forecast horizon is in line with my own, and, adhering to that, very gradual removal of accommodation needs to begin this year.	23.0	999.0
201611	2875	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	I also share some of President Rosengren’s concerns that our overly accommodative policy may be creating some financial stability concerns.	23.0	999.0
201611	2876	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	At this juncture, I tried to ask myself what it would take not to move by year’s end, and I could come up with only some extreme events that are very unlikely.	23.0	999.0
201611	2877	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	In view of the timing of this meeting, we should probably wait until December, but it is essential that we communicate that not moving in December would take a rather severe deterioration in our economic outlook.	23.0	999.0
201611	2878	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	My reading of alternative B is that it comes close to doing that.	23.0	999.0
201611	2879	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	So I can support alternative B at this time.	23.0	999.0
201611	2880	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	The signal we are sending will, in itself, start the process and will achieve some measure of tightening in financial markets.	23.0	999.0
201611	2881	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	So, Brian, please deduct 220 words from my word “Lockhart”	23.0	999.0
201611	2882	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	—I mean, lockbox.	23.0	999.0
201611	2883	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	[Laughter]	23.0	999.0
201611	2884	2016-11-02	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201611	2885	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23.0	65.0
201611	2886	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201611	2887	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I support alternative B.	23.0	91.0
201611	2888	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I do not think a move today is appropriate.	23.0	91.0
201611	2889	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	As I noted yesterday, I think we have to keep an eye out to make sure that the recent softer tone in private domestic final purchases is just part of the typical ebb and flow in the data that we see in an economy growing modestly above trend.	23.0	91.0
201611	2890	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I believe this is the case.	23.0	91.0
201611	2891	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	With regard to price stability, core PCE inflation has improved somewhat over the past couple of rounds.	23.0	91.0
201611	2892	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I’m pleased to see that the 12-month change has made it up to 1.7 percent for two months in a row.	23.0	91.0
201611	2893	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	But, as Governor Fischer said yesterday in a different context, “Good.	23.0	91.0
201611	2894	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Nice job.	23.0	91.0
201611	2895	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	But now is not the time for complacency.”	23.0	91.0
201611	2896	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I remain concerned about inflation expectations.	23.0	91.0
201611	2897	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Core inflation has risen 0.3 percentage point since the turn of the year, and total PCE inflation is up about ¾ percentage point.	23.0	91.0
201611	2898	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	But instead of firming, household inflation expectations have fallen to new lows, and, even with the slight pickup since our September meeting, TIPS breakevens are still down a touch, 10 basis points, since late last year.	23.0	91.0
201611	2899	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Furthermore, futures markets continue to indicate that investors are clearly much more concerned about low-inflation outcomes than they are about above-target inflation.	23.0	91.0
201611	2900	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	This lack of improvement in expected inflation weighs heavily on my assessment of appropriate policy.	23.0	91.0
201611	2901	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	In my opinion, unless core inflation overshoots 2 percent by some amount in this cycle, I don’t believe the Board’s inflation attractor will get back to 2 percent.	23.0	91.0
201611	2902	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	And I view that perspective as in line with the long-run strategy that overshooting is consistent with a symmetric inflation objective and trying to get inflation expectations up to 2 percent.	23.0	91.0
201611	2903	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	If our primary policy objective now is to get core inflation back to 2 percent sooner rather than later after so many years of undershooting, I would not advocate a December rate hike.	23.0	91.0
201611	2904	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	But the Committee has pretty firmly signaled that a hike is important, relying on inflation confidence.	23.0	91.0
201611	2905	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Our communications have been pointing fairly forcefully to a rate increase sometime this year, unless there was a clear softening in economic activity.	23.0	91.0
201611	2906	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	In light of this virtual commitment, if economic conditions remain as they are today, the communications and credibility risks of not moving in December would be significant without a very different policy statement and plan.	23.0	91.0
201611	2907	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Hence, I can support the changes in paragraph 3 language that will further validate market expectations for a rate increase in December unless the data strongly object.	23.0	91.0
201611	2908	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	What about beyond December?	23.0	91.0
201611	2909	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	My last SEP submission had three rate increases between now and the end of 2017.	23.0	91.0
201611	2910	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	For me, I feel that we should not get ahead of this pace unless we see a marked improvement in the data, particularly in the factors underlying our inflation outlook, and I agree with President Bullard’s viewpoints on that for characterizing 2017.	23.0	91.0
201611	2911	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I found it useful in my public speaking to communicate about inflation through the lens of the canonical model the Chair spelled out in her Amherst speech last year.	23.0	91.0
201611	2912	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Basically, the model’s inflation determinants are inertia, slack, transitory factors, and inflation expectations.	23.0	91.0
201611	2913	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I find this breakdown helpful for explaining the overall inflation outlook and how this outlook motivates the rationale for my appropriate policy rate path.	23.0	91.0
201611	2914	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	I think this taxonomy also could be a useful tool for the Committee to use to describe more explicitly the economic conditionality governing our moves after December.	23.0	91.0
201611	2915	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Our communications should reinforce that future rate increases will depend on the weight of these factors pointing to attainment of our 2 percent objective sustainably, symmetrically, and sooner rather than later.	23.0	91.0
201611	2916	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	We should be able to point to data-based signs of improvements in these indicators when we actually do raise rates in 2017, assuming the data are willing.	23.0	91.0
201611	2917	2016-11-02	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201611	2918	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201611	2919	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23.0	65.0
201611	2920	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	81.0
201611	2921	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	At our September meeting, I argued that the data since the beginning of the year had essentially met our expectations as expressed in the December SEP.	23.0	81.0
201611	2922	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	If anything, the real output and productivity data surprised a bit on the low side, and the inflation data have surprised repeatedly on the high side.	23.0	81.0
201611	2923	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Intermeeting events caused us to delay the rate increases that the December SEP had envisioned for this year in order to wait for additional data to confirm that these events would have no material effect on the economy.	23.0	81.0
201611	2924	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Fortunately, they have not, and the data since the September meeting have just strengthened the case for a rate increase.	23.0	81.0
201611	2925	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Some Committee members have argued that the data came close to confirming our December projections precisely because we delayed rate increases and pulled down the expected policy rate path.	23.0	81.0
201611	2926	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	I don’t find this convincing, however, because the timing isn’t consistent with the conventional views about the lags in the effects of monetary policy.	23.0	81.0
201611	2927	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Looking forward to our next meeting, I agree with you, Madam Chair, that some weakness in the upcoming economic data should not stay our hand.	23.0	81.0
201611	2928	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	This is especially true when we are in the process of converging to a path with lower trend productivity and employment growth.	23.0	81.0
201611	2929	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	The relevant question is whether incoming data are inconsistent with fluctuations around such a lower trend growth path.	23.0	81.0
201611	2930	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	As I pointed out yesterday, for example, a payroll employment number as low as 60,000 is compatible with constant unemployment and labor force participation rates.	23.0	81.0
201611	2931	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	And, obviously, fluctuations within a typical range surrounding such a path would not be inconsistent, either.	23.0	81.0
201611	2932	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	As a consequence, it should take an exceptionally dismal data flow for us to delay raising rates yet again.	23.0	81.0
201611	2933	2016-11-02	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	23.0	81.0
201611	2934	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201611	2935	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23.0	65.0
201611	2936	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	103.0
201611	2937	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	I support alternative C, as I view an increase in the federal funds rate as having been appropriate for some time.	23.0	103.0
201611	2938	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Core PCE inflation is now running at 1.7 percent year over year, and we’re moving past the window when the decline in energy prices has held down headline, as the annualized six-month change in headline PCE inflation is now 2.1 percent.	23.0	103.0
201611	2939	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, labor utilization has increased this year, leaving the labor market near full employment.	23.0	103.0
201611	2940	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Accommodative monetary policy certainly supported achieving these objectives, but leaving the funds rate at its current level raises concerns.	23.0	103.0
201611	2941	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Without gradual adjustment, it seems we risk returning to “go-stop” types of policies that can create volatility rather than subdue it.	23.0	103.0
201611	2942	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Monetary policy has also, perhaps arguably, become more accommodative this year.	23.0	103.0
201611	2943	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	The funds rate has not changed, but we’ve signaled a shallower path of the funds rate and a lower terminal rate, this in the context of roughly full employment and inflation near 2 percent.	23.0	103.0
201611	2944	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, the real rate remains well below measures of the equilibrium real rate.	23.0	103.0
201611	2945	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Even with some adjustment to the level of accommodation, I expect to see labor utilization rise above its neutral level, which history shows can end poorly.	23.0	103.0
201611	2946	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	I accept as reasonable the arguments that current conditions are different than those of the past.	23.0	103.0
201611	2947	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	But this approach sits uneasily with me and, I think, with our statutory objective of effectively promoting maximum employment commensurate with the economy’s longer-run potential to increase production.	23.0	103.0
201611	2948	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Bringing more people into the labor force and having stronger attachment is, of course, a desirable feature of a tighter labor market, but I question its long-run benefit.	23.0	103.0
201611	2949	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Research by Christina Romer and David Romer published in a 1998 Jackson Hole conference volume argues that the cyclical effects of monetary policy on unemployment are inherently temporary.	23.0	103.0
201611	2950	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	They conclude that compassionate monetary policy is simply sound monetary policy, policy that aims to keep inflation stable and minimizes output fluctuations.	23.0	103.0
201611	2951	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	The possible benefits of continuing to let the economy heat up in terms of reversing past supply-side damage are highly uncertain.	23.0	103.0
201611	2952	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Research by my staff has examined the effects of expansionary monetary policy on indicators of the economy’s productive capacity in the pre- crisis period.	23.0	103.0
201611	2953	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Their findings indicate that after a period of expansionary monetary policy, labor productivity tends to rise because of an increase in capital and labor utilization, but it does not have benefits in terms of capital deepening or TFP.	23.0	103.0
201611	2954	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	The implication is that the effects are transitory and are consistent with the idea that monetary policy cannot affect the longer-run growth potential of the economy.	23.0	103.0
201611	2955	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Overall, as the economy strengthens, I see growing risk associated with a wait-and-see approach and a stronger case for continuing to normalize policy.	23.0	103.0
201611	2956	2016-11-02	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	23.0	103.0
201611	2957	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201611	2958	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23.0	65.0
201611	2959	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201611	2960	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Today I will support alternative B as written.	23.0	104.0
201611	2961	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	In my view, it is fair to say that the economy is not so far from full employment and is making reasonable progress toward 2 percent inflation.	23.0	104.0
201611	2962	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Nonetheless, other features of the landscape have also weighed in my thinking, including uncertainty about the natural rate of unemployment, the presence of pockets of slack in the labor market, inflation running persistently below target for a long time, inflation expectations at low levels, a weak and threatening global economy, a dollar highly sensitive to expectations about US policy, and a constrained scope for further easing at the effective lower bound.	23.0	104.0
201611	2963	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	So, with all of that background, the Committee’s patient approach has, in my view, been the right one, and that patience has paid dividends and continues to do so.	23.0	104.0
201611	2964	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	There has seemed to me to be little risk of falling “behind the curve” and plenty of reason to move cautiously.	23.0	104.0
201611	2965	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	To say it differently, I’ve seen the risks for policy as clearly one-sided.	23.0	104.0
201611	2966	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	But, as the economic outlook continues to slowly improve, the risks facing monetary policy are also gradually shifting.	23.0	104.0
201611	2967	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Today, with job growth continuing at a healthy pace, pockets of slack being gradually used up, and positive news on inflation, I think the risks are beginning to become more two-sided.	23.0	104.0
201611	2968	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	For example, if measured labor force participation ticks down again, then the unemployment rate could quickly fall well below 5 percent, suggesting less “room to run.”	23.0	104.0
201611	2969	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	And the volatility in labor force participation measurement this year and over the years suggests that current measurements could be transitorily high.	23.0	104.0
201611	2970	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Time will tell.	23.0	104.0
201611	2971	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	On inflation, I expect to see inflation move gradually up to 2 percent in the near term, and I see some risk that both headline and core could move up faster than expected.	23.0	104.0
201611	2972	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	The recent rise in inflation compensation and flows into TIPS suggests that some investors are coming to the same conclusion.	23.0	104.0
201611	2973	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Of course, inflation has run below target for so long that it shouldn’t be unwelcome for it to run a bit above target for a time.	23.0	104.0
201611	2974	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	I am no longer inclined to put, in effect, zero weight on the possibility that upside surprises in inflation and unemployment could require a more aggressive response and put the recovery at risk.	23.0	104.0
201611	2975	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	To me, that means that if the economy continues on its long path of output growth modestly above trend, a tightening labor market, and progress toward 2 percent inflation, I would gradually raise the federal funds rate along the lines of the September SEP.	23.0	104.0
201611	2976	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	And for that reason, I see it as probably appropriate to move in December if the economy performs roughly in line with expectations and there are no materially negative developments here or abroad.	23.0	104.0
201611	2977	2016-11-02	meeting	POWELL	Thank you.	23.0	104.0
201611	2978	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201611	2979	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	23.0	65.0
201611	2980	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	111.0
201611	2981	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I support alternative B.	23.0	111.0
201611	2982	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	As we talked about yesterday, the recent uptick in inflation and inflation expectations, at least market-based ones, makes me more comfortable about the possibility of raising rates in December.	23.0	111.0
201611	2983	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Looking forward, I think we need to remain very open to the possibility that labor force participation might continue to rise, and we might, therefore, see continued strong job growth in the context of stable unemployment and subdued inflation.	23.0	111.0
201611	2984	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Taking into account our dual mandate, this offers a strong case for moving cautiously with rate increases.	23.0	111.0
201611	2985	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	In September, I talked about three metrics that I was looking at:  one, a sustained upward movement in core PCE—we’ve seen an uptick; two, rising inflation expectations—we’ve seen an uptick; or, three, a significant decline in the headline unemployment rate.	23.0	111.0
201611	2986	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I still feel like those are the right three measures for me to have some confidence that this labor force participation story either is continuing or has run its course.	23.0	111.0
201611	2987	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	So, for me to support a move in December, I’m going to want to see continued evidence along those three measurements to understand where that story is and how much more it has to run.	23.0	111.0
201611	2988	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Let me just thank President Williams for responding to my question from yesterday.	23.0	111.0
201611	2989	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	One of the reasons I like to go late is that it gives me a chance to respond and it makes it harder for the other person to respond to my response.	23.0	111.0
201611	2990	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	[Laughter]	23.0	111.0
201611	2991	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	You can have a two-hander.	23.0	65.0
201611	2992	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Yes, unless you go for a two-hander, which I understand and which is a stronger intervention.	23.0	111.0
201611	2993	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	But I understand the point you made—that there’s a short-term consideration, and then there’s a longer-term question of what framework we’re operating under.	23.0	111.0
201611	2994	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I just feel like now is a curious time.	23.0	111.0
201611	2995	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	If we were at the effective lower bound and there was consensus on the Committee that we were going to be at zero or near zero for the foreseeable future, and we’re looking for new ways of achieving accommodation, I could understand exploring a different inflation target or a different regime, like nominal GDP targeting.	23.0	111.0
201611	2996	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	Or if we were well off the lower bound, in a more normal economic environment, I could understand raising the question “What’s the best long-term operating framework for this Committee or for future Committees?”	23.0	111.0
201611	2997	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	But I feel like it’s a curious time, when we’re debating whether now is the time to start raising the funds rate, to then say, “Well, maybe we should also be raising the inflation target or changing to a nominal GDP target.”	23.0	111.0
201611	2998	2016-11-02	meeting	KASHKARI	I just see those two things as in conflict, but I understand conceptually that they are separate questions, so thank you for responding to my question.	23.0	111.0
201611	2999	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201611	3000	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23.0	65.0
201611	3001	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201611	3002	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Since the September meeting, we’ve received welcome indications of a continued improvement in labor market participation, as well as some progress on inflation and inflation expectations after a long period of troubling weakness on both.	23.0	107.0
201611	3003	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	These developments lead me to believe that our prudent risk-management approach has served us well this year, supporting continued gradual gains in employment and progress on inflation while helping to navigate a number of material risks.	23.0	107.0
201611	3004	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Looking ahead, in view of the signs that there may be scope for further improvement in the labor market; the fact that inflation continues to run persistently below our target, which is symmetric; the weakness in the PDFP components of spending data; and the presence of several important adverse medium-term risks coming from abroad, I believe it’s prudent to wait for more evidence that we are near full employment and that inflation is going to be sustainably at our 2 percent target.	23.0	107.0
201611	3005	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In the weeks ahead, we’ll have several important pieces of data in hand that will help with that assessment.	23.0	107.0
201611	3006	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Conversely, I’ve listened carefully, but I would be hard-pressed to identify convincing evidence that the economy is currently running hot.	23.0	107.0
201611	3007	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	When the Committee decides it is appropriate to take a step in removing policy accommodation, it will be important to emphasize, again, that the rate path forward is likely to remain gradual and shallow due to several key features of the post-crisis new normal.	23.0	107.0
201611	3008	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	A combination of a neutral rate that looks to remain persistently low, the elevated sensitivity of the exchange rate to any perceived divergence in US and foreign economic conditions, and somewhat greater room to run in the post-crisis labor market than had been anticipated suggests the amount of accommodation to be removed is likely to be relatively modest.	23.0	107.0
201611	3009	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	I continue to be very concerned about the asymmetry in our ability to respond using conventional tools to counter shortfalls in demand relative to unexpectedly strong demand.	23.0	107.0
201611	3010	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	This also suggests the value of removing that accommodation at a gradual pace.	23.0	107.0
201611	3011	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	As we look forward to a time when something akin to alternative C will be appropriate, I want to highlight two areas for consideration.	23.0	107.0
201611	3012	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	First, as risk events emanating from Europe just since our September meeting remind us, we should be very cautious about characterizing risks to the outlook as balanced.	23.0	107.0
201611	3013	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Risks arising from developments abroad unquestionably remain tilted to the downside, and we’ve seen repeatedly over the past two years that global developments can importantly affect US financial conditions and the outlook.	23.0	107.0
201611	3014	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	As we’ve seen in Europe and Japan, proximity to the effective lower bound imposes important constraints on monetary policy, limiting its ability to offset adverse demand shocks.	23.0	107.0
201611	3015	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	So if we were to go further and characterize risks as fully balanced, as in the current alternative C, I believe we might be perceived as not adequately sensitive to important features of the current economic environment.	23.0	107.0
201611	3016	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, we haven’t altered the language in paragraph 4 since December 2015.	23.0	107.0
201611	3017	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In the meantime, the Committee has significantly lowered its estimate of the longer-run neutral funds rate.	23.0	107.0
201611	3018	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	In December 2015, when the sentences describing the future path were last modified, the median longer-run rate in the SEP was 3.5 percent.	23.0	107.0
201611	3019	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	It is currently nearly ¾ percentage point lower.	23.0	107.0
201611	3020	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, I believe it would be helpful to update paragraph 4 in alternative C to reference the lower projected level of the longer-run funds rate, reinforcing the message that interest rates are likely to rise only gradually and to a level likely well below previous norms.	23.0	107.0
201611	3021	2016-11-02	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201611	3022	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201611	3023	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23.0	65.0
201611	3024	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201611	3025	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B as written.	23.0	96.0
201611	3026	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I wanted the statement to suggest that we now have greater confidence about reaching our inflation objective, and I think we’ve accomplished that by the changes in the language in paragraph 3.	23.0	96.0
201611	3027	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that will be useful in reinforcing the notion that a December rate hike, barring some unforeseen change in the outlook, is likely.	23.0	96.0
201611	3028	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	At this juncture, I don’t view a December rate hike as particularly risky in terms of provoking a sharp tightening in financial conditions, such as what happened in January this year, which followed our first rate hike last December.	23.0	96.0
201611	3029	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	First, I don’t think the market turbulence we had early this year was mainly attributable to that rate hike.	23.0	96.0
201611	3030	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	But, second, and more important, unlike a year ago, market participants should now better recognize that we’re not on a tightening campaign similar to what occurred during the period from 2004 to 2006.	23.0	96.0
201611	3031	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The median forecast last December was for four rate hikes in 2016—we may get one, and the forward curve is very flat.	23.0	96.0
201611	3032	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	The probability of tightening in December, based on January federal funds rate futures, has climbed to about 70 percent right now.	23.0	96.0
201611	3033	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	That has not unnerved market participants.	23.0	96.0
201611	3034	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	I find it hard to imagine that the last 30 percent of the probability, should we move, would have an outside effect in financial market conditions.	23.0	96.0
201611	3035	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think that we can do this without great fear that this is going to provoke an outsized market reaction.	23.0	96.0
201611	3036	2016-11-02	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201611	3037	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23.0	65.0
201611	3038	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much for a good discussion of the policy move for today.	24.0	65.0
201611	3039	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And we did solicit suggestions concerning alternative C, thinking that if we do move in December, it might be a draft.	24.0	65.0
201611	3040	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	I’ve heard some further suggestions, and I would just say, as we come closer to December, that if things seem to be proceeding in a direction of a move and others have thoughts about what would be valuable to see in alternative C, I would really encourage you to contact us with ideas you may have.	24.0	65.0
201611	3041	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	For now, I’d like to put up alternative B for a vote, with the language unchanged.	24.0	65.0
201611	3042	2016-11-02	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	24.0	999.0
201611	3043	2016-11-02	meeting	MADIGAN	As you indicated, this vote will be on the draft statement for alternative B, as included on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas Laubach’s briefing materials.	24.0	999.0
201611	3044	2016-11-02	meeting	MADIGAN	It will also be on the directive to the Desk as included in the implementation note on page 10 of those briefing materials.	24.0	999.0
201611	3045	2016-11-02	meeting	MADIGAN	Chair Yellen Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Brainard Yes President Bullard Yes Governor Fischer Yes President George No President Mester No Governor Powell Yes President Rosengren Yes Governor Tarullo Yes .	24.0	999.0
201611	3046	2016-11-02	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you.	24.0	999.0
201611	3047	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	24.0	65.0
201611	3048	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, everybody.	24.0	65.0
201611	3049	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	It’s still incredibly early.	52.0	65.0
201611	3050	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	Hey, lunch is ready.	52.0	97.0
201611	3051	2016-11-02	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	52.0	97.0
201611	3052	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	For those of you who will still be here at 11:00, I believe 11:00 is the witching hour at which a buffet lunch will appear, so you’re welcome to stay for that.	52.0	65.0
201611	3053	2016-11-02	meeting	YELLEN	And let me just say that the next meeting will be Tuesday and Wednesday, December 13 and 14.	52.0	65.0
201612	0	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, folks.	50.0	65.0
201612	1	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s get started.	50.0	65.0
201612	2	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Today and tomorrow’s meeting is a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board of Governors.	50.0	65.0
201612	3	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	I need a motion to close the Board meeting.	50.0	65.0
201612	4	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	50.0	108.0
201612	5	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	50.0	65.0
201612	6	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	50.0	65.0
201612	7	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	50.0	65.0
201612	8	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	I think most of you know that President Lockhart has announced that he plans to step down from his position early next year, and this will be his last FOMC meeting.	50.0	65.0
201612	9	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Dennis has agreed to come back for a reception in January on the evening of the first day of the FOMC meeting, which will provide us with an opportunity to honor him appropriately and express our best wishes in a more festive setting than an FOMC meeting.	50.0	65.0
201612	10	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	But I’d also like to make just a few remarks today.	50.0	65.0
201612	11	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	After a long and varied career in finance and academia here and abroad, Dennis joined the Federal Reserve in March 2007 as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.	50.0	65.0
201612	12	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	That was just months before the Global Financial Crisis.	50.0	65.0
201612	13	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Fortunately, we all know that correlation is not causation.	50.0	65.0
201612	14	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	50.0	65.0
201612	15	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	For the past decade, President Lockhart has ably represented the Federal Reserve in the Sixth District.	50.0	65.0
201612	16	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	He has contributed greatly to the System’s work generally, including serving most recently as chairman of the Conference of Presidents.	50.0	65.0
201612	17	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	And, in the course of attending 79 FOMC meetings, he has enhanced the Committee’s deliberations on monetary policy through his careful reporting on economic and financial developments in the Atlanta District, his thoughtful analysis of national conditions and the economic outlook, and his balanced approach to our policy decisions.	50.0	65.0
201612	18	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Dennis, we thank you for your service to the Federal Reserve, and we wish you all the best in the next phase of your career.	50.0	65.0
201612	19	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	50.0	88.0
201612	20	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	[Applause]	50.0	88.0
201612	21	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	50.0	65.0
201612	22	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Let us turn to our agenda.	67.0	65.0
201612	23	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	The first item pertains to “Proposed Revisions to Rules Regarding Availability of Information.”	67.0	65.0
201612	24	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	You recently received a staff memorandum that proposes certain revisions to the Committee’s rules regarding the availability of information.	67.0	65.0
201612	25	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	To summarize briefly, legislation passed earlier this year requires federal agencies to implement a number of changes to relevant information availability policies by December 27.	67.0	65.0
201612	26	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Approval of the staff proposal would align the Committee’s FOIA rules with the new statutory requirements and would implement a number of additional changes, all of which are technical.	67.0	65.0
201612	27	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Let me ask: Does anybody have any questions for the staff about the proposals?	67.0	65.0
201612	28	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	67.0	65.0
201612	29	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	67.0	65.0
201612	30	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	If not, I suggest that we now have a single vote on the proposal, and I’m going to ask Brian to explain exactly what it is that we will be requested to vote on.	67.0	65.0
201612	31	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	67.0	999.0
201612	32	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	This vote will encompass three sets of items.	67.0	999.0
201612	33	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	For your reference, I might note that these items are included on page 2 of the staff memorandum under the heading “Procedural Notes.”	67.0	999.0
201612	34	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	First, the Committee would approve the adoption of the recommended changes to its rules regarding the availability of information.	67.0	999.0
201612	35	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	A tracked-changes version of the rules is attached to the staff memo.	67.0	999.0
201612	36	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	Second, the Committee would make two determinations that would allow the revised rules to be published in the Federal Register as an immediately effective interim final rule under the Administrative Procedure Act.	67.0	999.0
201612	37	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	One, the Committee would determine that there is good cause that public notice and comment on these amendments would be “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.”	67.0	999.0
201612	38	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	Two, the Committee would determine that there is good cause to waive the typical 30-day delay for the effective date of the rule.	67.0	999.0
201612	39	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	The staff believes that these determinations are reasonable because, one, the act requires agencies to implement the necessary changes to the rules in a very short time frame, and, two, the changes beyond those required by the act are technical in nature.	67.0	999.0
201612	40	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	Third, the Committee would authorize the Secretary in consultation with the General Counsel to do two things:  one, to take the appropriate steps to reflect these changes in the rules and records of the Committee and submit the appropriate filings to the Federal Register, and, two, to appoint a Federal Reserve employee as the Committee’s FOIA public liaison to fulfill the roles described in the amended rules.	67.0	999.0
201612	41	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	A draft of the Federal Register notice, which includes a detailed description of the changes, was attached as appendix 2 to the staff memo.	67.0	999.0
201612	42	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	That notice is the proposal on which the Committee is being asked to vote.	67.0	999.0
201612	43	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	67.0	65.0
201612	44	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Do I have a motion to approve the proposal?	67.0	65.0
201612	45	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	67.0	108.0
201612	46	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	And a second?	67.0	65.0
201612	47	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Second.	67.0	96.0
201612	48	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	67.0	65.0
201612	49	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	67.0	65.0
201612	50	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, Brian.	67.0	65.0
201612	51	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you very much.	67.0	999.0
201612	52	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	I just have an additional note.	67.0	999.0
201612	53	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	Although the interim final rule will be effective immediately upon publication in the Federal Register, the public will have 60 days to submit any comments.	67.0	999.0
201612	54	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	The staff anticipates that after the public comment period, the Committee will be asked, potentially at the March meeting, to make the rule final either as is or with changes, if warranted by public comment, and to authorize publication of the final rule in the Federal Register.	67.0	999.0
201612	55	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you.	67.0	999.0
201612	56	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	67.0	65.0
201612	57	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	And let me next call on Simon.	67.0	65.0
201612	58	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	It’s a Board meeting as well?	67.0	999.0
201612	59	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, this is a Board meeting as well.	67.0	65.0
201612	60	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	We’ve already had a motion and closed the Board meeting.	67.0	65.0
201612	61	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	67.0	999.0
201612	62	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	I was just checking.	67.0	999.0
201612	63	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	67.0	65.0
201612	64	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	We’re now going to go to “Financial Developments and Open Market Operations.”	61.0	65.0
201612	65	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Thank you Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201612	66	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The US election outcome produced a significant repricing in financial assets over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201612	67	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Market participants expect the new Administration to introduce expansionary fiscal policies over the coming years and to implement a shift in tax and regulatory policy that is thought likely to promote economic growth.	61.0	999.0
201612	68	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	While there is perceived to be a high degree of uncertainty about the ultimate nature, extent, timing, and effect of these policies, market participants expect the Committee to pursue a somewhat faster pace of policy normalization.	61.0	999.0
201612	69	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-left panel of your first exhibit, the nominal 10-year Treasury yield increased more than 60 basis points since the November FOMC meeting, the largest intermeeting increase since 2010.	61.0	999.0
201612	70	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Although this is consistent with expectations of fiscal expansion, some contacts have suggested that nominal and real yields were too low earlier this year in relation to fundamentals.	61.0	999.0
201612	71	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	But market participants were hesitant to put on corresponding positions until the election-related risk event had passed.	61.0	999.0
201612	72	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Meanwhile, the dollar jumped, domestic risk assets rallied significantly, and emerging market assets sold off.	61.0	999.0
201612	73	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Ahead of the election, market participants had expected a victory by Mr Trump to cause the opposite domestic market reaction, driven by an increase in perceived economic and political uncertainty.	61.0	999.0
201612	74	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Market participants now argue that the Republican control of both the legislative and executive branches of government and President-elect Trump’s conciliatory comments on election night may have somewhat reduced such concerns.	61.0	999.0
201612	75	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	In the most recent Desk surveys, we asked respondents to rate the importance of changes in expectations for various US economic policies in driving the intermeeting change in the 10-year Treasury yield.	61.0	999.0
201612	76	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The bubbles in the top-right panel are scaled by the number of responses and, on average, respondents rated changes to tax policy and government spending as the most important drivers.	61.0	999.0
201612	77	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	In the case of other economic policies that were rated less important, there was a much wider dispersion of views, potentially suggesting greater uncertainty over the effect of the proposed policies.	61.0	999.0
201612	78	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Respondents generally cited the same drivers as the impetus for dollar strength and higher equity valuations.	61.0	999.0
201612	79	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Alongside the shift in economic policy expectations and the apparent increase in risk appetite, the market-implied probability of an increase in the target federal funds rate at this meeting increased from approximately 60 percent at the time of the November FOMC meeting to 90 percent, as shown by the dark blue line in middle- left panel; this market-implied probability is consistent with responses from Desk surveys.	61.0	999.0
201612	80	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Economic data and FOMC communications over the period reinforced market expectations for a rate hike in December, and the market-implied probability is now above what was seen just ahead of the December 2015 FOMC meeting.	61.0	999.0
201612	81	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Beyond this meeting, the market-implied path of the target federal funds rate steepened significantly, as shown by the shift from the light blue to the dark blue line in the middle-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201612	82	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The unconditional survey-implied path, shown by the pink diamonds, also increased, and for the first time in at least the previous two years the market- and survey-implied paths are roughly equal.	61.0	999.0
201612	83	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Despite the substantial re- pricing in the market-implied path, survey respondents generally do not expect the median SEP rate forecasts to change materially at this meeting, with some noting that it may be too soon for FOMC participants to adjust their forecasts.	61.0	999.0
201612	84	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-left panel, the distribution of respondents’ expected outcomes for the federal funds rate of the year-end 2018, conditional on not moving to the effective lower bound, shifted right, with the average probability ascribed to the rate being at or below 1 percent falling from roughly 20 percent to less than 10 percent.	61.0	999.0
201612	85	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The skewness of the distribution shifted slightly toward higher rates.	61.0	999.0
201612	86	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The bottom-right panel shows the probability individual respondents assigned to a move to the ELB sometime between now and the end of 2019 on each of the previous three Desk surveys.	61.0	999.0
201612	87	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The bubbles are scaled by the percent of respondents, and the average probability, denoted by the blue diamonds, declined to roughly 20 percent in the most recent survey.	61.0	999.0
201612	88	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	This level is the lowest this year, and the dispersion of responses also fell a bit.	61.0	999.0
201612	89	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The top-left panel of your next exhibit shows the relative contributions of each of these factors to the change in the unconditional PDF-implied point estimates for 2018 and 2019.	61.0	999.0
201612	90	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The shift toward higher rates, conditional on not moving to the ELB, accounts for the majority of the increase in the path, the dark blue area, followed by a reduction in the probability of moving to the ELB over the forecast horizon, the red area.	61.0	999.0
201612	91	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Thomas will show further supporting evidence on the sources of the increase in the path from Eurodollar options and term structure models.	61.0	999.0
201612	92	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Despite the steepening in the expected path of the policy rate, the median survey respondent expects no change to reinvestments until the second quarter of 2018, roughly unchanged compared with the November surveys, as shown in the top-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201612	93	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	That said, 10 respondents cited expected changes to the composition of the FOMC in 2018 as influencing their expectations regarding the timing of a change in reinvestment policy, and, interestingly, all but one of these respondents pulled forward their timing estimates.	61.0	999.0
201612	94	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Average PDF-implied mean expectations for the par value of SOMA at year-end 2019 were little changed.	61.0	999.0
201612	95	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As a result, it seems unlikely that changes in expectations for the size of the SOMA portfolio contributed significantly to the rise in 10-year Treasury yields over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201612	96	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As a means of further informing our understanding of the rise in Treasury yields, the Desk surveys asked respondents to decompose the intermeeting period change in the 10-year yield.	61.0	999.0
201612	97	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-left panel, respondents, on average, decomposed the move fairly evenly across possible factors.	61.0	999.0
201612	98	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	However, there was a wide dispersion of views regarding this decomposition, with the exception of inflation risk premiums, which most agreed contributed to about one-fourth of the move in the nominal Treasury yields.	61.0	999.0
201612	99	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	US five-year, five-year forward inflation compensation as measured by inflation swaps increased roughly 30 basis points over the period, shown in in the middle-right panel, to the highest level year-to-date.	61.0	999.0
201612	100	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The Desk’s survey measures of expected inflation also moved up, and the distribution of PCE inflation in 2019 is now assessed as roughly symmetric around 2 percent.	61.0	999.0
201612	101	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The increase in domestic inflation expectations and compensation was part of a global re-pricing.	61.0	999.0
201612	102	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The roughly 15 percent increase in oil prices over the period was an additional contributor.	61.0	999.0
201612	103	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	That said, inflation compensation in the euro area and Japan still remains well below the central banks’ respective inflation targets.	61.0	999.0
201612	104	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Consistent with higher growth forecasts and an increase in investor confidence, the S&P 500 index jumped by around 7 percent over the period.	61.0	999.0
201612	105	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-left panel, financials outperformed dramatically.	61.0	999.0
201612	106	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	In fact, they outperformed the broader S&P 500 index by the largest intermeeting margin since 2009 and performed better than would have been predicted purely on the basis of the increase in interest rates and the appreciation in the overall stock market.	61.0	999.0
201612	107	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Market participants attributed this outperformance to expectations of less stringent financial regulations.	61.0	999.0
201612	108	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	However, contacts are uncertain about exactly what form these regulatory changes might take, and Desk analysis has not found any differentiation in performance across banking sector shares that might indicate expectations for specific regulatory changes.	61.0	999.0
201612	109	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Bank shares also outperformed markedly in Europe and Japan.	61.0	999.0
201612	110	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The outperformance of industrials and materials sectors was attributed to expectations for increased infrastructure spending, while the stock prices of companies with higher effective tax rates that would benefit the most from potential changes to the corporate tax system also saw outsized gains.	61.0	999.0
201612	111	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As shown in bottom-right panel, the dollar appreciated broadly over the period.	61.0	999.0
201612	112	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Supported by wider interest rate differentials, the broad trade-weighted dollar has now strengthened to its highest level in 14 years.	61.0	999.0
201612	113	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Potential changes to US trade and immigration policies reportedly weighed heavily on the Mexican peso, while monetary policy actions in Japan and the euro area served to reinforce depreciation pressures on the yen and the euro.	61.0	999.0
201612	114	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As part of its yield-curve control framework, the Bank of Japan conducted a fixed-rate full allotment purchase operation for the first time, unexpectedly targeting the two- and five-year maturity sectors.	61.0	999.0
201612	115	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Consistent with theory, the operations generated no demand but were effective in controlling rates.	61.0	999.0
201612	116	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The JGB yield curve has been relatively stable since the introduction of yield-curve control in September.	61.0	999.0
201612	117	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The bar chart in the top-left panel of your next exhibit compares the steepening of sovereign debt curves across the G4 by showing the change in the spread between the 2- and 30-year securities.	61.0	999.0
201612	118	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As shown by the left bar, the JGB curve steepened by about 10 basis points over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201612	119	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As you can see, this move is small compared with other countries in the developed world.	61.0	999.0
201612	120	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Meanwhile, the German yield curve, the right bar, steepened dramatically.	61.0	999.0
201612	121	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The steepening was driven in part by a decline in short-dated rates and an increase in long-dated rates following last week’s ECB meeting.	61.0	999.0
201612	122	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The ECB announced an extension of its asset purchase program until at least December 2017, though starting in April the monthly pace of purchases will be trimmed to €60 billion.	61.0	999.0
201612	123	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The ECB also announced some technical changes to the program’s parameters to address a growing scarcity of eligible assets for purchase; most notably, securities trading below the deposit facility rate will be eligible for purchase beginning in January.	61.0	999.0
201612	124	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	We estimate that the parameter changes allow the ECB’s asset purchase program to run until at least December 2017.	61.0	999.0
201612	125	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The abrupt re-pricing of longer-term US Treasury securities has had a significant effect on the market value of the SOMA portfolio.	61.0	999.0
201612	126	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-right panel, the unrealized profit, measured by the difference between market and book value, has declined by the largest amount since the “taper tantrum.”	61.0	999.0
201612	127	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	It is important to note that after many years of QE and a longer period of official-sector dollar reserve accumulation, much of the decrease in market value is registering on central bank balance sheets.	61.0	999.0
201612	128	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Stepping back from the immediate price action and bearing in mind the failure of the market to price any of these moves before the election, market participants have cited several key areas of uncertainty.	61.0	999.0
201612	129	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	First, many market participants say that the nature, extent, and ultimate effect of any fiscal stimulus is quite unknown.	61.0	999.0
201612	130	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Potential changes to US trade and immigration policies are also viewed as key tail risks that have the potential to offset the macroeconomic benefits of other economic policies.	61.0	999.0
201612	131	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Additionally, market participants are reportedly concerned about political risk in Europe over the next year or so.	61.0	999.0
201612	132	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the lower-left panel, the Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, the red line, has increased notably: The index is at its highest level since the beginning of the time series in 1997.	61.0	999.0
201612	133	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	However, identifying market pricing that reflects these uncertainties is difficult.	61.0	999.0
201612	134	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	While some measures of implied volatility have increased a bit, the Desk’s standardized cross-asset implied volatility index, the blue line, is nearly one standard deviation below its historical average.	61.0	999.0
201612	135	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The subdued levels of implied volatility across markets could reflect the difficulty in effectively pricing risk associated with events or policies for which the timing and effect is unknown and potentially might not materialize for some time.	61.0	999.0
201612	136	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	A simpler explanation is that there could be some complacency or overconfidence among investors.	61.0	999.0
201612	137	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	A final and related risk identified by market participants is a further sharp appreciation of the US dollar and the potential challenges it poses for China.	61.0	999.0
201612	138	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the lower-right panel, the onshore renminbi, the red line, depreciated 2 percent against the dollar over the intermeeting period to its weakest level since the financial crisis.	61.0	999.0
201612	139	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The persistent depreciation of the renminbi against the dollar has occurred amid large net capital outflows, the blue bars.	61.0	999.0
201612	140	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Chinese government officials have reportedly responded by enhancing capital controls and by intervening to stem renminbi depreciation.	61.0	999.0
201612	141	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	China’s foreign reserves declined over the intermeeting period and intervention activity is likely at its highest level since early this year.	61.0	999.0
201612	142	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	For now, market participants appear relatively comfortable with these developments concerning China, but if capital outflows increase significantly, global financial market instability may return.	61.0	999.0
201612	143	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Brian will analyze possible reactions of the dollar to various scenarios in his briefing.	61.0	999.0
201612	144	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	I will now turn to money markets and Desk operations on your final exhibit.	61.0	999.0
201612	145	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The FX swap basis has widened across major US dollar currency pairs, shown in the top-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201612	146	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The basis indicates the implied cost of borrowing US dollars offshore through the foreign exchange market, above what it would cost to borrow dollars directly at US dollar LIBOR.	61.0	999.0
201612	147	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	If covered interest parity held, it would be zero.	61.0	999.0
201612	148	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Specifically, the one- and three-month FX swap bases have widened as investors have sought to secure US dollar funding over the year-end date.	61.0	999.0
201612	149	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The reduction in the size of lending by US prime money market funds to banks had already reduced one alternative supply of dollar funding for foreign banks.	61.0	999.0
201612	150	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The most pronounced widening has occurred following the US election, as interest rate differentials between the US dollar and other currencies increased.	61.0	999.0
201612	151	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As yields on US assets become more attractive and this increases cross-border purchases of dollar-denominated assets, demand for hedging in the FX forward market will likely increase, contributing to a further widening of the swap basis.	61.0	999.0
201612	152	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Lastly, emerging market reserve managers reportedly reduced their provision of dollars in the FX swap market since the US election, as they maintained higher levels of liquidity to prepare for possible FX intervention to support their currencies.	61.0	999.0
201612	153	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The further widening of the basis might produce more demand at the dollar auctions run by central banks in the standing swap network, particularly over year-end.	61.0	999.0
201612	154	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	In domestic funding markets, we have observed a significant decline in overnight secured rates in recent weeks.	61.0	999.0
201612	155	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The average Treasury triparty ex-GCF repo rate, which is the market in which the bulk of money market fund lending in the repo market occurs, has fallen to 28 basis points this cycle, compared with 33 last intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201612	156	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-right panel, rates on triparty repo transactions for Treasury collateral have shifted lower since the middle of November and have been largely concentrated at or just above the 25 basis point ON RRP rate.	61.0	999.0
201612	157	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	We observed an increase in the number of triparty repo transactions executed below the ON RRP rate, although the overall magnitude of such trades remained relatively small.	61.0	999.0
201612	158	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Cash lenders at these low rates were exclusively non-RRP counterparties.	61.0	999.0
201612	159	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	In addition to the increase in government money funds seeking investment in Treasury repo driven by money fund reform, some market contacts have noted that the recent rise in rates has reduced the market value of the collateral to fund.	61.0	999.0
201612	160	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The rise in rates has also amplified demand to establish short positions in the Treasury securities market, which has served to increase the amount of securities trading special.	61.0	999.0
201612	161	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	When securities trade special, they are removed from the GC collateral pool, putting further downward pressure on the GC rate.	61.0	999.0
201612	162	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	These factors had an even more pronounced effect on rates for Treasury GCF repo—a smaller market made up largely of transactions between dealers—which averaged 36 basis points this period, compared with 55 basis points last cycle.	61.0	999.0
201612	163	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	This effect has compressed the spread between the GCF and GC rates, shown in the middle-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201612	164	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	This spread represents the compensation required by dealers with large, stable repo funding bases to intermediate between money funds and smaller, less creditworthy dealers.	61.0	999.0
201612	165	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The increase in government money fund AUM and the lower levels of overnight secured rates were both reflected in ON RRP usage over the period.	61.0	999.0
201612	166	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	ON RRP take-up continues to be larger than earlier this year, with government funds making up the large majority of the increase, shown as the dark blue area in the middle-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201612	167	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As a result of the lower level of repo rates, participation by government securities dealers, included in the red area, has also increased modestly, as the 25 basis points offered by the ON RRP facility has at times become attractive to them as an arbitrage activity.	61.0	999.0
201612	168	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Usage of the ON RRP is expected to increase materially as we approach year-end.	61.0	999.0
201612	169	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The Desk recently conducted a survey of money fund counterparties to gauge their expectations for demand around year-end, shown as the gray bars in the panel.	61.0	999.0
201612	170	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	While respondents expect the ON RRP facility to see demand of around $500 billion on the year-end date, the expected change from its current level is similar to that seen on previous quarter- and year-ends and smaller compared with year-end 2015.	61.0	999.0
201612	171	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	One consideration with regard to year-end is whether some large government money fund and GSE counterparties may be limited by the $30 billion individual cap on the ON RRP facility.	61.0	999.0
201612	172	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The bottom-left panel shows a time series of the number and types of counterparties that have participated in the ON RRP facility at a level equal to or greater than $15 billion, half of the individual cap.	61.0	999.0
201612	173	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	While this has occurred more frequently since the middle of this year as some government money funds have grown in size, the number of counterparties participating at these levels on any given day has remained low.	61.0	999.0
201612	174	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	In contrast to the movement in secured rates this period, the effective federal funds and overnight bank funding rates were unchanged at 41 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201612	175	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As noted, all respondents in our surveys expect an increase in the federal funds target range at this meeting.	61.0	999.0
201612	176	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Based on responses to the Desk’s recent survey of money market participants, the median expectation is for nearly full pass-through of such a tightening to money market rates, shown in the bottom-right panel as a spread relative to the IOER rate.	61.0	999.0
201612	177	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	These expected rates are generally consistent with forward rates implied by financial markets.	61.0	999.0
201612	178	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	To conclude, we would like to note that in the appendix, in addition to the usual summary of small value test operations that have been conducted by the Desk, you will find a short update pertaining to a memo that was recently circulated describing the Desk’s operational readiness framework.	61.0	999.0
201612	179	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair, that completes my prepared remarks.	61.0	999.0
201612	180	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	We would be happy to take questions.	61.0	999.0
201612	181	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	61.0	65.0
201612	182	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Simon?	62.0	65.0
201612	183	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	62.0	65.0
201612	184	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Yes, I have two or three questions.	62.0	81.0
201612	185	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	One is about the SOMA Domestic Portfolio Unrealized Profit and Loss on exhibit 3.	62.0	81.0
201612	186	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62.0	999.0
201612	187	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	There’s also a figure in Tealbook B, and, for November 30, I wasn’t sure if they lined up.	62.0	81.0
201612	188	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Is there something conceptually different between those numbers?	62.0	81.0
201612	189	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Because some of us are going to be eager trackers of unrealized capital gains or losses in the months and weeks ahead, I suspect.	62.0	81.0
201612	190	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	That’s very perceptive of you.	62.0	999.0
201612	191	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	I also noticed that.	62.0	999.0
201612	192	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	So, my reckoning is 80; they’ve got 120 there.	62.0	999.0
201612	193	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	I think there’s a difference in definition and timing involved in that, but you’re right.	62.0	999.0
201612	194	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	There is a bit of a difference.	62.0	999.0
201612	195	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	I believe that in Tealbook B we are using our estimates of what we would show in the Quarterly Financial Report.	62.0	999.0
201612	196	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I see.	62.0	81.0
201612	197	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	So I’m just giving you right up to what the controllers and markets tell us on that day.	62.0	999.0
201612	198	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	62.0	81.0
201612	199	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I don’t expect someone to regurgitate the difference now, but would it be possible to circulate a little write-up of what the difference is?	62.0	81.0
201612	200	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	We will do that, yes.	62.0	999.0
201612	201	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	It’s a question I raised this morning on the call.	62.0	999.0
201612	202	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Second, I really appreciated the overview of the operational-readiness framework.	62.0	81.0
201612	203	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I’m a longtime supporter of the Desk’s operational readiness and participated in readiness preparations, and I’m really glad to see the Desk taking a systematic approach to ensuring the Desk’s ability to conduct operations that it is currently authorized to conduct.	62.0	81.0
201612	204	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I was intrigued, however, by the memo’s reference to the Desk assessing the readiness to conduct operations that it may be asked to conduct, might not have ever conducted, and might not be authorized to conduct now.	62.0	81.0
201612	205	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I was really curious about this.	62.0	81.0
201612	206	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	First of all, there’s an appendix that shows 26 operations that have the highest readiness prioritization, and so you engage in regular readiness preparations.	62.0	81.0
201612	207	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	And I was really glad to see selling MBS was on that list.	62.0	81.0
201612	208	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I want to commend you for that right off the bat.	62.0	81.0
201612	209	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	We are authorized to do those types of open market operations.	62.0	999.0
201612	210	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	But you maintain a catalog of 58 operations, and you just told us about 26 of them, and I didn’t see the other 32 listed anywhere.	62.0	81.0
201612	211	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	These are things that you folks think you need to be ready to do, but we haven’t talked about them here.	62.0	81.0
201612	212	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I don’t know if any of us have even thought about them.	62.0	81.0
201612	213	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	So, actually, I’m really curious about them.	62.0	81.0
201612	214	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Does it take many resources to maintain some readiness for these things that we haven’t even thought about doing?	62.0	81.0
201612	215	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Have you assessed the likelihood of use?	62.0	81.0
201612	216	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Have you ever discussed any of these with external parties by way of researching what would be involved in operations in some far-flung market or in other—the imagination runs wild in this circumstance.	62.0	81.0
201612	217	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I was wondering if you could make available the list of 32 to the Committee at some point.	62.0	81.0
201612	218	2016-12-14	meeting	LOGAN	You’re right that the three categories that are listed here are the categories of operations in which we’re currently using resources, and that’s why we focused on the three.	62.0	999.0
201612	219	2016-12-14	meeting	LOGAN	There are about 30 other operations that we didn’t list, and they cover a wide variety of things, including things we did in the crisis.	62.0	999.0
201612	220	2016-12-14	meeting	LOGAN	Agency debt purchases would be one of those; TSLF Schedule 1 would be in that category.	62.0	999.0
201612	221	2016-12-14	meeting	LOGAN	They also include things that we may have done pre- crisis—for example, options on repos that we did during Y2K would be one—and some things that we haven’t done, such as municipal debt.	62.0	999.0
201612	222	2016-12-14	meeting	LOGAN	There may have been things that people asked us about during the crisis, and we may have done a little work on them but didn’t do any real operational work.	62.0	999.0
201612	223	2016-12-14	meeting	LOGAN	They include a wide variety of things, and we can certainly share that.	62.0	999.0
201612	224	2016-12-14	meeting	LOGAN	But we’re not using resources on the things that are in those two categories today, and the purpose of this is to show you the things in which we are.	62.0	999.0
201612	225	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	62.0	81.0
201612	226	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	We will be happy to share the full list.	62.0	999.0
201612	227	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Great.	62.0	81.0
201612	228	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Are they all things that the open market Desk is legally entitled to do?	62.0	81.0
201612	229	2016-12-14	meeting	LOGAN	Yes, everything there is within the Federal Reserve Act.	62.0	999.0
201612	230	2016-12-14	meeting	LOGAN	For example, there are agency debt sales, FX forwards, FX swaps with private counterparties, purchasing spec pools instead of TBAs, or doing repos DVP instead of through the triparty system.	62.0	999.0
201612	231	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I see.	62.0	81.0
201612	232	2016-12-14	meeting	LOGAN	So there are things that have been at this table.	62.0	999.0
201612	233	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Thanks.	62.0	81.0
201612	234	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	It will be very exciting reading for everyone.	62.0	999.0
201612	235	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions?	62.0	65.0
201612	236	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	62.0	65.0
201612	237	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Is it your sense that the Chinese are selling Treasury securities to meet some of these redemptions?	62.0	110.0
201612	238	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Yes, as they have been for quite a while.	62.0	999.0
201612	239	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	And that’s continuing?	62.0	110.0
201612	240	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62.0	999.0
201612	241	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	And then the second thing.	62.0	110.0
201612	242	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Do you think people are expecting—I know that it’s not explicit—that once the exchange reserves run low enough the Chinese might be thinking about taking some preemptive action to stem these flows, such as a devaluation?	62.0	110.0
201612	243	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	So I’ll let Steve comment as well.	62.0	999.0
201612	244	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	They still have more than $3 trillion in reserves and a current account surplus.	62.0	999.0
201612	245	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	So I don’t think there’s anything next week.	62.0	999.0
201612	246	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The notion would be if this kept going for another 12 months, then that might show a bigger rundown in the reserves.	62.0	999.0
201612	247	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Part of the fall in exchange reserves is due to the valuation effect, because they hold nondollar assets.	62.0	999.0
201612	248	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	If they’re pricing in dollars, that moves it down.	62.0	999.0
201612	249	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Also, because they previously sold quite a lot of short stuff in the intervention, their portfolio will also have market losses in it, as the rates have gone up and the way they report is that way.	62.0	999.0
201612	250	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Steve.	62.0	999.0
201612	251	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	I think they’ve already taken one preemptive action, which is to tighten up capital controls on outflows, and, meanwhile, I think there is actually an active debate within China among different observers and policymakers over whether a preemptive large devaluation would help by delivering the devaluation people are worried about or hinder because once you do one devaluation, a lot of market participants expect more to follow.	62.0	999.0
201612	252	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Right.	62.0	110.0
201612	253	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	And history suggests they are correct.	62.0	999.0
201612	254	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	In other words, an awful lot of out- of-control depreciations start with a deliberate devaluation.	62.0	999.0
201612	255	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	So this is still up in the air.	62.0	999.0
201612	256	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Our forecast is for neither a preemptive devaluation nor a very large and continuing depreciation.	62.0	999.0
201612	257	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Our view is that a lot of the depreciation of the RMB against the dollar that we’ve seen is, more or less, in line with that of other currency movements and is in line with one of their standard objectives, which is to keep the RMB more or less stable against the basket of currencies, and, in fact, that has continued.	62.0	999.0
201612	258	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	So our forecast over the next few years is that they keep the RMB stable against this basket of currencies, more or less, and as a result of that, you get a little bit more depreciation of the RMB against the dollar.	62.0	999.0
201612	259	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	62.0	110.0
201612	260	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions?	62.0	65.0
201612	261	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62.0	65.0
201612	262	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201612	263	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, I need a vote to ratify domestic open market operations.	63.0	65.0
201612	264	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	63.0	108.0
201612	265	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	A second?	63.0	65.0
201612	266	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Second.	63.0	96.0
201612	267	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63.0	65.0
201612	268	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	63.0	65.0
201612	269	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s move along next to our “Economic and Financial Situation.”	11.0	65.0
201612	270	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Stephanie Aaronson is going to start us off.	11.0	65.0
201612	271	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11.0	999.0
201612	272	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	I will be referring to the “Material for Staff Presentation on the Economic and Financial Situation.”	11.0	999.0
201612	273	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Your first exhibit summarizes the data received since the October projection, which corroborate that economic activity picked up in the second half of the year, as we’ve been anticipating for some time.	11.0	999.0
201612	274	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	As shown in panel 1, we expect real GDP to rise at about a 2½ percent pace, on average, in the second half of the year, up from a 1 percent pace in the first half.	11.0	999.0
201612	275	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In addition, the BEA’s first estimate of GDI in the third quarter, line 7, which we also find to be a useful signal of the strength of the economy, posted a large increase.	11.0	999.0
201612	276	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The incoming data for the third quarter have been a bit stronger than we expected, but with much of the surprise in volatile categories such as inventory investment and net exports, we now expect a smaller gain in the fourth quarter.	11.0	999.0
201612	277	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	As shown in panel 2, a number of System nowcasts of Q4 call for faster growth than the Board staff projects—suggesting some upside risk to our current-quarter projection.	11.0	999.0
201612	278	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The two employment reports we’ve received since the October Tealbook show that the labor market has continued to tighten.	11.0	999.0
201612	279	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Payroll employment advanced at a solid pace, and the unemployment rate, the black line in panel 3, dropped 0.3 percentage point to 4.6 percent in November.	11.0	999.0
201612	280	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate, the red line, has moved down 0.2 percentage point since September to 62.7 percent.	11.0	999.0
201612	281	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Our assessment is that the surprise in the unemployment rate will be only partially unwound—we have penciled in a forecast of 4.7 percent for December and in the first quarter.	11.0	999.0
201612	282	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	This view is partly informed by the labor flows data.	11.0	999.0
201612	283	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	As can be seen in panel 4, some of last month’s decline in the unemployment rate reflected an increase in the transition rate from unemployment to employment—a development that we think is likely to persist.	11.0	999.0
201612	284	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In a longer view, the flows data on labor force entry and exit, shown in panel 5, indicate that entry into the labor force, the black line, has slowed over the past year or so, even as labor market conditions have continued to tighten.	11.0	999.0
201612	285	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Nonetheless, exits from the labor force, the red line, have slowed even more, the result of which has been an improvement in participation over the past year.	11.0	999.0
201612	286	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	A look at the past few business cycles suggests that it is not unusual for exits to fall faster than entries as the unemployment rate nears the natural rate.	11.0	999.0
201612	287	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	These flows data suggest that workers are becoming more attached to the labor force as the expansion matures, perhaps reflecting better-quality job matches.	11.0	999.0
201612	288	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The first panel on your next exhibit compares the current path of GDP growth, the black line, with the one from a year ago in the December 2015 Tealbook, the red line.	11.0	999.0
201612	289	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	As can be seen, the data on GDP growth over the past year or so have surprised us to the downside, although our projection is little revised.	11.0	999.0
201612	290	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Meanwhile, the GDP gap in panel 2, which takes into account some small revisions to our supply side, shows a bit lower resource utilization this year than in the December 2015 Tealbook, although by the end of 2018 the gap is essentially unrevised.	11.0	999.0
201612	291	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Similarly, the unemployment rate in panel 3 was a touch higher than we anticipated for much of the past year but is little revised for the period ahead.	11.0	999.0
201612	292	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	While GDP growth has been a bit weaker and resource utilization is little revised, the interest rate environment has been much more accommodative than we expected.	11.0	999.0
201612	293	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Panel 4 plots the Treasury yield curve for 2016:Q4 as we projected at the time of the December 2015 Tealbook, the red line, and at present, the black line.	11.0	999.0
201612	294	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Last December we projected the yield on three-month Treasury securities would stand at 1½ percent by now, about 1 percentage point higher than its current value.	11.0	999.0
201612	295	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Meanwhile, the 10- year Treasury yield—despite its recent jump—is about 1¼ percentage points lower.	11.0	999.0
201612	296	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	As we have informed you previously, we took some signal from these developments over the past year and marked down our assumption regarding r* in the longer run.	11.0	999.0
201612	297	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Taking into account the upward revision we made this round, our estimate of longer-run r* is ¼ percentage point lower than in the December 2015 Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201612	298	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The most important change to our projection this round was that we assumed that an expansionary fiscal policy package would be enacted next year.	11.0	999.0
201612	299	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Obviously, a substantial amount of uncertainty surrounds the ultimate form of any package, so this assumption is meant to serve as a placeholder pending further developments.	11.0	999.0
201612	300	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	As is summarized in panel 5, we assume the Congress will pass a personal income tax reduction worth 1 percent of GDP, to begin in the third quarter of next year.	11.0	999.0
201612	301	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	We applied a standard marginal propensity to consume out of this income of 0.7 percent, so over the next several years the tax cut boosts GDP by a cumulative 0.7 percent, not including indirect multiplier effects or interest rate offsets.	11.0	999.0
201612	302	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The more stimulative fiscal policy also results in a higher exchange value of the dollar and higher interest rates.	11.0	999.0
201612	303	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Panel 6 provides a summary of the all-in effects of the fiscal assumptions on GDP growth in our projection.	11.0	999.0
201612	304	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	As shown by the rose- shaded part of the bar, fiscal policy, which includes both the initial fiscal impetus as well as the multiplier effect, cumulatively boosts spending by 85 basis points between 2017 and 2019.	11.0	999.0
201612	305	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	However, the higher interest rates crowd out private spending, and the higher dollar also subtracts from GDP.	11.0	999.0
201612	306	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	On net, we project the fiscal package will boost the level of GDP about 45 basis points by 2019.	11.0	999.0
201612	307	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In the final bullet of panel 5, as Simon discussed, the nominal 10-year Treasury yield moved up dramatically in the wake of the election, so substantial financial restraint is already in place.	11.0	999.0
201612	308	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	However, we have assumed, based on past experience, that households won’t increase spending in advance of the tax cut—indeed, it takes them three years to build the extra cash flow into their spending habits.	11.0	999.0
201612	309	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The panels on the next page summarize the inflation outlook.	11.0	999.0
201612	310	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	As can be seen in panels 1 and 2, our projections regarding both headline and core PCE price inflation are little changed from the October Tealbook, as the data have come in close to our expectations, and, in view of how flat we think the Phillips curve is, the modestly higher resource utilization in this projection does not translate into noticeably higher inflation.	11.0	999.0
201612	311	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The next two panels parse out the cumulative revisions that we have made to our projections of total and core PCE inflation since December of last year.	11.0	999.0
201612	312	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Total PCE inflation, panel 3, is now estimated to be about 0.3 percentage point higher this year than we projected last December, the black line, as upside surprises to energy prices and to core inflation outweigh the impact of lower-than-expected food prices.	11.0	999.0
201612	313	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The upward surprises to core inflation, parsed in panel 4, cannot be explained by the main factors that we track and so are concentrated in the yellow category with the not-very- illuminating label of “other.”	11.0	999.0
201612	314	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Part of the “other” category reflects the high readings on non-market-based core inflation we have received this year, from which we typically take little signal.	11.0	999.0
201612	315	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Panel 5 shows three of the measures of labor compensation that we follow.	11.0	999.0
201612	316	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	According to the latest readings, compensation has continued to rise at a moderate pace and is showing some slight signs of acceleration.	11.0	999.0
201612	317	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In exhibit 4, I summarize the FOMC memo that examined episodes in which the unemployment rate undershot its natural rate.	11.0	999.0
201612	318	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	For reference, the shaded regions in panel 1 highlight the domestic episodes of undershooting; I’ve also plotted total PCE price inflation on the chart.	11.0	999.0
201612	319	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In selecting these episodes, we relied on real-time data and current staff estimates of the natural rate, records of FOMC meetings such as transcripts and minutes, contemporaneous Monetary Policy Reports and testimonies, as well as the research literature.	11.0	999.0
201612	320	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The findings are summarized in panel 2.	11.0	999.0
201612	321	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	First, although they are not common, soft landings have occurred.	11.0	999.0
201612	322	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	We identified one domestic example, the mid-1990s, and two examples from advanced foreign economies.	11.0	999.0
201612	323	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	We took a very restrictive definition of a “soft landing,” as we required that the unemployment rate stabilize at or below real-time estimates of the natural rate and that no recession occur for a few years once the soft landing was achieved.	11.0	999.0
201612	324	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	This definition ruled out, for example, the moderation in the unemployment rate around 1984, because, at that time, the Committee viewed the unemployment rate as well above their estimate of its natural rate.	11.0	999.0
201612	325	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	And it ruled out the late 1990s and mid-2000s in the United States, as, in both cases, recessions followed within a couple of years.	11.0	999.0
201612	326	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Second, the soft landings share some characteristics.	11.0	999.0
201612	327	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Monetary policy typically began to tighten before the unemployment rate fell significantly below the natural rate.	11.0	999.0
201612	328	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In addition, the achievement of a soft landing depended substantially on the nature of the shocks that hit the economy.	11.0	999.0
201612	329	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	For instance, all three soft landings occurred during the mid-1990s or early 2000s, at a time when structural productivity growth was unexpectedly strong.	11.0	999.0
201612	330	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Another finding, unsurprisingly, is that tight labor markets have often been associated with higher inflation, both domestically and in the AFEs.	11.0	999.0
201612	331	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In the United States, the most prominent examples occurred in the late 1960s and 1970s.	11.0	999.0
201612	332	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	These episodes shared several features, which are summarized in panel 3.	11.0	999.0
201612	333	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	First, the inflation process was different then.	11.0	999.0
201612	334	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Panel 4 displays the coefficients on slack and inflation persistence from 10-year rolling regressions of an inflation equation similar to that used by the staff.	11.0	999.0
201612	335	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	As can be seen by the red line, inflation was more sensitive to slack in the 1970s than in subsequent years, and inflation was more persistent (the black line).	11.0	999.0
201612	336	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In panel 3, in many inflationary episodes, the Committee appeared to have underestimated the depth of the undershooting.	11.0	999.0
201612	337	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	For instance, during the 1960s, the Committee thought full employment was consistent with an unemployment rate of 4 percent, below current estimates.	11.0	999.0
201612	338	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Similarly, Athanasios Orphanides has shown that estimates of the output gap during the 1970s based on real-time information show lower levels of resource utilization than estimates based on current vintages of data and revised estimates of potential.	11.0	999.0
201612	339	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	A final feature of these inflationary episodes is that, for a variety of reasons, monetary policymakers in the 1960s and 1970s did not always focus on restraining economic activity in order to avoid inflation.	11.0	999.0
201612	340	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	As summarized in the last bullet of panel 2, we also sought to determine whether past incidents of undershooting were associated with financial instability and found that while financial imbalances and unemployment undershoots are correlated, causality is difficult to infer.	11.0	999.0
201612	341	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	And we examined whether running a “hot economy” has been associated with permanent improvements in the labor market.	11.0	999.0
201612	342	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Again, the results were ambiguous.	11.0	999.0
201612	343	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	On both questions, the research literature is sparse, and more research is warranted.	11.0	999.0
201612	344	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Let me conclude with a few thoughts.	11.0	999.0
201612	345	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Clearly, the historical record is ambiguous regarding the outcome of unemployment undershootings.	11.0	999.0
201612	346	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In the current situation, differences in the inflation process, along with the fact that inflation has been below the Committee’s objective, suggest that a substantial and unwanted move of inflation above the Committee’s objective is less likely than a simple assessment of historical episodes might suggest.	11.0	999.0
201612	347	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In addition, we continue to judge that financial stability vulnerabilities are currently at only a moderate level.	11.0	999.0
201612	348	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	That said, some of the factors that increase the risk associated with undershooting remain.	11.0	999.0
201612	349	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In view of the uncertainty surrounding both published data and our estimates of the natural rate of unemployment and potential output, we could be mismeasuring the amount of slack in the economy.	11.0	999.0
201612	350	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Moreover, as panel 4 suggests, the inflation process is not static and could revert such that inflation is more likely to move higher.	11.0	999.0
201612	351	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Finally, the economy remains subject to substantial shocks—and these shocks will certainly have an important effect on the outcome.	11.0	999.0
201612	352	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Brian Doyle will now continue with the international section of our presentation.	11.0	999.0
201612	353	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Thank you, Stephanie.	11.0	999.0
201612	354	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	At this point, you could be forgiven for being sick of hearing about the US election.	11.0	999.0
201612	355	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	But after countless months of heated campaigning and more than a month of post-election debate, I hope you will indulge me in talking a little more about its implications for the foreign economies.	11.0	999.0
201612	356	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	First, an overview of the forecast.	11.0	999.0
201612	357	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As seen in panel 1, third-quarter foreign real GDP growth recovered more strongly from its second-quarter doldrums than we had expected in October.	11.0	999.0
201612	358	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	After moderating in the fourth quarter, foreign growth settles around 2½ percent, subdued by historical standards, throughout the remainder of the forecast period.	11.0	999.0
201612	359	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As has been the case for some time, this outlook is helped by highly accommodative monetary policy in advanced foreign economies and a recovery— albeit a tepid one—in South America.	11.0	999.0
201612	360	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Expected changes in US policy have two small but noticeable effects on our foreign forecast.	11.0	999.0
201612	361	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	First, tighter financial conditions have left a small negative imprint on the near-term forecast, especially in emerging market economies (EMEs).	11.0	999.0
201612	362	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As Simon has noted, since the US election, longer-term rates, panel 2, have risen in most foreign economies; EME credit spreads, panel 3, have increased; and the dollar has appreciated sharply and broadly.	11.0	999.0
201612	363	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Second, the staff’s assumed additional US fiscal stimulus has a small net positive effect on foreign GDP growth later in the forecast period.	11.0	999.0
201612	364	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	I will discuss the fiscal stimulus effects first, then return to how we are interpreting the dollar.	11.0	999.0
201612	365	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	To gauge the effects of changes in US fiscal policy on foreign economies, we conduct two simulations using the IF Division’s SIGMA model, shown in panels 4 through 7.	11.0	999.0
201612	366	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	The first is an anticipated US tax cut of 1 percent of GDP, the blue lines, beginning in the third quarter of 2017 as assumed in the staff’s baseline forecast, and the second, shown by the red lines, augments this tax cut with another 1 percent of GDP in government spending as in an alternative scenario in the Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201612	367	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	In both cases the results are just illustrative, but the model is calibrated so that the effect on US GDP is reasonably in line with the staff’s assessment in the Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201612	368	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As you can see in panel 4, the boost from the tax cut scenario to foreign GDP is quite modest, less than one-fifth of the effect seen in the United States in the staff forecast.	11.0	999.0
201612	369	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	This foreign output response has helped inform what we have built into the foreign outlook.	11.0	999.0
201612	370	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	This effect operates through three channels.	11.0	999.0
201612	371	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	First, foreign exports, panel 5, are boosted as US consumers spend some of the tax cut on foreign goods and, second, as the dollar, panel 6, rises almost 1 percent.	11.0	999.0
201612	372	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	But, third, foreign interest rates also rise, panel 7, in part as foreign monetary policy reacts to stronger economic growth and higher inflation.	11.0	999.0
201612	373	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Thus, domestic demand in the foreign economy is crowded out some.	11.0	999.0
201612	374	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	In the alternative scenario in which additional US fiscal spending is added, the foreign growth effects, the red line in panel 4, are somewhat more than doubled, reflecting the larger effects on US GDP from a similarly sized package of government spending.	11.0	999.0
201612	375	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	In exhibit 6, the broad dollar, the black line in panel 1, has appreciated more than 3 percent since the election, with more of the move coming against the EMEs and with outsized rises against the Japanese yen in green and the Mexican peso in yellow.	11.0	999.0
201612	376	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Beyond this higher jumping-off point, we continue to expect the dollar to appreciate further over the forecast period, panel 2, reflecting our assessment that market expectations of US monetary policy rates are still below those assumed in the staff forecast.	11.0	999.0
201612	377	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Accordingly, as in past forecasts, we project the dollar to rise as markets are surprised by the degree of FOMC tightening.	11.0	999.0
201612	378	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As we have indicated for some time, this dollar path could prove wrong for several reasons.	11.0	999.0
201612	379	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	To begin with, the sensitivity of the dollar with respect to surprises in monetary policy is quite uncertain.	11.0	999.0
201612	380	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As shown in the scatterplot in panel 3, our rule of thumb is that the dollar’s value against the AFE currencies rises about 1 percent for roughly every 30 basis point surprise in interest rates.	11.0	999.0
201612	381	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	However, this relationship has varied a lot in recent years.	11.0	999.0
201612	382	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	And thus the dollar could be stronger or weaker than we expect.	11.0	999.0
201612	383	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Furthermore, as Simon noted, some of the recent dollar appreciation is likely a response to expectations of more stimulative US fiscal policy.	11.0	999.0
201612	384	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	If we take the post- election shift in monetary policy expectations as solely due to changes in fiscal policy expectations, then our rule of thumb suggests that only about half of the appreciation is a result of fiscal policy.	11.0	999.0
201612	385	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As shown by the red dot in panel 3, over the five days following the election, the AFE index of the dollar rose about 2 percent, whereas our rule of thumb predicted only a 1 percent rise, on the basis of the more than 30 basis point widening of the interest rate differential shown on the horizontal axis.	11.0	999.0
201612	386	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Note that the 1 percent rise from the rule of thumb is about the same as the increase in the dollar shown in our fiscal scenario on the previous slide.	11.0	999.0
201612	387	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	How do we account for the difference between our rule of thumb and the actual move in the dollar?	11.0	999.0
201612	388	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	One possibility is that markets share the staff’s view on the size of the fiscal expansion, but the sensitivity of the dollar with respect to interest rates was higher than our rule of thumb during the period.	11.0	999.0
201612	389	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	In this case, assuming the 1-percent-of-GDP fiscal package materializes, the dollar might well evolve as we project in the Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201612	390	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	But another possibility is that markets are expecting a much larger fiscal package than we are assuming.	11.0	999.0
201612	391	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Indeed, in the alternative scenario with a larger fiscal policy, the dollar appreciates about twice as much.	11.0	999.0
201612	392	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	In that case, if the staff assumption for fiscal policy materializes and markets are surprised by how small the fiscal package turns out to be, the dollar might well prove weaker than we are projecting.	11.0	999.0
201612	393	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	And a third possibility is that the outsized rise in the dollar reflects other factors besides fiscal expansion.	11.0	999.0
201612	394	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Some of these factors are reviewed in your next exhibit.	11.0	999.0
201612	395	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	To begin with, talk about repatriation of foreign profits of US companies could have put upward pressure on the dollar.	11.0	999.0
201612	396	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	That said, the effect of repatriation on the dollar would probably be relatively small.	11.0	999.0
201612	397	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As shown in panel 1, during the previous episode of repatriation, which was announced in June and passed in October of 2004, the dollar declined against AFEs, although it then moved up before the second half of 2005, when we believe most repatriation flows took place.	11.0	999.0
201612	398	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Furthermore, currently, an estimated 70 to 95 percent of the more than $1 trillion in US corporations’ cash held abroad is held in US dollar-denominated accounts, and transferring these funds from foreign subsidiaries to US parents would not affect the value of the dollar.	11.0	999.0
201612	399	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Another factor that might have led to the recent outsized rise in the dollar was concerns that EMEs would be especially vulnerable to future increases in interest rates and other developments, as highlighted in a Tealbook alternative scenario.	11.0	999.0
201612	400	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	EME capital flows, panel 2, turned sharply negative after the election.	11.0	999.0
201612	401	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	And, as shown in the scatterplot in panel 3, the EME currencies that fell the most since the election were those with greater underlying structural and macroeconomic vulnerabilities.	11.0	999.0
201612	402	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	A third factor that may have boosted the dollar recently, or which could influence the dollar in the future, is the risk that the United States will erect trade barriers or tighten immigration policy.	11.0	999.0
201612	403	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	The first of these likely explains part of the outsized decline in the Mexican peso, which has a large weight in the broad dollar index.	11.0	999.0
201612	404	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	However, it is unclear whether this consideration explains movements in other currencies.	11.0	999.0
201612	405	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As shown in panel 4, if one excludes Mexico from the scatterplot, the correlation between currency depreciation and the importance of exports to the United States is close to zero.	11.0	999.0
201612	406	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	I will return to trade policy shortly.	11.0	999.0
201612	407	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Besides the factors that likely contributed to the dollar’s immediate post-election surge, a number of other factors will likely affect the dollar’s path in the future.	11.0	999.0
201612	408	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	One of them is worries about Europe.	11.0	999.0
201612	409	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	To be sure, the failed Italian referendum left only a limited mark on financial markets.	11.0	999.0
201612	410	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	But many risks remain, including the fragility of the European banking sector and concerns that the Brexit vote is one more crack in a fracturing European project.	11.0	999.0
201612	411	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	And with several key elections scheduled during 2017, as listed in panel 5, worries that an anti-EU group could gain power will likely feed dollar strength for some time.	11.0	999.0
201612	412	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Additionally, China is a perennial risk to the dollar forecast.	11.0	999.0
201612	413	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Even before the election, as Simon noted, private capital outflows from China, the gray bars in panel 6, had reaccelerated, apparently on renewed expectations that the depreciation of the renminbi against the dollar is a one-way bet.	11.0	999.0
201612	414	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Indeed, the RMB has continued to depreciate against the dollar over the intermeeting period, falling 2 percent.	11.0	999.0
201612	415	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Authorities have increased their intervention to support the renminbi and more recently imposed additional capital controls.	11.0	999.0
201612	416	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	But the accelerated outflows raise the possibility of a more rapid depreciation of the RMB that unsettles markets.	11.0	999.0
201612	417	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	In your next exhibit, despite these risks, and as shown in panel 1, looking through the short-term soybean-related wiggles of late, past dollar appreciation as well as that expected to come continues to weigh on the net export contribution to US GDP growth.	11.0	999.0
201612	418	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	The higher dollar has increased the drag arising from net exports, panel 2, although the direct boost to imports due to US fiscal policy stimulus, panel 3, plays a sizable role as well, especially further out in the forecast period.	11.0	999.0
201612	419	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	It bears mentioning that at this point in our business cycle, some drag due to net exports in the next couple of years is not necessarily undesirable—it represents one of the transmission channels of a normalization of monetary policy designed to avert overheating in an environment of full or near-full employment.	11.0	999.0
201612	420	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As noted in panel 4, this baseline forecast of US trade does not include effects of potential trade measures, except to the extent that worries over higher tariffs may have affected the dollar.	11.0	999.0
201612	421	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As discussed in greater depth by my colleague Rob Vigfusson in his pre-FOMC briefing yesterday, the President has broad authority to raise tariffs, and President-elect Trump has discussed several possible actions, including renegotiating or withdrawing from NAFTA and declaring China a currency manipulator.	11.0	999.0
201612	422	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	The panels below illustrate the macroeconomic effects of a generic 10 percent rise in tariffs.	11.0	999.0
201612	423	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As shown by the blue line in panel 5, in principle, a unilateral and persistent hike in tariffs could raise US output in the short run by shifting foreign production to domestic producers and thus boosting the trade balance, panel 6.	11.0	999.0
201612	424	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	But the rise in import costs raises inflation, panel 7, which together with the increase in output will result in monetary policy tightening, not shown, and a higher dollar, panel 8, muting some of the shift in trade.	11.0	999.0
201612	425	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Moreover, higher interest rates and import costs also lower investment, not shown.	11.0	999.0
201612	426	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Outside of the model, it may be difficult to shift production to domestic producers quickly because of specialized production or long-term contracts, and higher trade barriers might disrupt supply chains and, hence, reduce production.	11.0	999.0
201612	427	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Of course, tariffs rarely remain unilateral.	11.0	999.0
201612	428	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As shown by the red lines in panels 5 and 6, when the foreign country reciprocates with matching-percentage tariffs, US output is hurt even in the short run, in part as US exports decline relative to baseline.	11.0	999.0
201612	429	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Over the longer run, while some of these shorter-run issues might work themselves out, higher tariffs are almost always a net negative for aggregate economic growth and welfare, in part by hampering productivity, although the estimated size of the negative effect of tariffs varies in the literature.	11.0	999.0
201612	430	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	I will now turn to Don Kim, who will brief on participants’ Summary of Economic Projections submissions.	11.0	999.0
201612	431	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201612	432	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	I will be referring to the packet labeled “Material for Briefing on the Summary of Economic Projections.”	11.0	999.0
201612	433	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	To summarize, most of your economic projections are little changed from the September SEP, although the median projected path of the federal funds rate is slightly higher.	11.0	999.0
201612	434	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	However, more of you now see the uncertainty surrounding your economic projections as above historically typical levels, and fewer of you now see the risks to economic growth or inflation as tilted to the downside or the risks to unemployment as weighted to the upside.	11.0	999.0
201612	435	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Exhibit 1 summarizes your economic projections, which are conditional on your individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.	11.0	999.0
201612	436	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	As shown in the top panel, the median of your projections of real GDP growth this year is 1.9 percent.	11.0	999.0
201612	437	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Most of you project that economic growth will pick up a bit next year and run at or above your estimates of its longer-run rate through 2019.	11.0	999.0
201612	438	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	As shown in the second panel, the median of your projections of the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2016 is 4.7 percent, slightly below the median of its longer-run normal level.	11.0	999.0
201612	439	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Almost all of you see the unemployment rate falling a bit further next year and expect it to remain below its longer-run normal level through 2019.	11.0	999.0
201612	440	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	As can be seen in the third panel, the median of your projections of headline PCE inflation moves up from 1.5 percent this year to 1.9 percent in 2017 and 2 percent in 2018 and 2019, with several of you projecting a modest overshooting of the 2 percent objective in 2019.	11.0	999.0
201612	441	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	In the bottom panel, the median of your projections of core inflation also increases gradually over the next three years.	11.0	999.0
201612	442	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Exhibit 2 compares your current projections with those in the September Summary of Economic Projections and with the December Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201612	443	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	As indicated in the top panel, the medians of your projections of economic growth have edged up since September, and, as shown in the second panel, the medians of your projections of the unemployment rate have edged down.	11.0	999.0
201612	444	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Most of you who revised these projections pointed to forthcoming changes in fiscal policy.	11.0	999.0
201612	445	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	As shown in the third panel, the median of your projections of headline PCE inflation this year was revised up moderately, largely reflecting incoming data.	11.0	999.0
201612	446	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Although a majority of you have modestly revised up your projection of core PCE inflation this year, the median of your projections of core inflation this year, shown in the fourth panel, is unchanged.	11.0	999.0
201612	447	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	The medians of your projections of headline and core inflation beyond this year are also unchanged.	11.0	999.0
201612	448	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Compared with the December Tealbook, the medians of your projections of real GDP growth are roughly similar, while the medians of your projections of the unemployment rate and of the headline and core inflation rates are generally somewhat higher than those presented in the Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201612	449	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Exhibit 3 provides an overview of your assessments of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate.	11.0	999.0
201612	450	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Your projections of the federal funds rate at the end of this year, shown at the left of the upper panel, suggest that all of you assumed a 25 basis point rate hike at this meeting.	11.0	999.0
201612	451	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Thereafter, the medians of your projections, marked by horizontal red lines, are 1.38 percent at the end of 2017, 2.13 percent at the end of 2018, and 2.88 percent at the end of 2019, with the median projection for each of these three years 25 basis points higher than in September, shown in the bottom panel.	11.0	999.0
201612	452	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	The median of the longer-run federal funds rate rose slightly to 3 percent.	11.0	999.0
201612	453	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	As in September, almost all of you anticipated that the appropriate level of the funds rate at the end of 2018 would remain below your individual judgments of its longer-run level, but about half of you, considerably more than in September, now project the funds rate to overshoot its longer-run level in 2019.	11.0	999.0
201612	454	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	As shown by the red diamonds in exhibit 3, the median federal funds rate that a non-inertial Taylor (1999) rule prescribes—conditional on your individual projections of core inflation, the unemployment rate gap, and the longer-run federal funds rate— has shifted up since September.	11.0	999.0
201612	455	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	The rise in the Taylor rule prescription for the end of this year primarily reflects upward revisions to projected inflation and downward revisions to the unemployment rate, while the higher Taylor rule prescriptions for years beyond 2016 result largely from the downward revisions to the unemployment rate.	11.0	999.0
201612	456	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Almost all of you project levels of the federal funds rate in 2016 to 2018 that are well below the prescriptions derived by using your individual economic outlooks as inputs into the policy rule formula.	11.0	999.0
201612	457	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	The median of your projections for 2019 is also below the median Taylor rule prescription but much closer than for preceding years.	11.0	999.0
201612	458	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Exhibit 4 provides some detail on your assumptions about fiscal policy and some analysis of the effects on your projections.	11.0	999.0
201612	459	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Based on your written narratives, nine of you incorporated some change in fiscal policy in your baseline projections, with most of this group assuming that the fiscal stimulus would be of the same order of magnitude as in the December Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201612	460	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Among the eight of you who did not incorporate a change in fiscal policy into your baseline projections, many expressed the view that at this point uncertainty surrounding prospective changes in fiscal and other policies is very large or that there is not yet enough information to make a reasonable assumption about the magnitude of the changes.	11.0	999.0
201612	461	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	As can be seen in the top and middle sections of the lower panel, the revisions since September in your projections of real GDP growth and the unemployment rate for those of you who have not incorporated a change in fiscal policy are close to zero on average.	11.0	999.0
201612	462	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	In contrast, those of you who incorporated some stimulus from fiscal policy, on average, modestly revised up your projections of real output growth and revised down your projections of the unemployment rate in 2018 and 2019.	11.0	999.0
201612	463	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	A similar breakdown for the changes in your assumptions about appropriate monetary policy compared with September is shown in the bottom section; those of you who incorporated a change in fiscal policy revised up your projections of the federal funds rate in 2018 and 2019 by about 25 to 30 basis points on average, while those of you who did not change your fiscal assumption had little change in your federal funds rate projections on average.	11.0	999.0
201612	464	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Many of you mentioned that the recent tightening in financial conditions, together with a somewhat steeper path of the policy rate, provides a partial offset to the effects of the fiscal stimulus, which may help explain the relatively small size of the revisions to the economic variables, even for those who have incorporated a change in fiscal policy.	11.0	999.0
201612	465	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Exhibit 5 shows your assessments of the uncertainty and risks surrounding your economic projections.	11.0	999.0
201612	466	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	As shown in the figures to the left, a majority of you continue to view the uncertainty associated with your projections as broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years.	11.0	999.0
201612	467	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	However, more of you now see the uncertainty about GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or inflation as higher than in September.	11.0	999.0
201612	468	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Many of you mentioned uncertainty surrounding fiscal, trade, immigration, or regulatory policies, noting that it is difficult to predict the size, timing, and composition of these policy changes.	11.0	999.0
201612	469	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	As illustrated in the figures to the right, fewer of you now see the risks to economic growth and inflation as weighted to the downside and the risks to unemployment as weighted to the upside than in September.	11.0	999.0
201612	470	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Many of you noted that the prospect of expansionary fiscal policy had increased the upside risks to output growth and inflation, but many also pointed to factors such as the proximity of short- term nominal interest rates to the effective lower bound, global disinflationary pressures, downside risks in Europe and China, and the possibility of a large jump in financial market volatility in the event that fiscal policy turns out to be less stimulative than expected, as sources of downside risk.	11.0	999.0
201612	471	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201612	472	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	That concludes our prepared remarks.	11.0	999.0
201612	473	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	We would be happy to respond to your questions.	11.0	999.0
201612	474	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for any of our presenters?	12.0	65.0
201612	475	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	12.0	65.0
201612	476	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	I am sure I should know this, but which are generally more accurate, the SEP forecasts or the Tealbook projections?	12.0	108.0
201612	477	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	For what?	12.0	999.0
201612	478	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	GDP, interest rates, whatever.	12.0	108.0
201612	479	2016-12-14	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	The answer is they are both equally bad.	12.0	999.0
201612	480	2016-12-14	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	[Laughter]	12.0	999.0
201612	481	2016-12-14	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	That’s the best answer.	12.0	999.0
201612	482	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	That was so diplomatic.	12.0	91.0
201612	483	2016-12-14	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	They are close enough.	12.0	999.0
201612	484	2016-12-14	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	The Tealbook does slightly better on near-term inflation forecasts, but that’s on a very short-run horizon.	12.0	999.0
201612	485	2016-12-14	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	But other than that, they are really about the same.	12.0	999.0
201612	486	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Do we need the SEP when we have the Tealbook?	12.0	108.0
201612	487	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Well, we put the SEP into the public domain.	12.0	65.0
201612	488	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Are we going to put the Tealbook out?	12.0	108.0
201612	489	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	12.0	65.0
201612	490	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	But we do that with a five-year lag.	12.0	65.0
201612	491	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	12.0	65.0
201612	492	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes.	12.0	102.0
201612	493	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have two questions for the staff.	12.0	102.0
201612	494	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	One is a technical one on the simulations you reported this afternoon regarding fiscal policy.	12.0	102.0
201612	495	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Those on exhibit 5 were done with the FRB/US model.	12.0	102.0
201612	496	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Is that right?	12.0	102.0
201612	497	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	No, they were done with the SIGMA model.	12.0	999.0
201612	498	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the Tealbook I thought they were done with the FRB/US model.	12.0	102.0
201612	499	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	That’s right.	12.0	999.0
201612	500	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As I noted, we are trying to calibrate the response of US GDP in a model that includes a bigger international sector.	12.0	999.0
201612	501	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay.	12.0	102.0
201612	502	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	That helped because it is a little confusing.	12.0	102.0
201612	503	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	But when I look at the Tealbook assumption about monetary policy in the other advanced foreign economies, except for the United Kingdom, it sounds like you have basically constant, zero, or negative, or whatever interest rates for the next several years.	12.0	102.0
201612	504	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	So when you did the SIGMA model simulations of a strong fiscal expansion in the United States, did they incorporate these typically very large multipliers for them?	12.0	102.0
201612	505	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201612	506	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	So in this SIGMA simulation, it’s a three-country model, and the United States of course is one of those countries.	12.0	999.0
201612	507	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	The other two countries are split up by those that are at the effective lower bound and those that are not.	12.0	999.0
201612	508	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	And those that are not at the effective lower bound, say, for the blue lines, which is the assumed tax cut, get a little bit more than twice the kick because, at the effective lower bound, monetary policy doesn’t respond.	12.0	999.0
201612	509	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	And what did you assume about their response?	12.0	102.0
201612	510	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Did you assume that they would just stay at zero for the next few years?	12.0	102.0
201612	511	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	This matters a lot when you do these simulations.	12.0	102.0
201612	512	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201612	513	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	They don’t respond for a while.	12.0	999.0
201612	514	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay.	12.0	102.0
201612	515	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	For the rest of the world, fiscal stimulus in the United States is exactly what the doctor ordered, as they are at the interest-rate lower bound.	12.0	102.0
201612	516	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	I just wanted to make sure that that I had that right.	12.0	102.0
201612	517	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	The second question was more of a question to the staff.	12.0	102.0
201612	518	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	When I read Tealbook A, I was surprised.	12.0	102.0
201612	519	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	I actually thought I was reading the September one.	12.0	102.0
201612	520	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Specifically, on the risks to the GDP outlook, I was surprised the Tealbook took the stand that the risks were still tilted to the downside.	12.0	102.0
201612	521	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	When I look at the SEP responses or when I read the Monday morning briefing, which I know had an alternative view aspect, it seems to me there are now a lot of risks to the upside in terms of fiscal policy, at least in the short term.	12.0	102.0
201612	522	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	The way I describe my views, I was “balanced but slightly to the soft side” because of the effective lower bound, but then this shifted me over to “balanced but slightly to the upside” because of the potential for much larger fiscal stimulus than you incorporated.	12.0	102.0
201612	523	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Could you explain your thinking about why overall the risks were still to the downside on GDP and the upside on unemployment?	12.0	102.0
201612	524	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	Our views on fiscal policy have changed in the period since the outcome of the election.	12.0	999.0
201612	525	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	Previously, our rationale had included a view that fiscal policy was unlikely to be marshaled heavily in opposition to material weakening in cyclical conditions.	12.0	999.0
201612	526	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	But it remains the case, in our judgment, that monetary policy, both here and abroad, is probably less well positioned to combat a significant cyclical weakening.	12.0	999.0
201612	527	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	Even with the upward tilt, we think that, if it’s long enough until the next recession ensues, monetary policy in the United States, in any event, will be reasonably well positioned to combat that.	12.0	999.0
201612	528	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	But at the moment, on the basis of how much reduction in the funds rate the Committee has judged to be appropriate in the face of an average-sized recession and on the basis of how large the balance sheet is already, the capacity for a material monetary policy easing is now less than has been the case historically.	12.0	999.0
201612	529	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, David, that’s exactly what I thought you were thinking.	12.0	102.0
201612	530	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	I’m expecting that I am walking into something.	12.0	999.0
201612	531	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	[Laughter]	12.0	999.0
201612	532	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes, you are walking into agreement with me, which is probably what you want to run from here.	12.0	102.0
201612	533	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	And that makes me—I’ve got my hand on my wallet.	12.0	999.0
201612	534	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	But seriously, it sounds like it’s not really a near-term kind of assessment.	12.0	102.0
201612	535	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s really more of a medium- or longer-term assessment of where we are in terms of—if I can say this—the steady-state balance of risks, because of the lower bound with a low r* and with the global conditions that you anticipate.	12.0	102.0
201612	536	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	The reason I point this out is that it’s not just a statement in a way about, well, right now we’re still at a low interest rate, right now core inflation is 1¾ percent, because even with a 4.2 percent unemployment rate and core inflation roughly at our target, in the Tealbook you still see this as a scenario in which the underlying risks are still to the downside.	12.0	102.0
201612	537	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I think that maybe just trying to make that point is helpful.	12.0	102.0
201612	538	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	Well, I thought I was with you, but you indicated the opposite conclusion than what I thought.	12.0	999.0
201612	539	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	I thought I heard you just say that our judgment is mainly a medium-term judgment about asymmetric risks, and I would have said the opposite—that my concern predominantly is a recession, if one were to occur.	12.0	999.0
201612	540	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	We don’t have one in the baseline.	12.0	999.0
201612	541	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	But we’re talking about risks here.	12.0	999.0
201612	542	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	And a recession in the next year or two, before the level of the funds rate has moved further up in its trajectory, would cause greater concern in terms of the ability of the Committee to fight the effects of the recession.	12.0	999.0
201612	543	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	But then some ways, as long as there is a lower bound, isn’t that always the case?	12.0	96.0
201612	544	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Right.	12.0	102.0
201612	545	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	So that’s what I’m wondering about.	12.0	102.0
201612	546	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Because you have 4.2 percent unemployment, you’re basically at baseline in that situation.	12.0	102.0
201612	547	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	Implicit in our projection, I think, is that there are some headwinds and that some normalization of real macroeconomic conditions will occur over the next few years, and that will give the Committee some greater scope to raise the funds rate.	12.0	999.0
201612	548	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	In particular, the Laubach and Williams estimates are that the equilibrium real rate is, I think, in the neighborhood of about ¼ percent at the moment.	12.0	999.0
201612	549	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	In the longer run, we now, having incorporated a more expansionary fiscal policy, have it at 1 percent.	12.0	999.0
201612	550	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	And so, as that process of increase in the equilibrium short rate unfolds, that will give a little bit greater scope for an easing of the stance of monetary policy in the future, several years down the road, than would be available today.	12.0	999.0
201612	551	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Well, my concern, obviously, is that that doesn’t occur, right?	12.0	102.0
201612	552	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	When we reduce our balance sheet and everything, we will find that the equilibrium real rate is actually quite low.	12.0	102.0
201612	553	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, anyway, this is just a topic for further discussion.	12.0	102.0
201612	554	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	It certainly is an admissible risk.	12.0	999.0
201612	555	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	It’s not what is envisioned in our baseline.	12.0	999.0
201612	556	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	12.0	65.0
201612	557	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I have several questions, but first I wanted to build on what President Williams said.	12.0	96.0
201612	558	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess my view of the risks to the forecast is that you have a modal forecast and then you ask, where is the skew of the distribution?	12.0	96.0
201612	559	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s not about where the lower bound lies relative to the funds rate.	12.0	96.0
201612	560	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So I guess I interpret the balance of the risks differently, I think, than you do.	12.0	96.0
201612	561	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I want to ask about two different things.	12.0	96.0
201612	562	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	First of all, what’s the staff’s thinking about what level of knowledge they have to have before they put something in the Tealbook?	12.0	96.0
201612	563	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I mean, I was really struck by how the FOMC participants handled the fiscal uncertainty in very distinct ways, yet the Tealbook put in 1 percent, starting in the third quarter.	12.0	96.0
201612	564	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	What’s the threshold for deciding to do that relative to deciding to put something in for trade barriers going up or immigration policy being tightened?	12.0	96.0
201612	565	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I mean, how do you think about that?	12.0	96.0
201612	566	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Because we have this very specific fiscal forecast, and when I think about the uncertainty associated with it, it’s just enormous in terms of magnitude, timing, and composition.	12.0	96.0
201612	567	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	When does it get over the bar?	12.0	96.0
201612	568	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	What is the decision rule?	12.0	96.0
201612	569	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess that’s what I’m asking.	12.0	96.0
201612	570	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201612	571	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	I think there are two issues.	12.0	999.0
201612	572	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	One is, how do we make the decision to put something in?	12.0	999.0
201612	573	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	And then what do we decide to put in?	12.0	999.0
201612	574	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Because once we decide to do something, it’s a modal forecast, so we need to write down something specific.	12.0	999.0
201612	575	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In this case we felt that, in view of what had been said during the election campaign and as the Republicans will control the White House and the Congress, there seemed to be some appetite for doing something, and we thought it was likely.	12.0	999.0
201612	576	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	There has long been talk about tax cuts.	12.0	999.0
201612	577	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The Republicans have been in favor of doing that, and it was something that Donald Trump campaigned on.	12.0	999.0
201612	578	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The House Republicans have had a plan that has been circulated, and it is actually pretty similar in magnitude to what we built into the forecast.	12.0	999.0
201612	579	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	I think that there is clearly a huge range of uncertainty.	12.0	999.0
201612	580	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	But a tax cut was under discussion to a sufficient degree that we thought it seemed likely that they would move forward on this.	12.0	999.0
201612	581	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	And, actually, this situation is similar to what happened in the early 2000s when, even before the 2000 election, there was some talk about tax cuts.	12.0	999.0
201612	582	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	And, actually, once George W.	12.0	999.0
201612	583	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Bush came into office, their implementation moved forward pretty quickly.	12.0	999.0
201612	584	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So the bar is sort of:  That you’re highly confident of direction.	12.0	96.0
201612	585	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201612	586	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	If you’re reasonably confident of direction, then you’re going to put something in.	12.0	96.0
201612	587	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Is that a way to think about it?	12.0	96.0
201612	588	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	I think so.	12.0	999.0
201612	589	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	That’s how I was thinking about our having moved in that direction.	12.0	999.0
201612	590	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Okay.	12.0	96.0
201612	591	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Although it’s worth noting, by comparison, on the trade policy front, we are also moderately confident in direction.	12.0	999.0
201612	592	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Right.	12.0	96.0
201612	593	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	We expect that if there are going to be moves, they will be toward higher barriers of trade.	12.0	999.0
201612	594	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	But the array of different possible actions that have been floated by the campaign were so disparate, and the magnitude of some of the individual items—reopening NAFTA, declaring China a trade manipulator—were so difficult to gauge that it was very hard even to assess whether there would be actions that would be macroeconomically meaningful, or whether there would just be a series of disparate actions that might have microeconomic effects but not amount to a lot on the macro side.	12.0	999.0
201612	595	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	So, for that reason, we chose not to assume trade policies in our baseline.	12.0	999.0
201612	596	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Look, I don’t think there is a perfect choice here.	12.0	96.0
201612	597	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it is just really a hard choice.	12.0	96.0
201612	598	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I just wanted to understand the rationale.	12.0	96.0
201612	599	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	I’d just like to elaborate on one other aspect of how we made the decision.	12.0	999.0
201612	600	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Sure.	12.0	96.0
201612	601	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	We had to make a decision to do something.	12.0	999.0
201612	602	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	It was clear that financial market participants made a judgment that something is likely to be in the offing.	12.0	999.0
201612	603	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Agreed.	12.0	96.0
201612	604	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	I think it would have been reasonable, and, indeed, I contemplated seriously putting in front of the Committee a projection in which we had no fiscal adjustment.	12.0	999.0
201612	605	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	That would have required a more elaborate process of backing out, on the basis of financial market quotes, some allowance for the response that they had built in, in anticipation of a fiscal policy path that we were not putting in.	12.0	999.0
201612	606	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Right.	12.0	96.0
201612	607	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	Now, it really was, more or less, a coincidence, not a design objective, that the fiscal package that our analysts proposed to put in does seem to be in pretty good alignment with what most financial market participants are writing down, and that’s documented in the memo that we sent to the Committee.	12.0	999.0
201612	608	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	We look like we’re in the middle of the pack of the various people who were taking a swing at making some kind of judgment.	12.0	999.0
201612	609	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	So to a degree I think that has eased our analytical burden in constructing a coherent forecast that had one story behind it.	12.0	999.0
201612	610	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	But I would say that to help the Committee in its thinking, we put a couple of alternative scenarios in the “Risks and Uncertainty” section, one with no fiscal package and one that is, roughly speaking, twice as big.	12.0	999.0
201612	611	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	The other percentage point’s worth of GDP comes in the form of government spending rather than tax cuts.	12.0	999.0
201612	612	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	No, I thought it was good to do.	12.0	96.0
201612	613	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I want to switch gears a little bit.	12.0	96.0
201612	614	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I liked the memos on unemployment-rate undershooting.	12.0	96.0
201612	615	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	The one thing they didn’t get into, though, is this empirical regularity, at least for the United States, whose unemployment rate either goes up a little or it goes up a lot, and I think in the memo they talked about different countries’ experiences.	12.0	96.0
201612	616	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there was one country, Canada, for which it did go up 1 percentage point.	12.0	96.0
201612	617	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	But why we see this empirical regularity that the unemployment either goes up a trivial amount, or by a lot, is interesting.	12.0	96.0
201612	618	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	And I guess I’m still curious about the staff’s views on that, whether that is just a statistical anomaly, because we haven’t had that many business cycles, or if there’s something dynamically going on in the economy when the unemployment rate starts to go up that generates those kinds of outcomes.	12.0	96.0
201612	619	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	And the memos were silent on that one question.	12.0	96.0
201612	620	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201612	621	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	A couple of years ago, the staff actually did send a memo to the Committee on that, documenting that empirical regularity.	12.0	999.0
201612	622	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	And what it found was that those episodes in which the unemployment rate did go up a lot were often associated with efforts on the part of the Committee to—	12.0	999.0
201612	623	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Make it so?	12.0	96.0
201612	624	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	—to make it so, to tame inflation.	12.0	999.0
201612	625	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	And I will note that there were a couple of episodes—in particular, the mid-1990s—when the unemployment rate did come up a bit.	12.0	999.0
201612	626	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	But it came up slowly enough that it didn’t trigger this particular stylized fact that you’re referring to.	12.0	999.0
201612	627	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Right.	12.0	96.0
201612	628	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The stylized fact is something along the lines of, say, a three-month moving average of the unemployment rate, because it’s noisy, rises 0.4 percentage point.	12.0	999.0
201612	629	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Or more.	12.0	96.0
201612	630	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Yes, or more, over the course of a quarter or two.	12.0	999.0
201612	631	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Actually, in the mid-1990s, when we did find one of these soft landings, in fact, it was a soft landing from below, where the unemployment rate, relative to what we thought was the natural rate then, did come up a bit.	12.0	999.0
201612	632	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Clearly, we do think that there are some dynamics, once the economy does start into a recession, that generate these rapid increases in the unemployment rate.	12.0	999.0
201612	633	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	But I wouldn’t say that I thought that the memo precluded the possibility of these other rises.	12.0	999.0
201612	634	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Actually, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the period for which we sort of identified the interrupted soft landing, the unemployment rate was gradually drifting up.	12.0	999.0
201612	635	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	And we were kind of ambivalent about whether that would have ended in a recession, had not the shock associated with the 1990 invasion of Kuwait occurred.	12.0	999.0
201612	636	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	But that’s another case in which there is some evidence of it.	12.0	999.0
201612	637	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So, not to put words in your mouth—would you characterize yourself as believing, agnostic, not believing?	12.0	96.0
201612	638	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Agnostic, is that the way you are on this issue?	12.0	96.0
201612	639	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	About whether the unemployment rate would—	12.0	999.0
201612	640	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Whether there’s something there or just a statistical artifact.	12.0	96.0
201612	641	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	I think there is something there, in the sense that I think when we enter a recession the unemployment rate goes up quickly, and that’s often when you see it.	12.0	999.0
201612	642	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	But I don’t think that that precludes the possibility that you can have those gradual increases.	12.0	999.0
201612	643	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	I think we haven’t seen that many of them because we don’t have that many examples, but when we were looking, there weren’t that many examples we identified in which the Committee actually said that it was trying to achieve a soft landing.	12.0	999.0
201612	644	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	And so I think it’s just a little unclear.	12.0	999.0
201612	645	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	I don’t think the fact that we view this empirical regularity rules out the possibility that it can also go up gradually.	12.0	999.0
201612	646	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So to President Rosengren, don’t despair.	12.0	96.0
201612	647	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	12.0	96.0
201612	648	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	And with that, we turn the floor over to President Rosengren.	12.0	65.0
201612	649	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	I want to follow up on Vice Chairman Dudley’s first question and David Wilcox’s response to it.	12.0	90.0
201612	650	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	When I look at the revisions to the projections broken out by change in fiscal assumption and no change in fiscal assumption, I see that the no change in fiscal assumption for the real GDP is zero, minus 0.01, 0.01, and zero.	12.0	90.0
201612	651	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	So, no change from the previous time.	12.0	90.0
201612	652	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	But we observe that the 10-year Treasury yield is 70 basis points higher.	12.0	90.0
201612	653	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Either you had to do the exercise that David talked about, which is to back out all the financial market movements in order to be able to come up with that forecast, or you have to be modeling a very severe monetary policy contraction because that would be the reason you don’t have fiscal policy changing—then, presumably, it’s a monetary policy change.	12.0	90.0
201612	654	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	In effect, this would be modeling a very substantial monetary policy tightening with no change in GDP.	12.0	90.0
201612	655	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	If this were to be something that were used in the press conference, I think it would lead to a lot of awkward questioning because you’d have to come up with how people actually backed out their expectation of how much the financial market reaction is due to changed expectations regarding fiscal policy.	12.0	90.0
201612	656	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	That could generate a whole host of questions.	12.0	90.0
201612	657	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	I don’t know if you were planning on using this in the press conference.	12.0	90.0
201612	658	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	I wasn’t planning on using this, but I was planning on, if asked about the SEP, saying that some participants included a fiscal policy change and some didn’t, and that you could note that even when there were assumptions of a fiscal policy change, the changes in the federal funds rate paths were modest.	12.0	65.0
201612	659	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	But then, for those that didn’t, you have to explain how you had a 70 basis point increase in the 10-year Treasury yield that is not due to changed expectations regarding fiscal policy.	12.0	90.0
201612	660	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	I mean, you do observe that the long rate has gone up a lot.	12.0	90.0
201612	661	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	So how do you explain the way people actually came up with their assumption about no fiscal policy change using actual rates?	12.0	90.0
201612	662	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	And you have essentially a 25 basis point increase in the path, which is, as I understand it, similarly to the effect of this fiscal policy package on r*, and a larger, I guess 40 basis point, move in the 10-year Treasury rate.	12.0	65.0
201612	663	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Part of this occurs by term premiums and part by moves in the funds rate.	12.0	65.0
201612	664	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	I think that’s consistent with the projections that you see here.	12.0	65.0
201612	665	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Now, there’s a larger market reaction, but there is a lot of uncertainty and we don’t know what assumptions have gone into that—maybe a larger fiscal package than the staff have penciled in here.	12.0	65.0
201612	666	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	President Rosengren, I’m not sure that enough information in the SEP process was collected to answer your question because the 10-year Treasury rate is not specified.	12.0	999.0
201612	667	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	So, in principal, we don’t know how participants handled that.	12.0	999.0
201612	668	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Also, we didn’t really know why the 10-year Treasury rate was so low.	12.0	999.0
201612	669	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari, then President Bullard.	12.0	65.0
201612	670	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Just one quick response—and then I have a question—which is, I didn’t necessarily assume that the market moves are going to be substantial.	12.0	111.0
201612	671	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	And when we get more information, the markets may just reverse themselves.	12.0	111.0
201612	672	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	So that wasn’t a factor in my SEP submission.	12.0	111.0
201612	673	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	And I put in no fiscal policy change.	12.0	111.0
201612	674	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Onto my question to the staff:  In the alternative scenarios, I was surprised that the banking crisis in Europe was the most negative of all the scenarios.	12.0	111.0
201612	675	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	The scenario that I worry about is one in which multiple banks get into trouble at the same time or a bank were to fail.	12.0	111.0
201612	676	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	But the scenario you picked was one bank doesn’t fail and goes to resolution.	12.0	111.0
201612	677	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	And that alone was enough to trigger a negative scenario for the United States.	12.0	111.0
201612	678	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I wonder if you could expand on that, and explain that mechanism.	12.0	111.0
201612	679	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	And then, how worried are you about this, in light of what we’re seeing in Italy and potentially what we’re seeing in Germany?	12.0	111.0
201612	680	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Brian?	12.0	999.0
201612	681	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Unless you’d rather I respond.	12.0	999.0
201612	682	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	No, if you want to go ahead, please.	12.0	999.0
201612	683	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	[Laughter]	12.0	999.0
201612	684	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	I’ll take this one.	12.0	999.0
201612	685	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	First of all, just comparing the two international alternative scenarios, the banking crisis one was, I think, marginally more consequential for US variables than the emerging market turmoil one, but not by a great deal.	12.0	999.0
201612	686	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	And, as with most simulations, that reflected in some sense what we put into the simulation, and the inputs included some downward pressure on US confidence and spending and upward pressure on spreads, as the reverberations arising from the banking crisis in Europe spread out through the global economy.	12.0	999.0
201612	687	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	We assume that those will be greater in the case of this advanced-economy banking crisis than would be the case in the event of an emerging-market heightened-financial-stress situation.	12.0	999.0
201612	688	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Now, going to the issue of comparing the effect of one bank having a messy resolution with, let’s say, some genuine bankruptcies of some smaller banks, our view was that the scenario in question was one in which if a very large, very systemically important, one of the most systemically important banks in the world located in the northern part of Europe was forced into resolution, and potentially if that resolution was handled in a somewhat messy way, leaving a lot of uncertainty and leading to a sort of reverse-moral-hazard play in which some investors were surprised that they were not bailed out fully, then that situation, due to the highly interconnected nature of the bank, its many counterparties, and its prominence in the global financial system would lead to a lot more contagion and reverberations than, for example, the other very prominent banking situation right now in Europe, which is about Italian banks.	12.0	999.0
201612	689	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Now, you can tell a story in which a resolution in bankruptcy of Monte dei Paschi— which is the current Italian bank that’s the most exposed to problems—with subordinated debt holders being bailed in and with it also being handled poorly so you get queues of people waiting to get their money out, which is seen on nightly television all around Europe, also leads to banking distress.	12.0	999.0
201612	690	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	But the fact is, right now the resolution of that bank and maybe some other smaller Italian banks is a pretty well-anticipated development.	12.0	999.0
201612	691	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Our sense is that even if that bank gets resolved, which seems to be the most likely situation at present, it would take place without the shock to financial markets and the reverberation through a network of counterparties that would be the case in a messy resolution of a much larger and more systemically important bank.	12.0	999.0
201612	692	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	12.0	65.0
201612	693	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	94.0
201612	694	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I have several questions.	12.0	94.0
201612	695	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	First of all, on the net effect of fiscal policy, panel 6 on exhibit 2 shows a net boost to real GDP of 45 basis points.	12.0	94.0
201612	696	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And my question is, is that the total over the three-year period?	12.0	94.0
201612	697	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The cumulative effect.	12.0	999.0
201612	698	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And I presume this is not statistically significantly different from zero?	12.0	94.0
201612	699	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Given our staff forecast errors, you mean?	12.0	999.0
201612	700	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Yes.	12.0	94.0
201612	701	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201612	702	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	That’s right.	12.0	999.0
201612	703	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	It’s estimated to be a small positive effect, but sort of statistically speaking, you can’t say too much.	12.0	94.0
201612	704	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12.0	94.0
201612	705	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Not to mention model uncertainty, which would be gigantic.	12.0	94.0
201612	706	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	I think that’s correct.	12.0	999.0
201612	707	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	I mean, it has to be correct.	12.0	999.0
201612	708	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	On the other hand, if we were to apply the standard that we would only build in effects that were deemed to be statistically significant, we’d have remarkably little to say.	12.0	999.0
201612	709	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I totally understand.	12.0	94.0
201612	710	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I just want to put in perspective what we can say about future fiscal policy in a realistic sense, in view of model uncertainty and statistical uncertainty, and I think the answer is “not much, but we do the best we can.”	12.0	94.0
201612	711	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	On “Understanding Movements in the Dollar,” exhibit 6, if I’m reading the graph on the real dollar—panel 2—correctly, we’re now assuming a bigger appreciation of the dollar.	12.0	94.0
201612	712	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	We’ve talked about this before, and I’ve questioned this before.	12.0	94.0
201612	713	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	We’re saying that the dollar is going to appreciate because we’re going to surprise the world with more aggressive monetary policy than it currently expects.	12.0	94.0
201612	714	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And yet when I look at panel 4—“Implied Federal Funds Rate Path”—in Mr Potter’s exhibit 1, I see that the market now expects a much higher federal funds rate path— in fact, much closer to the Committee median—than before.	12.0	94.0
201612	715	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So it seems like if anything, on the basis of that, we should be expecting less appreciation of the dollar, not more.	12.0	94.0
201612	716	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	In panel 2, if you look at those black solid and black dashed lines of the current and previous forecasts of the broad dollar, most of the difference is the jumping off point—that is, the higher dollar that we’ve already seen.	12.0	999.0
201612	717	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	And I realize that it’s almost imperceptible, but if you look at those two lines you’ll actually see that the solid line—the forecasted line—is actually slightly flatter because market expectations and the staff’s implied path of the policy rate have come closer together.	12.0	999.0
201612	718	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	There’s less surprise built in, so this has flattened out the path a little bit.	12.0	999.0
201612	719	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	But there’s still some surprise.	12.0	999.0
201612	720	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	And that gets you an upward tilt.	12.0	999.0
201612	721	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Yes.	12.0	94.0
201612	722	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Look at the implied federal funds rate path.	12.0	94.0
201612	723	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	According to this picture, almost nothing in 2017, very little by the end of 2018—almost all of it is out in 2019.	12.0	94.0
201612	724	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	In Simon’s presentation, what he’s comparing is the market-implied path and the SEP path for September.	12.0	999.0
201612	725	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	It’s changed a little bit.	12.0	94.0
201612	726	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	That’s right.	12.0	999.0
201612	727	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	And what I was referring to was the staff’s assumption regarding policy.	12.0	999.0
201612	728	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	And I believe there was a Taylor-rule panel that I feel like I passed through at some point in time.	12.0	999.0
201612	729	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Is it that one right there, Don?	12.0	999.0
201612	730	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So it’s the appreciation of the dollar because the Committee is going to follow the Taylor (1999) rule—as opposed to the SEP path, which tells you what the Committee participants actually think they’re going to do.	12.0	94.0
201612	731	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	That’s what’s implied in the staff projection.	12.0	999.0
201612	732	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Isn’t this a little bit off in comparison with what we should be doing?	12.0	94.0
201612	733	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I mean, you’re projecting increases in the dollar that are affecting the whole milieu of how we’re going to look at the future evolution of the international economy and the US economy.	12.0	94.0
201612	734	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And it’s all based on what you think the Committee is going to do versus what the Taylor rule says the Committee should do.	12.0	94.0
201612	735	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Well, arguably.	12.0	999.0
201612	736	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	I mean, let’s put it this way—our job is to present an internally coherent forecast to you.	12.0	999.0
201612	737	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	And it’s one in which, basically, market expectations interact with monetary policy.	12.0	999.0
201612	738	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	If we think that markets are going to respond to a monetary policy path that they do not anticipate, that should have implications for the dollar.	12.0	999.0
201612	739	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Those changes in the dollar should feed back to the real economy and, in turn, to monetary policy.	12.0	999.0
201612	740	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	It sounds very circular, and that’s because it is.	12.0	999.0
201612	741	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	No, I understand.	12.0	94.0
201612	742	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	And that’s why, basically, we need to produce a forecast that takes into account all of the different reactions of the variables to everything else, and what we deliver is what happens after the market has settled down and we’ve converged in our projection to a consistent set of projections.	12.0	999.0
201612	743	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I guess another way to do it would be to take a market-based forecast of the dollar.	12.0	94.0
201612	744	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	We could do that.	12.0	999.0
201612	745	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	I think that’s the IMF strategy, in terms of some of its projections.	12.0	999.0
201612	746	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	We can do that.	12.0	999.0
201612	747	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	That would mean that as we think about monetary policies as we go forward and consider changes in those monetary policies and their effect on the economy, then, by assuming a market path for the dollar, which is invariant to our monetary policy, we’re basically shutting down a transmission channel of monetary policy.	12.0	999.0
201612	748	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	And that should lead, I think, to a less reliable forecast of the economy, or at least one in which you would have to think more about, “This is what the path of the economy will be if the dollar is fixed according to the market path.	12.0	999.0
201612	749	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	What will it be if we think the dollar responds to monetary policy?”	12.0	999.0
201612	750	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	In some sense, it would make your job more complicated in interpreting our forecast.	12.0	999.0
201612	751	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I guess what I’d like to stress to the Committee is that, when we look at these dollar exchange-rate forecasts, they are forecasts made on the basis of the Committee actually following a Taylor (1999) rule.	12.0	94.0
201612	752	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	An inertial Taylor (1999) rule.	12.0	999.0
201612	753	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I have one more question on the “Understanding Movements in the Dollar” exhibit, panel 3, “Dollar Response to Monetary Policy Surprises.”	12.0	94.0
201612	754	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Is the staff rule of thumb a fitted regression line or is that just a line?	12.0	94.0
201612	755	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	That particular line is just a line.	12.0	999.0
201612	756	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	We have shown the Committee, I think in the chart show in June, what the fitted line has been historically and what it’s been more recently.	12.0	999.0
201612	757	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Since 2010, that line is steeper line.	12.0	999.0
201612	758	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	If you go back historically, the line is shallower.	12.0	999.0
201612	759	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	There’s a lot of uncertainty depending on the time period you choose to look at.	12.0	999.0
201612	760	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	And what we’ve done, I think, over the past year is move that rule of thumb up away from the longer historical period toward a more recent experience.	12.0	999.0
201612	761	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	But the rule of thumb is informed by regressions that we run of exchange rates on changes in interest rates during, before, and after FOMC events.	12.0	999.0
201612	762	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	It’s informed, but it’s not really based on these data.	12.0	94.0
201612	763	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	It actually is based on these data, because these are all the FOMC dates since 2010.	12.0	999.0
201612	764	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	That’s right.	12.0	999.0
201612	765	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	And that, in fact, comprises our sample.	12.0	999.0
201612	766	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So it is a fitted line.	12.0	94.0
201612	767	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201612	768	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Brian?	12.0	999.0
201612	769	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	No.	12.0	999.0
201612	770	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Using this period, a fitted line would actually be steeper.	12.0	999.0
201612	771	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12.0	94.0
201612	772	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So if it was a fitted regression line, then there would be some confidence bounds surrounding it.	12.0	94.0
201612	773	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	It looks to me like the red dot is actually within those bounds.	12.0	94.0
201612	774	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	The red dot is certainly within the confidence bounds.	12.0	999.0
201612	775	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	I mean, the confidence bounds would actually be outside of the presentation.	12.0	999.0
201612	776	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	You’ve spent a lot of time in the presentation saying, “Well, this was outsized, looked outsized” or something, but it’s not really.	12.0	94.0
201612	777	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	It’s outsized relative to just the point estimate of the rule of thumb.	12.0	999.0
201612	778	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	But it is true, the confidence bounds are huge.	12.0	999.0
201612	779	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Just look at these blue dots here.	12.0	94.0
201612	780	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	You’ve got a lot that are just as big as the red dot.	12.0	94.0
201612	781	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The dollar did move a lot, a few days after the election.	12.0	999.0
201612	782	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	No, I understand the dollar moved a lot after the election, but not really that much outside of other events or other surprises that have happened.	12.0	94.0
201612	783	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	That’s what this would say.	12.0	94.0
201612	784	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	All right.	12.0	999.0
201612	785	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12.0	94.0
201612	786	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	12.0	94.0
201612	787	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12.0	65.0
201612	788	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Any further questions?	12.0	65.0
201612	789	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	12.0	65.0
201612	790	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	12.0	81.0
201612	791	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Just a brief, partial defense of the staff.	12.0	81.0
201612	792	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Watch your wallet.	12.0	102.0
201612	793	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	12.0	102.0
201612	794	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	This is a man-bites-dog story here.	12.0	97.0
201612	795	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	12.0	97.0
201612	796	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	President Bullard was inviting us to compare the net effect of fiscal policy with the staff’s forecast error.	12.0	81.0
201612	797	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	But I think that a part of the staff’s forecast error that’s attributable to shocks that occur in the economy after the forecast is written is irrelevant to the question of the difference between two alternative futures, with and without some assumed intervention.	12.0	81.0
201612	798	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Perhaps some error in that estimation of that difference might be attributable to uncertainty about coefficients, perhaps model uncertainty.	12.0	81.0
201612	799	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	But, surely, the forecast error attributable to shocks that are realized is irrelevant to that.	12.0	81.0
201612	800	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	So I think it’s an open question as to whether this is within error bands or outside of them.	12.0	81.0
201612	801	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	What would you say about model uncertainty, President Lacker?	12.0	94.0
201612	802	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Model uncertainty?	12.0	81.0
201612	803	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Models are uncertain.	12.0	81.0
201612	804	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	12.0	81.0
201612	805	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	That’s a blank check, right?	12.0	81.0
201612	806	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I mean, unless you actually calculate it with a certain set of models.	12.0	81.0
201612	807	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	And I’m not sure they ever show us those things.	12.0	81.0
201612	808	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	My statement was that we can’t tell with very much accuracy what the improvement would be, and I guess I stand by that.	12.0	94.0
201612	809	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12.0	65.0
201612	810	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing no more questions, I suggest we begin our economic go-round, have a few presentations, and then take the coffee break later on.	13.0	65.0
201612	811	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s start with President Rosengren.	13.0	65.0
201612	812	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201612	813	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	There have been substantial changes in financial markets since our previous meeting.	13.0	90.0
201612	814	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	The 10-year Treasury yield has increased more than 60 basis points, the dollar has appreciated, and the stock market has reached new highs.	13.0	90.0
201612	815	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	I must admit, however, that despite all the excitement in financial markets since the presidential election, my economic forecast has responded with more restraint, in part reflecting my skepticism that fiscal and regulatory policies are likely to be as transformative as some of the markets seem to be anticipating.	13.0	90.0
201612	816	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Like the Tealbook, I expect the economy to significantly overshoot full employment.	13.0	90.0
201612	817	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	In my forecast, the unemployment rate declines to 4.2 percent by 2019, well below my estimate of the natural rate of unemployment of 4.7 percent.	13.0	90.0
201612	818	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	This occurs despite my assumption of an increase in the federal funds rate at this meeting and about four more per year over the forecast horizon.	13.0	90.0
201612	819	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	If I took literally the fiscal policy as announced by the incoming Administration, it would call for much more monetary policy tightening.	13.0	90.0
201612	820	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, reflecting my skepticism about the speed of adopting new fiscal policies and the uncertainty regarding the magnitude of fiscal policies that will actually be passed by the Congress, I continue to assume a relatively gradual increase in the federal funds rate.	13.0	90.0
201612	821	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Should my skepticism prove wrong, we will need to tighten more quickly.	13.0	90.0
201612	822	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because of the overshooting of full employment in my forecast, I was quite interested in the staff memos discussing earlier periods of overshooting.	13.0	90.0
201612	823	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	My own conclusion after reading the memos is that significantly overshooting full employment in the United States almost always results in adverse outcomes.	13.0	90.0
201612	824	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because there is uncertainty about the exact value of the natural rate, there is merit in probing how low the natural rate might be.	13.0	90.0
201612	825	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	At the same time, it is important to weigh the potential costs of an unemployment rate that falls well below all of our estimates of what is sustainable in the long run.	13.0	90.0
201612	826	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	The countervailing costs and benefits are the reason it can be useful to probe the lower natural rate of unemployment, but remaining more than ½ percentage point below our best guess of the natural rate for a prolonged period of time would be more like a plunge than a careful probe.	13.0	90.0
201612	827	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	My forecast envisions a very gradual decline in the unemployment rate, reaching 4½ percent by the end of 2017.	13.0	90.0
201612	828	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, with the unemployment rate for November already at 4.6 percent, there is considerable risk that we will overshoot full employment by even more than I forecast by the end of next year.	13.0	90.0
201612	829	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	If it becomes clearer during the course of the year that this is occurring, I would expect monetary policy to need to tighten more quickly.	13.0	90.0
201612	830	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is worth noting that there is increasing evidence of tight labor markets.	13.0	90.0
201612	831	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	The share of the unemployed who have been unemployed for less than 27 weeks is now near historical lows.	13.0	90.0
201612	832	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	In contrast, the share of unemployed workers who have been unemployed longer than 27 weeks remains fairly elevated.	13.0	90.0
201612	833	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	The general scarcity of workers should encourage employers to hire those who have experienced long-duration unemployment.	13.0	90.0
201612	834	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	In support of that notion, we have seen some increase in the probability of reemployment for long-duration workers, although such hires likely come with additional training costs.	13.0	90.0
201612	835	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	In view of the general tightening of labor markets, employers are likely to bid more aggressively for those workers with the appropriate skill set.	13.0	90.0
201612	836	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Indeed, there is already evidence— for example, the wage increases apparent in the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker—that labor costs are starting to rise.	13.0	90.0
201612	837	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Anecdotally, employers in our region increasingly complain about a shortage of workers.	13.0	90.0
201612	838	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	This is certainly consistent with the low unemployment rates in many parts of New England, with the unemployment rate in Massachusetts now at 3.3 percent and in New Hampshire now at 2.8 percent.	13.0	90.0
201612	839	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	These employers increasingly mention a shortage of workers limiting growth opportunities for their firms.	13.0	90.0
201612	840	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Consistent with the perception of tightening labor markets and the data in the Wage Growth Tracker, these firms are increasingly talking about offering higher wages and increasing their budgets for workforce development.	13.0	90.0
201612	841	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	In sum, my forecast involves an assumption of the same withdrawal of stimulus as the Tealbook.	13.0	90.0
201612	842	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	The recent increase in longer-term rates and the dollar appreciation are already doing some of our work for us.	13.0	90.0
201612	843	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Even so, there is a significant risk that fiscal policy will be even more expansionary than I have assumed.	13.0	90.0
201612	844	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	As a consequence, I see the risks associated with my GDP forecast as weighted to the upside and the unemployment rate weighted to the downside.	13.0	90.0
201612	845	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Although there is a great deal of uncertainty concerning fiscal policy, even with an unaltered post-election fiscal policy assumption, my forecast has the unemployment rate falling well below its full-employment rate and inflation somewhat overshooting our inflation target by the end of the forecast, albeit with a very different outlook for longer-term rates and the dollar.	13.0	90.0
201612	846	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201612	847	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201612	848	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13.0	65.0
201612	849	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	102.0
201612	850	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	The economy is on a solid trajectory, the labor market is strong, and the recent employment report suggests that we have achieved or even overshot our full-employment mandate.	13.0	102.0
201612	851	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	And we continue to make progress toward our inflation objective.	13.0	102.0
201612	852	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, a key development during the intermeeting period was the election and the prospect of increased fiscal stimulus in coming years.	13.0	102.0
201612	853	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Financial markets and many of my contacts expect big changes in taxes, spending, and regulation, but they also stress the enormous uncertainty about the size, scope, and timing of what will eventually be passed.	13.0	102.0
201612	854	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, this can be seen in measures of policy uncertainty, like the Baker, Bloom, and Davis index, which rose notably after the election.	13.0	102.0
201612	855	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	My contacts are divided between those excited by the prospect of lower taxes and less regulation and those concerned about the possibility of large cutbacks in spending on health care and social services, higher tariffs, and labor shortages due to restrictions on immigration.	13.0	102.0
201612	856	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	On balance, our conversations with business contacts in my District portray a cautious optimism.	13.0	102.0
201612	857	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	In their view, the key uncertainty today is how much new policies will help businesses over the near term.	13.0	102.0
201612	858	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Will it be a modest bump or a large boost?	13.0	102.0
201612	859	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	One summarized this as “positive uncertainty.”	13.0	102.0
201612	860	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	But not all of my contacts were so giddy.	13.0	102.0
201612	861	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	There are identifiable losers in discussions about policy changes.	13.0	102.0
201612	862	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	For example, we have a contact from the health-care sector who complained that having finally paid the substantial costs of implementing and adjusting to the Affordable Care Act, he now has to pay the substantial cost of adjusting away from it.	13.0	102.0
201612	863	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the head of a large medical system reported that they have already reduced capital spending and hiring.	13.0	102.0
201612	864	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	As he put it, “While we’re not yet in a formal hiring freeze, it would be accurate to describe our current stance as a hiring chill.”	13.0	102.0
201612	865	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Representatives of charitable institutions worry that demand for their services will increase even as tax cuts reduce incentives for charitable giving.	13.0	102.0
201612	866	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	At this point, I still view the risks to my projection as balanced but not unusually large relative to the past 20 years.	13.0	102.0
201612	867	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	In part, my views reflect the fact that I penciled in fiscal stimulus of similar magnitude to the Tealbook, although a bit more backloaded, reflecting the fact that I anticipate a mix of tax cuts and other changes that may take longer to agree on and then to implement.	13.0	102.0
201612	868	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	If anything, the possibility of an even bigger fiscal stimulus tilts the risk to the outlook for output growth and inflation modestly to the upside.	13.0	102.0
201612	869	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of uncertainty, despite the spike in policy uncertainty that I mentioned, readings from financial markets, such as the VIX, hardly point to elevated uncertainty overall.	13.0	102.0
201612	870	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have not changed my assumptions about the longer-run levels of output growth, the natural rate of unemployment, or r*.	13.0	102.0
201612	871	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	In contrast to the Tealbook, I view it as premature to speculate about the potential effects of changes in federal policies on the longer-run level of r* at this time.	13.0	102.0
201612	872	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	On this issue, I think it’s not enough just to talk about the change in the deficit—the details matter.	13.0	102.0
201612	873	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Until we have greater clarity on what policies actually get enacted into law, I’ll maintain my current r* assumption of ¾ percent.	13.0	102.0
201612	874	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	I would add that the level of r* is affected by more than just US policies and US economic developments, and that global forces will continue to put downward pressure on r*.	13.0	102.0
201612	875	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	For example, weighted-average estimates of r* for the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the euro area stand at slightly above zero today.	13.0	102.0
201612	876	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	The one place in which we do have clarity is the labor market.	13.0	102.0
201612	877	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’re already overshooting our goal, and I project even greater overshooting of full employment and some modest overshooting of our inflation target.	13.0	102.0
201612	878	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	To limit the degree of overshooting of our goals and the buildup of risks to the economy, I have penciled in four funds rate increases next year and even more in 2018.	13.0	102.0
201612	879	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Like the Tealbook, my forecast also contains some overshooting of the federal funds rate relative to its longer-run equilibrium level in 2018 and 2019.	13.0	102.0
201612	880	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	I am SEP respondent number 14.	13.0	102.0
201612	881	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Let me conclude with some additional comments about labor markets.	13.0	102.0
201612	882	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Despite an unemployment rate that is at the lowest level since 2007, there remains concern that we have yet to wring out every pocket of labor market slack.	13.0	102.0
201612	883	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	There’s been extensive effort throughout the Federal Reserve System over the past several years to measure the state of the labor market and assess the degree of slack.	13.0	102.0
201612	884	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Recent joint work from my staff and colleagues at the Richmond Federal Reserve add to this body of work.	13.0	102.0
201612	885	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Instead of debating whether to include one group or another as part of the labor force, they let the data do the talking.	13.0	102.0
201612	886	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	They developed an alternative metric of labor market slack that scales all members of the population by the historical relative propensity to find employment.	13.0	102.0
201612	887	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	An interesting insight of this work—and President Lacker has talked about this previously—is that if you look at the job-finding rates of the marginally attached to the labor force—people out of the labor force but who would like to work—their job- finding rates are basically the same as the long-term unemployed.	13.0	102.0
201612	888	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ve had a lot of debates about what’s the right definition of the labor force.	13.0	102.0
201612	889	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I think the right answer to this is there is no right definition of the labor force, because a lot of these groups actually move back and forth between these categories.	13.0	102.0
201612	890	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, what they do is take everybody who’s in the population, and then they don’t make an ex-ante decision about categories—they take everyone in the population and weight them by their chance of landing a job in a given month.	13.0	102.0
201612	891	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	The resulting measure of worker availability provides a theoretically consistent read on the amount of slack in the labor market.	13.0	102.0
201612	892	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, looking at data through October, the nonemployment index that they come up with stands at levels similar to what we saw back in 2005, which I think is a nice benchmark for when the economy was thought to be at full employment.	13.0	102.0
201612	893	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	And this research provides additional evidence that the unemployment rate today is currently providing a reliable signal of labor market slack and that we’ve reached a full-employment economy.	13.0	102.0
201612	894	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13.0	102.0
201612	895	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201612	896	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13.0	65.0
201612	897	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201612	898	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	According to the markets, this is likely to be the second meeting in eight years at which the FOMC changes the federal funds rate.	13.0	108.0
201612	899	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	The market’s logic is clear:  The conditions we have set for raising the federal funds rate have been met; we have, in essence, confirmed that we believe they have been met; and we will therefore go ahead.	13.0	108.0
201612	900	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	In addition, market reactions since the election victory of Mr Trump have been remarkably positive and consistent with our moving at this meeting.	13.0	108.0
201612	901	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	This meeting and this interest rate decision may also mark the end of the post–Great Financial Crisis period in which US monetary policy was most heavily influenced by the memories of the 2008–09 financial crisis, among them the fear of having again to operate in a ELB environment.	13.0	108.0
201612	902	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Will the critics and the historians write that we were justified in moving at this time of enormous uncertainty about what awaits us in the coming year?	13.0	108.0
201612	903	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And will they say that this was the real beginning of the normalization of monetary policy after the second largest financial crisis in the history of the Federal Reserve?	13.0	108.0
201612	904	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Well, there’s a great deal of uncertainty about that, because there’s a great deal of uncertainty about US economic policy in the months and years ahead and, of course, about the shocks that will impinge on the world economy, which includes the economy of the United States.	13.0	108.0
201612	905	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	I want to mention briefly the study that was presented by Stephanie of the implications of the unemployment rate undershooting the natural rate or, equivalently, the benefits and costs of running a high-pressure economy.	13.0	108.0
201612	906	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	It was encouraging to read that soft landings can and do happen.	13.0	108.0
201612	907	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	However, the memo notes that in real time, we really don’t know just how tight the economy is.	13.0	108.0
201612	908	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And we, of course, don’t know what shocks are awaiting us around the next corner.	13.0	108.0
201612	909	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And if you think that’s not right, just think back a month and a half.	13.0	108.0
201612	910	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Another lesson provided by the memo is that we must stay vigilant on inflation.	13.0	108.0
201612	911	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	History shows that the inflation process, which appears pretty benign at present, can change quickly.	13.0	108.0
201612	912	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Thus, monetary policymakers will remain focused on keeping inflation near its target.	13.0	108.0
201612	913	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Turning now to the recent behavior of the financial markets, market participants’ optimism derives in part from the fundamentally sound state of the US economy after a recovery that has so far lasted 19 months, and for which a significant part of the credit is owed to the Federal Reserve—not only for the unconventional monetary policies it has undertaken in the period since 2008, not only for the steadiness with which it has pursued the goals set out in the dual mandate, but also for its vigorous implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act.	13.0	108.0
201612	914	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	But market participants are also, in part, optimistic about equity prices and pessimistic about bond prices, because they believe US nonmonetary economic policies from 2017 on will be more expansionary, and more inflationary, than they had believed a little more than a month ago.	13.0	108.0
201612	915	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Nonetheless, we need to remind ourselves that, at this stage, although we have a general idea of the direction of future US economic policies, there is a great deal of uncertainty about what will be done and when; about the size and direction of fiscal policy changes; about regulatory changes across a broad range of areas, including with regard to financial regulations and labor market policies; about trade policies and the taxation of the foreign earnings of US companies; about NAFTA and other trade agreements; and about events in foreign economies, in China, in the EU, in the process of Brexit, in emerging market and developing economies, in the oil markets, and no doubt in other areas, some of which we can name today, some of which will come as surprises.	13.0	108.0
201612	916	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	We will need to note that future economic growth will depend critically on future rates of productivity growth, about which there’s considerable uncertainty and about which questions similar to those about the effect of a high-pressure economy on unemployment are relevant.	13.0	108.0
201612	917	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	There will likely also be challenges to the current operating procedures of the Federal Reserve and to its independence.	13.0	108.0
201612	918	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	We will be operating, too, in an environment in which many of the assumptions about the role of the United States in global affairs more generally that have held for more than 70 years may need to be adjusted.	13.0	108.0
201612	919	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	There must be more uncertainty about economic developments over the next four to five years in the United States and world economies today than there has been since the beginning of the Great Recession, and that means there is a great deal of uncertainty.	13.0	108.0
201612	920	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	So what can we say to market participants about future monetary policies?	13.0	108.0
201612	921	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And what can we say about future monetary policies to the general public?	13.0	108.0
201612	922	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And what do we say to ourselves?	13.0	108.0
201612	923	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Now, we’ve been talking about the details of what’s going to happen as if we are still in the normal period.	13.0	108.0
201612	924	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	I think that we’re at the beginning of a very different period, and that we’re going to have to think about it.	13.0	108.0
201612	925	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	I think that what we’ve done today, which is essentially to make a fairly simple assumption about what will change—namely, fiscal policy—and not discuss or not include other changes, is about the only way we could proceed, because there is so much uncertainty about the state of the economy over the next few years.	13.0	108.0
201612	926	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	What we’ll have to do is to emphasize to everyone that our actions will continue to be guided by the dual mandate along with a concern for financial stability.	13.0	108.0
201612	927	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	In practice, that most likely means we will not change the interest rate at our end-of-January meeting, for there will be very little reduction in uncertainty by then.	13.0	108.0
201612	928	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	There could be a change in the interest rate in mid- March, but even then we will remain extremely uncertain about future economic developments.	13.0	108.0
201612	929	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	But whatever happens, it is critical that we behave—and be seen to behave—with the goal of achieving our dual mandate and with a calmness that we have shown in the past.	13.0	108.0
201612	930	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	The bottom line is very simple:  We must do our job.	13.0	108.0
201612	931	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Looking back, we have the comfort of knowing that we can rely on one another, on the Chair, and on the excellent staff of the Federal Reserve to do that as best we can.	13.0	108.0
201612	932	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And we also know that our best has been remarkably good.	13.0	108.0
201612	933	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201612	934	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201612	935	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13.0	65.0
201612	936	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201612	937	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Over the past couple of months, labor markets and the path of inflation have continued to progress pretty much as anticipated in many forecasts, including that of the Tealbook, and I found that fact in and of itself to be significant.	13.0	97.0
201612	938	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to inflation, the stabilization of prices in 2016 that was anticipated at the end of last year by many around this table has been realized.	13.0	97.0
201612	939	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	As expected, the effects of the big energy price decreases are tailing off, and unlike a number of occasions over the past several years when one factor holding down inflation faded only to be replaced by another, it does not appear that any new disinflationary impulse is currently in play.	13.0	97.0
201612	940	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I’m a little less sure as to whether the effects of a strengthened dollar will also recede, as there seems to me some risk of further strengthening.	13.0	97.0
201612	941	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	But, even if that happens, I doubt it would be of the magnitude of the earlier episodes.	13.0	97.0
201612	942	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	And, actually, I now see the risks to inflation as slightly to the upside—with the possibility that the production cuts announced by international oil producers will hold, and with some chance that fiscal policy in the next year or two will become significantly more stimulative.	13.0	97.0
201612	943	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to labor markets, I have found that our focus on slack over the past couple of years—slack that was not reflected in the unemployment rate as such—has served us well and has served the country and the economy well.	13.0	97.0
201612	944	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	But, as I said at the previous FOMC meeting, I thought we might be getting within sight of the point at which labor market slack had been largely taken up.	13.0	97.0
201612	945	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Data in the intervening two months have reinforced that view.	13.0	97.0
201612	946	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	As one of our staff economists nicely put it, “Nearly all labor market indicators are either strengthening or are already strong.”	13.0	97.0
201612	947	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Some of the strong numbers obviously include job creation, which, although at a slightly lower level, continues to be substantially above the number needed to create a net increase in employment relative to the labor force.	13.0	97.0
201612	948	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Job openings continue to be high, and layoffs continue to be low.	13.0	97.0
201612	949	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Some numbers, which are already good, are strengthening even further, such as first-time claims.	13.0	97.0
201612	950	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Now, although wages stalled in the November report, this seems to me the classic case of not wanting to read too much into one data point, particularly against the backdrop of several previous months’ indications of some improvement in wages generally.	13.0	97.0
201612	951	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to indicators of slack, the unemployment rate has finally declined, and obviously it declined by a substantial amount.	13.0	97.0
201612	952	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think the magnitude of this decrease is going to hold fully, as the staff projection has suggested, but some of it is very likely persistent, breaking the year-long streak of significant labor market improvement unaccompanied by a decline in the unemployment rate.	13.0	97.0
201612	953	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Other indicators of slack, such as part-time for economic reasons and the share of the long-term unemployed, have continued their gradual improvement.	13.0	97.0
201612	954	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	The decrease in the labor force participation rate in the November report is consistent with, though certainly doesn’t firmly establish, the possibility I mentioned at the previous meeting that the labor force participation rate has returned to our best estimate of its trend and, at least on the basis of past experience, may thus not be expected to increase above that level in anything but a transitory fashion.	13.0	97.0
201612	955	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Of course, we’ve adjusted our estimates of trend over the past several years and may again, so I don’t want to place too much weight on this factor, but it is something concrete suggesting that slack reduction may be nearly complete.	13.0	97.0
201612	956	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to wages, I’ll just note in passing again that I continue to regard the labor market as a surrogate for output constraints rather than relying on a direct Phillips-curve unemployment–inflation relationship, but I still do find wages to be relevant.	13.0	97.0
201612	957	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Here, I do want to note my uneasiness with explanations of wage increases tied too predominantly, in the short to medium term, to productivity limitations.	13.0	97.0
201612	958	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I think that this approach tends to underplay the fact that labor prices, like other prices, are set at the intersection of a demand curve and a supply curve, and although the demand-curve shape is determined in significant part, though not exclusively, by productivity considerations, the supply curve is not.	13.0	97.0
201612	959	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	And I think too much focus on productivity also tends to make the causation one way, whereas my sense is that productivity improvements sometimes come precisely because of upward pressure on wages that motivate firms to invest in productivity-enhancing technologies or production techniques.	13.0	97.0
201612	960	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	So as you can tell, in general, my observation for this FOMC meeting is “the shoe that didn’t drop,” which is to say that things have kind of continued as expected.	13.0	97.0
201612	961	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	And at least with respect to labor markets, as I suggested last time, I think we’re now well within the point at which the elimination of slack is in view.	13.0	97.0
201612	962	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	The second point I was going to make at some length was the uncertainty attending the outlook, but I’m going to truncate my comments substantially because Governor Fischer made most of those points.	13.0	97.0
201612	963	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	If I can do this for purposes of the minutes, I would just second everything Governor Fischer said about the fiscal situation, the fact that there are other policies being discussed, and how there are upside and downside risks.	13.0	97.0
201612	964	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	It was for that reason, incidentally, that I regard fiscal policy as an upside risk of somewhat indeterminate magnitude, but I did not incorporate any assumed changes into my baseline outlook.	13.0	97.0
201612	965	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	And my view is that for purposes of our policymaking, we will have plenty of time over subsequent meetings to incorporate likely effects of a range of policies as they become more concrete.	13.0	97.0
201612	966	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	And, finally, Madam Chair, to add my two cents’ worth to people’s comments on the Aaronson etal memo, I have to say my interpretation of Stephanie Aaronson’s briefing and the related staff memo was that the strongest conclusion was that the most important factor is luck.	13.0	97.0
201612	967	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	That is to say, if you are in a circumstance in which you are trying to either execute a soft landing or deal with inflation, the strong conclusion was that there’s likely to be some sort of shock that you haven’t anticipated.	13.0	97.0
201612	968	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	And then the question is:  Is it a shock taking you in the direction you would want it to take you or is it reinforcing the direction that you’re trying to reverse?	13.0	97.0
201612	969	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t know that that actually provides an enormous amount of policy guidance.	13.0	97.0
201612	970	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201612	971	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201612	972	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13.0	65.0
201612	973	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	107.0
201612	974	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The biggest piece of news in the intermeeting period was the reduction of uncertainty regarding the US elections.	13.0	107.0
201612	975	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	With the same party slated to control both houses of the Congress and the presidency, fiscal policy may become considerably more active.	13.0	107.0
201612	976	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	At this early stage, however, considerable uncertainty remains about the size, composition, and timing of the policies the new President and the Congress will pursue.	13.0	107.0
201612	977	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Although financial conditions have changed since the election in anticipation of these possible policy changes, the intermeeting data on real activity has been little affected by the election.	13.0	107.0
201612	978	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Thus, I’ll first review what the data are telling us about the economy’s current course before turning to the possible implications of fiscal policy changes over the medium term.	13.0	107.0
201612	979	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	I’ve been heartened to see progress toward both of our goals continuing at a sustainable pace.	13.0	107.0
201612	980	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent reports validate the prudent approach we’ve taken over the course of 2016.	13.0	107.0
201612	981	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Against the backdrop of notable risks associated with developments abroad and with the persistent underperformance of inflation, we were well served by not taking this progress for granted ex ante.	13.0	107.0
201612	982	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Since we last met, the labor market has continued to improve.	13.0	107.0
201612	983	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Over the past two months, payroll employment gains have averaged 160,000, sufficient for a continued increase in resource utilization.	13.0	107.0
201612	984	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The unemployment rate fell 0.3 percentage point last month, and it is now 4.6 percent.	13.0	107.0
201612	985	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Although this has led some to conclude that the labor market is now beyond full employment such that future increases in resource utilization will be unsustainable, there are a couple of reasons to think it could be somewhat premature to draw this conclusion.	13.0	107.0
201612	986	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	First, last month’s large decline seems out of step with other gauges of labor market activity, such as payroll gains, job openings, and layoffs, which have remained fairly flat.	13.0	107.0
201612	987	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The unemployment rate had also been quite stable over the past year or so, remaining within a range of 4.9 to 5.1 percent between August 2015 and October 2016.	13.0	107.0
201612	988	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	There was only one drop during that time period, and it turned out to be a short-lived aberration.	13.0	107.0
201612	989	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	We cannot rule out the possibility that November’s drop will be viewed as somewhat outsized in retrospect, so we should wait a few months before drawing firm conclusions.	13.0	107.0
201612	990	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Second, there are signs of remaining slack in the labor market even though the margins are diminishing.	13.0	107.0
201612	991	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Most notably, the prime-age employment-to-population ratio remains 1.4 percentage points below pre-crisis levels, and the number of prime-age Americans who are out of the labor force but want a job today is still elevated—notably elevated—relative to pre- crisis.	13.0	107.0
201612	992	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Related to this, nominal wage growth remains muted.	13.0	107.0
201612	993	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The ECI increased only 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in September, little different from the pace earlier in the recovery, and average hourly earnings increased 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in November.	13.0	107.0
201612	994	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The still low level of price inflation is consistent with this interpretation.	13.0	107.0
201612	995	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Core PCE inflation has exhibited some welcome improvement in recent months.	13.0	107.0
201612	996	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	At 1.7 percent in October, the 12-month change in core prices was 0.4 percentage point above the level a year ago.	13.0	107.0
201612	997	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Even so, inflation has been persistently below our target for eight years, and it remains below our target today.	13.0	107.0
201612	998	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Against this backdrop, I welcome the recent upward movements in measures of inflation compensation.	13.0	107.0
201612	999	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Most notably, the 5-year, 5-year-ahead TIPS measure of inflation compensation has increased 40 basis points since October, and median 5-to-10-year-ahead inflation expectations in the Michigan survey moved up in November from a historically low level.	13.0	107.0
201612	1000	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	But, even with these recent improvements, these gauges of inflation expectations are still noticeably below historical norms, suggesting that we must continue to be attentive to downside risks if we’re to achieve our target, which is symmetric around 2 percent.	13.0	107.0
201612	1001	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The news on aggregate activity has likewise been encouraging.	13.0	107.0
201612	1002	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent indicators suggest GDP will increase at an annual rate of 2½ percent over the second half, a step-up from the 1.1 percent pace in the first half.	13.0	107.0
201612	1003	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Retail sales rebounded in October, auto sales remained strong in November, and real income gains look to be solid this year despite a leveling-off in energy prices—all good signs for consumers.	13.0	107.0
201612	1004	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, recent data on housing starts and permits suggest an upturn in residential investment this quarter, following two quarters of declines.	13.0	107.0
201612	1005	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, although business investment was flat last quarter after falling in the first half of this year, there are some positive signs.	13.0	107.0
201612	1006	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	These include small upturns in new orders for capital goods and corporate profitability, as well as in drilling rigs, which likely reflect both demand- and supply-side developments in oil markets.	13.0	107.0
201612	1007	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	But there are also challenges, most notably the recent rise in the dollar and the foreign outlook.	13.0	107.0
201612	1008	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	After changing little over the middle part of the year, the dollar has increased more than 3 percent since October.	13.0	107.0
201612	1009	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The staff expects the dollar to appreciate further, by a little more than 1 percent per year over the medium term.	13.0	107.0
201612	1010	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	But there’s a risk of a larger appreciation if fiscal deficits expand more materially.	13.0	107.0
201612	1011	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	And, although foreign GDP growth looks likely to move up to an annualized pace of 2½ percent over the second half—a welcome improvement—the pace of foreign growth is still considerably lower than earlier in the recovery.	13.0	107.0
201612	1012	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	There are also important fragilities in the international environment.	13.0	107.0
201612	1013	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	A strengthening dollar and rising rates could pose risks to emerging markets that have experienced substantial dollar-denominated borrowing in recent years.	13.0	107.0
201612	1014	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	For some, this may be somewhat offset by the prospect of stronger commodity prices, but for others, this may exacerbate strains.	13.0	107.0
201612	1015	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Mexico, in particular, bears watching because of the outsized currency moves it has experienced related to the election and the extensive ties to US financial markets and trade that could be perturbed in the months ahead.	13.0	107.0
201612	1016	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	China continues to pose risks, although as was noted earlier, market participants seem quite complacent compared with the first quarter of this year.	13.0	107.0
201612	1017	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Due to stimulus, GDP growth is likely to meet the government’s stated objective this year, but attainment of this goal comes at the expense of a further increase in already very elevated leverage.	13.0	107.0
201612	1018	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	In most economies, the current trajectory of indebtedness would not be sustainable.	13.0	107.0
201612	1019	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	It remains to be seen whether China is, indeed, unique in this regard.	13.0	107.0
201612	1020	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Most immediately, demand for foreign assets by Chinese households and businesses appears to be increasing, despite the Chinese government’s efforts to rein in that demand.	13.0	107.0
201612	1021	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Capital account outflows have picked up after a midyear lull, putting downward pressures on the renminbi, which has fallen about 6 percent against the dollar so far this year.	13.0	107.0
201612	1022	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The Chinese authorities are estimated to have spent nearly $40 billion in foreign exchange reserves last month alone.	13.0	107.0
201612	1023	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	It seems likely that this combination of limited domestic investment opportunities, recent government-induced increases in domestic credit and liquidity, and fears of further depreciation and tightening of exchange controls is driving increased demand for foreign assets, and these pressures could intensify early next year.	13.0	107.0
201612	1024	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The Chinese authorities can continue to tighten controls, but this, in turn, has costs in terms of their desire for more private-sector-led economic growth in order to accomplish gradual deleveraging.	13.0	107.0
201612	1025	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	In Europe, the “no” vote in the December 4 Italian referendum was widely expected, and the reaction was muted.	13.0	107.0
201612	1026	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The ECB retains substantial capacity, as it reaffirmed last week.	13.0	107.0
201612	1027	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	But the need to recapitalize Italian banks remains, and a credible plan has not yet been agreed upon.	13.0	107.0
201612	1028	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonperforming loans are quite high, and economic stagnation would continue to add to the level of problem loans on balance sheets.	13.0	107.0
201612	1029	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Broader stagnation also poses risks to Italian sovereign debt, which is currently about 130 percent of GDP.	13.0	107.0
201612	1030	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Some large European banks outside of Italy have also been challenged by low profitability and relatively low capital ratios and remain vulnerable to a slowing of economic growth.	13.0	107.0
201612	1031	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Returning to the United States, we’re now in the eighth year of the expansion, and as we scan the horizon for any increases in risk taking, I found it interesting that, in recent interviews with market participants, all of them highlighted a low level of leverage among investors despite the environment of very low short-term interest rates.	13.0	107.0
201612	1032	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	This suggests that regulatory changes and a renewed sensitivity to risks since the financial crisis have constrained, at least up to this point, undue leverage in the financial sector and have reduced, at least for now, an important source of risk, but this bears close watching.	13.0	107.0
201612	1033	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Finally, the advent of a unified government suggests an increase in upside risks to aggregate demand in the United States.	13.0	107.0
201612	1034	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Financial market participants and the Board’s staff expect deficits to increase into the future.	13.0	107.0
201612	1035	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s too early to evaluate the size of the effect on the economy, in view of substantial uncertainty about the magnitude, the composition, and the effects on aggregate demand and supply, as well as on term premiums.	13.0	107.0
201612	1036	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Looking at earlier episodes when significant electoral shifts led to greater unity across the legislative and executive branches, we saw very large increases in deficits, on the order of 1½ to 2 percentage points of GDP, that persisted beyond the first term.	13.0	107.0
201612	1037	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Notably, episodes in the early 1980s and 2000s occurred when the economy was further from full employment and there was greater headroom in the national debt.	13.0	107.0
201612	1038	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	A large and persistent expansion of fiscal deficits targeted at high-multiplier segments, such as infrastructure investment or low-income households, could have material effects on GDP growth, as well as on the short- and long-run neutral federal funds rate.	13.0	107.0
201612	1039	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	But for a fiscal expansion to be large and sustainable, it would need to have significant positive effects on aggregate supply.	13.0	107.0
201612	1040	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	For this to be true, there are a number of very important “ifs” that I won’t review here today.	13.0	107.0
201612	1041	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	By contrast, an increase in fiscal deficits that does not raise potential economic growth or extend very far into the long term could raise the neutral rate over the medium term, but not as much in the long term.	13.0	107.0
201612	1042	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	If such an expansion is large enough, the resulting tightening in resource constraints and upward pressure on inflation may lead the short-run neutral rate to rise above the longer-term neutral rate by the end of the medium term, with important implications for monetary policy.	13.0	107.0
201612	1043	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	And, of course, we could see additional strengthening of the exchange rate in anticipation of such changes, as we’ve seen in previous episodes.	13.0	107.0
201612	1044	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	For the moment, it seems prudent to put some probability on a moderate increase in fiscal deficits starting in the second half of the year, and this leads to a relatively modest change to my forecast.	13.0	107.0
201612	1045	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	But the possibility of a more significant expansion has altered the risks to aggregate demand and made them more balanced.	13.0	107.0
201612	1046	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	13.0	107.0
201612	1047	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201612	1048	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest we take a break now, grab some coffee, and come back in 20 minutes, at 10 minutes to 4:00.	13.0	65.0
201612	1050	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s resume.	13.0	65.0
201612	1051	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13.0	65.0
201612	1052	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201612	1053	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	In my remarks today, I’m going to cover pre- and post-election sentiment of District contacts, anecdotal feedback received from contacts on the state of the economy, and my forecast.	13.0	88.0
201612	1054	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	My District’s directors and contacts notably changed their tune on economic prospects from pre-election to post-election.	13.0	88.0
201612	1055	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	The election’s results seem to have produced a pickup in optimism based on expectations of an unwinding of regulation, lower corporate and individual taxes, and fiscal stimulus.	13.0	88.0
201612	1056	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Most contacts confirmed ongoing tightening of labor markets.	13.0	88.0
201612	1057	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Both employers and staffing agencies reported they continue to struggle to fill positions.	13.0	88.0
201612	1058	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard that low-wage workers are increasingly difficult to recruit in certain urban and resort locations because of shortages of affordable housing.	13.0	88.0
201612	1059	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Staffing agency contacts indicated that many employers are willing to take longer to fill positions rather than significantly raise starting wages.	13.0	88.0
201612	1060	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	In order to fill vacancies for low-skilled positions, some firms said they have eased job specs and verification requirements such as drug tests.	13.0	88.0
201612	1061	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard opinion to the effect that firms may still be holding the line on starting wages to preserve their salary structures but are, in effect, incurring the costs of labor shortages by way of reduced worker quality and increased training costs.	13.0	88.0
201612	1062	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	A further point on wage pressures: Anecdotal reports indicated that the overall rate of merit programs remained stable in the 2½ to 3 percent range.	13.0	88.0
201612	1063	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	However, the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker that measures average wage growth of the same individuals accelerated to a pace just under 4 percent in the latest November reading.	13.0	88.0
201612	1064	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	This is close to pre-recession readings.	13.0	88.0
201612	1065	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	The labor market looks about as tight as it was before the recession.	13.0	88.0
201612	1066	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding my forecast and SEP submission, my real GDP growth forecast is little changed from the previous SEP and from the outlook that I put forward during most of this year.	13.0	88.0
201612	1067	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	I had real GDP growing at close to 2 percent per annum over the forecast horizon and for the longer run.	13.0	88.0
201612	1068	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	However, my risk assessment associated with that outlook has shifted to the upside.	13.0	88.0
201612	1069	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	The upside risk I perceive reflects accelerating business fixed investment and does incorporate upside risks resulting from changes in fiscal policy.	13.0	88.0
201612	1070	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Like Governor Tarullo and others, my baseline projection does not incorporate fiscal policy effects.	13.0	88.0
201612	1071	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	My thinking is that it’s too early to tell the size, timing, and characteristics of any fiscal package.	13.0	88.0
201612	1072	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	And those details, obviously, matter a lot.	13.0	88.0
201612	1073	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding business fixed investment, my baseline forecast continues to anticipate solid BFI growth over the forecast horizon.	13.0	88.0
201612	1074	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Previously, I was worried about my BFI assumption being too optimistic and, therefore, treated this business fixed investment baseline assumption as carrying downside risk.	13.0	88.0
201612	1075	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	At the time of earlier forecasts, my assumption regarding BFI growth was not much supported by incoming data and was not getting much support in the form of anecdotal inputs received from business contacts.	13.0	88.0
201612	1076	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	However, in the most recent intermeeting cycle, we heard indications of accelerating capital spending intentions from a number of contacts.	13.0	88.0
201612	1077	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Most contacts cited market demand and revenue growth as the drivers of their revisions to cap-ex plans.	13.0	88.0
201612	1078	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	In that vein, taking into consideration the likelihood that the economy is arguably near full employment, analysis performed by my staff points out that in earlier periods in which the unemployment rate reached or fell below its natural rate, there has been a sizable pickup in the pace of business fixed investment.	13.0	88.0
201612	1079	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	This evidence buoys my confidence in the view that BFI growth will accelerate.	13.0	88.0
201612	1080	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	My baseline forecast also sees headline and core PCE inflation reaching rates consistent with the Committee’s target in 2017 and holding near target thereafter.	13.0	88.0
201612	1081	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Consistent with treating the economic growth effect of fiscal stimulus as an upside risk, I see some upside risk for inflation.	13.0	88.0
201612	1082	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Even though I believe an agnostic view of the economic effect of expected fiscal stimulus is the right position at this time in a baseline forecast, it’s my view that the possibility of fiscal stimulus reduces the need to think about running a high-pressure economy, dependent solely on monetary policy.	13.0	88.0
201612	1083	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	My thought process is that we appear to be very close to meeting our policy objectives, there is not much remaining resource slack, and there is reason to be confident that we will be closing in on our inflation objective relatively soon.	13.0	88.0
201612	1084	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	With a prospect of substantial fiscal stimulus, I am inclined to be somewhat cautious in weighing the degree of monetary accommodation.	13.0	88.0
201612	1085	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	I will add that an upside scenario resulting from new fiscal measures could present communications challenges for the Committee, even in the near term, in my opinion.	13.0	88.0
201612	1086	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	And I’ll expand on this thought in the next round.	13.0	88.0
201612	1087	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201612	1088	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201612	1089	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13.0	65.0
201612	1090	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	103.0
201612	1091	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Economic conditions in much of the 10th District remain a bit soft as employment growth lags the nation as a whole.	13.0	103.0
201612	1092	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	The outlook for the agricultural sector continues to be negative despite the boost in demand from abroad for soybeans, which made an outsized contribution to third-quarter GDP.	13.0	103.0
201612	1093	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Some of the headwinds in other sectors of the regional economy, however, look to be dissipating.	13.0	103.0
201612	1094	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Our manufacturing- and service-sector surveys both show signs of improvement, and District energy firms appear to have adjusted to lower oil prices.	13.0	103.0
201612	1095	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	One report pointed to familiar telltale signs of boom times in the Denver real estate market.	13.0	103.0
201612	1096	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	The online Denver Business Journal has resumed a feature called “Crane Watch,” watching the number of cranes across the sky.	13.0	103.0
201612	1097	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	In general, our directors and other labor and business contacts noted more optimism as they anticipate and assess the effects of potential fiscal policy changes.	13.0	103.0
201612	1098	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	A notable exception was health care and nonprofits, for which our contacts expressed heightened uncertainty and concern about such changes.	13.0	103.0
201612	1099	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Unlike the Tealbook, I did not incorporate assumptions about potential fiscal policy changes into my SEP, on account of the considerable uncertainty about the nature and timing of any such changes.	13.0	103.0
201612	1100	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	As a result, my outlook for the national economy is little changed and I continue to assume GDP growth near 2 percent over the next few years.	13.0	103.0
201612	1101	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Of course, the prospects of tax cuts and more fiscal spending seem likely to pose upside risks to my GDP growth and inflation forecasts over the next few years.	13.0	103.0
201612	1102	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	I expect further improvement in the labor market to support household spending and economic activity.	13.0	103.0
201612	1103	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	The Kansas City Federal Reserve’s labor market conditions index shows that both the level of activity and the momentum in the labor market increased last month.	13.0	103.0
201612	1104	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Consumer confidence remains high and has continued to increase over the past few weeks.	13.0	103.0
201612	1105	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, the personal saving rate remains high by historical standards, even as housing and equity market wealth post near-record highs.	13.0	103.0
201612	1106	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Like others, I appreciated the Board staff memos on overshooting full employment and the various approaches they examined for determining economic slack.	13.0	103.0
201612	1107	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	And I would offer just a couple of observations from their analysis.	13.0	103.0
201612	1108	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	First, in assessing labor market slack, I’d be interested if geography is an important aspect for this discussion.	13.0	103.0
201612	1109	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	For example, as I looked at states in my own District, the unemployment rate in New Mexico has never really recovered since the crisis—it’s lower, but only modestly, and still well above pre-crisis levels.	13.0	103.0
201612	1110	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	For this particular geography, I see the issues as structural and complex.	13.0	103.0
201612	1111	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	For a state like Oklahoma, the unemployment rate increased a full percentage point over the past year.	13.0	103.0
201612	1112	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	The issue here reflects a sectoral shock—namely, to energy—which has resulted in some reallocation in labor and capital.	13.0	103.0
201612	1113	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	I see this shock as largely cyclical and unlikely to generate longer-term structural issues.	13.0	103.0
201612	1114	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, Colorado’s unemployment rate remains near historically low levels and likely below its state-specific natural rate of unemployment.	13.0	103.0
201612	1115	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	These three examples highlight the difficulty of gauging overall slack, as each local labor market faces a different set of issues.	13.0	103.0
201612	1116	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	A second observation on these memos goes back to a question from our previous meeting about historical experience in undershooting the natural rate of employment.	13.0	103.0
201612	1117	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Here, I found the staff’s broad conclusions of the memos did not necessarily diminish my own concerns about this strategy.	13.0	103.0
201612	1118	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Namely, it poses risks, it has uncertain benefits, and, even as policy is calibrated to achieve a soft landing, it requires, as Governor Tarullo and the staff noted, a bit of luck.	13.0	103.0
201612	1119	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Regarding inflation, I continue to view current rates of inflation as consistent with our mandate for price stability and with PCE inflation continuing to make progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective.	13.0	103.0
201612	1120	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	103.0
201612	1121	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201612	1122	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13.0	65.0
201612	1123	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201612	1124	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The economy has made further progress toward our objectives since the November meeting.	13.0	104.0
201612	1125	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Core inflation has ticked up; the headline unemployment rate has declined; and GDP growth has picked up since midyear, which should support continued further tightening in labor markets and progress toward 2 percent inflation.	13.0	104.0
201612	1126	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The November jobs report confirms that the labor market continues to tighten, albeit at a slower pace than over the past few years.	13.0	104.0
201612	1127	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Over the past 12 months, the unemployment rate has now declined 0.4 percentage point compared with an average annual rate of 0.9 percentage points over the preceding four years, which reflects both a welcome outperformance of labor force participation relative to trend as well as a slower pace of job creation.	13.0	104.0
201612	1128	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	We are seeing rising real wages and improving job prospects.	13.0	104.0
201612	1129	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Surveys indicate that households are finally seeing jobs as plentiful, and firms are finding it harder to fill positions—results that have typically been seen at or above full employment.	13.0	104.0
201612	1130	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The unemployment rate at 4.6 percent is now a bit below most estimates of the natural rate and seems to be on a path to reach the low 4s.	13.0	104.0
201612	1131	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	There is some evidence now of emerging supply-side constraints, particularly in surveys of jobs hard to get and hard to fill.	13.0	104.0
201612	1132	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	On the other hand, wages and compensation more broadly have yet to show more than a gradual halting increase.	13.0	104.0
201612	1133	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The interesting and excellent staff memo on undershooting the natural rate finds limited evidence on the question of whether such an undershooting should be expected to have highly persistent or even permanent positive supply-side effects.	13.0	104.0
201612	1134	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The evidence is limited for one reason:  Because undershoots are rare.	13.0	104.0
201612	1135	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The record, however, is clear that prolonged high unemployment can have adverse supply-side effects as workers lose skills and attachment to the labor force.	13.0	104.0
201612	1136	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	From 2009 through 2013, labor force participation suffered a deep cyclical decline.	13.0	104.0
201612	1137	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The exact levels of the natural rate and the trend participation rate are always uncertain.	13.0	104.0
201612	1138	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	That uncertainty is even higher than usual, in view of the unique characteristics of this cycle.	13.0	104.0
201612	1139	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	So, as long as inflation is below target, economic growth is barely above trend, and wage increases are moderate, we have time and space to allow the unemployment rate to decline a bit further without too much risk of getting “behind the curve.”	13.0	104.0
201612	1140	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	I assume that this will be happening in a context of a rising policy rate and gradually tightening financial conditions.	13.0	104.0
201612	1141	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	There will be time to react if we see upside surprises in economic growth or inflation.	13.0	104.0
201612	1142	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	A modest undershoot will also help ensure that inflation does move up to our 2 percent target.	13.0	104.0
201612	1143	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The section of the undershooting memo addressing the Phillips curve was quite interesting in this regard.	13.0	104.0
201612	1144	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	It does not seem likely to me that the inflation dynamics of the 1970s—with high persistence and a steep Phillips curve—are likely to reemerge unless the Committee manages to convince the public that we are okay with inflation moving well above target and staying there.	13.0	104.0
201612	1145	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	But we have reached the point at which inflation risks are balanced, and I am open to the idea that a sustained period of time well below the natural rate could risk undesirably high inflation.	13.0	104.0
201612	1146	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	That will be a risk to watch.	13.0	104.0
201612	1147	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The recent increase in market-based measures of inflation compensation is a welcome development.	13.0	104.0
201612	1148	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Expectations remain below our target of 2 percent after accounting for the wedge between CPI and PCE inflation.	13.0	104.0
201612	1149	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	In addition, these readings are still below where they were in early 2014 or during a pre-crisis period when inflation was close to our target.	13.0	104.0
201612	1150	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	All told, the move up in inflation compensation supports confidence that inflation expectations are well anchored.	13.0	104.0
201612	1151	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	As hoped, economic growth has picked up during the second half of the year.	13.0	104.0
201612	1152	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	With solid increases in PDFP, real GDP is poised to expand at a moderate pace.	13.0	104.0
201612	1153	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Consumption accounts for the lion’s share of the domestic demand growth and will likely post moderate gains, thanks to solid increases in income.	13.0	104.0
201612	1154	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The pace of business investment remains a concern, as nonresidential investment has not increased, on net, in two years, and that weak performance is undoubtedly contributing to the poor productivity outcomes.	13.0	104.0
201612	1155	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Fiscal policy seems set to take a more accommodative turn, and I find the staff’s deployment of a hypothetical tax cut amounting to 1 percent of GDP to be a reasonable placeholder.	13.0	104.0
201612	1156	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	A fiscal policy initiative of that nature would, at a minimum, provide a near-term insurance policy against downside risks, including weak economic growth, low inflation, and global risk events.	13.0	104.0
201612	1157	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	I did assume such a tax cut in my baseline, but I didn’t take it into real outcomes.	13.0	104.0
201612	1158	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	I just took it as an insurance policy or a reason for greater confidence in the baseline.	13.0	104.0
201612	1159	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	In sum, we are essentially at full employment.	13.0	104.0
201612	1160	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The economy is expanding moderately and there is poised to be a more expansionary fiscal stance, which is likely to put upward pressure on output growth, employment, and inflation while also reducing downside risks.	13.0	104.0
201612	1161	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	A somewhat tighter monetary policy is likely to be needed.	13.0	104.0
201612	1162	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201612	1163	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201612	1164	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13.0	65.0
201612	1165	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201612	1166	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	The past six weeks have been remarkable.	13.0	91.0
201612	1167	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	As one of my contacts said, many uncertainties have receded, but others have gone up.	13.0	91.0
201612	1168	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	It’s still early days regarding the plans of the new Administration and the Congress.	13.0	91.0
201612	1169	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	But it does seem pretty clear that more fiscal stimulus is headed our way as well as other major government policy changes.	13.0	91.0
201612	1170	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	At the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, we incorporated a modest fiscal boost into our economic projections, which I will describe in a bit.	13.0	91.0
201612	1171	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	With respect to non-election-related developments, the reports provided by my directors and other business contacts on the current economic landscape were a bit more positive than was the case in the previous round.	13.0	91.0
201612	1172	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Fundamentals for economic growth continue to be solid, with a strong labor market providing a key source of support.	13.0	91.0
201612	1173	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Manufacturers in the aerospace and defense sectors have seen further improvements, while heavy equipment producers and the steel industry still face challenges.	13.0	91.0
201612	1174	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Automotive sales continue to be robust.	13.0	91.0
201612	1175	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Sales, however, are being supported by strong incentives, and the industry currently anticipates that it will need to continue aggressive pricing to maintain this year’s sales pace in 2017.	13.0	91.0
201612	1176	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	I continue to hear businesses repeat their long-running refrain:  Many types of skilled workers remain in short supply at going market rates.	13.0	91.0
201612	1177	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	This reminds me—a production of Hamilton is playing in Chicago, and I’ve noticed, first hand, that orchestra-level tickets are in short supply at list prices.	13.0	91.0
201612	1178	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	But I can get tickets on StubHub if I’m willing to pay more.	13.0	91.0
201612	1179	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	In any case, nominal wage growth remains relatively subdued, suggesting that labor markets are not all that tight yet.	13.0	91.0
201612	1180	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Looking ahead, a number of my directors and contacts were optimistic about some of the President-elect’s economic proposals.	13.0	91.0
201612	1181	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	For instance, steelmakers and heavy equipment manufacturers are looking forward to more infrastructure spending, and, unsurprisingly, our contacts in the financial sector are almost ringing bells and caroling as they recite their Christmas wish lists for reduced regulatory oversight.	13.0	91.0
201612	1182	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	13.0	91.0
201612	1183	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	On the other hand, one of my directors runs a large health-care delivery system.	13.0	91.0
201612	1184	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	He’s struggling to figure out how major changes to the Affordable Care Act and other new regulatory policies might affect his hospital system and the provision of health care more broadly.	13.0	91.0
201612	1185	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Furthermore, the optimism surrounding pro-business proposals and fiscal stimulus was tempered by some of my contacts’ concerns regarding the potential adverse effects of trade and immigration proposals.	13.0	91.0
201612	1186	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Regarding the national outlook, recent nonfinancial data have come in about as expected.	13.0	91.0
201612	1187	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	In our opinion, the recent increase in 10-year Treasury rates and the further strengthening of the dollar require some additional economic conditioning assumptions.	13.0	91.0
201612	1188	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Accordingly, in our forecast, we assume a modest fiscal expansion that increases the primary deficit a little more than 1 percentage point of GDP.	13.0	91.0
201612	1189	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	This is a similar assumption to that in the Tealbook.	13.0	91.0
201612	1190	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	To be clear, we also did not make any changes to our path of potential output.	13.0	91.0
201612	1191	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	By the way, we’re number eight in the SEP submissions.	13.0	91.0
201612	1192	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	The direct impulse of our fiscal assumption on consumption and government purchases would boost the level of GDP about ½ percentage point by the end of 2018.	13.0	91.0
201612	1193	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	We, like the Tealbook, interpret much of the recent increase in term premiums and the dollar as arising from these expected policy changes.	13.0	91.0
201612	1194	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	These restraining influences limit the direct policy effect, so the net effect on GDP is only 0.3 percentage point by the end of 2018.	13.0	91.0
201612	1195	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	All told, this is a relatively modest revision to our outlook, considering the substantial financial market reactions to date.	13.0	91.0
201612	1196	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Putting it all together, we continue to expect that real GDP growth will run moderately above its potential rate over the course of the projection period.	13.0	91.0
201612	1197	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	As a result, we expect further tightening in labor markets, with the unemployment rate falling from our projected average of 4.8 percent in the fourth quarter of this year to 4.3 percent by the end of 2019.	13.0	91.0
201612	1198	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	This is about ¼ percentage point below the 4½ percent natural rate that we expect to prevail in 2020.	13.0	91.0
201612	1199	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Our expectation of increased fiscal stimulus makes me, like many around the room, a bit more optimistic on inflation than in our previous SEP submission.	13.0	91.0
201612	1200	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Financial market developments have included a welcome increase in TIPS inflation compensation—I believe Governor Powell used exactly the same phrasing, “welcome increase”—as well as more balanced inflation tail risks, as measured by swaps pricing.	13.0	91.0
201612	1201	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	We also have seen better incoming data on actual inflation.	13.0	91.0
201612	1202	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	As a result, I raised my core PCE inflation forecast slightly, by 0.1 percentage point in each of the next three years.	13.0	91.0
201612	1203	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	I now expect we will reach 2 percent by the end of 2019.	13.0	91.0
201612	1204	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	This is the first time in years that my forecast reaches our inflation target within the projection period.	13.0	91.0
201612	1205	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Despite these upward revisions, I still see downside risks to my inflation forecast, stemming primarily from a strong dollar, but, overall, the downside inflation risks are smaller than they were in September.	13.0	91.0
201612	1206	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	My projections are premised on my assumed path of monetary policy.	13.0	91.0
201612	1207	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	That’s the statement that makes comments about monetary policy appropriate, according to Hoyle.	13.0	91.0
201612	1208	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	13.0	91.0
201612	1209	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	My path regarding appropriate policy has the funds rate increasing 25 basis points this year, twice more in 2017, and four times in 2018.	13.0	91.0
201612	1210	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Once we have more clarity from the incoming Administration and the new Congress on their policies, we might have a stronger economic outlook that could well warrant a steeper path of rate increases.	13.0	91.0
201612	1211	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	I think we need to see how the economy performs with more financial restraint after the past six weeks and tomorrow’s decision.	13.0	91.0
201612	1212	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, in our view, financial conditions and the dollar have already tightened ahead of the direct fiscal stimulus that will likely occur later in 2017.	13.0	91.0
201612	1213	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Some people, I’ve already heard, think it’s going to be a little bit later in terms of the direct influence.	13.0	91.0
201612	1214	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	With the rise of inflation to our 2 percent objective still being just a forecast, albeit a more likely forecast now, I still see a role for caution in 2017.	13.0	91.0
201612	1215	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201612	1216	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201612	1217	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13.0	65.0
201612	1218	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201612	1219	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	According to some interpretations of the Book of Revelations, when three unusual events occur together, they may be a sign that the apocalypse is near.	13.0	94.0
201612	1220	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Let’s take stock:  The Chicago Cubs have won the World Series, Donald Trump has won the presidency, and Bob Dylan has won a Nobel Prize [laughter].	13.0	94.0
201612	1221	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	At the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, we have a regime-switching model of the apocalypse and currently estimate that we are in the no-apocalypse state.	13.0	94.0
201612	1222	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	But we have increased the probability of a switch to the apocalypse state somewhat in response to these recent events.	13.0	94.0
201612	1223	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	In my discussions with Eighth District contacts, indications seem to be consistent with the no- apocalypse state.	13.0	94.0
201612	1224	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Economic growth seems to be plodding along much as it has been in recent years, consistent with our estimates of a 2 percent trend growth rate.	13.0	94.0
201612	1225	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Some sectors, notably agribusiness—and I agree with President George here—remain in a slump, while others, including those related to housing, seem to be maintaining momentum.	13.0	94.0
201612	1226	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Consumer confidence appears to have picked up noticeably, a factor that may have some influence on holiday retail sales activity.	13.0	94.0
201612	1227	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Indeed, the our Reserve Bank’s news index nowcast, which tends to put more weight on softer data like consumer confidence, is currently suggesting a fourth-quarter annualized growth rate of close to 4 percent for the US economy.	13.0	94.0
201612	1228	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	This is something I’ll be watching closely in the weeks ahead.	13.0	94.0
201612	1229	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Nevertheless, even with the robust fourth quarter, should it occur, the real GDP growth rate for the United States for all of 2016 would still be close to 2 percent, and the St Louis Federal Reserve’s forecast for 2017—and, in fact, for the entire forecast horizon—remains at 2 percent.	13.0	94.0
201612	1230	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The question I am getting a lot in recent conversations is:  Does the recent election usher in a regime change with respect to growth prospects for the US economy?	13.0	94.0
201612	1231	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The short answer to this is “maybe,” and we are treating this as an upside risk in our regime-based forecast for the time being.	13.0	94.0
201612	1232	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	On this, I agree with President Lockhart and others.	13.0	94.0
201612	1233	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	It’s possible that we will become convinced that true change has occurred for US macroeconomic prospects in the quarters and years ahead, but it’s too early to reach such a conclusion today.	13.0	94.0
201612	1234	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis’s regime-based approach has two key components: The low-growth, low-real-rate regime we are currently in is characterized by a low rate of productivity growth and by a high liquidity premium on short-term government debt.	13.0	94.0
201612	1235	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Both of these factors are working to keep safe real interest rates very low and, by extension, the appropriate policy rate very low.	13.0	94.0
201612	1236	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Is either one of these factors likely to switch to a high value during the forecast horizon?	13.0	94.0
201612	1237	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The answer is: “Maybe, but not yet.”	13.0	94.0
201612	1238	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	To organize my thinking, I can divide nonmonetary policy into five very broad areas of change that may occur.	13.0	94.0
201612	1239	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	One is deregulation, broadly defined.	13.0	94.0
201612	1240	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Two is tax changes, especially with respect to business taxes, including repatriation of cash stored overseas and changes in corporate tax rates.	13.0	94.0
201612	1241	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Three, infrastructure spending; four, trade; and, five, immigration.	13.0	94.0
201612	1242	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Of these five categories, in my opinion, the first three executed properly could conceivably affect medium-term productivity and have some effect on the medium-term growth rate of the US economy.	13.0	94.0
201612	1243	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I would not conceive of these initiatives as stimulus but, rather, as an attempt to increase the trend growth rate of the US economy.	13.0	94.0
201612	1244	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I think an argument can be made for deregulation if you think that the regulatory pendulum has swung too far in recent years.	13.0	94.0
201612	1245	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	However, it’s a broad area.	13.0	94.0
201612	1246	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	It would apply across many different types of activity that would affect business, and it’s difficult to gauge.	13.0	94.0
201612	1247	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I think that tax changes, to the extent that they could influence investment in the United States, might have some effect on medium-term productivity and might have an effect through that channel.	13.0	94.0
201612	1248	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Infrastructure spending tends to take a long time, but in principle you’d like to have the right amount of public capital in place.	13.0	94.0
201612	1249	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	This could also improve medium-term productivity.	13.0	94.0
201612	1250	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So these are things that—at least in principle—could affect the longer-term growth rate in the United States.	13.0	94.0
201612	1251	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The final two areas, perhaps more important during the election, are, in my opinion, slow-moving issues:  trade and immigration.	13.0	94.0
201612	1252	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	As an example on trade, I would cite the Canada– EU negotiation, which has dragged on for seven years and has still not been approved by the European Union.	13.0	94.0
201612	1253	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I would take this as an indication that any attempts to change trade arrangements between countries takes a very, very long time.	13.0	94.0
201612	1254	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Of course, you can impose tariffs and start a trade war.	13.0	94.0
201612	1255	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	But you get retaliation from the other side, and it tends to be counterproductive.	13.0	94.0
201612	1256	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Immigration reform, if done correctly, is another area that could be very beneficial to the United States, but, again, even if you change the flow of immigrants into the United States in a way that would improve US productivity, that would take a long time to shape the US labor force and have a real effect.	13.0	94.0
201612	1257	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	For the purposes of monetary policy, I think it is the first three areas that are the most likely to inform discussions in the next several years here around this table.	13.0	94.0
201612	1258	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Also, I think that the effects from any policy changes that may be upcoming are more likely to be seen in 2018 and 2019 and much less in 2017.	13.0	94.0
201612	1259	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Sitting here today at the end of 2016, I would say our near-term outlook has not changed very much.	13.0	94.0
201612	1260	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	It is possible that there would be some near-term effects, but I think they’re less likely.	13.0	94.0
201612	1261	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	One thing that people might cite is the equity market rally, which was proceeding apace again this morning when I was watching TV.	13.0	94.0
201612	1262	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t know what happened today.	13.0	94.0
201612	1263	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I would interpret the equity market rally as due primarily to the prospect of corporate tax changes, which by themselves would have a large effect on revaluating the US corporate sector and not so much on anticipated economic growth effects from the possible policy changes ahead, even though much of the commentary will talk in terms of higher growth ahead.	13.0	94.0
201612	1264	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	It’s really the tax changes that have a very direct and immediate effect.	13.0	94.0
201612	1265	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The bottom line is that the St Louis Federal Reserve left the baseline outlook essentially unchanged over the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201612	1266	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	We are acknowledging upside risk as we have previously.	13.0	94.0
201612	1267	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	On the changes in yields since the election, I have a couple of comments.	13.0	94.0
201612	1268	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	First of all, I agree with President Williams’s comments about global forces.	13.0	94.0
201612	1269	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	You are talking about yields in a global context.	13.0	94.0
201612	1270	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t know if the United States can really break out of the global context all by itself.	13.0	94.0
201612	1271	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Also, roughly half of the increase in the 10-year yield was inflation expectations.	13.0	94.0
201612	1272	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The other half was a real yield.	13.0	94.0
201612	1273	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with Governor Powell and President Evans that the increase in inflation expectations was a welcome development.	13.0	94.0
201612	1274	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	For the Federal Reserve Bank of St.	13.0	94.0
201612	1275	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Louis’s outlook, we haven’t really been acknowledging, at least in recent meetings, that inflation expectations, as measured by the TIPS market, were too low compared with our forecast.	13.0	94.0
201612	1276	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Now that they’ve rebounded back to something more reasonable.	13.0	94.0
201612	1277	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	That’s good from our point of view.	13.0	94.0
201612	1278	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	But it does not require an adjustment, because we were assuming that they were going to bounce back anyway.	13.0	94.0
201612	1279	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The increase in the real rate is something that we have taken on board, and we’ve hedged our bets a little bit.	13.0	94.0
201612	1280	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	We think we may need now to have one more increase in the policy rate in 2017 to maintain unemployment and inflation at longer-run levels.	13.0	94.0
201612	1281	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	That is a slight change from where we were before, and that’s due to the run-up in real rates that we’ve observed in recent weeks.	13.0	94.0
201612	1282	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Even aside from that, there continues to be upside risk to this projection of the policy rate, should any of the switches to a higher-productivity regime or a lower-liquidity-premium regime occur.	13.0	94.0
201612	1283	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Finally, I think it may be time for the Committee to think about another policy tool, which is to reduce the size of the balance sheet.	13.0	94.0
201612	1284	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	This would be an alternative approach to sole reliance on the policy rate normalization path.	13.0	94.0
201612	1285	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And I’ll talk a little bit more about that tomorrow.	13.0	94.0
201612	1286	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201612	1287	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201612	1288	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	13.0	65.0
201612	1289	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201612	1290	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Before the recent OPEC agreement, we had been expecting that global oil production and consumption would get into rough balance by the first half of 2017.	13.0	110.0
201612	1291	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	On the basis of that analysis, we had expected record excess inventory levels would begin to decline by mid-2017, and we believed that the price of oil, while volatile, would continue to firm.	13.0	110.0
201612	1292	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Obviously, the recent OPEC agreement, which called for a cut in crude oil production of approximately 1.2 million barrels per day and would reduce output to approximately 32 million barrels per day during the first half of 2017, will have an effect on our forecast.	13.0	110.0
201612	1293	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	There are also hopes—which look like they’re materializing—for an additional 600,000 barrels a day by non-OPEC countries, half of that coming from Russia.	13.0	110.0
201612	1294	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	If this agreement is actually complied with—something that many doubt—it will accelerate this entire balancing process.	13.0	110.0
201612	1295	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Even before this, the rig count had begun gradually increasing during the past few months, and we believe that with a price of oil between $55 and $65 per barrel, the rig count could increase substantially.	13.0	110.0
201612	1296	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	We’re now on the precipice of that, and you could see substantial cap-ex flowing into this sector.	13.0	110.0
201612	1297	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	If you look ahead, though, over the next three to five years, our view at the Dallas Federal Reserve is that if there’s a price risk in the oil market, it is likely to be to the upside.	13.0	110.0
201612	1298	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	This is primarily because of the lack of new investment and long-lived oil production projects over the past few years.	13.0	110.0
201612	1299	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	In the medium term, new supply is going to have to come from increased production from shale, which has a very short decline curve.	13.0	110.0
201612	1300	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Our forecast also incorporates our expectation that global oil demand will continue to grow, on average, to 1.3 million barrels a day in 2017.	13.0	110.0
201612	1301	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	In terms of the District, due to the stabilization of the oil sector as well as continued diversification of the Texas economy, Texas job growth has improved from less than 1 percent in the first half of 2016.	13.0	110.0
201612	1302	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	We now expect job growth in excess of 2 percent in the second half of 2016 and a similar rate of job growth in 2017.	13.0	110.0
201612	1303	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	I would note, as many others have, that respondents to our most recent business outlook survey reported a significant uptick in their assessments of current conditions and the outlook, commenting on a more business-friendly environment for taxes and regulation.	13.0	110.0
201612	1304	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	At this point, we would say that risks to the District economic growth forecasts are to the upside.	13.0	110.0
201612	1305	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Regarding the nation, as many of you have discussed, we are making progress toward reaching our full-employment goal.	13.0	110.0
201612	1306	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	I find myself increasingly focusing on measures of employment among prime-age workers, which continue to lag.	13.0	110.0
201612	1307	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	And I’ve particularly been focusing again on the correlations between employment levels, participation, and levels of educational attainment.	13.0	110.0
201612	1308	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Analysis of levels of educational attainment versus participation and employment make me believe that even with beefed-up focus on vocational training as well as other programs that improve educational attainment levels, the labor force participation rate is likely to decline over the next 10 years to below 61 percent primarily due to demographic trends.	13.0	110.0
201612	1309	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Based on this, I believe that current rates of real GDP growth, though quite sluggish by historical standards, will certainly be sufficient to continue to take any slack out of the labor market and lower the unemployment rate.	13.0	110.0
201612	1310	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	I’ll come back to that in a moment.	13.0	110.0
201612	1311	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Regarding inflation, the Dallas the year-over year rate for the trimmed mean has been running steadily at 1.7 percent so far in 2016.	13.0	110.0
201612	1312	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	It has now ticked up to 1.8 percent in the most recent reading, and this trend continues to give me confidence that we’re going to reach our 2 percent objective over the medium term, if not sooner.	13.0	110.0
201612	1313	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	As I’ve talked about many times before, I’m continuing to work with my team to try to understand the effects of aging demographics, increasing levels of technology-enabled disruption, increased globalization, and particularly high ratios of government debt to GDP, which at a minimum appear to me at least not to be sustainable, even before considering new policies that may increase debt-to-GDP.	13.0	110.0
201612	1314	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	We’re certainly going to be highly vigilant in assessing the possible effects of significant potential changes to regulatory, fiscal, structural, and other government policies.	13.0	110.0
201612	1315	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	For the time being, like Governor Powell, I’ve factored in these possibilities as an insurance policy in our forecast.	13.0	110.0
201612	1316	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Having said that, in discussions with our business contacts, we continue to see, as I said before, a sharp improvement in the level of optimism.	13.0	110.0
201612	1317	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	We’re going to have to see what is actually implemented in terms of policy, but I do believe that the probability of overshooting our full employment and inflation objectives has increased.	13.0	110.0
201612	1318	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Time will tell, but I’m certainly now much more forward leaning regarding this possibility.	13.0	110.0
201612	1319	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Two final comments. in view of all the discussion about trade and immigration, I thought I’d comment on those issues.	13.0	110.0
201612	1320	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	We obviously have a very strong relationship between the Dallas Federal Reserve and the Central Bank of Mexico, as well as with the economic and political leaders of that country, and we do a substantial amount of research on trade and immigration.	13.0	110.0
201612	1321	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Let me share a couple of thoughts.	13.0	110.0
201612	1322	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	First, on trade, Texas is now the largest exporting state in the United States, and our largest trading partner is Mexico.	13.0	110.0
201612	1323	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	We estimate that trade between the United States and Mexico, measured in 2015 dollars, has grown from approximately $159 billion in 1994, which was around the time of NAFTA, to approximately $532 billion in 2015.	13.0	110.0
201612	1324	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	I see President Williams looking at me.	13.0	110.0
201612	1325	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	We may need some fact checking on this one.	13.0	102.0
201612	1326	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	We may debate that, yes.	13.0	110.0
201612	1327	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	[Laughter]	13.0	110.0
201612	1328	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Well, let me get to the other parts of our analysis.	13.0	110.0
201612	1329	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Approximately 55 percent of US trade with Mexico is imports to the United States, and approximately 45 percent is exports from the United States to Mexico.	13.0	110.0
201612	1330	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Approximately 81 percent of Mexico’s exports, by our measure, went to the United States.	13.0	110.0
201612	1331	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	What is interesting to us and what we particularly focus on is that approximately 40 percent of US imports from Mexico represents content that originates in the United States—that is, it’s the result of production partnerships, integrated logistics, and supply chains.	13.0	110.0
201612	1332	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	In our view, these partnerships have improved Texas’s competitiveness, as well as US competitiveness.	13.0	110.0
201612	1333	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	We believe that these arrangements have the effect of increasing employment in Texas as well as in the United States, and if these arrangements did not exist or were disrupted, we would likely lose some of these jobs to other countries, particularly in Asia.	13.0	110.0
201612	1334	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Because this aspect of trade is very critical to US competitiveness, we’ll continue to focus heavily on it.	13.0	110.0
201612	1335	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Regarding immigration, we estimate that the United States is home to more immigrants from Mexico than any other nation, by our count approximately 12 million.	13.0	110.0
201612	1336	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Mexican-born immigrants account for approximately 27 percent of all immigrants living in the United States and 55 percent of immigrants living in Texas.	13.0	110.0
201612	1337	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Our research suggests that over the past two years, net immigration flows to the United States from Mexico have basically been close to zero.	13.0	110.0
201612	1338	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Some people think those estimates are wrong, that they’ve been running negative.	13.0	110.0
201612	1339	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	And the reasons for that are improved economic conditions in Mexico, industrial reform, creation of a beefed-up social safety net, and smaller family size.	13.0	110.0
201612	1340	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	We estimate that immigrants generally and their children have made up a substantial portion—in our estimation, more than 50 percent—of the growth in the US labor force over the past 20 years.	13.0	110.0
201612	1341	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Let me stop there.	13.0	110.0
201612	1342	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201612	1343	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201612	1344	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	13.0	65.0
201612	1345	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201612	1346	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Over the intermeeting period, overall economic activity in the Third District continued to grow slowly but steadily, with employment barely increasing over the three months ending in October.	13.0	999.0
201612	1347	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	This recent behavior represents a significant departure from the region’s 0.7 percent trend growth rate.	13.0	999.0
201612	1348	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	A number of areas, such as Atlantic City, Vineland, and Allentown, have experienced contractions in employment this year, while some areas, such as metro Philadelphia, Altoona, and Ocean City, have seen employment growth rates in excess of 2 percent.	13.0	999.0
201612	1349	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	However, the recent slowdown in labor market growth has produced an unemployment rate of 5.5 percent for the region, almost a full percentage point higher than at the beginning of the year.	13.0	999.0
201612	1350	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	The increase in the unemployment rate is due to the loss of 90,000 jobs in the household survey, which represents job losses more consistent with the recession and, frankly, is at odds with the continued upward trend in employment reported in the establishment survey.	13.0	999.0
201612	1351	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Additionally, the behavior of new claims for unemployment insurance is more consistent with employment growth.	13.0	999.0
201612	1352	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	The most recent household labor market data are a bit of a puzzle.	13.0	999.0
201612	1353	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Needless to say, we will be monitoring developments in the region’s labor markets quite closely.	13.0	999.0
201612	1354	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Employment aside, other economic indicators point to slow-to-modest economic growth and an optimistic outlook among consumers and firms.	13.0	999.0
201612	1355	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Our manufacturing survey, due out this Thursday morning, remained in positive territory for the fifth straight month.	13.0	999.0
201612	1356	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	The current index increased from 7.6 to 21.5, well above its nonrecessionary average of 9.7.	13.0	999.0
201612	1357	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	In addition, respondents appear to be quite optimistic, with the future activity index jumping more than 23 points, from 29.3 to 52.6.	13.0	999.0
201612	1358	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	One contact summarized the mood in the business community as one of “awkward optimism”—I love the phrase—reflecting the hopes for a new Administration while recognizing the potential risks due to the presidential transition.	13.0	999.0
201612	1359	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Growth in consumer activity remains modest, and construction spending, both residential and nonresidential, is up on the year.	13.0	999.0
201612	1360	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	In our region, multifamily starts are approaching the level of single-family starts, which from a historical perspective is quite unusual and very different from national housing behavior.	13.0	999.0
201612	1361	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Looking ahead, we continue to forecast an acceleration of economic growth for the region in 2017.	13.0	999.0
201612	1362	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	On the nation as a whole, even though I did not incorporate any effects due to a change in fiscal policy, my economic outlook differs little from the staff’s.	13.0	999.0
201612	1363	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	The uncertainty surrounding the path of fiscal policy makes forecasting especially challenging.	13.0	999.0
201612	1364	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	I appreciate the staff’s efforts in taking a stand on proposed fiscal stimulus, but my own view is that the uncertainty about what might actually be implemented is high enough that I am not ready to make a major change to my outlook.	13.0	999.0
201612	1365	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	That said, I do think it is more likely than not that some stimulus will be forthcoming, so the risk to my forecast is weighted to the upside.	13.0	999.0
201612	1366	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	My forecast calls for real GDP to grow at 2.3 percent in 2017 and then 2.1 percent in 2018 and ’19.	13.0	999.0
201612	1367	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	The labor market continues to strengthen, and the unemployment rate edges down to 4.4 percent by the end of 2017 and then remains close to that level through 2019.	13.0	999.0
201612	1368	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Headline and core PCE inflation move up to the 2 percent target in 2018 but do not really overshoot in 2019.	13.0	999.0
201612	1369	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	The forecasts that I put the most weight on have acceptable outcomes for inflation and unemployment over the medium term together with an underlying policy rate path that calls for a bit less than 100 basis points per year in funds rate increases.	13.0	999.0
201612	1370	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Taking a forecast-targeting approach, my outlook calls for the funds rate to rise 75 basis points in 2017, which is one less rate hike than in my previous submission, and then about 100 basis points in each of the next two years.	13.0	999.0
201612	1371	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	But, like the staff, my modal outlook for real GDP growth is far from robust.	13.0	999.0
201612	1372	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	It appears that both of our forecasts are influenced by a somewhat discouraging view of longer-term growth, and there are fundamental reasons to take this view.	13.0	999.0
201612	1373	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Simply put, we—present company excluded—are getting older.	13.0	999.0
201612	1374	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	It seems that at each successive policy briefing, I learn a different way that demographics are reshaping the economy—their effects on labor force participation, their effects on real interest rates, and their effects on economic growth.	13.0	999.0
201612	1375	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Preliminary work by a member of my staff has pointed out that the decline in labor market fluidity, as measured by the gross job relocation rate, may be an important driver in declining productivity growth.	13.0	999.0
201612	1376	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	This decrease in fluidity is largely driven by demographic factors, with both the aging of firms and the aging of workers playing a role.	13.0	999.0
201612	1377	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Indeed, as some recent research at the New York Federal Reserve indicates, the two factors may be related, because with the aging of the workforce and fewer workers entering the labor market, employment costs rise, and it becomes less desirable for new firms to enter.	13.0	999.0
201612	1378	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Because new firms tend to have higher productivity, the aging of the distribution of firms can lead to lower productivity.	13.0	999.0
201612	1379	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Further, Ryan Decker of the Board staff estimates that productivity would be 2 percentage points per year higher in the dynamic high-tech sector if firms had expanded in line with their productivity at the same rate as they did pre-2000.	13.0	999.0
201612	1380	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	If the trending decline in fluidity continues, then we may be in for a period of prolonged low productivity growth that will affect the trajectory of future monetary policy.	13.0	999.0
201612	1381	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201612	1382	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201612	1383	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	13.0	65.0
201612	1384	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201612	1385	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Overall, the Fourth District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.	13.0	999.0
201612	1386	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	District contacts report largely stable economic conditions at this time.	13.0	999.0
201612	1387	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	The Bank’s diffusion index of business contacts reporting better versus worse conditions moved up from -6 at the time of our previous meeting to 0 and has been hovering around this level since midyear.	13.0	999.0
201612	1388	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Last Thursday we held a joint meeting of the Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Cincinnati boards, and I want to thank Governor Brainard and Eric Belsky for participating in a discussion of outreach efforts at the Cleveland Bank and at the System at large.	13.0	999.0
201612	1389	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	We found that to be a very productive discussion.	13.0	999.0
201612	1390	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	In the subsequent discussion of economic conditions, many directors expressed uncertainty about the likely effects of the election on their own businesses.	13.0	999.0
201612	1391	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	The bankers reported an increase in business sentiment among their customers, but a national labor leader on our Cincinnati Branch board noted that the employers they deal with are now less optimistic.	13.0	999.0
201612	1392	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	A national retail space real estate developer expressed some concerns about the large number of CMBS deals that were made in 2007 and are coming up for refinancing.	13.0	999.0
201612	1393	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Many of these deals were significantly leveraged, so some developers may run into trouble refinancing, in light of the new rules on risk retention and tighter underwriting standards by lenders.	13.0	999.0
201612	1394	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	District labor market conditions continue to strengthen.	13.0	999.0
201612	1395	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland Federal Reserve staff estimates that year-over-year growth in payrolls has edged down to 0.8 percent in November, but this pace is above their estimate of the District’s trend growth rate of about 0.25 percent, which is well below the trend growth rate of the nation and reflects the region’s low population growth and the aging of its population.	13.0	999.0
201612	1396	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	The District’s unemployment rate has remained around 5 percent all year.	13.0	999.0
201612	1397	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Responses from Fourth District contacts to the System’s special questions on hiring and wages were in line with those from the other Districts.	13.0	999.0
201612	1398	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Firms in the region continued to hire with relatively little change in hiring plans since last November’s survey.	13.0	999.0
201612	1399	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Compared with 63 percent in last year’s survey, 70 percent of respondents reported they were increasing wages to attract workers in either most or some job categories.	13.0	999.0
201612	1400	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Anecdotal reports indicate that firms are still having trouble hiring workers in several job categories, including construction and information technology.	13.0	999.0
201612	1401	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Inflation pressures in the District appear contained, but some firms report they are increasing prices after several years of stability.	13.0	999.0
201612	1402	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	A director who heads a large national paint and coatings company reported that in December, for the first time in four years, the firm increased prices 4 percent to cover rising labor and real estate costs.	13.0	999.0
201612	1403	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	He said there had been no pushback from customers.	13.0	999.0
201612	1404	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Regarding the national economy, real GDP growth has picked up in the second half of the year, as anticipated.	13.0	999.0
201612	1405	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Labor market conditions have continued to strengthen, and inflation indicators and several measures of inflation expectations have moved up since our previous meeting.	13.0	999.0
201612	1406	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	The prospects for some changes to fiscal and other economic policies—such as infrastructure spending, tax code changes, immigration policy, trade policy, and regulatory change—increased, but the form any policy changes will take, the timing of passage, and the timing and size of the effects are very uncertain at this point.	13.0	999.0
201612	1407	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	The Tealbook baseline assumptions about fiscal stimulus seem plausible to me, but the package could be larger or smaller, and its design will be an important factor in assessing the expected effect on the medium-run outlook.	13.0	999.0
201612	1408	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Will fiscal policy changes be formulated in a manner that merely gives a temporary boost to aggregate demand to be financed by deficit spending—a development that would not be beneficial to the economy over the medium to longer run?	13.0	999.0
201612	1409	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Or, instead, will the policy changes aim to increase productivity growth, which would be very beneficial if the policy changes actually achieve that goal?	13.0	999.0
201612	1410	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	We have few details at this point, so in putting together my SEP submission, like the Tealbook, I have incorporated a modest increase in output growth and inflation in 2018 due to fiscal policy effects.	13.0	999.0
201612	1411	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Policies that constrain immigration and trade would have negative effects for the US economy over the medium and longer run, but I have not incorporated these into my projections at this point.	13.0	999.0
201612	1412	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	So fiscal and other potential economic policies impart both upside and downside risks to my forecast.	13.0	999.0
201612	1413	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	The prospect of a larger fiscal package than I assumed poses upside risks to output growth and inflation, especially if monetary policy does not appropriately respond.	13.0	999.0
201612	1414	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	A smaller package poses some downside risks, especially because financial market participants appear to be anticipating fairly large effects and could be disappointed.	13.0	999.0
201612	1415	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	As more details about forthcoming policy changes come in, we will have a better sense of their implications and can adjust our forecast.	13.0	999.0
201612	1416	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	At this point, overall, my outlook for the US economy over the medium run hasn’t changed much since our previous meeting or since our September SEP submission.	13.0	999.0
201612	1417	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	I see the fundamentals—including accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions, improved household balance sheets, the strong labor market, and modestly more stimulative fiscal policy—as supportive of GDP growth over the forecast horizon at a pace at or slightly above its trend pace, which I estimate at 2 percent.	13.0	999.0
201612	1418	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	This pace is sufficient to put downward pressure on the unemployment rate, which stays below my longer-run rate of 5 percent over the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201612	1419	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	I anticipate that inflation will move up to 2 percent in early 2018, reflecting stable inflation expectations, continued strengthening of labor market conditions, and ongoing economic growth.	13.0	999.0
201612	1420	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	In light of my outlook, I believe it will be appropriate for the federal funds rate to move up over the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201612	1421	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	My trajectory is a bit steeper than in my September SEP submission, because the funds rate at the end of 2016 will be lower than I projected in September and because, compared with September, I am projecting slightly higher output growth and inflation and a somewhat lower unemployment rate over the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201612	1422	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	I now assume that the funds rate will end 2019 at a level slightly higher than my longer-run estimate of 3 percent.	13.0	999.0
201612	1423	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	But, admittedly, there is considerable uncertainty regarding this policy rate path, in view of the uncertainty associated with the forecast and the types of shocks that will invariably hit the economy over the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201612	1424	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	On its external website, the Cleveland Reserve Bank now publishes a set of simple monetary policy rules, the outcomes of these rules across alternative forecasts, and a tool for computing rule outcomes on the basis of the user’s own forecast.	13.0	999.0
201612	1425	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Looking at the rules, one can see there is quite a bit of variation in what the rules prescribe.	13.0	999.0
201612	1426	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	But the median path across the rules is steeper than the median path in the SEP.	13.0	999.0
201612	1427	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	My policy rate path is similar to the outcome from the inertial Taylor rule from our set of rules.	13.0	999.0
201612	1428	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	My path is a bit steeper than in the Tealbook, in part because I see somewhat greater inflation pressures.	13.0	999.0
201612	1429	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	As a result, my policy rate path results in somewhat less undershooting of the unemployment rate of its longer-run estimate compared with the Tealbook.	13.0	999.0
201612	1430	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	I see broadly balanced risks associated with my outlook, but I believe we need to remain very open to the considerable possibility that the economy will evolve differently from what we currently anticipate.	13.0	999.0
201612	1431	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	I was struck over the intermeeting period by how sharply financial conditions and consumer and business sentiment changed.	13.0	999.0
201612	1432	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	The National Federation of Independent Business survey results, which are embargoed until Tuesday, suggest there was a significant increase in confidence among small businesses since the election.	13.0	999.0
201612	1433	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Apparently, financial market participants and business leaders are expecting very beneficial changes to fiscal and other economic policies.	13.0	999.0
201612	1434	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	I found the Board staff’s memo on this to be quite helpful.	13.0	999.0
201612	1435	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	It could be that these expectations will be borne out, but at this point they seem to be skewed toward putting too much weight on very positive outcomes and too little weight on poor outcomes, especially as we have few details on the actual proposed policy changes.	13.0	999.0
201612	1436	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	On the other hand, I have always put more weight on fundamentals driving the economy and on these fundamentals driving sentiment.	13.0	999.0
201612	1437	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	But maybe I have been underestimating the effect that animal spirits or sentiment can have, independent of fundamentals like policy.	13.0	999.0
201612	1438	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	We’ve been somewhat puzzled by the low levels of business investment and productivity growth, against the background of the accommodative financial conditions we have had for quite some time.	13.0	999.0
201612	1439	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Perhaps now better sentiment will spur renewed investment.	13.0	999.0
201612	1440	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Of course, this possibility also raises the uncomfortable notion that there may be some truth to the skeptics’s argument that keeping interest rates as low as we have for as long as we have has sent a negative signal about the economy, which has hurt business, investor, and consumer confidence, thus creating a negative headwind.	13.0	999.0
201612	1441	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Recent developments suggest we may need to consider this, as well as the implications it would have for both our policy rate path and our communications.	13.0	999.0
201612	1442	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201612	1443	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201612	1444	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13.0	65.0
201612	1445	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	81.0
201612	1446	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Our surveys of economic activity in the Fifth District have shown modest firming since the previous FOMC meeting.	13.0	81.0
201612	1447	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Our composite manufacturing index was plus 4 in November, a notable increase from the negative numbers posted in the previous three months.	13.0	81.0
201612	1448	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Preliminary figures for December—confidential until the 27th, please—show a reading of plus 6.	13.0	81.0
201612	1449	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Service-sector activity also expanded more broadly since the previous meeting.	13.0	81.0
201612	1450	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	According to our survey, the revenue index for services was plus 3 in November and plus 8 according to the preliminary December results.	13.0	81.0
201612	1451	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Numerous contacts reported a greater sense of optimism regarding the economic outlook since the election.	13.0	81.0
201612	1452	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Some have used words like “exuberance” and “euphoria.”	13.0	81.0
201612	1453	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	An array of sources cited the prospect of changing or repealing regulations enacted in recent years as one source of optimism.	13.0	81.0
201612	1454	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	The new overtime rules were frequently cited, and firms that had gone through implementation reported cases of employees feeling insulted at being reclassified as hourly or just quitting outright.	13.0	81.0
201612	1455	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Prospects for rollback of the ACA and EPA rules and for possible tax reform were also cited as contributing to greater optimism.	13.0	81.0
201612	1456	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Several bank CEOs noted a flurry of borrowing requests.	13.0	81.0
201612	1457	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	They say that many customers had let investment demand build over the past few years and that the election seems to have released pent-up increases in planned capital spending.	13.0	81.0
201612	1458	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Other contacts, however, noted the uncertainty surrounding the contours of upcoming policy changes, and one director called the euphoria “irrational.”	13.0	81.0
201612	1459	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	One utility industry executive from West Virginia said that some in the state were positively giddy about the prospect of their coal jobs coming back.	13.0	81.0
201612	1460	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	But he emphasized that while some near-term uptick in coal production in response to firming natural gas prices was possible, there was no way coal production was going to return to anything like previous levels.	13.0	81.0
201612	1461	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	And one director who’s the CEO of a large urban Goodwill said that clients at their workforce training centers—these are mostly in the hospitality and security occupations—have become more fearful as a result of the election.	13.0	81.0
201612	1462	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Nonetheless, the overall tone of anecdotal comments from directors and roundtable participants was strikingly upbeat.	13.0	81.0
201612	1463	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	At the national level, the natural interpretation of the large increases in equity prices and bond yields since the election seems consistent with the general exuberance we’ve heard from around our District, namely an anticipation of tax reform or reduced regulatory burden.	13.0	81.0
201612	1464	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I find it heartening that markets appear to be more or less discounting adverse economic effects from increased trade barriers, although some of our export-oriented manufacturers have expressed some worries about future trade policy.	13.0	81.0
201612	1465	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Clearly, there’s a lot of uncertainty about just what’s coming down the pike by way of policy initiatives, but it seems prudent to build in at least some fiscal stimulus into the baseline forecast at this point, and for simplicity we followed the Tealbook’s approach of assuming a medium-sized personal tax cut in Q3.	13.0	81.0
201612	1466	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Without that assumption, our forecast would have been little changed from our September SEP submission that showed real GDP growth slowing to its trend rate of about 1¾ percent.	13.0	81.0
201612	1467	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	With that assumption, GDP growth is ¼ percentage point higher next year but basically the same thereafter.	13.0	81.0
201612	1468	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I agree with the notion that any productivity enhancements arising from the new policy environment are speculative at this point and likely to show up only over an extended horizon, so I’m not assuming any material supply-side effects for now.	13.0	81.0
201612	1469	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	The way things have played out since the election gives me a bit more confidence in the business investment forecast, however.	13.0	81.0
201612	1470	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I think President Mester and others commented on this.	13.0	81.0
201612	1471	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Since the beginning of the year, the Tealbook, like many others, myself included, has been projecting an imminent rebound in business fixed investment.	13.0	81.0
201612	1472	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Instead, BFI has been disappointingly sluggish all year.	13.0	81.0
201612	1473	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	If the post- election response represents the release of pent-up business spending plans, then investment spending may have been held down before the election by firms’ apprehension about the election outcome and growing regulatory burdens.	13.0	81.0
201612	1474	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	If the current burst of optimism is to some extent sustained, then we are more likely to get the turnaround in BFI that we’d been hoping for.	13.0	81.0
201612	1475	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	My inflation projections are basically unchanged.	13.0	81.0
201612	1476	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Core and overall inflation rates converge to 2 percent in about a year.	13.0	81.0
201612	1477	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Achieving that outcome—that is, keeping the added fiscal stimulus from driving up inflation—is going to require tighter monetary policy.	13.0	81.0
201612	1478	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I’m projecting the appropriate funds rate to rise more rapidly than I did in September.	13.0	81.0
201612	1479	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	We start from a lower base than I had projected for this month, and the net is the same rate at the end of next year as I wrote down in September, but a higher rate at the end of 2018.	13.0	81.0
201612	1480	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	For me, uncertainty about the economic outlook in the United States is greater than it was at the previous meeting.	13.0	81.0
201612	1481	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Even though the direction might be clear, the range of possible fiscal and regulatory policy outcomes is fairly large.	13.0	81.0
201612	1482	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	It seems plausible that outcomes will not be quite as beneficial to economic growth and earnings as the move in equity values would imply.	13.0	81.0
201612	1483	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	So I think it’s worth taking the recent outbreak of exuberance with a few grains of salt.	13.0	81.0
201612	1484	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	On the other hand, inflation risks seem to be moving in the other direction.	13.0	81.0
201612	1485	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Indeed, inflation compensation measures have risen significantly, as several have noted, and even more striking is the movement in the Kitsul–Wright probabilities of high and low inflation that are derived from options markets.	13.0	81.0
201612	1486	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Since early October, the estimated probability of 10-year inflation being above 3 percent has risen from about 20 percent to about 40 percent, while the estimated probability of the 10-year inflation being below 1 percent has fallen from about 40 percent to about 20 percent.	13.0	81.0
201612	1487	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	We have also seen the 10-year Treasury security’s term premium move from negative territory to about zero.	13.0	81.0
201612	1488	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	This suggests that investors see less value in Treasuries as a hedge against deflation, and they’re becoming more concerned about the exposure of nominal Treasuries to the risk of inflation.	13.0	81.0
201612	1489	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	These developments could just reflect a dissipation of downside inflation risks and a return to the normalcy of a more symmetric inflation outlook.	13.0	81.0
201612	1490	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	At the same time, they could reflect market expectations that policy rates are not going to respond enough to prevent fiscal stimulus from pushing inflation higher.	13.0	81.0
201612	1491	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	For me, this implies we should seriously consider whether rate increases will be only gradual.	13.0	81.0
201612	1492	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Finally, I have some comments about the undershooting memo, which I appreciated.	13.0	81.0
201612	1493	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	It’s noteworthy that the only episode identified of a soft landing is 1993–1995.	13.0	81.0
201612	1494	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	This episode is identified in narrative accounts of postwar US monetary policy as the first instance of preemptive rate increases since the beginning of the Great Inflation in the mid-’60s.	13.0	81.0
201612	1495	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	The FOMC raised the federal funds rate 300 basis points in one year.	13.0	81.0
201612	1496	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I don’t expect we will need 300 basis points next year, but I suspect 50 won’t be enough.	13.0	81.0
201612	1497	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	These accounts give credit to our preemptive approach for stabilizing inflation expectations near 2 percent and ushering in the current era of relatively well-behaved, well-anchored inflation expectations.	13.0	81.0
201612	1498	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	This perspective reflects the extent to which our credibility—that is, expectations about monetary policy—is capable of varying over time.	13.0	81.0
201612	1499	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	And, in this regard, I wanted to comment on the discussion of the inflation process in the memo.	13.0	81.0
201612	1500	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	One could be forgiven for thinking of it as an exogenous technological phenomenon, but I know the staff appreciates that it’s endogenous.	13.0	81.0
201612	1501	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Those parameters embed private-sector expectations about the conduct of policy in the future.	13.0	81.0
201612	1502	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	For me, the lesson I take from the undershooting memo is that we need to be careful not to miss the opportunity to be appropriately preemptive.	13.0	81.0
201612	1503	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	81.0
201612	1504	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201612	1505	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	13.0	65.0
201612	1506	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	111.0
201612	1507	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Moderate economic growth continues in the Ninth District.	13.0	111.0
201612	1508	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Retail spending and housing construction have been especially strong.	13.0	111.0
201612	1509	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	The ag sector in 2016 has seen a record harvest year, and, not surprisingly, farmers are pessimistic about next year.	13.0	111.0
201612	1510	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Employment continues to grow modestly despite continued poor labor availability.	13.0	111.0
201612	1511	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Twin Cities’ daycare providers said that a lot of new families need daycare because they’re all going back to work.	13.0	111.0
201612	1512	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Wages continue to see pressure, especially on the low end, but price pressures remain subdued.	13.0	111.0
201612	1513	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Contacts point to strong online competition in retail, especially in flat food prices.	13.0	111.0
201612	1514	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	A large online retailer is expanding sharply in the Twin Cities.	13.0	111.0
201612	1515	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Nationally, the moderate pace of expansion continues—solid consumption growth, but, as others have noted, investment remains worryingly weak.	13.0	111.0
201612	1516	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Most important to me is looking at the unemployment situation.	13.0	111.0
201612	1517	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	As others have noted, the big drop in the headline unemployment rate is something I’m paying close attention to.	13.0	111.0
201612	1518	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	That sharp decline coupled with a tick down in labor force participation suggests that the labor market is tightening, and the big question is, “Are we there yet or is there more room to run?”	13.0	111.0
201612	1519	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I think in future months we’ll see.	13.0	111.0
201612	1520	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	We’ll get more data to help determine whether or not this has really run its course.	13.0	111.0
201612	1521	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	There was welcome evidence of some pickup in productivity.	13.0	111.0
201612	1522	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I hope that will continue after Q3.	13.0	111.0
201612	1523	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	In terms of inflation, there was no change to core inflation in the intermeeting period.	13.0	111.0
201612	1524	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	As others noted, 5-to-10-year-ahead TIPS inflation compensation has risen, continuing a rise that started midyear.	13.0	111.0
201612	1525	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	But let’s remind ourselves that this is still low by historical standards, as some others have noted.	13.0	111.0
201612	1526	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	The markets seem focused on a scenario that fiscal policy becomes more expansionary, which in turn drives up inflation, and oil prices have risen a bit.	13.0	111.0
201612	1527	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	On the other hand, the dollar continues to strengthen, which will hold down import prices.	13.0	111.0
201612	1528	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	The trade-weighted index is up more than 25 percent since mid-2014, when the dollar strengthening began.	13.0	111.0
201612	1529	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Now, the other thing that I think is noteworthy, as others have noted, is financial markets since the election.	13.0	111.0
201612	1530	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Ten-year Treasury yields are up about 60 basis points, and this reflects a fairly even split between higher real rates and higher inflation compensation.	13.0	111.0
201612	1531	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Markets are expecting a faster pace of firming from us.	13.0	111.0
201612	1532	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	My view is that we should pay attention to markets, but not overreact to them.	13.0	111.0
201612	1533	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	They don’t have any better idea of what fiscal policy is going to be than we do.	13.0	111.0
201612	1534	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Markets and pollsters didn’t get Brexit right.	13.0	111.0
201612	1535	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	They didn’t get the election right.	13.0	111.0
201612	1536	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I don’t have any more confidence that they’re going to get fiscal policy right.	13.0	111.0
201612	1537	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	By the way, in terms of timing, we’re not going to know for quite some time what actual fiscal policy will be.	13.0	111.0
201612	1538	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	But my guess is that in the first 100 days we’ll at least have markers out from the Administration of what it’s proposing.	13.0	111.0
201612	1539	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	It’ll take longer for those negotiations to take place.	13.0	111.0
201612	1540	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	But I think we’ll know a lot more in three or four months than we know now.	13.0	111.0
201612	1541	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Higher rates plus a stronger dollar do imply tighter conditions.	13.0	111.0
201612	1542	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	But when I look at the rates going up—I guess I don’t know, President Williams, whether r* can move this quickly—it doesn’t feel like tighter conditions.	13.0	111.0
201612	1543	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	It feels like more optimism, and so it isn’t obvious how much effect that’s going to have.	13.0	111.0
201612	1544	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	And, as I said earlier, markets could give back these gains as quickly as they acquired them if negotiations go a different direction.	13.0	111.0
201612	1545	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	And then uncertainty, as I just touched on, is currently high, due to the policy uncertainty.	13.0	111.0
201612	1546	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Global uncertainty remains, with Italy, as we talked about; with South Korea now having some turmoil there politically; and with a large bank in Northern Europe, as we talked about earlier.	13.0	111.0
201612	1547	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	And uncertainty isn’t necessarily bad news.	13.0	111.0
201612	1548	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	There’s a greater chance of good outcomes but also a greater chance of bad outcomes.	13.0	111.0
201612	1549	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	In conclusion, we continue to make welcome progress toward our goals.	13.0	111.0
201612	1550	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	However, I will note in my policy go-round the elevated policy uncertainty.	13.0	111.0
201612	1551	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I struggle with not just tomorrow’s decision, which I think is fairly straightforward, but how do we communicate the likely future path, in view of this huge uncertainty that we face right now?	13.0	111.0
201612	1552	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201612	1553	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13.0	65.0
201612	1554	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201612	1555	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I think where we are and where we’re headed in the near term is relatively clear, and there seems to be pretty good agreement around the table.	13.0	96.0
201612	1556	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s also agreement that further out, 2018 and beyond, is less clear and, as many people have recognized, there is a potential for significant fiscal policy stimulus that could collide with an economy that may be operating at or even somewhat beyond what we would characterize as maximum sustainable employment.	13.0	96.0
201612	1557	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Over the near term, I expect the economy to continue to do what it had been doing, growing at a slightly above-trend pace.	13.0	96.0
201612	1558	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	When I assess the economy, I’m pretty optimistic about household spending, which I expect will be bolstered by further job gains and rising wage compensation.	13.0	96.0
201612	1559	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, the US consumer does not appear overstretched.	13.0	96.0
201612	1560	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	The personal saving rate, at 6 percent in October, actually seems to be a bit high relative to what one might expect on the basis of the historical relationship between household net worth and disposable income.	13.0	96.0
201612	1561	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	And household balance sheets are in good shape.	13.0	96.0
201612	1562	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Households did deleverage significantly since the Great Recession, and, over the previous year, household debt has been growing, but it has been growing at a very modest pace.	13.0	96.0
201612	1563	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Business fixed investment is sort of the wild card.	13.0	96.0
201612	1564	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s been the laggard in recent years, but I think it will also do somewhat better.	13.0	96.0
201612	1565	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Obviously, we’re probably past the drag due to the plunge in oil and gas drilling activity, but I also think that there was probably some negative consequence from election-year uncertainty.	13.0	96.0
201612	1566	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	And, now that that’s passed, that effect will likely fade as well.	13.0	96.0
201612	1567	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Residential investment, I’m not really sure what’s going to happen there.	13.0	96.0
201612	1568	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s been all over the place over the past year and a half, up in 2015, in the first quarter of this year, and then down sharply in Q2 and Q3.	13.0	96.0
201612	1569	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess I think that higher mortgage rates will restrain housing demand somewhat, similar to what we saw during the taper tantrum, but against that we have the fact that housing supply still seems to be low relative to job growth and the longer-run pace of household formation.	13.0	96.0
201612	1570	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So we’re not producing houses at a particularly rapid rate right now.	13.0	96.0
201612	1571	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	In contrast, I do expect the trade sector will be a drag on growth over the next year or so.	13.0	96.0
201612	1572	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	The performance during the first three quarters of this year seems to be an anomaly.	13.0	96.0
201612	1573	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I did not expect that trade would contribute positively to GDP growth this year, and it does seem to be due mainly to a weakness in imports, primarily of capital goods, and, of course, the often-cited surge in soybean exports.	13.0	96.0
201612	1574	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Over the next year, I would expect some modest drag on the trade side as these temporary factors lapse and as the recent strength of the dollar starts to become more relevant again.	13.0	96.0
201612	1575	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, the implications of the Trump Administration’s goal of better trade deals for the United States are, from my perspective, highly uncertain.	13.0	96.0
201612	1576	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So it’s not just fiscal policy.	13.0	96.0
201612	1577	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Trade deals that are more favorable to US interests, but without any meaningful increase in trade barriers, could evolve in a mostly positive direction, or they could evolve in a very negative one involving higher trade barriers.	13.0	96.0
201612	1578	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	In that case, the principle of comparative advantage would be challenged with negative consequences for productivity and, presumably, the prices of internationally traded goods and services.	13.0	96.0
201612	1579	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	As many of us have noted, another source of uncertainty is the likely trajectory of fiscal policy.	13.0	96.0
201612	1580	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	While I agree with the general sentiment that fiscal policy is likely to turn more expansive, I’m one of the people who have not put it into their forecast yet because we don’t know what it is, when it is, or how big it is, and that’s just too many considerations for me to figure out how to parse it into my forecast.	13.0	96.0
201612	1581	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I want to see more information, and I think we will have a lot more information in the next three or four months.	13.0	96.0
201612	1582	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So by the time we get to the March SEP, I think this will be factoring into my outlook.	13.0	96.0
201612	1583	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	In assessing the outlook, one thing that we talked about around the table is, how do you factor in the recent market developments?	13.0	96.0
201612	1584	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Since the election, we’ve had pretty large movements in financial asset prices.	13.0	96.0
201612	1585	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Bond yields are up, equity prices are up, and the dollar has appreciated considerably against many different currencies.	13.0	96.0
201612	1586	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	On balance, if you view it in terms of a financial condition index, it looks to be a tightening of financial market conditions.	13.0	96.0
201612	1587	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	But I’m not really concerned by this because I do think that this is a tightening that’s different than the tightening, for example, that we saw in early 2016.	13.0	96.0
201612	1588	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	That was an increase in risk aversion.	13.0	96.0
201612	1589	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	That was an increase in the risk premiums that were embedded in financial asset prices, and I don’t think that’s happening this time.	13.0	96.0
201612	1590	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that the tightening of financial market conditions, to the extent there’s a tightening at all, reflects greater optimism about the outlook, and it’s not even clear to me whether the net effect on real GDP growth is positive or negative.	13.0	96.0
201612	1591	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So I’m pretty agnostic about this, and I certainly am not using it to reduce my GDP growth forecast.	13.0	96.0
201612	1592	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the inflation outlook, I’m more confident that we’re going to make progress toward our 2 percent objective.	13.0	96.0
201612	1593	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	There are a number of things that I take as supportive of that.	13.0	96.0
201612	1594	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	One is less downside risk to the economy because I do think it’s not just that US fiscal policy is likely to turn more stimulative.	13.0	96.0
201612	1595	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the global economic outlook has improved somewhat.	13.0	96.0
201612	1596	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, to the extent that US fiscal policy is more stimulative, that’s going to help the rest of the world, too.	13.0	96.0
201612	1597	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	This gives a real chance for Japan and Europe to get out of their very low inflation traps.	13.0	96.0
201612	1598	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	If we have more fiscal policy stimulus—not a reason to do the fiscal policy stimulus, necessarily—it will be helpful, potentially, for them.	13.0	96.0
201612	1599	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Another is the effect of higher energy prices on headline inflation, and I think that’s going to feed into inflation expectations.	13.0	96.0
201612	1600	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re already starting to see the very beginnings of that.	13.0	96.0
201612	1601	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	However, longer term on inflation, I’m starting to be worried about the risk that inflation overshoots.	13.0	96.0
201612	1602	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	This is tied back to the issue of whether fiscal policy is going to be very stimulative.	13.0	96.0
201612	1603	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not going to put much weight on this risk over the very near term.	13.0	96.0
201612	1604	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	In the short run, at least, I don’t feel like it will be a particularly bad outcome if inflation is slightly above 2 percent for a time because that would reinforce the notion that our 2 percent inflation objective is symmetric and not a ceiling.	13.0	96.0
201612	1605	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	But I do think that we could be looking at a situation two to three years from now where the economy was really getting pushed along by this fiscal stimulus, and if we were late—to President Lacker’s comments—inflation could start to get out of hand.	13.0	96.0
201612	1606	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	In that vein, I particularly worry a little bit about how the Tealbook models these kinds of risks, because it always assumes that we’re going to do the right thing, and it assumes that the Phillips curve is very, very flat.	13.0	96.0
201612	1607	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not convinced that we’ll necessarily always do the right thing.	13.0	96.0
201612	1608	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	The Federal Reserve has made serial errors in policy, and as you push the unemployment rate down to very low levels, I think there’s enough risk that the Phillips curve becomes steeper.	13.0	96.0
201612	1609	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	When I read the Tealbook’s alternative scenarios, I’m always amazed by how big the shocks are relative to the consequences on economic growth and inflation because the results are so damped by the expectations that, in the end, we’ll do the right thing.	13.0	96.0
201612	1610	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Everyone knows we’ll do the right thing and, therefore, nothing really bad happens.	13.0	96.0
201612	1611	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we just have to be a little bit cautious when we think about those alternative scenarios.	13.0	96.0
201612	1612	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, in terms of my interest rate projections, which we’ll talk more about tomorrow, I haven’t made any changes yet, two 25 basis point moves in 2017 and three for 2018.	13.0	96.0
201612	1613	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	But if we do get the news on fiscal policy that maybe we’ll get before the March meeting, then my forecast of my forecast is that my forecast might move up.	13.0	96.0
201612	1614	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201612	1615	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	My thanks to everyone for an interesting discussion of the outlook and associated risks.	13.0	65.0
201612	1616	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	What I’d like to do is close out the round with a few comments on incoming data and on the possible implications for the outlook of changes in fiscal policy.	13.0	65.0
201612	1617	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	To begin:  As we expected and intended, labor market conditions have continued to improve.	13.0	65.0
201612	1618	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Payroll gains have remained solid at about 180,000 per month since late summer and for the year as a whole.	13.0	65.0
201612	1619	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	The unemployment rate dropped markedly in November.	13.0	65.0
201612	1620	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Like the staff, I expect this decline to be partially reversed in the next month or two, leaving the unemployment rate very close to my estimate of its sustainable longer-run level.	13.0	65.0
201612	1621	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	The broader U-6 measure of labor utilization, although still somewhat elevated, has fallen more than ½ percentage point since the start of the year.	13.0	65.0
201612	1622	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	And the employment-to-population ratio has held steady, despite the downward pressure from demographic trends.	13.0	65.0
201612	1623	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	On the basis of these and other indicators, I judge that overall utilization in the labor market is more or less back to normal.	13.0	65.0
201612	1624	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	That said, I don’t think we’ve fallen “behind the curve.”	13.0	65.0
201612	1625	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Wage gains are still subdued, and inflation remains below our 2 percent objective.	13.0	65.0
201612	1626	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, the elimination of slack does not mean that the economy has reached some tipping point, with any further tightening triggering widespread shortages of workers, a sharp acceleration in costs, or other destabilizing dynamics.	13.0	65.0
201612	1627	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	On the basis of the evidence presented in the two, very nicely done, staff memos, I instead expect that the effects of a further decline in unemployment on inflation or, conceivably, on financial stability will develop only slowly, giving us time to respond if undesirable effects emerge.	13.0	65.0
201612	1628	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, I consider the risk of a marked overheating to be low if we act to remove gradually the modest degree of accommodation that is still in place.	13.0	65.0
201612	1629	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Real GDP has been expanding at a fairly moderate pace for some time.	13.0	65.0
201612	1630	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	And in an environment of rising interest rates, I would expect growth to slow further, all else being equal.	13.0	65.0
201612	1631	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	With appropriate adjustments to policy, we should be able to prevent the unemployment rate from undershooting its long-run level to an excessive degree.	13.0	65.0
201612	1632	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	We’ve also made good progress on the inflation front, and the data have come in somewhat stronger than I expected a year ago.	13.0	65.0
201612	1633	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	On a 12-month basis, headline PCE inflation is now running at close to 1½ percent, compared with only ½ percent last year.	13.0	65.0
201612	1634	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, core PCE inflation is now running at 1¾ percent.	13.0	65.0
201612	1635	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Survey-based measures of expected inflation remain stable, and market-based measures of inflation compensation, although still low, have risen more than 30 basis points since our previous meeting.	13.0	65.0
201612	1636	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	These developments have reinforced my confidence that inflation will be back to 2 percent within a couple of years, aided in part by moderately tight labor market conditions.	13.0	65.0
201612	1637	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Ideally, we will succeed in adjusting the stance of monetary policy over time to achieve the desired soft landing.	13.0	65.0
201612	1638	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	As one of the staff memos discussed, history shows that such an outcome is possible, at least as long as we are not hit with a large adverse shock.	13.0	65.0
201612	1639	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Judging the stance of policy that’s most conducive to keeping the economy operating on an even keel is, of course, never easy.	13.0	65.0
201612	1640	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	But it is particularly tricky in the current environment, because of our large asset holdings and considerable uncertainty about future fiscal policy.	13.0	65.0
201612	1641	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Estimates suggest that the neutral level of the real funds rate is currently near zero, more than 1 percentage point higher than its actual value.	13.0	65.0
201612	1642	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	If so, then achieving a neutral stance would appear to require roughly four 25 basis point hikes in addition to the one that we will presumably announce tomorrow.	13.0	65.0
201612	1643	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	But in assessing how much and how quickly to raise the funds rate next year, we need to bear in mind that the degree of accommodation provided by our balance sheet is also declining appreciably.	13.0	65.0
201612	1644	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	According to staff estimates, the downward pressure on longer-term yields from our security holdings will diminish by 16 basis points between now and the end of 2017.	13.0	65.0
201612	1645	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Because the restraint imposed by such a shift is roughly equivalent to that associated with two or more hikes in the funds rate, the need to raise the funds rate very quickly may be less than it might appear.	13.0	65.0
201612	1646	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Risk-management concerns related to the effective lower bound provide another reason to proceed gradually.	13.0	65.0
201612	1647	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	At the same time, the neutral value of the real funds rate is likely to rise over time if residential construction continues to recover from its unusually depressed level, capital spending and productivity growth pick up, and economic activity abroad strengthens.	13.0	65.0
201612	1648	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Easier fiscal policy also now appears likely to stimulate real activity over time, thereby placing additional upward pressure on the path of the funds rate consistent with our dual objectives.	13.0	65.0
201612	1649	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	But, at this point, we don’t know how big a fiscal package may be enacted, let alone the timing or composition of its provisions, so we really can’t judge how much stimulus it might impart.	13.0	65.0
201612	1650	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	In fact, the overall effect of the fiscal proposals under consideration could turn out to be mildly contractionary in 2017 if additional fiscal impetus ends up being delayed until late next year or beyond, as the stronger dollar and the notable increase we have already seen in longer- term yields since the election will likely have a more front-loaded negative effect on economic activity.	13.0	65.0
201612	1651	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	For these reasons, I think we should be careful not to get too far out ahead of budget developments in assessing what effect fiscal policy is likely to have on our actions.	13.0	65.0
201612	1652	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	It may be many months before the situation clarifies.	13.0	65.0
201612	1653	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	I think we should be careful not to overstate the implications of easier fiscal policy for the appropriate stance of monetary policy.	13.0	65.0
201612	1654	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Empirical studies of historical movements in federal debt and interest rates suggest that an increase in the deficit by 1 percent of GDP for 10 years raises longer-term interest rates roughly 30 to 40 basis points.	13.0	65.0
201612	1655	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	As the staff notes, a portion of this increase likely occurs via a higher term premium.	13.0	65.0
201612	1656	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	This means that the enactment of a package such as that penciled into the Tealbook should only modestly alter the path of the federal funds rate and its longer-term normal level.	13.0	65.0
201612	1657	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	As for the medium-term policy implications of easier fiscal policy, those will depend on the timing and composition of the package that’s passed; market reactions to its provisions; and the net effect of the resulting changes in taxes, government spending, and financial conditions on household and business spending.	13.0	65.0
201612	1658	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	But, unless the Congress passes something radically different than what seems likely at this point, I anticipate that gradual adjustments in the federal funds rate over time will still be appropriate.	13.0	65.0
201612	1659	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	As Don reported in his briefing, roughly half of you incorporated an assumption of greater fiscal stimulus into your SEP submissions this round.	13.0	65.0
201612	1660	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	On the basis of the comments that you provided and Don’s analysis, it appears that anticipated changes in fiscal policy were a factor accounting for some of the revisions to your projected funds rate path.	13.0	65.0
201612	1661	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	But overall, the revisions are really quite small.	13.0	65.0
201612	1662	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	I do plan to explain that if I’m asked about it at the press conference.	13.0	65.0
201612	1663	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	I will also note that many proposals for taxes and spending are currently being discussed, but there is considerable uncertainty about what the Congress may eventually pass, and that we do not intend to act preemptively based on guesses about future policy even though some of us have incorporated such guesses into our SEP submissions.	13.0	65.0
201612	1664	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, I will stress that fiscal policy is just one of many factors that influence real activity and inflation and, thus, the course of monetary policy over time.	13.0	65.0
201612	1665	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	I believe that an important objective in our communications in the months ahead should be to avoid leaving the public with the impression that we simply intend to act to offset any stimulus that fiscal policy may provide.	13.0	65.0
201612	1666	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Instead, I hope we will stress that we intend to carry out the task that the Congress has assigned to us—the pursuit of maximum employment and price stability—and we’ll adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in response to all of the factors that affect the economic outlook.	13.0	65.0
201612	1667	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Furthermore, although there may be broad principles pertaining to fiscal policy that we can articulate, such as the need to ensure long-run fiscal sustainability, the potential value of strengthening the automatic stabilizers, or the desirability of policies that would boost productivity growth, I would urge that we avoid commenting on particular tax and spending proposals under discussion, on the grounds that that’s the job of the Congress and the incoming Administration, whereas our job is monetary policy.	13.0	65.0
201612	1668	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there.	13.0	65.0
201612	1669	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	And I think we have time for Thomas to provide his monetary policy briefing.	13.0	65.0
201612	1670	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201612	1671	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for the Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21.0	999.0
201612	1672	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	With alternatives B and C, the Committee would announce that the evidence accumulated since the summer on progress toward the Committee’s employment and inflation objectives now makes a sufficiently strong case for an increase in the federal funds rate.	21.0	999.0
201612	1673	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	By contrast, with alternative A, the Committee would defer an increase today, while waiting to see further progress on its objectives.	21.0	999.0
201612	1674	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	A decision to maintain the current target range would come as a considerable surprise to financial market participants; over the intermeeting period, both the market-implied probability of a rate hike and the probability reported in the Desk surveys rose to above 90 percent.	21.0	999.0
201612	1675	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	While tomorrow’s decision may be clear, at least to market participants, the outlook for the economy and for monetary policy is now subject to considerable uncertainty stemming from the possibility of greater fiscal stimulus as well as other potential policy changes.	21.0	999.0
201612	1676	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The first four panels in my exhibit summarize how market participants’ expectations about the future path of the federal funds rate and the probability distribution associated with the expected values have changed since your previous meeting.	21.0	999.0
201612	1677	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	As shown in the upper-left panel, the expected path of the federal funds rate implied by OIS quotes—the black lines—has steepened noticeably since your November meeting.	21.0	999.0
201612	1678	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Of course, part of the shift in the OIS forward rate curve could reflect a rise in the term premium, which is assumed to be zero in this calculation.	21.0	999.0
201612	1679	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The red lines show the expected path of the federal funds rate after adjusting it for shifts in the term premium as estimated by the staff’s OIS term structure model that takes the effective lower bound into account.	21.0	999.0
201612	1680	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	That path has also revised up over the intermeeting period but by somewhat less than the OIS forward path.	21.0	999.0
201612	1681	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Investors thus generally appear to expect that the Committee will increase rates a bit faster—albeit still at a gradual pace—over the next two years than they thought earlier, and they are not likely to be surprised by the modest upward revision in the median SEP path.	21.0	999.0
201612	1682	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The black line in the panel to the right presents the evolution of the expected pace of tightening over the year starting tomorrow on the basis of market quotes, again not adjusted for term premiums.	21.0	999.0
201612	1683	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Expectations for the pace of tightening turned up noticeably following the elections and now stand just short of 50 basis points.	21.0	999.0
201612	1684	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	That roughly matches the pace of tightening over 2016 that markets expected at the time of last December’s meeting.	21.0	999.0
201612	1685	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Then, as now, expectations are for a gradual pace of tightening over the coming year—two rate hikes—compared with expectations for eight hikes over the year following the initial increase in the funds rate in June 2004.	21.0	999.0
201612	1686	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The middle two panels offer some perspective on how market participants’ views about potential outcomes for the federal funds rate over the next two years have changed since the time of your November meeting.	21.0	999.0
201612	1687	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	As is the case for the responses from the Desk surveys that Simon discussed earlier, the market-based probability distribution for the level of the funds rate at the end of 2017 has shifted to the right.	21.0	999.0
201612	1688	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The red line in the middle-right panel indicates that uncertainty about the level of the federal funds rate further out has increased, suggesting that investors’ views about outcomes for the economy—likely including, but not limited to, fiscal policy outcomes—have become more diffuse.	21.0	999.0
201612	1689	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The responses to the Desk surveys also indicated that market participants’ views about the outlook for fiscal policy cover a wide range of possibilities, and we have only a rough idea of what assumptions about fiscal policy and possibly other policies underlie recent movements in asset prices.	21.0	999.0
201612	1690	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Notwithstanding how speculative any assumption about the fiscal outlook has to be at this point, it is instructive to try to gauge the possible monetary policy implications of the greater fiscal stimulus assumed in the staff baseline projection.	21.0	999.0
201612	1691	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	An alternative scenario in the “Risks and Uncertainty” section of Tealbook A provided one perspective on this question.	21.0	999.0
201612	1692	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The bottom-left panel looks at the same question through the lens of the optimal control exercises that we presented in Tealbook B.	21.0	999.0
201612	1693	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	There, we showed a range of exercises reflecting monetary policy responses to fiscal scenarios under different policymaker strategies.	21.0	999.0
201612	1694	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	In this panel, the solid line plots the path of the federal funds rate under optimal control using the staff baseline assumptions about fiscal policy and a loss function in which policymakers place equal weights on keeping inflation close to 2 percent, keeping the unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate, and minimizing changes in the funds rate.	21.0	999.0
201612	1695	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	This policy calls for a somewhat faster pace of tightening than the staff’s baseline assumption.	21.0	999.0
201612	1696	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	For comparison, the dashed green line plots the optimal control simulation of the “No Fiscal Stimulus” scenario, which essentially tracks the optimal control simulation using the October staff projection as the baseline.	21.0	999.0
201612	1697	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The distance between the two lines shows the additional tightening that would have the effect of keeping the unemployment rate and inflation on roughly the same paths that we showed in the October baseline forecast.	21.0	999.0
201612	1698	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The federal funds rate in the optimal control simulation using the current staff projection as the baseline is 2½ percent at the end of 2017—36 basis points above the rate in the optimal control simulation based on the “No Fiscal Stimulus” scenario.	21.0	999.0
201612	1699	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	By 2020, when the funds rate peaks at 5¼ percent, it is about 1 percentage point above the “No Fiscal Stimulus” scenario.	21.0	999.0
201612	1700	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The bottom-right panel summarizes a number of important caveats associated with this analysis.	21.0	999.0
201612	1701	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	First, the prescriptions from optimal control are quite sensitive to the timing and other details of any fiscal package; the baseline assumptions are, no doubt, just one of a range of possibilities.	21.0	999.0
201612	1702	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	In addition, as we show in Tealbook B, the federal funds rate path depends importantly on which loss function is assumed.	21.0	999.0
201612	1703	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Another consideration is whether financial conditions will respond to fiscal policy changes as assumed in FRB/US.	21.0	999.0
201612	1704	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	We can’t be sure what revisions to the economic outlook underlie the adjustments in yields and asset prices since the election.	21.0	999.0
201612	1705	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	As the staff noted in the memo to the Committee on the “Market Reactions to the US Election Outcome,” some of the financial market responses seem to be broadly consistent with what we would have expected, in view of the changes to fiscal policy assumed in the staff projection, while others are more difficult to square.	21.0	999.0
201612	1706	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Finally, the optimal control simulations omit risk-management considerations near the effective lower bound, on the one hand, and potential risks associated with a possible nonlinear response to a substantial undershooting of the unemployment rate on the other.	21.0	999.0
201612	1707	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The broader message seems to be that there is heightened uncertainty about the outlook for the federal funds rate.	21.0	999.0
201612	1708	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	In these circumstances, the absence of revisions to paragraphs 2 and 4 in alternative B will likely be understood as the Committee sensibly withholding judgment on how the outlook for monetary policy may be affected.	21.0	999.0
201612	1709	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201612	1710	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	That completes my prepared remarks.	21.0	999.0
201612	1711	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The November statement and the draft alternatives and implementation notes are on pages 2 to 12 of the handout.	21.0	999.0
201612	1712	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for Thomas?	22.0	65.0
201612	1713	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	22.0	65.0
201612	1714	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22.0	94.0
201612	1715	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I’m looking at panel 2 here.	22.0	94.0
201612	1716	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I’m trying to understand the graph.	22.0	94.0
201612	1717	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	This looks like there would be a surprise due to our announcement tomorrow because this suggests that there would be three rate increases, is that right?	22.0	94.0
201612	1718	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Am I reading this correctly?	22.0	94.0
201612	1719	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The first thing I would note is that these are based on—I’ll give the technical term—“risk-neutral probabilities,” that is, there is no term premium adjustment.	22.0	999.0
201612	1720	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	So the levels are little hard to interpret.	22.0	999.0
201612	1721	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The point I tried to make is that the expectations obtained using this measure seem to be in a place similar to where they were a year ago.	22.0	999.0
201612	1722	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Well, your comment was that in 2004, at the time of the tightening, they expected 200 basis points, eight moves.	22.0	94.0
201612	1723	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes, if you take this exactly.	22.0	999.0
201612	1724	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And now they’re expecting 50 basis points, two moves.	22.0	94.0
201612	1725	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	According to this metric.	22.0	999.0
201612	1726	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And the SEP says three moves.	22.0	94.0
201612	1727	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes.	22.0	999.0
201612	1728	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	They haven’t seen the December SEP.	22.0	108.0
201612	1729	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	But, President Bullard, you’re saying it will be a surprise.	22.0	65.0
201612	1730	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	It would be a surprise.	22.0	94.0
201612	1731	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	That’s what I’m saying.	22.0	94.0
201612	1732	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Last year we showed four, and it stayed at 50, though.	22.0	96.0
201612	1733	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So it wasn’t like they moved.	22.0	96.0
201612	1734	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	And they were surprised; they came down.	22.0	91.0
201612	1735	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	I’d like to reemphasize the difficulty about term premiums.	22.0	999.0
201612	1736	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	We are looking here at term premiums at the one-year-ahead horizon, basically.	22.0	999.0
201612	1737	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	I think in 2004 we would have probably said these would be small and positive.	22.0	999.0
201612	1738	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	At this point, there is a great deal of uncertainty on this.	22.0	999.0
201612	1739	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Nonetheless, both term structure models and surveys indicate that actually there are negative term premiums, even at short horizons.	22.0	999.0
201612	1740	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	That would mean that if you corrected for that, as I do in the upper-left panel, if you take those estimates at face value, you really would think that what you read here as 50 basis points might well be 75 or more.	22.0	999.0
201612	1741	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	So I’d be cautious in interpreting the level as meaning that their expectation is too high.	22.0	999.0
201612	1742	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	22.0	94.0
201612	1743	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I have one other question on the bottom-left panel, “Federal Funds Rate Paths under Optimal Control.”	22.0	94.0
201612	1744	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The black line never goes below the green dotted line.	22.0	94.0
201612	1745	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	If I simulate this out 10 or 15 years, do they eventually cross, so that the effect is eventually neutral?	22.0	94.0
201612	1746	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Or is this just a permanent effect coming from fiscal policy?	22.0	94.0
201612	1747	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Eventually, they would converge.	22.0	999.0
201612	1748	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	They would not reverse the order, so the integral under the black line will be larger than the integral under the green dotted line.	22.0	999.0
201612	1749	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I noted that it takes quite a while.	22.0	94.0
201612	1750	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	True.	22.0	999.0
201612	1751	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	This is, again, the FRB/US model, with slow-moving dynamics and a lot of foresight built in.	22.0	999.0
201612	1752	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	22.0	94.0
201612	1753	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	22.0	65.0
201612	1754	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Thomas, do you calculate what r* is at each point along these paths?	22.0	108.0
201612	1755	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Along which paths?	22.0	999.0
201612	1756	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Let’s look at the bottom left, at the fifth panel.	22.0	108.0
201612	1757	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	We can always take two paths and compute the difference in the real federal funds rate that would keep the output gap closed at a point in time.	22.0	999.0
201612	1758	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	For example, in Tealbook B, we reported this time around that, by that metric, r* has been revised up about 30 basis points from last time.	22.0	999.0
201612	1759	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	In this chart?	22.0	108.0
201612	1760	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	This here is a little different because here we are applying optimal control to two different baselines.	22.0	999.0
201612	1761	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	But basically the calculation is very similar, yes.	22.0	999.0
201612	1762	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Along these paths, are we at 2 percent inflation?	22.0	108.0
201612	1763	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The deviation of inflation from baseline under any of these paths is very small—which means that inflation converges to 2 percent in a very similar way to how it does in the baseline.	22.0	999.0
201612	1764	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And we’re at full employment?	22.0	108.0
201612	1765	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Optimal control, as you know, with the equal weights loss function basically allows for much less undershooting of the unemployment rate than the baseline does.	22.0	999.0
201612	1766	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	So that’s what we show in Tealbook B—the standard loss function.	22.0	999.0
201612	1767	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The reason why these paths are higher than in the Tealbook baseline is that optimal control is, if you want, fighting the unemployment undershooting much more strongly.	22.0	999.0
201612	1768	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	22.0	108.0
201612	1769	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	22.0	108.0
201612	1771	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions?	52.0	65.0
201612	1772	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	52.0	65.0
201612	1773	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, why don’t we adjourn and resume our deliberations at 9:00 am December 14 Session .	52.0	65.0
201612	1774	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s get started.	52.0	65.0
201612	1775	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Before we start our go-round, I’d first like to call on Thomas to follow up on a point from yesterday.	12.0	65.0
201612	1776	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	999.0
201612	1777	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	President Lacker asked yesterday about the consistency between the staff’s estimate of the unrealized gain position in the SOMA portfolio at the end of November, which was reported on page 57 of Tealbook B as $121 billion, and the data Simon showed in panel 14 of his handout.	12.0	999.0
201612	1778	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	As mentioned in Tealbook B, the number reported there was a preliminary estimate.	12.0	999.0
201612	1779	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	And, in the period since the Tealbook closed, we have received new data that show that the unrealized gain position at the end of November was $81 billion—$40 billion lower than the preliminary estimate recorded in Tealbook B.	12.0	999.0
201612	1780	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Great.	12.0	81.0
201612	1781	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Thanks, I appreciate that.	12.0	81.0
201612	1782	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Let me next call on David Wilcox to discuss data.	11.0	65.0
201612	1783	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201612	1784	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	First, I’d like to call to your attention briefly the sheet of additional labor market statistics that are in front of you.	11.0	999.0
201612	1785	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	Last night, President Kashkari usefully called to my own attention the fact that, through a series of inadvertent circumstances, we hadn’t provided information on a demographic breakdown until now.	11.0	999.0
201612	1786	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	With regard to unemployment rates by race or ethnicity, it’s interesting to note that the unemployment rates for blacks, Hispanics, and whites are all back, essentially, where they were in the fourth quarter of 2007.	11.0	999.0
201612	1787	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	However, in level terms, of course, there remain wide differences in unemployment rates across these groups.	11.0	999.0
201612	1788	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	With regard to this morning’s retail sales release, our preliminary assessment is that the news is just a little softer than we had expected.	11.0	999.0
201612	1789	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	The portion of retail sales that the BEA uses for estimating real PCE increased 0.2 percent in November, which was one-tenth less than we had expected, and there was a downward revision of one-tenth to this category of sales in October.	11.0	999.0
201612	1790	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	All told, though, this is a small forecast error.	11.0	999.0
201612	1791	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	And, relative to our expectation, we would take about one-tenth off our estimate of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter, leaving our estimate of fourth-quarter GDP growth at about 1½ percent.	11.0	999.0
201612	1792	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any questions for David?	12.0	65.0
201612	1793	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	12.0	65.0
201612	1794	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12.0	65.0
201612	1795	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Then why don’t we begin our go-round on policy, starting with President Rosengren?	23.0	65.0
201612	1796	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201612	1797	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B.	23.0	90.0
201612	1798	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	The market fully expects an increase at this meeting, and our statement at the November meeting set the stage for an increase.	23.0	90.0
201612	1799	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Failure to proceed to take action at this meeting would seriously undermine our efforts to communicate clearly our intentions and the rationale for policy action.	23.0	90.0
201612	1800	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	As I noted yesterday, my SEP submission has four increases in the federal funds rate in 2017, giving a pattern quite similar to the Tealbook’s federal funds rate path for next year.	23.0	90.0
201612	1801	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	With the unemployment rate falling well below my estimate of full employment and inflation only somewhat below our 2 percent target, we should be indicating that the baseline case for monetary policy will be for normalizing at a gradual but more regular pace.	23.0	90.0
201612	1802	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	At this time, my preferred path would involve tightening at every other meeting.	23.0	90.0
201612	1803	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Indeed, while fiscal stimulus would have been much preferred earlier in the cycle, positive fiscal surprises will likely require us to normalize monetary policy even more quickly.	23.0	90.0
201612	1804	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201612	1805	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201612	1806	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23.0	65.0
201612	1807	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	102.0
201612	1808	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	I support alternative B as written.	23.0	102.0
201612	1809	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	As I noted yesterday, it seems likely that greater fiscal stimulus will boost aggregate demand and inflation toward the end of next year and beyond.	23.0	102.0
201612	1810	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, there remains a great deal of uncertainty about the size, the composition and timing, and the effects of fiscal stimulus.	23.0	102.0
201612	1811	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	In addition, there are potential changes for trade, immigration, and regulatory policies.	23.0	102.0
201612	1812	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	But all of that can be set aside.	23.0	102.0
201612	1813	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Today’s decision stands on its own.	23.0	102.0
201612	1814	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	On the basis of past progress on our goals and the intermeeting data, there’s already compelling evidence in hand to support this move.	23.0	102.0
201612	1815	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ve reached full employment with continued solid momentum, and we’re poised to run a hot labor market for the next couple of years at least.	23.0	102.0
201612	1816	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Inflation has also picked up and is closing in on our target.	23.0	102.0
201612	1817	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Against this background, the rate increase in alternative B is an appropriate small step in the process of removing monetary accommodation.	23.0	102.0
201612	1818	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	In light of the uncertainty about future fiscal and other policy actions by the next Congress and the incoming Administration, we should stand pat for the time being in terms of the forward-guidance language in paragraph 4.	23.0	102.0
201612	1819	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	If fiscal policy ends up being appreciably more expansionary, at future meetings, we may need to modify the “only gradual” phrase describing the likely pace of rate increases.	23.0	102.0
201612	1820	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	In that regard, I found the proposed language in alternative C replacing “only gradual” with “additional gradual” unsatisfactory and potentially confusing, especially since “additional” may sound like a continuation of our practice of one rate hike per year.	23.0	102.0
201612	1821	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	This discussion of how best to modify the language can wait until we have greater clarity on fiscal and other policies next year.	23.0	102.0
201612	1822	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23.0	102.0
201612	1823	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201612	1824	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23.0	65.0
201612	1825	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	81.0
201612	1826	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I support an increase in the funds rate target and alternative B.	23.0	81.0
201612	1827	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I expect that’ll be the consensus view, so I’m going to talk about the future path of policy.	23.0	81.0
201612	1828	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	The current draft of alternative B continues to predict only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.	23.0	81.0
201612	1829	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I think there are now good reasons to question whether we should continue to have as much confidence that rate increases will be gradual.	23.0	81.0
201612	1830	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	For some time now, I’ve argued that we should pay heed to the fact that our policy benchmarks are so far above the current level of the funds rate target.	23.0	81.0
201612	1831	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I applaud inclusion of the Taylor rule prescriptions in the handout yesterday and hope we can include Taylor rule calculations, such as appear in the Tealbook, in the Monetary Policy Report to the Congress next time we draft that.	23.0	81.0
201612	1832	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Those benchmarks continue to rise, and increasing the funds rate target at a pace as gradual as two or three quarter points a year is unlikely to close the gap at a satisfactory rate, in my view.	23.0	81.0
201612	1833	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	There’s little doubt we’re at full employment, and, as a result, I think it’s increasingly important for us to pick up the pace of tightening.	23.0	81.0
201612	1834	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	This argument is reinforced by the memo on unemployment-rate undershooting.	23.0	81.0
201612	1835	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	As I noted yesterday, in the only domestic episode featuring a soft landing, the FOMC raised the funds rate 300 basis points.	23.0	81.0
201612	1836	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	The four previous undershoots in the historical record resulted in inflation increasing, sometimes quite sharply.	23.0	81.0
201612	1837	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I think it’s noteworthy that the 1994 episode has been identified as the first instance of preemptive rate increases.	23.0	81.0
201612	1838	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Another factor establishing our credibility in 1994, arguably, was that the new Administration at the time chose to respect the Fed’s monetary policy independence.	23.0	81.0
201612	1839	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	This was something of a break from the practice of previous Administrations, going back to Lyndon Johnson’s in 1965, of being willing to exert pressure on the Federal Reserve to adopt more stimulative policies.	23.0	81.0
201612	1840	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I thought Vice Chairman Dudley was right yesterday to point out that our risks are likely to involve compromises to our credibility, and that we’re not really modeling those in a coherent way.	23.0	81.0
201612	1841	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Those are outside our usual modeling practice.	23.0	81.0
201612	1842	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	An Administration that’s willing to discard the 25-year-old precedent of White House respect for the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy independence strikes me as capable of contributing to a loss of credibility.	23.0	81.0
201612	1843	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	The abrupt shift in circumstances since our November meeting suggests skepticism about gradualism as well.	23.0	81.0
201612	1844	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	While the details of fiscal policy are obviously pretty uncertain, the indications are that fiscal policy will be, if anything, more expansionary, perhaps significantly more than we expected at the November meeting.	23.0	81.0
201612	1845	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	There’s no question that greater fiscal stimulus implies higher real interest rates.	23.0	81.0
201612	1846	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	There was some discussion of that yesterday.	23.0	81.0
201612	1847	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Indeed, in the Tealbook, the staff has marked up its assumed path of r*.	23.0	81.0
201612	1848	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	And if the fiscal policy outlook leads to expected higher real interest rates, which I think are clearly warranted, then our estimates of r* should increase.	23.0	81.0
201612	1849	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	That implies we’ll have an even larger policy gap to close over time, so we will need to move even more rapidly.	23.0	81.0
201612	1850	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	The post-election movement in market readings on future inflation also argues for less gradual rate increases.	23.0	81.0
201612	1851	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Of course, these market reactions aren’t independent of anticipated fiscal policy.	23.0	81.0
201612	1852	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	But our expectation that rate increases would be only gradual was grounded in part on low readings on inflation and inflation expectations and the sense that the downside risks were elevated.	23.0	81.0
201612	1853	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Inflation has moved up over the course of the year, and, since the election, there’s been a significant increase in financial market measures of expected inflation.	23.0	81.0
201612	1854	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	As I noted yesterday, evidence from options and term premiums indicates that investors believe the downside risks to inflation are diminishing and the risks to the upside are becoming more salient.	23.0	81.0
201612	1855	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	It’s as if the inflation outlook is in the process of “coming about,” to use a nautical term.	23.0	81.0
201612	1856	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	So I think a strong case can be made that we may soon need increases in our policy rate that do not qualify as gradual.	23.0	81.0
201612	1857	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	And, if so, I support President Williams’s suggestion that we start thinking about how to back away from the “gradual” language in our statement.	23.0	81.0
201612	1858	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	81.0
201612	1859	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201612	1860	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23.0	65.0
201612	1861	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201612	1862	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I favor alternative B.	23.0	97.0
201612	1863	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	As I tried to explain yesterday, my views on labor markets have evolved over the past several months because of what I’ve seen happening in labor markets.	23.0	97.0
201612	1864	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I think a number of metrics assessed individually— and, certainly, labor market conditions as a whole—suggest that we’re fairly far along in the process of removing slack.	23.0	97.0
201612	1865	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I think some slack probably does remain in the labor market, but, even after today’s rate increase, we will still have an accommodative monetary policy, which I think will appropriately continue to support further increases in jobs and wages.	23.0	97.0
201612	1866	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I’m a little less certain about the inflation target.	23.0	97.0
201612	1867	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	My SEP actually doesn’t get to 2 percent during the course of the next four years.	23.0	97.0
201612	1868	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	But, as I indicated yesterday, conditional on that projection, I think the risks are on the upside.	23.0	97.0
201612	1869	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	So I should say that I’m not today going along reluctantly.	23.0	97.0
201612	1870	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I actually am convinced that this is the right policy move.	23.0	97.0
201612	1871	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	As we go forward, I think that, for now, a continued posture of gradualism is the right position for us to take.	23.0	97.0
201612	1872	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Continuing considerations include the fact that we are still relatively close to the effective lower bound.	23.0	97.0
201612	1873	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	And, as many of us have been saying for some time now, the resulting asymmetry in the tools available to us pushes me a little bit, at least, toward being cautious about rate increases, because anything that would increase the likelihood of a recession seems to me to present more problems.	23.0	97.0
201612	1874	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	On external risks, I think President Williams said yesterday that there are some upside risks internationally, with a prospect of somewhat better economic growth in some countries.	23.0	97.0
201612	1875	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	But those will be pretty incremental upside risks, if they are realized.	23.0	97.0
201612	1876	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I think the downside risks that are out there would be risks of something substantially more negative—whether it be European banking problems, which produce stress in financial markets around the world; China facing significant problems because of its debt overhang; or any number of geopolitical circumstances that could go negative over the course of the next year or so.	23.0	97.0
201612	1877	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Those seem to me to pose negative risks of a magnitude that is substantially greater than the nontrivial likelihood of some upside surprises on underlying economic growth trends.	23.0	97.0
201612	1878	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Moreover, as Governor Fischer and others explained in some detail yesterday, the uncertainty on what will happen—not just with fiscal policy, but also with the policies of the incoming Administration and the Congress more generally—seems to me to counsel some patience before we decide that there’s going to be fiscal stimulus and therefore, in an anticipatory fashion, a need to act on it.	23.0	97.0
201612	1879	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to the memo by Aaronson and others, I’ll just say again that I think a fair reading of that memo suggests only two strong conclusions: first, it depends a lot on underlying circumstances; and, second, it depends a lot on the luck of the external shock, if I can put it that way.	23.0	97.0
201612	1880	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	And I would have loved to have drawn the conclusions that I was leaning toward 6, 8, and 10 months ago.	23.0	97.0
201612	1881	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think it fairly supports that.	23.0	97.0
201612	1882	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think it supports conclusions in the other direction, either—that the risks of overshooting are high, and that we have to move in a very strong preemptive fashion.	23.0	97.0
201612	1883	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Having said all of that, I do think the decisions we’ll have before us could get more difficult fairly quickly.	23.0	97.0
201612	1884	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	While the lower-bound and external risk considerations may remain, we may see a continued tightening of labor markets and may see some pickup in inflation, which just, in the internal considerations of the economy as we’re currently observing it, might counsel further rate increases.	23.0	97.0
201612	1885	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	And, obviously, if we see some clarification of policy directions that would suggest further stimulus, I do think the effort to balance those two sets of considerations will, for me at least, become more difficult and might—and I underline “might”—require at some point the change in the language that President Williams was referring to.	23.0	97.0
201612	1886	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201612	1887	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201612	1888	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23.0	65.0
201612	1889	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	103.0
201612	1890	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	I support alternative B.	23.0	103.0
201612	1891	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	The unemployment rate will likely reach the Committee’s estimate of its longer-run level this quarter, and core PCE inflation has moved up.	23.0	103.0
201612	1892	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	With tightening labor market conditions and rising inflation, achieving a sustainable pace of employment growth and stable prices requires gradually raising the federal funds rate.	23.0	103.0
201612	1893	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Soft landings are uncommon.	23.0	103.0
201612	1894	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	In the few successful examples noted by the Board staff’s analysis, monetary policy acted preemptively, beginning to tighten before the unemployment rate fell below the natural level.	23.0	103.0
201612	1895	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Today the unemployment rate has already reached most estimates of the natural rate, with a negative real federal funds rate and extremely gradual moves to normalize monetary policy.	23.0	103.0
201612	1896	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	As we look to our policy choices next year, the risk that a more expansionary fiscal policy could necessitate a faster-than-expected pace of policy tightening warrants consideration in two ways, I think.	23.0	103.0
201612	1897	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	First, thinking about the March SEP, I wonder if we should consider adopting a common assumption for fiscal policy.	23.0	103.0
201612	1898	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	This could help the public interpret the projections and could make it easier to explain changes in the SEP at the press conference.	23.0	103.0
201612	1899	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Along these lines, adding some measure of uncertainty, as the subcommittee on communications discussed in its recent memo, might also be helpful.	23.0	103.0
201612	1900	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Second, we might have to reframe our strategies regarding the balance sheet.	23.0	103.0
201612	1901	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Under current fiscal policy, we project a gradual path of the federal funds rate and have associated it with a large balance sheet.	23.0	103.0
201612	1902	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	However, a higher path would bring forward the time when policy normalization is well under way.	23.0	103.0
201612	1903	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	To better manage expectations, the Committee might clarify what “well under way” means.	23.0	103.0
201612	1904	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	In my view, we will be well under way when the target range of the funds rate reaches between 1 and 1¼ percent.	23.0	103.0
201612	1905	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	The views of other participants could be captured by including a question in the next SEP about the appropriate level of the federal funds rate to cease reinvestments.	23.0	103.0
201612	1906	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	This would be similar to the previous special question about the date at which participants judged that an increase in the funds rate would first become appropriate.	23.0	103.0
201612	1907	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	23.0	103.0
201612	1908	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201612	1909	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	23.0	65.0
201612	1910	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201612	1911	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Reflecting my view that there remains, essentially, no slack in the labor market and the observation that inflation continues to move closer to target, I am very supportive of alternative B.	23.0	999.0
201612	1912	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Financial markets are expecting an increase in rates and have essentially priced in a removal of policy accommodation.	23.0	999.0
201612	1913	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Regarding the forward-guidance language, I worry that markets have come to interpret “gradual” as meaning one or perhaps two rate hikes per year.	23.0	999.0
201612	1914	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	A look at the federal funds futures market lends some credence to my concern, and I think it would be useful to start contemplating a different characterization of future policy, as others have said.	23.0	999.0
201612	1915	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	In light of the overall weakness of trend growth that I alluded to yesterday, as well as the increased economic uncertainty, I am in favor of removing accommodation quite gradually.	23.0	999.0
201612	1916	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	But I am worried that our language may suggest that this means fewer rate hikes than many of us view as appropriate.	23.0	999.0
201612	1917	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201612	1918	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201612	1919	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23.0	65.0
201612	1920	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201612	1921	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	I support alternative B.	23.0	91.0
201612	1922	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	I think a 25 basis point move today is appropriate in light of the continued gains in labor markets, the modest improvement in the inflation outlook, and our communications that virtually promised a rate increase this year unless there was a clear softening in economic activity.	23.0	91.0
201612	1923	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	I also believe it best that we continue to communicate our view that conditions are likely to evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the funds rate.	23.0	91.0
201612	1924	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Paragraph 4, as written, still works for me.	23.0	91.0
201612	1925	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Although I believe the odds of returning to the effective lower bound have diminished somewhat, these risks are still notable and likely to remain so for some time.	23.0	91.0
201612	1926	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	So the zero-lower- bound risk management still argues for a shallow policy rate path and instilling strong confidence that the FOMC will live up to our symmetric inflation objective.	23.0	91.0
201612	1927	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	As I mentioned yesterday, my current appropriate policy rate path has two 25 basis point increases in 2017.	23.0	91.0
201612	1928	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	I hope, as we move through next year, that private-sector fundamentals will remain sound and we will have a better idea about the fiscal policy picture.	23.0	91.0
201612	1929	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	And, down the road, we could see changes in the outlook that would dictate a steeper path of rates that I would readily support, but that’s for future meetings.	23.0	91.0
201612	1930	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201612	1931	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201612	1932	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23.0	65.0
201612	1933	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201612	1934	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	It’s December, and it’s an FOMC meeting.	23.0	999.0
201612	1935	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Am I the only one who has a sense of déjà vu around the table?	23.0	999.0
201612	1936	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	[Laughter]	23.0	999.0
201612	1937	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	In light of the progress made toward our goals and the medium-run outlook as well as the risks associated with the outlook, I support a 25 basis point increase of the federal funds rate target at this meeting, and I believe economic developments make a compelling case for this change even apart from a higher likelihood of some fiscal policy stimulus to come.	23.0	999.0
201612	1938	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	I can support alternative B as written.	23.0	999.0
201612	1939	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	At this point, it seems sensible to make few changes in the statement.	23.0	999.0
201612	1940	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Indeed, on that score, I’d make one suggestion.	23.0	999.0
201612	1941	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	In the penultimate line in paragraph 1, why not just add the word “considerably” rather than also changing “but remain low” to “but still are low”?	23.0	999.0
201612	1942	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	So that part of the sentence would read “Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved up considerably but remain low.”	23.0	999.0
201612	1943	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	In paragraph 3, I am interpreting the change from “further improvement” to “further strengthening” as a change from a normative locution to a positive one.	23.0	999.0
201612	1944	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	That makes sense at this point, with the unemployment rate near, or even below, many estimates of the full-employment rate.	23.0	999.0
201612	1945	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	This language acknowledges that if the labor market gets too overheated, this shouldn’t be interpreted as an improvement.	23.0	999.0
201612	1946	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	But I do think this change is pretty subtle, so I’m not sure how it’ll be interpreted.	23.0	999.0
201612	1947	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	As I said, I understand the argument for making few changes in the statement today, but I do think there are looming policy and communications challenges we’ll need to confront sooner rather than later.	23.0	999.0
201612	1948	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Like some others, I think we do need to find a way to step back from the “gradual path” language.	23.0	999.0
201612	1949	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	As I recall, the language was introduced to signal that, when normalization started, we didn’t anticipate raising rates at each and every meeting, as we did from mid-2004 to mid-2006.	23.0	999.0
201612	1950	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	That’s still true, but I don’t think “gradual” is necessarily being interpreted in the same way anymore.	23.0	999.0
201612	1951	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Indeed, the issue has been that the market has been anticipating a much shallower path of policy than we are.	23.0	999.0
201612	1952	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	If the public’s new interpretation of “gradual” is one hike per year, as we did for the past two years, then the path we anticipate is no longer gradual.	23.0	999.0
201612	1953	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Moreover, there are a number of risks that, if realized, might entail a different policy rate path from that we currently anticipate.	23.0	999.0
201612	1954	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	I suspect that over the next two years, we may need to change our forecasts and our anticipated policy rate path more frequently than we’ve done in the past couple of years.	23.0	999.0
201612	1955	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	For one thing, some clarity concerning fiscal and other economic policies will likely be forthcoming.	23.0	999.0
201612	1956	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	We will need to incorporate that information into our outlook for the medium run.	23.0	999.0
201612	1957	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	We’ll also need to assess what, if any, effect these policy changes might have on longer-run structural aspects of the economy, including productivity growth and the equilibrium interest rate.	23.0	999.0
201612	1958	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Like others, I found the Board staff’s memo on soft landings quite interesting.	23.0	999.0
201612	1959	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	They were able to find a couple of examples, but the common characteristics were, one, that monetary policy was preemptive and began to tighten before the unemployment rate fell below real-time estimates of the natural rate; and, two, that the shocks that hit the economy once it slowed were either small or beneficial.	23.0	999.0
201612	1960	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	The unemployment rate is now below most estimates of the natural rate.	23.0	999.0
201612	1961	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	So, arguably, it is difficult to characterize our current policy stance as necessarily preemptive, and I don’t think we can or should count on positive shocks.	23.0	999.0
201612	1962	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	This suggests we need to remain vigilant against falling “behind the curve.”	23.0	999.0
201612	1963	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	We may need to be less inertial than we’ve been.	23.0	999.0
201612	1964	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	We need to be open to 50 basis point increases if necessary and to ending reinvestments sooner than currently anticipated.	23.0	999.0
201612	1965	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	At the same time, there are downside risks, too, including the prospect that financial market participants’ expectations could swiftly shift if they’re disappointed by the set of policies coming from the Administration and the Congress, as well as the possibility of increased geopolitical tensions.	23.0	999.0
201612	1966	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	The aim is not to offset fiscal policy.	23.0	999.0
201612	1967	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Instead, the aim is to position monetary policy to achieve our dual-mandate goals.	23.0	999.0
201612	1968	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	This necessarily means taking into account how the economic environment, including fiscal policy, is changing to the extent that those changes affect our ability to achieve our goals.	23.0	999.0
201612	1969	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	For us, it seems important to me that we continue to de-emphasize discussion of short-run fluctuations in our communications and emphasize that our policy choices are driven by our assessment of what policy is appropriate to achieve our dual-mandate goals.	23.0	999.0
201612	1970	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	If I’m right that our anticipated policy rate path may need to change more often, then we face a challenge in communicating that these changes are being driven by a systematic assessment of progress relative to our goals and not because we are reacting to short-run fluctuations in the data and behaving in a discretionary manner without a framework, of which we are increasingly being accused.	23.0	999.0
201612	1971	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	It’ll be helpful for us to continue to work toward clarifying the degree of uncertainty regarding our current assessment of the likely future path of policy, in view of the uncertainty associated with the forecast and the inevitable shocks that will hit the economy.	23.0	999.0
201612	1972	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Now, because I’ve stopped reading and watching the news [laughter]—that happened about a month ago—I have some time on my hands, so I’ve been reading a bit of Federal Reserve history.	23.0	999.0
201612	1973	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Let me continue by pointing out something that former Chairman Alan Greenspan once said about monetary policy:  “There is no alternative to basing actions on forecasts, at least implicitly.	23.0	999.0
201612	1974	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	It means that often we need to tighten or ease before the need for action is evident to the public at large, and that policy may have to reverse course from time to time as the underlying forces acting on the economy shift.	23.0	999.0
201612	1975	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	This process is not easy to get right at all times, and it is often difficult to convey to the American people, whose support is essential to our mission.”	23.0	999.0
201612	1976	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Greenspan made these remarks 20 years ago, almost to the day, and they strike me as just as relevant today as they were then.	23.0	999.0
201612	1977	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201612	1978	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201612	1979	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23.0	65.0
201612	1980	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201612	1981	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	I believe that it’s appropriate for the Committee to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, and I support alternative B as written.	23.0	104.0
201612	1982	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Employment growth continues strong, unemployment is at or below the natural rate, and output is expanding moderately and above potential.	23.0	104.0
201612	1983	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Inflation is gradually increasing a little faster than forecast.	23.0	104.0
201612	1984	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Market-based measures of inflation expectations have moved up, and we haven’t been this close to our dual-mandate target since the mid-2000s and, before that, the mid- 1990s.	23.0	104.0
201612	1985	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	I revised up my SEP path of the federal funds target slightly, with three increases next year instead of two.	23.0	104.0
201612	1986	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	That seems to me to be justified by the strengthening of the unemployment gap and the performance of inflation.	23.0	104.0
201612	1987	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The expectation of more accommodative fiscal policy should also support economic growth and ensure against weaker outcomes.	23.0	104.0
201612	1988	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	My SEP path is still a gradual one that accommodates an extended period of unemployment in the mid- and low 4s, a bit below current estimates of the natural rate—what I would call a warm labor market.	23.0	104.0
201612	1989	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	I see this as appropriate, and, in fact, I had hoped that we would get to this point.	23.0	104.0
201612	1990	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	But getting here now means that the risks are two sided.	23.0	104.0
201612	1991	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Depending on their size and other characteristics, fiscal easing measures could put further downward pressure on unemployment and upward pressure on inflation and economic growth.	23.0	104.0
201612	1992	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	We’ve also had extraordinary changes in asset prices and significant improvements in survey measures of business and household confidence, and it may well be that all of these factors come together to make a case for a faster pace of tightening and appropriate language changes in the statement.	23.0	104.0
201612	1993	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	That case is yet to be made, but it’s certainly plausible that it may be made.	23.0	104.0
201612	1994	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201612	1995	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201612	1996	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23.0	65.0
201612	1997	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201612	1998	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	I support the policy action in alternative B and the suggested statement with its minimal changes in guidance.	23.0	88.0
201612	1999	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	In view of uncertainty about the timing of the next step, I think it would be a good idea not to provide much forward guidance at this stage.	23.0	88.0
201612	2000	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Lying low is, in my opinion, the right communications posture coming out of this meeting.	23.0	88.0
201612	2001	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	However, as I prefaced in my comments in the economics go-round, there could be communications dilemmas building.	23.0	88.0
201612	2002	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	At some point over the coming months, the Committee will likely have to consider alternative scenarios along the lines of the “Larger Fiscal Stimulus” scenarios presented in the Tealbook.	23.0	88.0
201612	2003	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	There are, of course, many “what-ifs” at this point, but, with a little more clarity, I’m thinking it would be a good idea to discuss and anticipate how the Committee might respond under various circumstances.	23.0	88.0
201612	2004	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	A steeper path of the policy rate, at least steeper than reflected in this meeting’s SEP, may be called for because of realized or projected fiscal policy effects.	23.0	88.0
201612	2005	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	There is a realistic chance a steeper path of the policy rate will be interpreted, perhaps appropriately, as offsetting fiscal policy.	23.0	88.0
201612	2006	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Much could be made of this seemingly adversarial stance of policy.	23.0	88.0
201612	2007	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	The Chair commented yesterday on how she plans to deal with questions in the press conference.	23.0	88.0
201612	2008	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	For my part, I think it would be wise to get ahead of this contingency and to make efforts to explain the FOMC’s and monetary policy’s relationship to fiscal policy.	23.0	88.0
201612	2009	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	In light of the difficulty that the Committee has experienced with crafting a statement that adequately captures the consensus thinking about future policy, this anticipatory communication probably would best be done in speeches and the Chair’s subsequent press conferences.	23.0	88.0
201612	2010	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	As I leave the Committee, I’d like to offer one more piece of free advice for your future assessments of the economy.	23.0	88.0
201612	2011	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	It seems to me that a lesson of the recent electoral cycle and the outcome of the election is the public’s differential experiencing of the economy across geography, the urban–rural spectrum, and cohorts defined by educational attainment.	23.0	88.0
201612	2012	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	I applaud the addition of the content in the staff briefing for these meetings that shows employment and unemployment differences by ethnicity, as we got this morning.	23.0	88.0
201612	2013	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	It strikes me that this reporting can go further in order to ensure the Committee has a good grasp of the ground-level effects of its policies in several dimensions.	23.0	88.0
201612	2014	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	This is not to suggest that monetary policy can or should take on distributional questions—it’s just to suggest that knowing more about the texture of economic experience across the population would be constructive.	23.0	88.0
201612	2015	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201612	2016	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201612	2017	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23.0	65.0
201612	2018	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201612	2019	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	When I started writing this, I was sure it would be two paragraphs, but, unfortunately, it turns out to be much more.	23.0	108.0
201612	2020	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	I, too, support alternative B, which I think is the first time I’ve ever said that, because I assumed it was taken for granted each time in the past.	23.0	108.0
201612	2021	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Now, before I start, I’d also like to introduce an almost irrelevant footnote.	23.0	108.0
201612	2022	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Dan emphasized the fact that, when pushing a high-pressure economy succeeded, it was other things that happened that made for the success.	23.0	108.0
201612	2023	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	There’s a very famous book among development economists written by Albert Hirschman, who was asked to evaluate projects of the World Bank.	23.0	108.0
201612	2024	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	He was given 10 of their large projects—this was a long time ago—to evaluate.	23.0	108.0
201612	2025	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	The result was that a little over half of them were successful.	23.0	108.0
201612	2026	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	The other result was that almost none of them went according to plan, and the successes didn’t have much to do with the plan but had to do with the improvisation that happened in the course of the project when it started going off track.	23.0	108.0
201612	2027	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And I think that tells us that you’ve got to be alive to changing circumstances.	23.0	108.0
201612	2028	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	So the fact that things happened elsewhere could have led to success or, if they’d been ignored, would probably have led to failure.	23.0	108.0
201612	2029	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	That, too, needs attention.	23.0	108.0
201612	2030	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	I’ll now turn to this topic.	23.0	108.0
201612	2031	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	If the incoming Administration changes economic policy in several areas as radically as promised during the election campaign, we will, in retrospect, view today’s interest rate decision as the last of an era.	23.0	108.0
201612	2032	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And, if so, we will have to develop an approach to making monetary policy in a setting of much greater nonmonetary policy uncertainty than we’ve had to deal with in recent years.	23.0	108.0
201612	2033	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	The decision to raise the federal funds rate 25 basis points is appropriate for the current state of the economy and in light of policy decisions and statements we’ve made in the period leading up to this meeting.	23.0	108.0
201612	2034	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And yesterday’s discussion made a compelling case for implementing the decision that the markets and the public expect.	23.0	108.0
201612	2035	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	The argument can be put very simply:  Both inflation and unemployment are very close to their dual-mandate targets.	23.0	108.0
201612	2036	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	We may be somewhat overshooting, by which I mean undershooting the natural rate of unemployment, and we expect very gradually to reach our 2 percent PCE inflation target.	23.0	108.0
201612	2037	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Further, it was clear yesterday that most of us believe there is a serious risk we might overshoot both targets, and that the time has therefore come to raise the federal funds rate.	23.0	108.0
201612	2038	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Well, that’s it with respect to this decision, but we need also to send signals about future FOMC policy.	23.0	108.0
201612	2039	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	At the certainty of repeating myself, the main message we need to send is that our monetary policy decisions will be made with the goal of achieving and maintaining the dual mandate.	23.0	108.0
201612	2040	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Well, that’s easy to say, but it’s not sufficient guidance to spell out the path that we expect the federal funds rate to follow.	23.0	108.0
201612	2041	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Tealbook B gives us a rich choice among alternative policies, so let me highlight a few of the results shown in the “Monetary Policy Strategies” section of Tealbook B and ask a few questions.	23.0	108.0
201612	2042	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	First, in terms of the charts on page 2 of Tealbook B, the staff projection shows large changes in interest rates by 2022.	23.0	108.0
201612	2043	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	These changes make much less difference to inflation in the next two years than they do over the longer period—that is, the Phillips curve is very flat.	23.0	108.0
201612	2044	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	There was an appeal yesterday for further work on whether the Phillips curve remains flat even as unemployment falls very low, and that is an important request.	23.0	108.0
201612	2045	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Second, the GDP gap seems quite sensitive to fiscal policy, which also means that the staff projection is very Keynesian.	23.0	108.0
201612	2046	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Well, that follows from the flat Phillips curve.	23.0	108.0
201612	2047	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	The simple policy rule simulations on page 4 show that the different policy rules have a much greater effect on unemployment than they do on inflation, in accordance with the way a Keynesian model works.	23.0	108.0
201612	2048	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Third, we do not, in practice, follow the interest rate paths shown for five years out.	23.0	108.0
201612	2049	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Starting three months from now, we’ll have moved on to a new set of projections.	23.0	108.0
201612	2050	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	That means we must be using the staff’s projections mainly for interest rates in the relatively near future.	23.0	108.0
201612	2051	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Or am I wrong, and do the projections five years out make much difference to what we do today?	23.0	108.0
201612	2052	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Fourth, I was struck by the box on page 2, which shows the projected medium-term equilibrium real federal funds rate.	23.0	108.0
201612	2053	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	In the second bullet point on page 3, the staff draws attention to the fact that, at 1.16 percent, FRB/US r* is well above the average level of the real federal funds rate in the 12 quarters of the projection that it takes to get the output gap to zero.	23.0	108.0
201612	2054	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	The average level of the real federal funds rate in the 12 quarters is 10 basis points.	23.0	108.0
201612	2055	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	That’s quite a large difference, because there are certainly some interest rates on that path that are well below 10 basis points.	23.0	108.0
201612	2056	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	What is the significance of that—that we really aren’t planning on or should plan on moving the real funds rate around a lot more than we think we should?	23.0	108.0
201612	2057	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	A question.	23.0	108.0
201612	2058	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Fifth, the optimal control simulations show just how important are the relative weights we put on inflation and unemployment in the loss function, which leads to my final question for today.	23.0	108.0
201612	2059	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	If the alternative simulations are a basis for choosing policy rates, what should guide that choice?	23.0	108.0
201612	2060	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Is it how much we like the charts?	23.0	108.0
201612	2061	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Or, to put the question differently, do we compute the value of the utility function on each path we examine, which is fairly difficult because we change the utility function among some of the paths?	23.0	108.0
201612	2062	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	But if we don’t compute the value of the utility function, why not?	23.0	108.0
201612	2063	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Finally, what should we tell the markets and the public?	23.0	108.0
201612	2064	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Well, early this morning, I was thinking, “Gee, I wonder if I can reproduce what the Chair said yesterday.”	23.0	108.0
201612	2065	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And then the following thought struck me: “Well, there is e-mail, and the Chair reads her e-mail 24 hours a day [laughter], so I’ll send her a note.”	23.0	108.0
201612	2066	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And she agreed that I could quote her.	23.0	108.0
201612	2067	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	So I will conclude by quoting what the Chair said yesterday—with her permission, she says.	23.0	108.0
201612	2068	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	23.0	108.0
201612	2069	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	It’s true.	23.0	65.0
201612	2070	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	You have my permission.	23.0	65.0
201612	2071	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	She said, “I will... note that many proposals for taxes and spending are currently being discussed, but there is considerable uncertainty about what the Congress may eventually pass, and that we do not intend to act preemptively based on guesses about future policy....	23.0	108.0
201612	2072	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Moreover, I will stress that fiscal policy is just one of many factors that influence real activity and inflation and, thus, the course of monetary policy over time.	23.0	108.0
201612	2073	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Instead I hope we will stress that we intend to carry out the task that the Congress has assigned to us, the pursuit of maximum employment and price stability, and we’ll adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in response to all of the factors that affect the economic outlook.”	23.0	108.0
201612	2074	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201612	2075	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And thank you.	23.0	108.0
201612	2076	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201612	2077	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	And, Governor Fischer, regarding the questions that you posed, did you want to have a response?	23.0	65.0
201612	2078	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	I think they’re questions we need to discuss at more length as we think through the policymaking process and what relationship there is between what’s in Tealbook B and what we actually decide.	23.0	108.0
201612	2079	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23.0	65.0
201612	2080	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201612	2081	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	23.0	65.0
201612	2082	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201612	2083	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	I support alternative B as written.	23.0	110.0
201612	2084	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	I continue to believe that removal of accommodation should be done gradually.	23.0	110.0
201612	2085	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	I submitted three increases in the federal funds rate in my SEP submission for 2017.	23.0	110.0
201612	2086	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Having said that, I think the risk of undershooting our unemployment objective and overshooting our inflation goals has increased.	23.0	110.0
201612	2087	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	And if this materialized, it’s going to have implications for monetary policy in 2017, including not just the federal funds rate, but also decisions about how we manage our balance sheet.	23.0	110.0
201612	2088	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	As we head into 2017, I intend to be patient and careful not to prejudge what nonmonetary policies might be enacted, instead allowing these policies to unfold and assessing them as the process moves forward.	23.0	110.0
201612	2089	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	I am struck by the breadth of the potential policy actions that could happen in the next year—changes to the Affordable Care Act; changes to taxes, both individual and corporate; changes to infrastructure spending policy; regulatory changes; changes in fiscal policy management decisions, including decisions involving potentially terming out Treasury maturities; and changes in trade policy, immigration policy, and foreign policy generally.	23.0	110.0
201612	2090	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	I think the ultimate mix and timing of these policy actions may lead to some unpredictable and surprising outcomes.	23.0	110.0
201612	2091	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201612	2092	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23.0	65.0
201612	2093	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201612	2094	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I support alternative B for today.	23.0	94.0
201612	2095	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I think we met our goals in a statistical sense long ago.	23.0	94.0
201612	2096	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I think our policy rate is only slightly below where it needs to be to be consistent with our policy goals.	23.0	94.0
201612	2097	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	There’s not much evidence so far that the recent election will alter the current regime, which is characterized by low productivity growth in the United States and low real rates on government paper globally, the so-called r†.	23.0	94.0
201612	2098	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Several people said they were disappointed in me yesterday because I didn’t mention r†, so I’ve sprinkled it throughout this commentary.	23.0	94.0
201612	2099	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	[Laughter]	23.0	94.0
201612	2100	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The fact that we’re not really leaving a regime, at least so far, may mean that the policy rate should remain fairly low over the forecast horizon.	23.0	94.0
201612	2101	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	That continues to be our projection, based on the information we have today.	23.0	94.0
201612	2102	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	There has been some change since the election—in particular, a major equity rally.	23.0	94.0
201612	2103	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Many are interpreting that as reflecting expectations of faster economic growth.	23.0	94.0
201612	2104	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I think that’s the wrong interpretation.	23.0	94.0
201612	2105	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I think it’s reflecting expectations of lower corporate tax rates, which, all by themselves, would lead to revaluation of the US corporate sector.	23.0	94.0
201612	2106	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And if you look at projections of economic growth, a few people have marked them up, but most people have them still around 2 percent, which is what we have for the St Louis Federal Reserve forecast.	23.0	94.0
201612	2107	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So, as of today, I don’t see the equity rally, so far, as reflecting changing fundamentals.	23.0	94.0
201612	2108	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	However, it is possible that a regime change is in the offing.	23.0	94.0
201612	2109	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The list of possible policy changes just rattled off by President Kaplan is astonishing, and it could mean a much different economy in the future.	23.0	94.0
201612	2110	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So, obviously, I’ll be watching this very closely.	23.0	94.0
201612	2111	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	To get the regime change, we would need higher medium-term productivity growth.	23.0	94.0
201612	2112	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And, as I was saying yesterday, a case could be made that some of the proposed fiscal policies will affect medium-term productivity growth:  possibly deregulation—you could make a case there; possibly tax changes—if they affect investment in the United States, that could change productivity; and possibly infrastructure programs.	23.0	94.0
201612	2113	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	All of these could have an effect.	23.0	94.0
201612	2114	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	All of these also could go the other way and be detrimental.	23.0	94.0
201612	2115	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So I think we just don’t know at this point.	23.0	94.0
201612	2116	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I will say that I think the way a lot of people are talking about fiscal policy around the table is not the way I would think about it.	23.0	94.0
201612	2117	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Temporary increases in real GDP driven by higher government spending, which is backed by future taxes, would be insufficient to change a regime, in my view.	23.0	94.0
201612	2118	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	In a standard New Keynesian model, which often informs a lot of the thinking here, fiscal policy of that type would have no role to play at all.	23.0	94.0
201612	2119	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Those interested in my views on this could check out an essay I wrote a few years ago called “Death of a Theory.”	23.0	94.0
201612	2120	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Another way the regime could be altered would be if the very large liquidity premium on government paper globally was to lessen over the forecast horizon.	23.0	94.0
201612	2121	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So-called r† would rise then, and that would rationalize a higher policy rate for this Committee.	23.0	94.0
201612	2122	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And, indeed, since the election, the 10-year yield has increased substantially.	23.0	94.0
201612	2123	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Some of this was inflation expectations.	23.0	94.0
201612	2124	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	As I explained yesterday, at the St Louis Bank we were already expecting or maybe hoping for a bounceback in market-based measures of inflation expectations.	23.0	94.0
201612	2125	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So, seeing that actually happen was gratifying but didn’t change our outlook.	23.0	94.0
201612	2126	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The rest of the increase in the 10-year has been in the real rate, and we did take some of this on board in our forecast.	23.0	94.0
201612	2127	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	It’s not a regime change, but it is a somewhat higher real rate.	23.0	94.0
201612	2128	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Accordingly, we now have one policy-rate increase in 2017, on top of today’s increase.	23.0	94.0
201612	2129	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And, indeed, that’s the only increase for the forecast horizon as we sit here today, according to the St Louis Federal Reserve forecast.	23.0	94.0
201612	2130	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I’ll make three further comments, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201612	2131	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I see today’s decision as likely to be interpreted as hawkish, because the dots are indicating three increases in 2017, whereas markets have that at two.	23.0	94.0
201612	2132	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I see it as somewhat above current market expectations.	23.0	94.0
201612	2133	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I am concerned that markets get ahead of themselves and start to think that the Committee is more hawkish than it probably really is.	23.0	94.0
201612	2134	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I would prefer to stress that we will react to market circumstances and incoming data.	23.0	94.0
201612	2135	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	If we do raise rates faster, it will be because there’s good news coming in on the US economy and not just because we decided all of a sudden to raise rates faster.	23.0	94.0
201612	2136	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So I think in the period ahead that’s an important point to emphasize.	23.0	94.0
201612	2137	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I see allowing some minor runoff in the balance sheet as a policy move that we should consider in the near future.	23.0	94.0
201612	2138	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	This is obviously not reflected in my rate path projection, but this would be another way to make a mild tightening move without altering the policy rate path.	23.0	94.0
201612	2139	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	This is something that has been pushed to the back burner and should come back on the table.	23.0	94.0
201612	2140	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	As some of you remember, I was actually an advocate of allowing runoff of the balance sheet first and then raising the policy rate later.	23.0	94.0
201612	2141	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I now think that we should reconsider a policy move that would go in this direction.	23.0	94.0
201612	2142	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Another possibility would be to reallocate toward shorter-term securities when we reinvest and undo the twist operation that was done several years ago.	23.0	94.0
201612	2143	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I think that’s something that we could consider in the near future, possibly during 2017.	23.0	94.0
201612	2144	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Finally, I prefer that we not use the rhetoric about running the economy hot.	23.0	94.0
201612	2145	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Maybe it’s just a sense of how I think about macroeconomics, but, to me, it suggests departing from planned policy or departing from an existing policy rule.	23.0	94.0
201612	2146	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	It sounds discretionary.	23.0	94.0
201612	2147	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I think we should emphasize that we’re reacting to real data that are coming in on the economy and that we’re setting the policy rate according to that.	23.0	94.0
201612	2148	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And even if we don’t write a policy rule down, we have a policy rule in mind that might have many more factors in it than the typical policy rules that are studied in the research literature.	23.0	94.0
201612	2149	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	But once you have that rule in mind, you would not arbitrarily depart from that rule to try to achieve some outcome, because the reason you chose the rule in the first place is, you think that’s the optimal policy.	23.0	94.0
201612	2150	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So I think that my preference would be to retire the rhetoric about running hot.	23.0	94.0
201612	2151	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201612	2152	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201612	2153	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23.0	65.0
201612	2154	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201612	2155	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The past few months have seen important progress toward our goals.	23.0	107.0
201612	2156	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The labor market has continued to strengthen, and maximum employment is in sight.	23.0	107.0
201612	2157	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The 12-month change in core PCE prices has moved up noticeably over the past year, to 1.7 percent most recently, as the effects of past dollar appreciation and oil price declines have faded.	23.0	107.0
201612	2158	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Although further progress is needed if our 2 percent target is to remain credible following eight years of falling short, importantly, measures of inflation compensation have also improved of late.	23.0	107.0
201612	2159	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	These are all welcome signs that are consistent with a modest removal of policy accommodation.	23.0	107.0
201612	2160	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Even with a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate, monetary policy will remain accommodative.	23.0	107.0
201612	2161	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	This is appropriate because of how flat the Phillips curve has been and the fact that inflation is still below our target against a backdrop of persistent underperformance, as well as risk-management considerations in the vicinity of the effective lower bound.	23.0	107.0
201612	2162	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	While the neutral rate remains low, the ability of monetary policy to respond to shocks will be asymmetric.	23.0	107.0
201612	2163	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, we need to remain alert to downside risks, such as those I discussed yesterday arising from foreign economies.	23.0	107.0
201612	2164	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The persistent underperformance of inflation, the low neutral rate, the presence of downside risks associated with developments abroad, and risk-management considerations in the vicinity of the lower bound together counsel a gradual approach for the time being.	23.0	107.0
201612	2165	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	However, the advent of unified government could herald a very significant shift in the policy mix.	23.0	107.0
201612	2166	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	While it’s premature to assess with any precision the size, composition, or duration of these fiscal policy changes, it seems prudent to put some probability on a moderate increase in fiscal deficits starting late next year.	23.0	107.0
201612	2167	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	At a minimum, it poses upside risks to aggregate demand and makes the overall risks more balanced.	23.0	107.0
201612	2168	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The change in the fiscal policy outlook could have important implications for monetary policy, including for reinvestment policy.	23.0	107.0
201612	2169	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, the observed elevated sensitivity of the dollar to any anticipated divergence could reasonably lead us to expect the exchange rate to continue to do some of this work preemptively.	23.0	107.0
201612	2170	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	I support alternative B.	23.0	107.0
201612	2171	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201612	2172	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	23.0	65.0
201612	2173	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	111.0
201612	2174	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I support alternative B.	23.0	111.0
201612	2175	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I’ve been highlighting three metrics that I’ve been focused on in looking at how the economy is unfolding: core PCE inflation, inflation expectations, and the headline unemployment rate.	23.0	111.0
201612	2176	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Since we last met, we’ve seen positive developments in two of those three—some upward movement in market-based inflation expectations and a decline in the headline unemployment rate, signaling a tightening labor market.	23.0	111.0
201612	2177	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	In this context, I support raising the federal funds rate today.	23.0	111.0
201612	2178	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I will continue to monitor inflation, inflation expectations, and unemployment closely.	23.0	111.0
201612	2179	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	In particular, I’m looking for evidence to see whether the labor force participation story of the past year or so has run its course or whether there’s more “room to run.”	23.0	111.0
201612	2180	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I also want to see the rise in inflation expectations translate into actual higher inflation, because, as Governor Brainard just noted, we are still below our inflation target, and we have a symmetric target, not a ceiling.	23.0	111.0
201612	2181	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	And the strengthening dollar, as the Governor said, is going to make achieving our inflation target a little bit harder.	23.0	111.0
201612	2182	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Now, as many of us have said, in the future, nonmonetary policy is unusually uncertain.	23.0	111.0
201612	2183	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Dramatic changes seem possible, but we don’t know how they’re going to affect the economy.	23.0	111.0
201612	2184	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	The biggest challenge we have, as I see it, is how we communicate about the future.	23.0	111.0
201612	2185	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	As others have said, I think we should focus on our dual mandate and communicate a rationale that our policy choices are going to come back to achieving those objectives.	23.0	111.0
201612	2186	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	People may not find that very satisfying, because the truth is, we don’t know a lot about how the future is going to unfold.	23.0	111.0
201612	2187	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	But it is what it is.	23.0	111.0
201612	2188	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	We can’t promise something that we don’t have.	23.0	111.0
201612	2189	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	In the new year, we’re going to know a lot more, and that will inform our decisions.	23.0	111.0
201612	2190	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I want to add one comment.	23.0	111.0
201612	2191	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Several folks around the table made a comment about the word “gradual” and whether that word is what markets are anchoring their expectations to.	23.0	111.0
201612	2192	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I don’t see it that way, because the SEP has been much more hawkish over the past several years and markets have been basically ignoring that.	23.0	111.0
201612	2193	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I have a hard time seeing them ignoring the SEP but then anchoring to the word “gradual.”	23.0	111.0
201612	2194	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I think markets are rendering their own judgments about the future path of policy and how they see the economy evolving.	23.0	111.0
201612	2195	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Language obviously matters, but I don’t think that one word, “gradual,” explains the markets’ outlook.	23.0	111.0
201612	2196	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	23.0	111.0
201612	2197	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201612	2198	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23.0	65.0
201612	2199	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	23.0	96.0
201612	2200	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B as written.	23.0	96.0
201612	2201	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	A few months ago, I thought that our first rate hike in a year might be an opportunity for a major “refresh” of the statement.	23.0	96.0
201612	2202	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	But I changed my mind about that after the election, because of concerns that a major rewrite might be misconstrued as motivated by the election outcome or taken as a major shift in policy direction.	23.0	96.0
201612	2203	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	We don’t want the statement to be viewed in that way, so I think a statement with minimal changes, except for the decision to raise the federal funds rate target, seems appropriate to me.	23.0	96.0
201612	2204	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	The major focus coming out of this meeting is going to be how the statement has changed in terms of language and how the SEP numbers have evolved since the September FOMC meeting.	23.0	96.0
201612	2205	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	The minimal changes in the statement language should be reassuring to people that the election outcome has not yet provoked a radical rethink of the policy outlook.	23.0	96.0
201612	2206	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the SEP, I expect that market participants will be mainly focused on what happens to the median federal funds rate path.	23.0	96.0
201612	2207	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	The path did show two hikes in 2017 and three hikes in 2018 at the September meeting, and people are generally not expecting the path to move up very much at all at this point.	23.0	96.0
201612	2208	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the fact that the path has moved up slightly may be a slight surprise to people, but I think the movements are small enough that it’s not going to be a big event for market participants.	23.0	96.0
201612	2209	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Before I finish, I had a couple of further thoughts.	23.0	96.0
201612	2210	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I want to build on this issue of the reinvestment of our Treasury and agency MBS portfolio.	23.0	96.0
201612	2211	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	My thinking for some time has been that the timing of stopping or beginning to taper down our reinvestment should be motivated by the risk of an early return to the effective lower bound.	23.0	96.0
201612	2212	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	That implies that if we were to become more optimistic that that’s less likely, then we might decide to begin this process at a lower federal funds rate target.	23.0	96.0
201612	2213	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	In other words, I had two variables in my timing function:  distance from the lower bound—the level of the federal funds rate—and the risk of a near-term economic downturn.	23.0	96.0
201612	2214	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So if we do get significant fiscal stimulus in the years ahead, in my mind, this would bring the reinvestment decision potentially much closer in terms of time, because we might lower the federal funds rate at which we felt comfortable beginning to end reinvestment.	23.0	96.0
201612	2215	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	We might get to that given federal funds rate earlier in time.	23.0	96.0
201612	2216	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think it really is time for the staff and the Committee to start to do the prep work on how we might actually end reinvestment.	23.0	96.0
201612	2217	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	There are a lot of issues here—tapering versus stopping, how long a taper should be, how to treat MBS versus Treasury securities, et cetera.	23.0	96.0
201612	2218	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think I would very much encourage the staff to get going on this, because I can imagine that, under a feasible set of circumstances, we could be having this conversation maybe by the middle of next year.	23.0	96.0
201612	2219	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I also encourage the staff in this work to give us their views on, how do we match the equivalence of ending reinvestment or tapering reinvestment with federal funds rate changes— say, some sort of notion of equivalency?	23.0	96.0
201612	2220	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I know that’s going to be very difficult to do with any great precision, because it’s not just the decision to change the reinvestment path.	23.0	96.0
201612	2221	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s also the fact that this is viewed as another major regime shift, one similar to the regime shift that we made a year ago.	23.0	96.0
201612	2222	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	But we still need to have a rough estimate so we can figure out how we should trade off these two things?	23.0	96.0
201612	2223	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, before I conclude, because we have plenty of time, I’ve been thinking a lot about the election outcome and what we should think about it.	23.0	96.0
201612	2224	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m very much in the camp of thinking that the generally free labor of goods and services in the global economy has been hugely beneficial to hundreds of millions of people, in lifting them out of poverty.	23.0	96.0
201612	2225	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	But, at the same time, I think the election result shows that there are a lot of people in the United States that have been left behind by globalization.	23.0	96.0
201612	2226	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	We’ve had weak productivity growth, so the pie is not growing very fast.	23.0	96.0
201612	2227	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	We’ve had a decline in the labor share of income over the past 20 or 30 years.	23.0	96.0
201612	2228	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	We’ve had an increase in the skew of income distribution, and we’ve had poor income mobility.	23.0	96.0
201612	2229	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	When you put those four things together, there are a lot of people who actually haven’t benefited from globalization.	23.0	96.0
201612	2230	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this is important, because monetary policy can’t really do that much about this.	23.0	96.0
201612	2231	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	We can try to keep the economy at maximum sustainable employment and price stability, but we really fundamentally can’t do much about these things.	23.0	96.0
201612	2232	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think we need to talk about them a little bit more, because if the country doesn’t make progress in helping more people benefit from globalization, the support for globalization and for trade is going to fracture—maybe it already is starting to fracture—and, with that, we’ll lose a lot, I think, as a country and a society.	23.0	96.0
201612	2233	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think it’s something that we collectively need to talk about.	23.0	96.0
201612	2234	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	In this vein, Raj Chetty and a whole bunch of other authors published a paper last week that I think is really interesting.	23.0	96.0
201612	2235	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Basically, what they did is, they looked at how the year of your birth affects your likelihood of earning more than your parents, based on the income decile of your parents.	23.0	96.0
201612	2236	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	What they found is that if you were born in 1940, your chances of doing better than your parents were really good.	23.0	96.0
201612	2237	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	But as you move down the cohorts from 1940, ’50, ’60, ’70, and ’80, the chances of outdoing your parents decline markedly.	23.0	96.0
201612	2238	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So, for example, if you were born in 1980, it looks like you’re not going to do as well as your parents if your parents were at 50 percent of the income distribution.	23.0	96.0
201612	2239	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I really encourage you to look at this paper.	23.0	96.0
201612	2240	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it’s really very interesting empirical work, but it also underscores a little bit what we just saw in terms of the election outcome.	23.0	96.0
201612	2241	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, I just want to bookend the Chair’s comments about our colleague President Lockhart, who’s stepping down.	23.0	96.0
201612	2242	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	You’ve been a terrific colleague on this Committee.	23.0	96.0
201612	2243	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	It just shows that the diversity of this Committee benefits all of us—your background as a banker and your international experience.	23.0	96.0
201612	2244	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	You’ve shown great care and skill as a colleague.	23.0	96.0
201612	2245	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	You’re a very collegial person to work with.	23.0	96.0
201612	2246	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m going to miss you, and I wish you all the best of luck in your new endeavors.	23.0	96.0
201612	2247	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Bill.	23.0	88.0
201612	2248	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Could I raise a question?	23.0	108.0
201612	2249	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Bill, I think there’s an important question about whether it’s globalization or modernization that lies behind what’s happened to relative incomes.	23.0	108.0
201612	2250	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And I’m not sure that it’s globalization.	23.0	108.0
201612	2251	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there are a lot of factors.	23.0	96.0
201612	2252	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m using that as a shorthand, so I don’t disagree that it’s more complicated than that.	23.0	96.0
201612	2253	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	But, clearly, the support for globalization in the United States is really in danger, and I guess that’s why I emphasize the globalization aspect of it.	23.0	96.0
201612	2254	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And, second, what will be the effect of the signal that we are starting to roll off the portfolio, just by itself?	23.0	108.0
201612	2255	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	We know how much of an addition to the supply of assets that the market has to absorb.	23.0	108.0
201612	2256	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	But we’re also sending a signal, which is, we think the economy is strong enough to enable us to do this.	23.0	108.0
201612	2257	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	That’ll reduce the effect to some extent, won’t it?	23.0	108.0
201612	2258	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the market would take it as a judgment that we’re more confident that the economy has sufficient momentum that we’re not going to go back to the effective lower bound in the very near future.	23.0	96.0
201612	2259	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Our original motivation for not ending the reinvestment was, we wanted to get a little bit of room away from the lower bound, and we wanted to have some confidence that we weren’t going to go back to the lower bound in the very short run.	23.0	96.0
201612	2260	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Right.	23.0	108.0
201612	2261	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23.0	65.0
201612	2262	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Now, I did hear considerable support for alternative B as written, but I also heard a suggestion from President Mester, and I want to put that in front of you and make sure I understood it properly.	24.0	65.0
201612	2263	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	At the end of the first paragraph of alternative B—	24.0	65.0
201612	2264	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester, please correct me if I didn’t get this right—President Mester suggested changing the words where it says “but still are low,” to “but remain low.”	24.0	65.0
201612	2265	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Yes.	24.0	999.0
201612	2266	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	And leave the “considerably” in there.	24.0	999.0
201612	2267	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	So, basically, just add a word, as opposed to changing it.	24.0	999.0
201612	2268	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	So, essentially, the sentence would be more black ink than we currently have.	24.0	65.0
201612	2269	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Yes.	24.0	999.0
201612	2270	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	You would be taking the old sentence and just adding the word “considerably,” so it would read “Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved up considerably but remain low.”	24.0	65.0
201612	2271	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think this is a big deal one way or the other, but I guess when I originally thought about this question, I thought that, on the one hand, you’re saying something is moving.	24.0	96.0
201612	2272	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	On the other hand, you’re saying something is remaining, and that seems a little bit in opposition to one another.	24.0	96.0
201612	2273	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Oh, I thought they were synonyms, but I defer.	24.0	999.0
201612	2274	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	And that’s why I was more in the camp of “still are low.”	24.0	96.0
201612	2275	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess I favor the way it’s written now, because if you say something has moved and then say something remains, was it at rest, or is it moving?	24.0	96.0
201612	2276	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	It just seems a little contradictory.	24.0	96.0
201612	2277	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	I think of “remain” and “still are” as synonyms, but I’m happy to defer and leave it the way it is.	24.0	999.0
201612	2278	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Are there strong views about this?	24.0	65.0
201612	2279	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think it matters.	24.0	96.0
201612	2280	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Should we leave it the way it is then?	24.0	65.0
201612	2281	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	24.0	65.0
201612	2282	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Now, because it has been a year since our previous policy action, I thought it might be helpful if I remind you of the procedure we follow for Board decisions on interest rates on reserves and discount rates taken in association with FOMC monetary policy decisions.	24.0	65.0
201612	2283	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	First, the FOMC will vote as usual on the monetary policy statement and the directive to the Desk.	24.0	65.0
201612	2284	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Second, the Board only, and not the FOMC, will vote on corresponding changes to the interest rates on reserves.	24.0	65.0
201612	2285	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	And, finally, the Board only will vote on changes to discount rates.	24.0	65.0
201612	2286	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	So let’s now first vote on the FOMC statement and directive, and let me ask Brian to make clear what it is we’re voting on and to call the roll.	24.0	65.0
201612	2287	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	24.0	999.0
201612	2288	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	This vote will be on the policy statement for alternative B as given on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas Laubach’s briefing materials—that is, without any change from what was included in those briefing materials.	24.0	999.0
201612	2289	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	It will also include the directive to the Desk as that is included in the draft implementation note, which is on pages 10 and 11 of those briefing materials.	24.0	999.0
201612	2290	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	Chair Yellen Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Brainard Yes President Bullard Yes Governor Fischer Yes President George Yes President Mester Yes Governor Powell Yes President Rosengren Yes Governor Tarullo Yes .	24.0	999.0
201612	2291	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you.	24.0	999.0
201612	2292	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	24.0	65.0
201612	2293	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	As I mentioned, the next vote will be a vote of the Board of Governors only and will be on an increase, to 75 basis points from 50 basis points, in the interest rates paid on required and excess reserve balances, effective December 15, 2016.	24.0	65.0
201612	2294	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Do I have a motion?	24.0	65.0
201612	2295	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	24.0	108.0
201612	2296	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	And a second?	24.0	65.0
201612	2297	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Second.	24.0	97.0
201612	2298	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	24.0	65.0
201612	2299	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	24.0	65.0
201612	2300	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	The final vote will also be a vote of the Board of Governors only and will cover three discount rate actions, so bear with me.	24.0	65.0
201612	2301	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	First, it will be to approve the requests of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco to increase the primary credit rate to 1¼ percent from 1 percent, effective December 15, 2016.	24.0	65.0
201612	2302	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Second, it will also encompass approval by the Board of Governors of the establishment of a 1¼ percent primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Bank, effective on the later of December 15, 2016, and the date such Reserve Bank informs the secretary of the Board of such a request.	24.0	65.0
201612	2303	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	The secretary of the Board would be authorized to inform such Reserve Bank of the approval of the Board of Governors on such notification by the Reserve Bank.	24.0	65.0
201612	2304	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, this vote will also encompass approval by the Board of Governors of the renewal by all 12 Federal Reserve Banks of the existing formulas for calculating the rates applicable to discounts and advances under the secondary and seasonal credit programs.	24.0	65.0
201612	2305	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	As specified by the formula for the secondary credit rate, the secondary credit rate would be set 50 basis points above the primary credit rate.	24.0	65.0
201612	2306	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	And, as specified by the formula for the seasonal credit rate, the seasonal credit rate would continue to be reset every two weeks as the average of the daily effective federal funds rate and the rate on three-month CDs over the previous 14 days, rounded to the nearest 5 basis points.	24.0	65.0
201612	2307	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Do I have a motion?	24.0	65.0
201612	2308	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	24.0	108.0
201612	2309	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	A second?	24.0	65.0
201612	2310	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Second.	24.0	97.0
201612	2311	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	24.0	65.0
201612	2312	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	24.0	65.0
201612	2313	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	That’s it.	53.0	65.0
201612	2314	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Let me mention that the date of our next meeting is Tuesday and Wednesday, January 31 and February 1.	53.0	65.0
201612	2315	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	At this point, there are boxed lunches that are available in the anteroom.	53.0	65.0
201612	2316	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	And, as usual, there will be a TV set up in the Special Library, if anybody is interested in watching my press conference.	53.0	65.0
201612	2317	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks, everybody.	53.0	65.0
