201510	0	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	5	5
201510	1	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s get started.	5	5
201510	2	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	As most of you know, this is the last FOMC meeting for President Kocherlakota.	5	5
201510	3	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Later today we will have a chance to thank him and to wish him farewell at a luncheon, but in view of Narayana’s service on the Federal Open Market Committee, I’d like to take this opportunity to thank him in the setting of an FOMC meeting as well.	5	5
201510	4	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Narayana became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in October 2009.	5	5
201510	5	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	He has participated in 54 regular meetings of the FOMC.	5	5
201510	6	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Before becoming president, he was a highly successful economic researcher while serving as a university professor and as a research consultant for the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.	5	5
201510	7	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	The insight and creativity that he demonstrated as a researcher were also hallmarks of his work as a monetary policymaker.	5	5
201510	8	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Over the past six years, President Kocherlakota has contributed greatly to the Committee’s formulation of monetary policies to address the challenging macroeconomic issues facing our nation.	5	5
201510	9	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	So, Narayana, let me say thank you in this venue for your service and say how much we will all miss you.	5	5
201510	10	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	[Applause]	5	5
201510	11	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you very much, Madam Chair.	5	5
201510	12	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	5	5
201510	13	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	And, as we did the previous time and probably will from now on, our meetings will be throughout joint meetings of the FOMC and the Board of Governors.	5	5
201510	14	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I need a motion to close the Board meeting.	5	5
201510	15	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	5	5
201510	16	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	5	5
201510	17	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	5	5
201510	18	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	The first topic on our agenda is “Equilibrium Real Interest Rates,” r*.	92	9
201510	19	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let me ask Chris Gust to start us off.	92	9
201510	20	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	Our briefing will be delivered in four segments by Kei-Mu Yi, Andrea Tambalotti, David López-Salido, and me.	92	9
201510	21	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	We will be referring to the package labeled “Material for Briefing on Equilibrium Real Interest Rates.”	92	9
201510	22	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	What level of the real policy rate would be consistent with moving the economy to, or keeping it at, full employment?	92	9
201510	23	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	This benchmark rate is often referred to as the “neutral” or “equilibrium” real rate, or r*.	92	9
201510	24	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	A policy stance that sets the real policy rate equal to r* is, in some models, neither contractionary nor expansionary.	92	9
201510	25	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	This general concept of a neutral real rate has been given several more-specific definitions, which I will summarize.	92	9
201510	26	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	Kei-Mu, Andrea, and David will focus on longer-run trends in r*, on shorter-run variations in r*, and on the policy implications of having to rely on uncertain estimates of r*.	92	9
201510	27	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	Exhibit 1 identifies different concepts that have been referred to as r*—that is, different definitions of a “neutral” real rate.	92	9
201510	28	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	Some have a very specific interpretation that is tightly linked to a model or class of models; others are statistical in nature.	92	9
201510	29	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	The first three entries in the list are associated with formal economic models.	92	9
201510	30	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	The natural, or Wicksellian, real rate is the real interest rate that would prevail in the absence of nominal rigidities such as sticky prices and wages.	92	9
201510	31	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	Thus, it is the real rate consistent with the level of resource utilization that would prevail if there were no nominal rigidities.	92	9
201510	32	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	The efficient real rate is the real rate that would prevail if there were neither nominal rigidities nor distortions such as imperfect competition or taxes that move allocations away from their efficient levels.	92	9
201510	33	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	The optimal real rate is the rate that would be prescribed by optimal monetary policy based on maximizing some welfare criterion.	92	9
201510	34	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	It may differ from the efficient rate if policy is constrained by the effective lower bound or if there are not enough policy instruments to achieve the most efficient outcomes.	92	9
201510	35	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	The real rate associated with the optimal control simulations presented in Tealbook B is one example of an optimal real rate.	92	9
201510	36	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	The natural, efficient, and optimal real rates are short-term concepts.	92	9
201510	37	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	Estimates of these rates fluctuate in response to economic shocks and move over the business cycle.	92	9
201510	38	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	In the simplest New Keynesian model, these three r* concepts are equivalent, and it is optimal for policymakers to set the short-term real interest rate equal to the natural rate in order to stabilize the price level and keep output at potential.	92	9
201510	39	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	In larger, more realistic New Keynesian models, these three concepts need not coincide; nonetheless, as Andrea will discuss, a monetary policy strategy in which the real policy rate tracks the natural rate generally leads to beneficial economic outcomes.	92	9
201510	40	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	Continuing down the list, a focus on the long-run average real rate takes r* to be the average of some short-term real interest rate measured over a long period of time.	92	9
201510	41	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	This definition is statistical and does not rely on a specific economic model.	92	9
201510	42	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	By contrast, estimating the steady-state real interest rate, which is the short-term real interest rate that would prevail in the long run once all shocks die down, requires a fully specified economic model.	92	9
201510	43	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	These two concepts are often used interchangeably in simple policy rules that are based on an assumed fixed long-run or steady-state real rate and thus have a constant intercept term.	92	9
201510	44	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	However, as Kei-Mu will explain, treating the long-run real rate as fixed, as is often assumed in the formulation of simple policy rules, does not appear to be realistic.	92	9
201510	45	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	FRB/US r*, which is shown in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of Tealbook B, is a different, though related, concept of r*.	92	9
201510	46	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	It provides a medium-run perspective on r* and is the level of the federal funds rate that, if maintained for 12 quarters, will close the output gap in three years.	92	9
201510	47	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	One can employ the “real rate gap,” which is the gap between the actual real interest rate and r*, as an indicator of the stance of monetary policy.	92	9
201510	48	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	For example, if the path of the actual real rate lies persistently below the path for a short-run concept of r*, output would eventually exceed potential.	92	9
201510	49	2015-10-28	meeting	GUST	I will now turn it over to Kei-Mu, who will discuss long-run trends in the real rate.	92	9
201510	50	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Thank you.	92	9
201510	51	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	In this presentation I will summarize aspects of the memo that Jing Zhang and I wrote on the evolution of long-run real interest rates and their fundamental determinants.	92	9
201510	52	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	The two real interest rates relevant to our memo are defined again in the top panel of exhibit 2.	92	9
201510	53	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Why should policymakers care about these longer-run interest rates— the term I will use to describe both?	92	9
201510	54	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	There are four related reasons, shown in the middle panel.	92	9
201510	55	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	First, optimal monetary policy requires specifying a path for the real federal funds rate.	92	9
201510	56	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	This, in turn, requires estimates of the future path of short-run r*.	92	9
201510	57	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Longer-run real rates characterize the future path of short-run r* once short- and medium-run shocks die down—these rates thus serve as (time-varying) reference points for short-run r*.	92	9
201510	58	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Second, the intercept term in a Taylor-type policy rule typically is set equal to the longer-run real interest rate.	92	9
201510	59	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Third, estimates of longer- run real interest rates can suggest when it is appropriate to change the long-run assumptions implicit in estimates of short-run r*.	92	9
201510	60	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Finally, estimates of longer-run real interest rates can shed light on the probability of hitting the effective lower bound, or ELB.	92	9
201510	61	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	The bottom panel provides an outline of our presentation.	92	9
201510	62	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	In exhibit 3, we present our estimates of long-run real interest rates, which are constructed as 11-year centered moving averages of the policy interest rate less the current annual CPI inflation rate, which we use as a proxy for the expected inflation rate.	92	9
201510	63	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	The upper panel shows long-run real interest rates in each of the G-7 countries.	92	9
201510	64	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	The lower panel shows the median long-run real interest rate across as many as 20 large economies for each year as well as the interquartile range and the US long- run real interest rate.	92	9
201510	65	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Note that there are three subperiods of trends, with the long-run real interest rate falling from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, then rising for 10 years or so, then falling again.	92	9
201510	66	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	In this last trend, covering a quarter-century, the 20-country median and the US long-run real interest rate have fallen almost 3 percentage points and real rates have become more closely synchronized across countries.	92	9
201510	67	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Next, we examine some of the fundamental determinants of the movements in long-run real interest rates.	92	9
201510	68	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	We first present some theoretical background in the upper panels of exhibit 4.	92	9
201510	69	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	The panels use a simple saving-investment framework to illustrate how real interest rates are determined.	92	9
201510	70	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	The interaction of desired saving and desired investment determines the equilibrium real interest rate.	92	9
201510	71	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Forces that alter desired saving and desired investment shift the corresponding curves, thus leading to a new equilibrium real interest rate.	92	9
201510	72	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	One example of a force affecting desired saving is the “global saving glut” hypothesis put forth by then Governor Ben Bernanke in 2005.	92	9
201510	73	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	In that story, due to the Asian financial crisis and to increased earnings by oil-producing nations, desired saving by many emerging market countries increased.	92	9
201510	74	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	In the upper-left panel, this shows up as a shift of the saving curve to the right, leading to lower real interest rates, higher equilibrium investment and saving, and, as a byproduct, increased capital inflows into countries like the United States that offer attractive investment opportunities.	92	9
201510	75	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Similarly, a force that causes global investment demand to fall, such as lower productivity growth, would show up as a leftward shift in the investment demand curve, leading to lower real interest rates and lower investment, as shown in the upper-right panel.	92	9
201510	76	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	The lower panel of exhibit 4 shows global gross fixed investment as a share of GDP over the past 50-plus years.	92	9
201510	77	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	There is a secular decline since the late 1970s.	92	9
201510	78	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Coupled with the fact that long-run real interest rates have fallen since the late 1980s, these data suggest that declining global investment demand has been a relatively important force over the past 25 years.	92	9
201510	79	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	We are not saying that the global saving glut has been unimportant.	92	9
201510	80	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Rather, we are pointing out that a decline in global investment demand had to be at least as important.	92	9
201510	81	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Exhibit 5 presents a couple of key determinants of investment demand.	92	9
201510	82	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	A standard result from the theory of investment demand is that the risk-free real interest rate equals the expected marginal product of capital, or MPK, less the risk premium and the economic depreciation rate.	92	9
201510	83	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Our memo describes how this relation can be explained via a simple cost-of-capital framework.	92	9
201510	84	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Thus, two key determinants of the real interest rate are the marginal product of capital and the risk premium.	92	9
201510	85	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	We can estimate the marginal product of capital from data on the capital share of income, GDP, and the capital stock.	92	9
201510	86	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	We compute the risk premium as a residual from the equation after subtracting depreciation.	92	9
201510	87	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	The top panel of exhibit 6 shows the median long-run MPK across countries for each year and the US long-run MPK.	92	9
201510	88	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	For comparison, it also shows the median and US long-run real interest rates from exhibit 3.	92	9
201510	89	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Median MPK dropped sharply by about 5 percentage points between the mid-1960s and the mid-1980s.	92	9
201510	90	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Since then, it has been between about 11 and 12 percent.	92	9
201510	91	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	This decline, as well as the decline in total factor productivity growth that we show in our memo, is consistent with the textbook growth model in which diminishing returns to capital accumulation eventually set in.	92	9
201510	92	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	This story fits the experience of a number of countries, especially those that went through a period of rapid economic growth—because of recovery from World War II, integration into the global economy, or both—in the 1950s through 1980s.	92	9
201510	93	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	The decline in MPK, however, does not closely track the trends in the long-run real interest rate, especially after the mid-1970s.	92	9
201510	94	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	For example, in the United States, long-run MPK declined slightly through the 1970s, then rose slightly until the mid-1990s, and has been flat since then.	92	9
201510	95	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	The flatness over the past quarter-century, juxtaposed against the declining trend of real interest rates, suggests that MPK has not been an important driver of long-run real interest rates during this period.	92	9
201510	96	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	The bottom panel of exhibit 6 shows the median long-run risk premium across countries for each year and the US long-run risk premium.	92	9
201510	97	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Again, for comparison, we have also included the median and US long-run real interest rates.	92	9
201510	98	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	The median and US risk premium fell from the mid-1970s through the late 1980s, but they have both risen about 3 percentage points since then.	92	9
201510	99	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	The fall in the long-run real interest rate during a period in which MPK was essentially constant can be reconciled by the rise in the risk premium.	92	9
201510	100	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	What could account for this rise in the risk premium over the past quarter- century?	92	9
201510	101	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	One possibility is that with increased integration of global goods and asset markets, the risk of capital projects has increased—with global competition, the probability of success is lower, but, conditional on success, the rewards are greater.	92	9
201510	102	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	A second possibility is that the demand for safe assets has persistently increased over the past quarter-century.	92	9
201510	103	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Exhibit 7 presents projections of two determinants of the marginal product of capital and long-run real interest rates:  growth of total factor productivity (TFP) and of the working-age population.	92	9
201510	104	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	The TFP projections are for the United States and come from recent research by John Fernald of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.	92	9
201510	105	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	He estimates that future TFP growth will be about 0.3 percentage point per year lower than during the Great Moderation period.	92	9
201510	106	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	In his framework, this translates into lower long-run real interest rates of at least 0.3 percentage point.	92	9
201510	107	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	The working-age population projections in the middle panel are for the 20 countries we studied earlier.	92	9
201510	108	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Annual population growth is projected to fall about 1 percentage point between now and mid-century.	92	9
201510	109	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	All else being equal, this will also lead to lower real interest rates.	92	9
201510	110	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Finally, we summarize key takeaways and policy implications in the bottom panel.	92	9
201510	111	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Long-run real interest rates have declined over the past quarter-century and are currently low in all of the world’s major economies.	92	9
201510	112	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Coupled with the estimates of US steady-state r* discussed in our memo, the data suggest that short-run real interest rates in the United States and other countries will fluctuate around a lower anchor compared with before.	92	9
201510	113	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	In addition, the projections of slower US TFP and global working-age population growth suggest that further reductions in the long-run or steady-state real interest rate may occur.	92	9
201510	114	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	If so, the United States and other economies will be more likely to hit the ELB in the foreseeable future than prior to the crisis.	92	9
201510	115	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Thank you.	92	9
201510	116	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Thank you.	92	9
201510	117	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	I will be continuing with the same set of exhibits, starting with exhibit 8.	92	9
201510	118	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	My presentation focuses on the so-called natural rate of interest, or NRI for short.	92	9
201510	119	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	As noted in panel 1, this concept has been developed within the New Keynesian modeling framework, in which it is defined as the real interest rate that would prevail in the absence of nominal rigidities such as sluggish adjustment in nominal prices and wages.	92	9
201510	120	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	The appeal of the natural rate of interest is that it is optimal in very simple New Keynesian models in which keeping the real value of the policy rate equal to the NRI delivers both price stability and full employment.	92	9
201510	121	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	In more realistic dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models, of the kind used for this presentation, this divine coincidence between the natural rate of interest, stable prices, and maximum employment no longer holds.	92	9
201510	122	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Nonetheless, even in these more complex models, the natural rate of interest is a useful reference point for monetary policy, as a monetary strategy in which the real policy rate targets the natural rate generally promotes stable inflation and economic activity.	92	9
201510	123	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	The DSGE approach to r* has three main strengths, which are listed in panel 2.	92	9
201510	124	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	First, DSGE models provide a coherent framework for estimating the natural rate of interest by positing a theoretical connection between the natural rate, which is unobservable, and observed macroeconomic variables.	92	9
201510	125	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Second, these models trace the movements of the natural rate back to the underlying sources of business cycle fluctuations.	92	9
201510	126	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Third, DSGE models allow us to study the effects of alternative policies through the use of counterfactual simulations.	92	9
201510	127	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	The main drawback of the DSGE approach to r* is that estimates of the natural rate are tightly linked to the features of specific models.	92	9
201510	128	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	As a partial antidote to this model dependence, we estimate the natural rate in the five different models listed in panel 3.	92	9
201510	129	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Three of these models—EDO, FR, and GIH—have been developed here at the Board of Governors.	92	9
201510	130	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	The fourth is the Federal Reserve Bank of New York DSGE model, and the fifth is an empirical model of r* developed at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.	92	9
201510	131	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	These models represent a diverse set of approaches to the measurement of the natural rate in terms of model structure, data used in estimation, and econometric techniques employed.	92	9
201510	132	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	This diversity of approaches is a strength of our work, as it provides a range of estimates for the natural rate of interest that takes into account uncertainty about the “true” model of the economy.	92	9
201510	133	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	This range of estimates is represented in blue in panel 4, together with the average real NRI across our five models, the black line.	92	9
201510	134	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Several features are worth highlighting.	92	9
201510	135	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	First, the natural rate fluctuates significantly over the business cycle, rising during expansions and declining sharply in recessions.	92	9
201510	136	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Second, the different models provide a consistent view of the broad movements in the natural rate, even if the range of estimates can be quite large at any given time.	92	9
201510	137	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	For example, the models disagree on how far the natural rate fell during the Great Recession, as shown by the wide range of estimates in 2009, but they all see it plunge to its historical low around that time.	92	9
201510	138	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Finally, the natural rate has recovered gradually since the end of the recession and currently is about zero.	92	9
201510	139	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Exhibit 9 provides some insight into the sources of fluctuations in the natural rate.	92	9
201510	140	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	As explained in panel 1, DSGE models trace fluctuations in the NRI back to a handful of fundamental business cycle shocks.	92	9
201510	141	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Reflecting the diversity of approaches that they represent, our models collectively include many such shocks.	92	9
201510	142	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	However, it is possible to group these shocks based on the economic decisions that they affect most directly.	92	9
201510	143	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	So, for instance, financial/saving shocks shift households’ desire to save and to hold safe assets, influencing their current demand for consumption.	92	9
201510	144	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Financial/investment shocks affect firms’ willingness or ability to invest—for instance, by changing the premium on external finance and, hence, firms’ cost of capital.	92	9
201510	145	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Productivity shocks affect the overall efficiency of production.	92	9
201510	146	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	All of these shocks, when negative, depress the natural rate because they boost desired saving, reduce desired investment, or both.	92	9
201510	147	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Panel 2 illustrates the independent contributions of the three groups of shocks to the estimated movements in the natural rate in the EDO model, on the left, and the FRBNY-DSGE model, on the right.	92	9
201510	148	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	The results in the other two DSGE models are similar.	92	9
201510	149	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	In these figures, the contributions of financial/saving shocks are represented by blue bars; those of financial/investment shocks are in red, while those of productivity shocks are in green.	92	9
201510	150	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	The contributions of all other shocks are in light gray.	92	9
201510	151	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	The colored bars sum to the black line, which represents the deviations of the estimated NRI from its steady state.	92	9
201510	152	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	All the models attribute the sharp decline in the natural rate during the Great Recession to a combination of severe negative shocks.	92	9
201510	153	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Financial/saving shocks are by far the most prominent in EDO, as shown on the left, as well as in FR and GIH, as discussed in the memo.	92	9
201510	154	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Investment shocks are also important in both EDO and FRBNY-DSGE, and the latter model attributes a significant role to productivity shocks as well.	92	9
201510	155	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	The models also indicate that financial shocks have generated persistent headwinds well into the recovery, keeping the natural rate well below its steady state.	92	9
201510	156	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	These headwinds appear to have abated somewhat over the past few quarters.	92	9
201510	157	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Both models project a gradual return of the natural rate toward its steady state.	92	9
201510	158	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	In the FRBNY-DSGE model, this normalization is slower than in the EDO model, with the NRI still about 1 percentage point below steady state at the end of 2018.	92	9
201510	159	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Factors similar to those at work in the United States appear to have lowered the natural rate of interest in the major advanced foreign economies as well.	92	9
201510	160	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Panel 3.1 compares estimates of the NRI based on the FR model for the United States, the black line, and the advanced foreign economies, whose trade-weighted aggregate natural rate is represented in brown.	92	9
201510	161	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	According to these estimates, the NRI in the advanced foreign economies reached historic lows during the Great Recession, remained depressed during the recovery, and is projected to normalize gradually, as in the United States.	92	9
201510	162	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	As indicated by the blue bars in panel 3.2, on the right, adverse financial/saving shocks account for most of these developments.	92	9
201510	163	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	The extent to which our estimates of the natural rate of interest may represent a useful reference for the federal funds rate is the subject of exhibit 10.	92	9
201510	164	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	As described in panel 1, we consider a counterfactual policy simulation, which we call NRI targeting, in which the central bank sets the real policy rate equal to the natural rate in every period rather than following the estimated interest rate rule that describes its historical behavior in each model.	92	9
201510	165	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Compared with the estimated policy rule, NRI targeting significantly reduces the volatility of both inflation and the output gap in two of our models.	92	9
201510	166	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	As shown in panel 2, the standard deviation of both variables in EDO falls about 70 percent when replacing the estimated interest rate rule with NRI targeting.	92	9
201510	167	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	In FRBNY-DSGE, the standard deviation of inflation is 39 percent lower, and that of the output gap is 86 percent lower under NRI targeting than under the estimated policy rule.	92	9
201510	168	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	In the GIH model, in contrast, NRI targeting reduces the volatility of inflation but at the cost of a less-stable real economy.	92	9
201510	169	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	This tradeoff between inflation stabilization and output gap stabilization highlights the fact that, in general, NRI targeting is not optimal in empirical DSGE models.	92	9
201510	170	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Panel 3 compares the recent evolution of the federal funds rate with that of the estimated nominal natural rate, which is computed by adding expected inflation to the real natural rate in each DSGE model.	92	9
201510	171	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	In panel 3, the federal funds rate is in red, including the October Tealbook assumption over the forecast horizon.	92	9
201510	172	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	The black line is the average nominal natural rate across models, with the blue shaded area representing the range of estimates.	92	9
201510	173	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	The average nominal NRI is very close to the federal funds rate until the end of 2008, when the federal funds rate reaches the effective lower bound.	92	9
201510	174	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	The natural rate continues to fall thereafter, opening a gap between the two of about 5 percentage points.	92	9
201510	175	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	This gap persists through 2010 according to all the models and until 2013 according to the average.	92	9
201510	176	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	As of the second quarter of 2015, all of the models estimate a positive nominal natural rate in a narrow range roughly between 1 and 2 percent.	92	9
201510	177	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	The models project a gradual normalization of the NRI, at a similar pace to that assumed for the federal funds rate in the October Tealbook.	92	9
201510	178	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Our conclusions are, first, that a diverse set of empirical macroeconomic models provides a consistent account of the evolution of the natural rate of interest over the business cycle.	92	9
201510	179	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Second, according to our estimates, financial disturbances were mostly responsible for pushing the NRI to its historical lows during the Great Recession, generating persistent headwinds that have kept it depressed through most of the recovery.	92	9
201510	180	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Third, these headwinds appear to have partly abated more recently.	92	9
201510	181	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Currently, the nominal natural rate is estimated to be back into positive territory after several years in which the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates was severely binding.	92	9
201510	182	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	For the period ahead, this normalization is projected to continue gradually.	92	9
201510	183	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	With that, I turn it over to David.	92	9
201510	184	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Thank you.	92	9
201510	185	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	I will summarize the key results presented in the memo titled “Monetary Policy at the Lower Bound with Imperfect Information about 𝑟𝑟∗” that I prepared with my colleagues Chris Gust, Ben Johannsen, and Bob Tetlow.	92	9
201510	186	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	I will focus on the implications of uncertainty about 𝑟𝑟∗ for its use in conducting monetary policy.	92	9
201510	187	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	The top panel of exhibit 11 outlines the key elements of our modeling approach.	92	9
201510	188	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	We use a simple New Keynesian model that has two key equations: an intertemporal “IS equation” that relates output to the real interest rate and expected future output, and a “Phillips curve” that relates current inflation to the output gap and expected future inflation.	92	9
201510	189	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In models of this class, demand and supply shocks are reflected in the natural rate, which is the real rate necessary to achieve full employment, and the stance of monetary policy can be defined in terms of the deviations of the actual real rate from this natural rate.	92	9
201510	190	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	The model is completed with a description of how monetary policy is determined.	92	9
201510	191	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In this description, we first assume that policymakers choose the optimal monetary policy under discretion, meaning that they set the policy rate optimally in response to incoming data on a period-by-period basis, but cannot make future policymakers follow a policy plan adopted today.	92	9
201510	192	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Next, we analyze the implications of uncertainty about 𝑟𝑟∗ for simple policy rules.	92	9
201510	193	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Whether policy is discretionary or follows a rule, the policy rate can be constrained by the effective lower bound on short-term nominal interest rates, which introduces an important nonlinearity in the model economy.	92	9
201510	194	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Finally, policymakers observe only an imperfect estimate of the natural rate.	92	9
201510	195	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	The middle and lower panels of the exhibit compare optimal policy under these assumptions with optimal policy in the complete information case, in which policymakers know the true value of 𝑟𝑟∗ .	92	9
201510	196	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	The policymaker optimally sets the nominal policy rate (on the vertical axes) in response to an indication that the natural rate has increased (the horizontal axes show the magnitude of the estimated increase, measured in percentage points).	92	9
201510	197	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In the middle panel, the economy is assumed to be in “normal times,” meaning that the nominal policy rate is initially well away from the ELB.	92	9
201510	198	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	As shown by the dashed blue line in the middle panel, if policymakers have timely and accurate information about the value of 𝑟𝑟∗, it is optimal for them to adjust the policy rate one for one in response to changes in 𝑟𝑟∗ .	92	9
201510	199	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In contrast, if policymakers have incomplete and potentially erroneous information about the value of 𝑟𝑟∗, it is optimal for them to attenuate their policy responses, as shown by the flatter, red dot-dashed line.	92	9
201510	200	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	The bottom panel repeats this exercise for an economy in which the ELB is initially just binding.	92	9
201510	201	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	For small revisions to estimated 𝑟𝑟∗, the policy rate remains at the ELB regardless of whether information is complete or incomplete.	92	9
201510	202	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	But if the estimate of 𝑟𝑟∗is known to be imprecise, a larger estimated increase in 𝑟𝑟∗ is required to lead the policymaker to move away from the ELB (that is, to lift off), and policy responses are even more attenuated than they are in normal times, as can be seen from the flat slope of the red dot-dashed line in the bottom panel of the exhibit.	92	9
201510	203	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	The reason is somewhat straightforward:  When the policy rate is at or near the ELB, the optimal policy is to err on the side of keeping the real policy rate below the 𝑟𝑟∗ estimate so as to reduce the likelihood that an adverse shock will weaken the economy enough to require a return to the ELB.	92	9
201510	204	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In essence, policymakers “take out insurance” against situations in which the information about 𝑟𝑟∗ might lead them to mistakenly raise the policy rate and in which the ELB would prevent them from offsetting the error in subsequent periods.	92	9
201510	205	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Our memo noted that pursuing optimal policy under discretion in the neighborhood of the ELB requires a complex nonlinear reaction function for the policy rate and that, as a practical matter, such a reaction function may be difficult to communicate and implement.	92	9
201510	206	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	An alternative approach might be to commit to a simple monetary policy rule whose intercept term varies in response to information indicating that the natural rate of interest has changed.	92	9
201510	207	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	The next exhibit illustrates the implications of committing to a particular rule-based approach in setting monetary policy in our model economy with imperfect information.	92	9
201510	208	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In exhibit 12, we examine two versions of the Taylor (1999) rule.	92	9
201510	209	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	As shown in the top panel, the difference between the two specifications is the assumption regarding how policymakers use information about 𝑟𝑟∗ .	92	9
201510	210	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In one case, policymakers set the intercept of the rule equal to the long-run average real rate and do not change it (the case in which 𝛼𝛼 = 1).	92	9
201510	211	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In the other case, the central bank adjusts the intercept term in the Taylor rule as the natural rate fluctuates (the case in which 𝛼𝛼 = 0), but, as in the previous exhibit, policymakers only have a noisy estimate of 𝑟𝑟∗ .	92	9
201510	212	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	The bottom panel of exhibit 12 compares the standard Taylor (1999) rule with a constant 𝑟𝑟∗, the black solid line, to the optimal discretionary policy, or ODP (the red dot-dashed line), when the policy rate is in the vicinity of the effective lower bound.	92	9
201510	213	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	As before, the panel displays the policymaker’s reaction function to estimated ∗changes in 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 .	92	9
201510	214	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Even though 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡∗ does not appear directly in the specification of the rule—because the intercept, in this instance, corresponds to the longer-run average real rate of around 2 percent—the policymaker recognizes that the estimates of 𝑟𝑟∗ contain valuable information about underlying shocks that also affect inflation and the output gap.	92	9
201510	215	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	The Taylor (1999) rule with a fixed intercept counsels notably higher nominal interest rates than the ODP even when the estimate of 𝑟𝑟∗ is imprecise; indeed, because the rule has an unadjusted constant intercept, the policy rate departs from the ELB for any change in the estimate of 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡∗ shown.	92	9
201510	216	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In contrast, the blue dashed line shows the outcomes when the intercept of the rule is allowed to change, one for one, with perceived movements in the natural rate (labeled “TR with Time- Varying 𝑟𝑟∗”).	92	9
201510	217	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In this case, policymakers’ reactions to estimates of 𝑟𝑟∗ are very similar to those under the optimal discretionary policy (the red dot-dashed line).	92	9
201510	218	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	The memo also analyzes a Taylor rule and a first-difference rule using parameter values optimized to account for uncertainty about 𝑟𝑟∗ and for being in the vicinity of the ELB.	92	9
201510	219	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	They deliver reaction functions that are quite similar to those shown in exhibit 12.	92	9
201510	220	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	As comforting as these results might appear, they are subject to the criticism that, because 𝑟𝑟∗ is unobservable and difficult to measure, the public could see monetary policy as being discretionary even if policymakers are following an optimized rule.	92	9
201510	221	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In exhibit 13 we show a summary of our principal findings.	92	9
201510	222	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	First, although 𝑟𝑟∗ can be useful as a benchmark for measuring the stance of monetary policy, the unobservable nature of 𝑟𝑟∗ and uncertainty about its value provide an argument for attenuating the response of policy to information about 𝑟𝑟∗, relative to the full- information case, but do not argue for ignoring such information.	92	9
201510	223	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Second, this attenuation is increased when the policy rate is near the effective lower bound, reflecting a policy approach that “takes out insurance” against possible adverse outcomes, with more insurance being optimal the more tangible the threat of the ELB.	92	9
201510	224	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Finally, in terms of simple rules, a strategy that allows for time variation in the intercept term of the rule could approximate reasonably well the performance of the optimal discretionary policy.	92	9
201510	225	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Our results, of course, come with caveats.	92	9
201510	226	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	The results may be model-specific.	92	9
201510	227	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In addition, following any of the strategies we analyze would certainly introduce communication challenges because policymakers would need to explain their actions by referring to information that cannot easily be verified by private agents.	92	9
201510	228	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Your final exhibit repeats the questions about your thinking on 𝑟𝑟∗ that were posed in the cover note that accompanied the four memos.	92	9
201510	229	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Thank you.	92	9
201510	230	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Chris, Kei-Mu, Andrea, and I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.	92	9
201510	231	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201510	232	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s start with questions for the various presenters.	92	9
201510	233	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	92	9
201510	234	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Thank you very much.	92	9
201510	235	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	First, I want to thank staff of the Board and Reserve Banks for an exceptionally thorough and thoughtful range of materials.	92	9
201510	236	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	This is greatly appreciated.	92	9
201510	237	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Really nicely done.	92	9
201510	238	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	A natural question occurs regarding this material, and I’m genuinely interested in the staff’s views about this.	92	9
201510	239	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	A basic message I take away from the staff memos is that current estimates of r* are well above the actual real federal funds rate.	92	9
201510	240	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Suppose we were to project ahead under the usual assumption that no further economic shocks hit the economy, and suppose we make the usual assumption that, in the long run, monetary policy can’t influence real variables.	92	9
201510	241	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	I take it that the underlying premise of these frameworks is that the real rate gap will close as we project ahead.	92	9
201510	242	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	So, if you think of the current r* as the long-run value of r*, the real rate is ultimately going to have to rise to meet r* as we project out.	92	9
201510	243	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	There’s the simple Fisher equation that has to hold.	92	9
201510	244	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	In that projection, we’d see either a combination of a rise in the nominal interest rate or a fall in the expected inflation rate, and, presumably, if the latter took place, it would pull down the actual inflation rate.	92	9
201510	245	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	I’m interested in the staff’s views on the following question.	92	9
201510	246	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	If, under those assumptions, we held the nominal interest rate near zero long enough, would that cause inflation to fall?	92	9
201510	247	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	The second related question is, how long is “long enough”?	92	9
201510	248	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	And then a third related question is, what are the odds that such a mechanism might be depressing inflation now?	92	9
201510	249	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Does anyone want to take that?	92	9
201510	250	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	I can take a stab at it.	92	9
201510	251	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	I can tell you what happens in the FRBNY- DSGE model.	92	9
201510	252	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	That model has an interest rate rule that governs monetary policy as we lift off.	92	9
201510	253	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	The gap between the prescription of that rule and the natural rate is not very different over time from what you see in panel 3 in exhibit 10.	92	9
201510	254	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Everything is quite well behaved in that context.	92	9
201510	255	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	And inflation, actually, as well as the output gap, quite slowly converges back to the steady state.	92	9
201510	256	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	That’s the context in which the existence of this gap doesn’t create any particular problem for the economy, and, in particular, you would then observe this effect that you are suggesting, in which inflation would be driven down along that.	92	9
201510	257	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	I think you may have misunderstood.	92	9
201510	258	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	One premise was that we hold the nominal interest rate fixed at zero for a long time, and that would violate the assumption you just described of following the rule you’ve implemented in your model.	92	9
201510	259	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	I’m asking about a different simulation than you just described, in essence.	92	9
201510	260	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	We would be happy to run that simulation and provide you with an answer.	92	9
201510	261	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	We haven’t done that.	92	9
201510	262	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	92	9
201510	263	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I’m not really very familiar with this line of theory.	92	9
201510	264	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Actually, President Bullard has referred to these before.	92	9
201510	265	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Isn’t this sort of the new monetary—it’s a different equilibrium, sort of a “multiple equilibriums” kind of story.	92	9
201510	266	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I didn’t know that it had very desirable features empirically.	92	9
201510	267	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	92	9
201510	268	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think one thing you could say is that the whole analysis is based on a unique steady-state equilibrium.	92	9
201510	269	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	It’s a linear model approximated around that steady state.	92	9
201510	270	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Even when you’re at the zero policy rate, there’s no other steady state that you can converge to or anything like that.	92	9
201510	271	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The paper by Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohé, and Uribe says there is another steady state.	92	9
201510	272	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	It is associated with zero policy rates, and that, they say, would exist in your model, but the way you analyzed it, either you’re assuming there’s no convergence to that steady state or you’re just ignoring the steady state altogether.	92	9
201510	273	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Maybe what I’m going to say is consistent with what President Bullard just said.	92	9
201510	274	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Isn’t there an argument that if you were to hold the nominal rate at zero, in spite of the fact that the equilibrium nominal rate would be higher, you would end up generating not lower but higher inflation.	92	9
201510	275	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	And, the higher inflation went, if you kept the nominal interest rate at zero, the lower the actual real rate would move over time, the gap would increase, and you would get accelerating inflation.	92	9
201510	276	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	But that’s equivalent to saying, instead of going to a steady state with lower inflation, you’d actually be on the dynamic path that would be unstable.	92	9
201510	277	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Those are the standard dynamics in a model in which expected inflation is anchored and we’re following a policy rule when you’ve got some nonneutralities that generate those dynamics.	92	9
201510	278	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	So, the thought experiment I was asking about invites us to, first, back away from stable inflation expectations.	92	9
201510	279	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	I’m not sure whether this is true, but President Kocherlakota and others have said we should question whether they’re well anchored or not.	92	9
201510	280	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	And it backs away from adherence to a policy rule.	92	9
201510	281	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	It asks us to think about, what if we depart from a rule for some time, and what if inflation expectations, over time, become unanchored?	92	9
201510	282	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	That’s the question.	92	9
201510	283	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Could we, by holding nominal rates low, drive inflation down?	92	9
201510	284	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	That was the question I wanted their thoughts on.	92	9
201510	285	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201510	286	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes, I don’t know if I’ll add much, but I’ll talk anyway.	92	9
201510	287	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	92	9
201510	288	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think President Lacker’s comments really get at the heart of the matter, which is what would happen to inflation expectations if the FOMC were to keep the federal funds rate low over a long period of time.	92	9
201510	289	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And there are models in which the public thinks through, “Well, the reason they’re keeping the federal funds rate low is actually because their target for inflation has fallen, and so, because they’re keeping the federal funds rate low, I must lower my inflation expectations,” and that becomes consistent in equilibrium.	92	9
201510	290	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I really think that the question is less a theoretical one than an empirical one about whether that is the way the public forms inflation expectations.	92	9
201510	291	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Right.	92	9
201510	292	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	That’s what I wanted the staff’s thoughts about.	92	9
201510	293	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That empirical question?	92	9
201510	294	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	92	9
201510	295	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman Dudley.	92	9
201510	296	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t quite understand the intuition behind the attenuation.	92	9
201510	297	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I understand the attenuation when you’re close to the effective lower bound, but when you’re not at the effective lower bound, what’s the reason why you would be lagging behind what you thought was the unbiased estimate of the r*?	92	9
201510	298	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I mean, it would seem to me that if you were lagging behind with your unbiased estimate of the r*, you’d be risking falling behind in inflation expectations and allowing them to get unanchored.	92	9
201510	299	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	What’s in the model that pushes against that?	92	9
201510	300	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t really understand the intuition behind the attenuation.	92	9
201510	301	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I get it at the zero lower bound, because you don’t want to make a policy mistake and get pushed back to the zero lower bound, but when you’re away from the zero lower bound, what’s the intuition behind the attenuation?	92	9
201510	302	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Are there features of the model that would generate that result?	92	9
201510	303	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	It just doesn’t seem that logical to me.	92	9
201510	304	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	If I may say something, you’re right that the attenuation is smaller when you are far away from the effective lower bound, but, again, the attenuation is coming from the filtering problem that the policymaker needs to do.	92	9
201510	305	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In any case, he has incomplete information about the true value of r*, which means, following the usual William Brainard principle, responding less aggressively to any uncertainty.	92	9
201510	306	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	The effect is a lot less important than when you are on the effective lower bound, precisely, as you mentioned, because of the nonlinearity.	92	9
201510	307	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	But, in normal times, you also would tend to respond by less, precisely because you are still uncertain.	92	9
201510	308	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	But you’re assuming that nothing bad happens when you’re lagging behind.	92	9
201510	309	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	In other words, inflation expectations don’t respond to that because otherwise it could be explosive.	92	9
201510	310	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Let’s imagine that r* increased and then you lag behind because of the Brainard principle.	92	9
201510	311	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	What happens then?	92	9
201510	312	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Don’t inflation expectations start to get unmoored because you’re lagging behind what the correct policy should be?	92	9
201510	313	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I just don’t understand this notion that you always want to do less.	92	9
201510	314	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I understand it at the effective lower bound, but I don’t understand the attenuation otherwise.	92	9
201510	315	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	That’s right.	92	9
201510	316	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	So, what we said is that, in normal times, the attenuation depends on the size of the signal regarding the natural rate.	92	9
201510	317	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	You converge to the case in which you start to get a bigger signal.	92	9
201510	318	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	You catch up.	92	9
201510	319	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	You catch up.	92	9
201510	320	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	But the model sets things up so there’s no cost to being late because, presumably, inflation expectations stay well anchored through this whole time period.	92	9
201510	321	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The model is sort of begging the result in some sense.	92	9
201510	322	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	There are two assumptions used in the simulation.	92	9
201510	323	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	One is, of course, that inflation will go down further, and the policy that we show is the policy under discretion.	92	9
201510	324	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	So the policymaker is just optimizing period by period, taking expectations as given.	92	9
201510	325	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess what I’m trying to really drive home is that the expectation in these models that inflation expectations always stay anchored is a pretty strong assumption, and that ends up potentially driving some of these results.	92	9
201510	326	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that what’s driving that attenuation outcome needs to be brought out a little bit more.	92	9
201510	327	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	If I may, this is very much related to President Williams’s past line of work.	92	9
201510	328	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	I feel a little reluctant to opine about that here [laughter].	92	9
201510	329	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Go for it.	92	9
201510	330	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Who’s the coauthor of that work?	92	9
201510	331	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	He is a former Board staffer by the name of Athanasios Orphanides.	92	9
201510	332	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	One key point is that it’s the imprecision about the r* estimate that is really making you cautious.	92	9
201510	333	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	I think one of the key lines that came out of the Orphanides-Williams line of work was that, in the presence of uncertainty regarding these estimates, you try to pursue strategies that rely much more on observed data rather than on these imprecise estimates.	92	9
201510	334	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	And so, the key lesson arising from that, for example, was that you want to particularly weigh in on observations on inflation, because if your estimate of the natural rate turns out to be wrong, this is where the information should show up.	92	9
201510	335	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	And so that’s why you give relatively little weight to the r* estimate.	92	9
201510	336	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	I hope I’m presenting that fairly.	92	9
201510	337	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	92	9
201510	338	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201510	339	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Two questions for Kei-Mu, I presume.	92	9
201510	340	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	On the global dynamics, exhibit 3, can you explain the convergence since, say, 2000 or so?	92	9
201510	341	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	You said in your remarks that rates seem more synchronized.	92	9
201510	342	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Is there a hypothesis of why that has happened?	92	9
201510	343	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	There are hypotheses.	92	9
201510	344	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	I think the most natural one is that countries have become more financially integrated over time, globally.	92	9
201510	345	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	So, barriers to capital flows have come down, and when that happens, various wedges that make interest rates differ across countries tend to become smaller, and then the rates become more similar.	92	9
201510	346	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	I think the financial-integration story is the most natural story for the past quarter-century.	92	9
201510	347	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	My second question is probably an economics or monetary policy 101 question, but I won’t be embarrassed asking it.	92	9
201510	348	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	There was so much talk a few years ago about the global savings glut.	92	9
201510	349	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	As a practical matter, where does it show up, and through what channels does it have the most effect on our rate structure?	92	9
201510	350	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Is it from foreign exchange reserves to Treasury securities?	92	9
201510	351	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Is that the channel that most influences real activity in the United States, or are there other channels by which that global savings glut has an influence on our economy?	92	9
201510	352	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	I’m going to think in terms of former Chairman Bernanke’s view of it, and I think his story had both a private-sector and a public-sector element to it.	92	9
201510	353	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	I think the public- sector element was that a number of governments—for example, those coming out of the Asian financial crisis—decided that, as a precautionary mechanism, it would be useful to build up a lot of foreign exchange reserves.	92	9
201510	354	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	And the way they built up those reserves was, they bought a lot of US Treasury securities.	92	9
201510	355	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	So that was a force to drive down real interest rates.	92	9
201510	356	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	I think you can make a similar argument for some of the oil-producing countries, too.	92	9
201510	357	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	At the same time, there are stories of emerging markets—for example, China, India— joining the global economic scene.	92	9
201510	358	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	These are countries that are growing rapidly, but they also are financially underdeveloped.	92	9
201510	359	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	In that type of world, if it were not for the financial underdevelopment, you would think that these countries would have high interest rates because their productivity prospects and growth prospects are very high.	92	9
201510	360	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	But because they are financially underdeveloped, their interest rates at home are actually quite low, and they are looking to save abroad.	92	9
201510	361	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	And so, once these economies start opening up, then these private-sector resources go abroad.	92	9
201510	362	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	Maybe not so much in China, because there are still capital controls there, but from other emerging market countries.	92	9
201510	363	2015-10-28	meeting	YI	And that is another force to drive down US and other advanced foreign economy interest rates.	92	9
201510	364	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you.	92	9
201510	365	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201510	366	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	92	9
201510	367	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I had a question for Andrea, though it also relates to Kei-Mu Yi’s memo.	92	9
201510	368	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On exhibit 10, you have a natural rate of interest and a federal funds rate.	92	9
201510	369	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That picture must depend on the assumption about the long-run or steady-state neutral rate.	92	9
201510	370	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	How does your estimate for that dovetail with what is in Kei-Mu’s memo?	92	9
201510	371	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Thank you.	92	9
201510	372	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	That’s a very good question.	92	9
201510	373	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	The models are built around a constant steady state.	92	9
201510	374	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	So, in the long run, all the models are going to go back to the steady state.	92	9
201510	375	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Let’s say that the natural rate at that point is something around 2 percent; that is generally across the models.	92	9
201510	376	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	In that respect, there is no long-run variation in the long-run r* in these models.	92	9
201510	377	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	So that’s part of the reason why we call these “short-run estimates of r*.”	92	9
201510	378	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	So, if I wanted to integrate this perspective with some of the work that President Williams, for example, has done together with Thomas, I don’t want to say that you would want to sum the two sources of variation, as that would probably involve misstating the way in which the two components co- vary.	92	9
201510	379	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	But, roughly speaking, that’s the type of exercise that you want to do.	92	9
201510	380	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	There is really no variation in the very long run in these models.	92	9
201510	381	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	So you would want to take that into consideration as well if you wanted to have a complete picture of the short-run and long-run variation in the natural rate that comes from this exercise.	92	9
201510	382	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So, to push you a little harder, if you were to try to integrate some of the thinking that was in Kei-Mu’s memo with what you had done, would that tend to push the blue line downward or upward?	92	9
201510	383	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	It would definitely push down.	92	9
201510	384	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Again, I wouldn’t want to say that you want to have a one-to-one addition there.	92	9
201510	385	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Another consideration is that there are very persistent shocks in our models that do keep the natural rate depressed below the steady state, potentially for very long.	92	9
201510	386	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	That’s the reason why you wouldn’t want to add up whatever effects might come from Laubach-Williams-type estimates.	92	9
201510	387	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	But, certainly, the bias could be toward making the black line somewhat lower, and we would have to do more work to tell you exactly how much lower.	92	9
201510	388	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	92	9
201510	389	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	92	9
201510	390	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	I want to thank the staff for the memos.	92	9
201510	391	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	I found them very useful, good conceptually and also in terms of the policy.	92	9
201510	392	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	I have three questions about the policy prescriptions.	92	9
201510	393	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	I guess I wasn’t that surprised about the attenuation result within the context of the models you were looking at, but I was wondering whether you have investigated models that actually think about the cost of financial stability of keeping interest rates low.	92	9
201510	394	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	In particular, ones that have true microfoundations of that.	92	9
201510	395	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Giovanni Dell’Aricca, Luc Laeven, and Robert Marquez have a Journal of Economic Theory paper that actually provides some microfoundations regarding some of the costs of financial stability.	92	9
201510	396	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	In their model, they have a banking sector in which, if the interest rate is very low for a long time, banks take on more risk, they become more leveraged, and they no longer monitor their borrowers as much as they did.	92	9
201510	397	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	So you get this aggregate increase in risk to the financial system.	92	9
201510	398	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The DSGE models don’t have that; the DSGE model is just going to have the macroeconomic risk.	92	9
201510	399	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Have you thought about what the policy prescription would be in a model that has this kind of financial-stability cost of low interest rates?	92	9
201510	400	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	That’s one question.	92	9
201510	401	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The second question has to do with the type of uncertainty.	92	9
201510	402	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	You only look at uncertainty or measurement error associated with r*.	92	9
201510	403	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	But you can also think about uncertainty associated with other artifacts in the Taylor rule—in particular, the output gap.	92	9
201510	404	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	We know that’s measured with imprecision; there’s a lot of uncertainty about it.	92	9
201510	405	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	And if there is uncertainty, for example, in some of the parameters in the model—for example, the degree of relative risk aversion—you can think about whether there would be a negative correlation between the r* and the output gap.	92	9
201510	406	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Some of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland staff analysis indicated that that attenuation result would then go away, because the measurement errors would offset one another.	92	9
201510	407	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	You’d have to think about how that would interact when you consider a policy prescription.	92	9
201510	408	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	I was wondering if you have any thoughts on that.	92	9
201510	409	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	With regard to my third question, in the Tealbook we sometimes use the inertial Taylor rule in which you are keeping interest rates low and then not reacting totally to it.	92	9
201510	410	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	My third question is that I’m wondering whether you are going to propagate the measurement error in r* over time, and how that would interact with your attenuation result, if you think about a different kind of rule.	92	9
201510	411	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Thank you, President Mester.	92	9
201510	412	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Those are very good questions.	92	9
201510	413	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	I’ll try to answer in the context of what we did, so I’m going to go in reverse order.	92	9
201510	414	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	You are absolutely right.	92	9
201510	415	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Thinking about the inertial aspect of the rule, we experimented in the memo with the first-difference rule, and you have a problem of “nowcasting” actual variables like the output gap or even inflation.	92	9
201510	416	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Then you actually translate persistent mistakes into the level if you respond wrongly to the variables.	92	9
201510	417	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	So, that is obviously going to have an effect that is probably going to make the attenuation less important, and we discussed that in the memo.	92	9
201510	418	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	So you are absolutely right.	92	9
201510	419	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	The idea that we have in the memo, though, was trying to get a way of introducing this smoothing parameter that is kind of a reduced-form in character, in order to capture many things and to try to illustrate a potential way of thinking about a smooth response, or a gradual response, of the nominal interest rate by thinking about uncertainty about r*.	92	9
201510	420	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	That’s the way we thought about that issue.	92	9
201510	421	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Let me just rephrase that.	92	9
201510	422	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	So what you’re saying is this is an alternative to looking at an inertial Taylor rule, because part of the reason you want an inertial rule is not because we don’t like fluctuations in the interest rate.	92	9
201510	423	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	That’s an alternative view.	92	9
201510	424	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In your first question, you probably have in mind, too, because of this financial-stability consideration, that this idea of smoothing the interest rate is another way of thinking about how, without having that in the rule as, it can arise because policymakers have a problem with incomplete information.	92	9
201510	425	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	That’s absolutely right.	92	9
201510	426	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Your second question is about the uncertainty of r* and another form of uncertainty.	92	9
201510	427	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	What gave us some perspective on that is that we use a little model; it’s very much a “toy” model.	92	9
201510	428	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In it, the r* is moving because we can control the nature of the fluctuations underlying the economy.	92	9
201510	429	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	The r* is moving because there are different shocks, whether a discount factor shock or technology shocks, and there are potentially shocks that matter for the Phillips curve too.	92	9
201510	430	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Those are what we call macro shocks.	92	9
201510	431	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	We actually know exactly what variation was behind what we call uncertainty about r*.	92	9
201510	432	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Of course, we can introduce other forms of uncertainty into the model.	92	9
201510	433	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	You mentioned uncertainty coming from a parameter; that is going to enter your model in a nonlinear way, so, in terms of the model, it is going to lead you exactly in the direction that William Brainard was emphasizing, to some attenuation.	92	9
201510	434	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Of course, that’s going to depend on what parameter.	92	9
201510	435	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	You mentioned one, risk aversion, which pretty much is saying something about the relation between the real interest rate and aggregate demand.	92	9
201510	436	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Of course, if you change that, because that’s related to risk aversion in this kind of model, that’s going to lead to some counteraction to what we call attenuation here.	92	9
201510	437	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	You’re absolutely right.	92	9
201510	438	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	We didn’t consider those kinds of uncertainties.	92	9
201510	439	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	But in the case of all the uncertainties that we did consider, the ones that we discussed always led in the same direction, in terms of r*, that we just put here in the memo.	92	9
201510	440	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	But even if you didn’t want to pin it to one parameter.	92	9
201510	441	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	With the parameter I chose, of course, you get the negative correlation.	92	9
201510	442	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Yes.	92	9
201510	443	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	You can imagine a world in which the measurement error associated with r* and the measurement error associated with the output gap would be negatively correlated.	92	9
201510	444	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	You can think of situations like that.	92	9
201510	445	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	We have these kinds of situations in the model, in order to think about markup shocks or technology shocks, and create—sometimes it depends on the persistence—this kind of negative correlation.	92	9
201510	446	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	And you’re right.	92	9
201510	447	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	On the one hand, you want to attenuate your response; on the other hand, you don’t want to do that.	92	9
201510	448	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	So, you can have situations like that in which they can cancel each other.	92	9
201510	449	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	We see that in our model, too.	92	9
201510	450	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	But for the kind of shocks that we consider, either technology or the one that changes the preference in terms of savings, they both lead to the conclusions that we have.	92	9
201510	451	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	And then, the last question was about how to introduce financial-stability considerations into these models.	92	9
201510	452	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	That’s a really interesting question.	92	9
201510	453	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	The only thing that I can say there is that we have a paper in which, instead of going through theory of how you might introduce searching for yields into the model, we follow a very simple practical and empirical approach.	92	9
201510	454	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	That is, we made a probability of a crisis endogenous with regard to a policy decision.	92	9
201510	455	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	We incorporate that into a New Keynesian model, and we try to understand how this kind of framework matters when you take into account that your policy decisions matter for future inflation and output through changing the probability of a crisis in the future because of searching for yields or other mechanisms.	92	9
201510	456	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	We leave that completely outside the model.	92	9
201510	457	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	We introduced such kinds of nonlinearities into the model, too.	92	9
201510	458	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	And that’s, of course, going in the direction that you mentioned.	92	9
201510	459	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	That’s leading to less attenuation when policymakers endogenize or internalize that there is a potential cost, and that is then to move the rates in the direction of increasing as opposed to attenuating.	92	9
201510	460	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	However, when we calibrate the model, the effects tend to be small.	92	9
201510	461	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	So, it’s really difficult, taking as given the correlation that we see in the data between the nominal interest rate and the probability of a crisis.	92	9
201510	462	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	You need to have a really large effect on changes in the policy rate on credit to that probability to get some results along the lines that you suggested.	92	9
201510	463	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Of course, it depends on, if you’re a minimax person, right, the fact that you may end up with this crisis—	92	9
201510	464	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Well, if you think in terms of robust control, too, yes.	92	9
201510	465	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Yes.	92	9
201510	466	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Exactly.	92	9
201510	467	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Whether the last person—yes, you definitely need to take into account worst-case scenarios to think about policy.	92	9
201510	468	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Right.	92	9
201510	469	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	You’re absolutely right.	92	9
201510	470	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	All right.	92	9
201510	471	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Thank you.	92	9
201510	472	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans, did you have a question?	92	9
201510	473	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I do.	92	9
201510	474	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Is it my turn?	92	9
201510	475	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s say it is.	92	9
201510	476	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	92	9
201510	477	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	First, on page 10, when you describe the experiment in which the volatility in inflation and the output gap are reduced when you follow the natural rate, what is the volatility of the policy rate process in that case?	92	9
201510	478	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Presumably, it’s a lot higher, because it doesn’t have inertia.	92	9
201510	479	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	That is correct.	92	9
201510	480	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	We only focused on the volatility of inflation and the output gap without taking a stance on what would that imply for the policy instruments.	92	9
201510	481	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	It is quite volatile.	92	9
201510	482	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	If you look at the estimates of the natural rate, you will see how volatile they are.	92	9
201510	483	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Right.	92	9
201510	484	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	So if anybody wanted to try to pocket those types of improvements, we’d be apt to move policy around quite a lot.	92	9
201510	485	2015-10-28	meeting	TAMBALOTTI	Yes, absolutely.	92	9
201510	486	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	President Mester’s question was fascinating and related to something I had been thinking about, too.	92	9
201510	487	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	If you think about the financial-stability issues and try to build them into these models—obviously not having seen that model—it’s going to imply some type of real cost to the economy when you’ve got these types of shocks and structures in place.	92	9
201510	488	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	So, you’re going to lose your “divine coincidence” result really quickly and in a big way.	92	9
201510	489	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	One of the nice things about these types of analyses is, if you think about r* movements as indicative of what almost-optimal policy or optimal policy is, it kind of tells us how to close inflation gaps and output gaps.	92	9
201510	490	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Now, if we’re going to build in another mandate, financial stability, I’m presuming that we’re not going to be getting closure of inflation gaps and output gaps if you’ve only got one instrument to achieve those three things.	92	9
201510	491	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	That’s absolutely correct.	92	9
201510	492	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Any ideas on how far away the wedges might be or how you go about thinking about that?	92	9
201510	493	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	No.	92	9
201510	494	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	[Laughter]	92	9
201510	495	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Fair enough, fair enough.	92	9
201510	496	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	It’s an imponderable.	92	9
201510	497	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Very quickly, President Evans, just for clarification:  In the analysis that David just was referring to, the goals actually remain the traditional dual-mandate objectives.	92	9
201510	498	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	There is no third objective of financial stability per se.	92	9
201510	499	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	It is simply that you take into account that your policies may have implications for your dual-mandate objectives through a channel that wasn’t previously present, which is that it might contribute to the probability of a financial crisis in the future.	92	9
201510	500	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	That’s right.	92	9
201510	501	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	You can think about how any financial friction you can bring into the model may involve an additional gap from whatever the optimal credit-to-GDP ratio is in the absence of any friction.	92	9
201510	502	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	In that sort of model, we don’t have a loss function that incorporates into the policymaker’s decision the deviation of any financial variable from that target.	92	9
201510	503	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	We only look at the usual deviations of output from potential output and inflation from target.	92	9
201510	504	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	If you accommodate that, it’s going to bring another tradeoff, as you mentioned.	92	9
201510	505	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	I wasn’t sure whether that’s what you meant when you referred to the gap.	92	9
201510	506	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Well, it’s kind of open-ended, really.	92	9
201510	507	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	You definitely need to think about all of the instruments.	92	9
201510	508	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Let me see if I’m following this.	92	9
201510	509	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	If you consider models that are more complicated and they introduce these financial-instability risks with those structures, now you go to compute your definition of r*.	92	9
201510	510	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	It’s going to be the Wicksellian version in which you close out the nominal rigidities, not the efficient real rate?	92	9
201510	511	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	With the natural rate, yes.	92	9
201510	512	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Okay, the natural rate.	92	9
201510	513	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	So in the analyses without that friction, you could take some comfort in saying, “Gosh, if I know what that r* is, I can kind of judge policy and move it in that direction and feel like I’m on track to achieve our dual mandate.”	92	9
201510	514	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Now, in the more complicated model in which we compute that, there’s going to be these additional wedges preventing that closure.	92	9
201510	515	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	So it’s not going to be enough to be following that r*, but we’re going to need additional strategies in order to close the gaps.	92	9
201510	516	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	Exactly, exactly.	92	9
201510	517	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	The optimal policy will never be to close the gap between the real rate and r*, whatever its definition.	92	9
201510	518	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	For example, that’s precisely what happened in this simple model when you acknowledge the effective lower bound, because once you are at the effective lower bound, you recognize reaching the effective lower bound as a credible threat and the possibility you will come back to it.	92	9
201510	519	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	It’s like a shifter that creates another wedge.	92	9
201510	520	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	You will never be able to close inflation deviations and the output gap.	92	9
201510	521	2015-10-28	meeting	LÓPEZ-SALIDO	So tracking the natural rate is not going to be the optimal policy in that case.	92	9
201510	522	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	92	9
201510	523	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201510	524	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Then why don’t we start our go-round.	92	9
201510	525	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	This is not a full go- round, but a number of people have indicated a desire to speak on this topic.	92	9
201510	526	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s start with President Williams.	92	9
201510	527	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201510	528	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think this is a timely topic for two reasons.	92	9
201510	529	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	One is, I think it is useful input into our own policy decisions and deliberations in the situation we find ourselves in today.	92	9
201510	530	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I also think it is important for thinking about our longer-term policy strategy, and I’ll come to that in a few minutes.	92	9
201510	531	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I found the memos and the briefings very useful and the discussion we’ve had already this morning very good, but my remarks will focus on the research on r* that Thomas Laubach and I have been working on for the past 15 years and that was summarized in the paper that we distributed to the Committee last week.	92	9
201510	532	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, by the way, after the paper was distributed, I received a nice e-mail from President Kocherlakota saying, and I quote, “As you think about your policy intervention for the upcoming meeting, I highly recommend this thoughtful paper.”	92	9
201510	533	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I found it very gratifying that he found our work useful input for the Committee’s thinking.	92	9
201510	534	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	But upon closer inspection, I noticed that the e-mail was not addressed to the FOMC but only to me.	92	9
201510	535	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	92	9
201510	536	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	It’s still relevant.	92	9
201510	537	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	In my reading of the literature and my own work with Thomas on this, I think a robust finding across pretty much all the studies is that r* has declined considerably over the past decade and, although point estimates differ, nearly all the current readings on r* are near historic lows.	92	9
201510	538	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	What remains unanswered is, what are the forces that have driven the natural rate of interest down?	92	9
201510	539	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Numerous explanations have been put forward, including slower economic growth, global factors, and so on, but it’s not possible to draw definitive conclusions based on the available evidence.	92	9
201510	540	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	This inability to identify clearly the sources of a decline in r* makes it hard to know how much of the shift will be temporary and how much will be long lasting.	92	9
201510	541	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Although much is made, in debate among researchers, of this distinction, for policy purposes we don’t need to wait for a definitive answer.	92	9
201510	542	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even if the natural rate eventually returns to its higher level, it’s likely to remain low for the next few years.	92	9
201510	543	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is seen in the analysis from the DSGE models and, quite honestly, from all the other models in which the natural rate is assumed to be only temporarily depressed.	92	9
201510	544	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	The conclusion I draw is that a relatively low natural rate of interest is likely to be with us for some time, and we need to take that into account in our forecasts, our analysis, and our policy deliberations.	92	9
201510	545	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Particularly, it argues for a shallow path of rate increases and an endpoint for interest rates that are below historical norms.	92	9
201510	546	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I should note that the Tealbook forecast implicitly incorporates a very low effective short-run r* and a long-run r* of only 1¼ percent.	92	9
201510	547	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	So these considerations are already built into the baseline projection to a large extent.	92	9
201510	548	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Looking further ahead, if the natural rate of interest stays persistently low, this does have direct implications for the frequency and severity of zero-lower-bound episodes and for financial stability.	92	9
201510	549	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	As prudent planning for such a possibility, we should have renewed discussions here in the Committee of the optimal size of our balance sheet, the expected use of LSAPs in the future, negative interest rates, and even the optimal inflation target and other approaches to cope with an environment of very low rates.	92	9
201510	550	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even if you’re not convinced today that the natural rate of interest is permanently lower, I do think that it makes sense for us to focus on these issues over the next year or so.	92	9
201510	551	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	92	9
201510	552	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201510	553	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	92	9
201510	554	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201510	555	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	The estimate for the equilibrium federal funds rate that I submitted to the September SEP was 350 basis points.	92	9
201510	556	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, I must admit that I have very little confidence in my ability to estimate the real equilibrium federal funds rate in the long run or in the short run.	92	9
201510	557	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	If the next recession were to begin with the federal funds rate at 350 basis points or lower, I am worried that we would once again return to the zero lower bound.	92	9
201510	558	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because we have lowered the federal funds rate more than 500 basis points in the wake of each of the past three recessions, the potential to hit the zero lower bound seems uncomfortably high.	92	9
201510	559	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	As the paper circulated by President Williams discusses, lower real equilibrium interest rates limit the options available to monetary policymakers to counter contractionary shocks to the economy.	92	9
201510	560	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, further exploring the tolerance of the Committee for expanding the balance sheet to offset average-sized recessions, assessing the effect of balance sheet actions on term premiums, and discussing the cost and benefits of a higher inflation target seem to be the most fruitful areas of discussion at this time.	92	9
201510	561	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	A lower equilibrium real interest rate implies that both the frequency and duration of zero-lower-bound episodes have risen, although it is difficult to know by how much.	92	9
201510	562	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	The past 15 years have already shown us that the frequency and duration were too high.	92	9
201510	563	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	The other implication of a lower real rate will be that we may need to respond to slowdowns with more- aggressive monetary policy actions.	92	9
201510	564	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	This may imply reducing the federal funds rate more quickly and aggressively than we have done in previous economic slowdowns, and we should prepare the public and the Congress over time for the potential that unconventional monetary policies may not be idiosyncratic, associated only with severe financial crises in the future, but may become tools more commonly deployed in economic slowdowns.	92	9
201510	565	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201510	566	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201510	567	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	92	9
201510	568	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201510	569	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	And thanks to everyone who worked on this r* project.	92	9
201510	570	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	The memos provide an excellent summary of the state of knowledge about this important topic.	92	9
201510	571	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	In fact, this topic is central to our policy deliberations.	92	9
201510	572	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	The fundamental question before the Committee this year and next is whether policy is sufficiently accommodative to support currently low inflation rising to our 2 percent objective over the medium term.	92	9
201510	573	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	These memos get to the heart of this issue.	92	9
201510	574	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Does our current zero interest rate policy represent emergency levels of monetary policy accommodation, or is it just slightly accommodative, or is it not really accommodative at all?	92	9
201510	575	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Understanding movements in r* is a way to bring all of these issues together in one place.	92	9
201510	576	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	There’s too much good material in these memos to cover all the interesting observations.	92	9
201510	577	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Here’s a few messages that I took away.	92	9
201510	578	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	First, r* has been falling over time.	92	9
201510	579	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I think President Williams was on target there.	92	9
201510	580	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	These reductions are quite persistent.	92	9
201510	581	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Some analyses, like the DSGE models, assume stationary deviations, and they turn out to be potentially very persistent, depending on the driving process that got us there.	92	9
201510	582	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Other analyses, like Laubach-Williams, assume I(1) permanent changes that persist indefinitely.	92	9
201510	583	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I agree with President Kocherlakota’s e- mail to you quite a lot.	92	9
201510	584	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	92	9
201510	585	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	The most recent Laubach-Williams r* estimates are close to zero and permanent.	92	9
201510	586	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	A very low r* combined with our 2 percent inflation objective implies that dealing with the zero lower bound will continue to be a big risk even once we get inflation back to target.	92	9
201510	587	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	So it’s important that we know how to deal with future situations when our policy rate may be forced to zero.	92	9
201510	588	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I agree with all of the suggestions that we should continue to study our tools that we could bring to bear on that situation when we find ourselves at the effective lower bound again.	92	9
201510	589	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Second, even though it is not totally clear why real rates have been falling, it seems to be a worldwide phenomenon that has been going on for two or three decades.	92	9
201510	590	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I agree with Kei-Mu and Jing that most of the developments that we can foresee suggest r* is going to stay low or maybe fall even lower, leaving us in a world in which the effective lower bound may be frequently binding.	92	9
201510	591	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Third, with r* currently close to zero, we cannot just assume that today’s zero funds rate is providing large amounts of policy accommodation.	92	9
201510	592	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	It appears that we are only below the equilibrium nominal rate by something on the order of 150 basis points.	92	9
201510	593	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Some have characterized our current policy rates as being at an emergency setting, a comment that’s clearly meant to imply that emergency rates are no longer appropriate for current economic conditions.	92	9
201510	594	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	My view from these memos is that having the real funds rate about 150 basis points below r* is not really an emergency setting.	92	9
201510	595	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Maintaining a zero funds rate is just prudent policy following a long period when we would have liked to have put rates much, much lower but couldn’t because of the effective lower bound.	92	9
201510	596	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	These low r* estimates also mean that two or three quarter-point increases in the funds rate could eliminate a good portion of the accommodation that we are finally now able to provide.	92	9
201510	597	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Fourth, uncertainty about r* most likely implies that “lower for longer” is a prudent risk- management policy.	92	9
201510	598	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	It’s not enough to simply point to wide uncertainty bands surrounding r* estimates.	92	9
201510	599	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	We need to assess the variety of policy losses under different realizations of r*.	92	9
201510	600	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Our policy losses are asymmetric at the zero lower bound, and, hence, in David, Chris, Ben, and Bob’s memo, optimal policy delays liftoff and prescribes lower rates until uncertainty about r* and the odds of hitting the effective lower bound are substantially reduced.	92	9
201510	601	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	My Brookings paper with Fisher, Gourio, and Krane reached a similar conclusion on the basis of a different information structure.	92	9
201510	602	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Finally, President Lacker brought up an interesting point and criticism of our monetary policies related to—I can’t really penetrate these models very well—the New Monetarist models with alternative equilibrium calculations.	92	9
201510	603	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I think that if you go out in public, you can hear people make comments like this to us.	92	9
201510	604	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I think it might be worth our time to figure out what is there and what is not.	92	9
201510	605	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Every time I hear the Fisher equation mentioned as an important point in this regard, I’ve come away with the impression that it’s the slavish appeal to an interest rate rule that interacts with the Fisher equation to validate this equilibrium, and it’s really quite fragile.	92	9
201510	606	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	If you were to break from that interest rate rule, and maybe you’ve got a threshold that tells you, “When I get way off target, I break from it,” that’s going to break that equilibrium.	92	9
201510	607	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	These are kind of transversality-type conditions.	92	9
201510	608	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	President Bullard, some years ago, when he was talking about this issue, similarly argued that maybe we should start doing more asset purchases, work the money angle on this.	92	9
201510	609	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	That’s another attempt to break the slavish commitment to that interest rate rule, and that knocks that equilibrium out.	92	9
201510	610	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	It’s outside the model, but in talking about these things, as President Lacker mentioned, if the public starts thinking we’re going after lower inflation, it begins to ratify this.	92	9
201510	611	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	That’s why I think it’s so important for us to recommit ourselves firmly to our inflation objective of 2 percent in an aggressive symmetric approach to that so that people won’t be left with that wrong impression and perhaps validate that type of outcome.	92	9
201510	612	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201510	613	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201510	614	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	92	9
201510	615	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201510	616	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	And thanks to the staff for these memos.	92	9
201510	617	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	They are very thoughtful and stimulating.	92	9
201510	618	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	When I think about r*, I have two concepts in mind, one short run and one long run.	92	9
201510	619	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The short-run r* is consistent with what I think is a neutral monetary policy today, and the long-run r* is what I think will be consistent with neutrality in the long run.	92	9
201510	620	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t have a precise estimate of what either of those are, but I certainly agree that both are likely to be well below what we have seen historically.	92	9
201510	621	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the short-run r*, I would put some weight on the model results, but I also would look elsewhere—simply, how fast has the economy been growing?	92	9
201510	622	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If r* were really close to 2 percent, I doubt we’d be growing at only a slightly above-trend pace right now.	92	9
201510	623	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we also have to be a bit careful and not overemphasize the DSGE model results too much because these models typically have very underdeveloped financial sectors, if they have one at all.	92	9
201510	624	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	This relevant in the current environment, because I think developments in the financial system have been important in depressing the real equilibrium rate.	92	9
201510	625	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s not just about longer-term fundamentals such as productivity growth and demographic trends.	92	9
201510	626	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	For myself, I think that short-run r* has been held down by strict lending standards for mortgages, especially for households with low FICO scores.	92	9
201510	627	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, to the extent we have had higher capital requirements and other regulations, they have weighed on the intermediation margin.	92	9
201510	628	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I would expect those would push down r* slightly, both now and in the longer run.	92	9
201510	629	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think memories of the crisis may also be important through their effects on precautionary saving, less borrowing.	92	9
201510	630	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Presumably, that influence will diminish over time, assuming we don’t have any new crises.	92	9
201510	631	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	As I have noted in speeches for some time, I also think the appropriate stance of policy does depend on how financial conditions evolve because monetary policy is not transmitted directly to the real economy but, instead, through its effect on financial conditions.	92	9
201510	632	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this is particularly important because the linkage between short-term rates and broader financial conditions is not stable through time.	92	9
201510	633	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The events of the fall of 2008 are the most noteworthy example of that.	92	9
201510	634	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Financial conditions tightened abruptly, and this called for a much lower short- term interest rate and response.	92	9
201510	635	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	That implies that the level of short-run r* is affected by financial conditions and how they respond to cyclical, secular, and even political developments.	92	9
201510	636	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	My expectation about the short-run r* is that it will gradually rise over time as some of the financial headwinds generated by the financial crisis fade.	92	9
201510	637	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I would expect that household credit histories and FICO scores will gradually improve as we get further away from the Great Recession.	92	9
201510	638	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, as home prices recover, the number of mortgages that are underwater should decline.	92	9
201510	639	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	This may also lead to a greater access to credit for affected households.	92	9
201510	640	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	At the same time, I don’t expect r* to get all the way back to 2 percent in the long run.	92	9
201510	641	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	So I’m with President Rosengren, 3½ percent on the long-run nominal federal funds rate without a lot of conviction.	92	9
201510	642	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	But it strikes me that an aging population, slower labor force growth, and somewhat slower productivity growth should all be factors that suggest that r* will stay below 2 percent for the foreseeable future.	92	9
201510	643	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, I think it’s important that we don’t overfixate on r* compared with other issues.	92	9
201510	644	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, this issue of how far we want the policy rate to deviate from our short-term r* estimate is also important.	92	9
201510	645	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Presumably, there is a path back to full employment and price stability that is superior to others in terms of its welfare-maximizing attributes.	92	9
201510	646	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	We need to be open-minded about the size of the differential that we should be seeking and not just accept the prescriptions as simple policy rules because those policy rules seem to be doing a good job of describing monetary policy in the past.	92	9
201510	647	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The impetus to economic growth from a given gap between the policy rate and r* might be different now than in the past.	92	9
201510	648	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	And, if that was the case, then that should affect our choice of the policy rate and the size of the gap.	92	9
201510	649	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, I would argue that, currently, risk-management concerns may imply a wider differential than maybe we have had in the past.	92	9
201510	650	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201510	651	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201510	652	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	92	9
201510	653	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201510	654	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	In reflecting on the memo and the presentation, I just have two brief comments related not to the theory but to our current policy decision, what faces us right now.	92	9
201510	655	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	First, I’m on board with the general thrust of the memos that the neutral rate is zero to slightly positive.	92	9
201510	656	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	This implies to me that the policy is currently too accommodative.	92	9
201510	657	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	And I believe this view is broadly consistent with the unemployment rate being close to its natural rate.	92	9
201510	658	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Second, I think that the steady-state r* is probably around 1.75 percent.	92	9
201510	659	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	The US economy is fundamentally sound, and productivity should pick up in the future.	92	9
201510	660	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Because of the after-effects of the financial crisis, neutral r* is below its steady-state value.	92	9
201510	661	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	But it will rise over time, and monetary policy should keep pace with that rise.	92	9
201510	662	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Additionally, and I think this is important, we need to learn, and we will be learning, about r* as normalization proceeds on a shallow path.	92	9
201510	663	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	And we need to see how the economy evolves as interest rates rise.	92	9
201510	664	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	There is an experiment that we will be conducting, and it’s an important experiment, to watch how r* evolves as we move along this shallow path.	92	9
201510	665	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201510	666	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201510	667	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201510	668	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201510	669	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I want to thank all of the presenters and the authors for a great set of memos.	92	9
201510	670	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I find the analysis to be highly informative, as I believe I will illustrate through my comments.	92	9
201510	671	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And, as others have noted, I think this is a very timely topic, in terms not only of the current policy considerations facing the Committee but also in terms of the policy considerations that may be facing the Committee for years to come.	92	9
201510	672	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I have three high-level takeaways from the memo.	92	9
201510	673	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Short-run r* has risen from recessionary lows, and there are good reasons to expect short-run r* to continue to rise.	92	9
201510	674	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	However, there have been significant downward trends in long-run and steady-state r*.	92	9
201510	675	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If those trends were to persist, we should expect short-run r* to remain below its 2007 level for years to come.	92	9
201510	676	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is broadly consistent with the pattern that we see in longer-term TIPS yields.	92	9
201510	677	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There are some issues there about sorting out term premiums from the behavior of expectations of short-run real interest rates, but it is broadly consistent with what we see in longer-term TIPS yields.	92	9
201510	678	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There are many uncertainties associated with the preceding two statements.	92	9
201510	679	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In general, because of the presence of the effective lower bound, those uncertainties argue for more- accommodative policy.	92	9
201510	680	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My summary of these takeaways is that it would be appropriate for the FOMC to use a reaction function, both now and in the future, that has a lower intercept, potentially much lower, than the familiar Taylor rules.	92	9
201510	681	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I want to make two additional comments.	92	9
201510	682	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The first concerns a potentially important takeaway from the memos about the nature of the slope coefficients in the FOMC policy reaction function.	92	9
201510	683	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We focused a lot of the discussion on the intercepts through our conversation about r*.	92	9
201510	684	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The second comment I want to make builds on President Mester’s questions about low r* and measures of financial stability.	92	9
201510	685	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My first comment is about the nature of the slope coefficients in the FOMC policy reaction function.	92	9
201510	686	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The questions at the end of the memo, which I’ll note that most of my colleagues have neatly sidestepped, are about our assessments of r*, with the idea that we could plug those different assessments into a policy rule.	92	9
201510	687	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I have heard from the comments made by others around the table—President Williams, Vice Chairman Dudley—it is pretty hard to know what is driving r*.	92	9
201510	688	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And so I think it is going to be pretty hard to formulate and communicate measures of r* on an ongoing basis.	92	9
201510	689	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, I think the memo by López-Salido and others was potentially helpful along these lines.	92	9
201510	690	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It points out that if we use a Taylor rule with a high coefficient on inflation deviations— and Thomas pointed out that this is a lesson from President Williams’s former work as well—we can substitute for this kind of uncertainty while essentially using a policy rule that tracks variations in r* around its long-run value, without having to measure those variations.	92	9
201510	691	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And the intuition behind this finding, I think, is simple to understand when the only shocks present are to the natural real rate of interest.	92	9
201510	692	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So there are no shocks to the Phillips curve.	92	9
201510	693	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In that case, it is optimal to use a rule that tracks the natural real rate of interest, this so-called “divine coincidence” case.	92	9
201510	694	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If you don’t have shocks to the Phillips curve, you’re going to get divine coincidence.	92	9
201510	695	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Another way to say that, though, is that it’s always optimal to tighten further if inflation is too high and to ease further if inflation is too low.	92	9
201510	696	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That suggests we can get good outcomes by using a rule that has a high coefficient on inflation gaps.	92	9
201510	697	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In a recent working paper, Chris House of the University of Michigan and a student coauthor show that we can get arbitrarily close to desirable outcomes in this no-shocks-to-the-Phillips-curve case by using a rule that has arbitrarily large coefficients on inflation.	92	9
201510	698	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So you don’t have to measure the variations in r* around its long-term value, you just have to track inflation and respond to inflation very aggressively.	92	9
201510	699	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think this is potentially an important lesson.	92	9
201510	700	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As we all talked about already, measuring r* and communicating about it could be very hard.	92	9
201510	701	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Responding a lot more aggressively to inflation is not.	92	9
201510	702	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it’s easy to communicate to the public why you might want to do that.	92	9
201510	703	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s true that inflation isn’t perfectly measured, and this is an important consideration that drives us, for example, to talk about core inflation in a lot of our communications.	92	9
201510	704	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But we could filter it by using forecast inflation instead.	92	9
201510	705	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This was, indeed, a favorite prescription of Chairman Bernanke, and it is also very similar to the goal-oriented approach that President Evans and I have advocated for some time—that you put a lot of weight on your goals, and that drives what your setting of the policy rate would be.	92	9
201510	706	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So that’s my first comment.	92	9
201510	707	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Results in the memo suggest we can track variations in r* around its long-run value, if you were to use a rule that was more aggressive, potentially a lot more aggressive—the memo by López-Salido and others settles on a coefficient of 20—about responding to actual or forecast inflation gaps.	92	9
201510	708	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My second comment follows up on what President Mester was saying about financial stability.	92	9
201510	709	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I did a search of the papers for the words “financial stability,” and it came up blank.	92	9
201510	710	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I didn’t find a single reference to financial stability.	92	9
201510	711	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think this is an important omission that I hope future work will fill.	92	9
201510	712	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	About two and a half years ago, I gave a speech about low r* and financial stability, and I pointed out that if r* is to be low permanently or even high persistently, we are only going to be able to achieve our dual-mandate objectives in the presence of signs of financial stability.	92	9
201510	713	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	President Williams, at our previous meeting, expressed concern that housing markets, at least in California, or potentially in the nation as a whole, were unduly frothy because rent-to-price ratios had fallen back to 2003 levels.	92	9
201510	714	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But if r* is going to be low by previous historical standards for years to come, then we are only going to achieve our dual-mandate objectives if things like the rent-to-price ratio are indeed low by previous historical standards.	92	9
201510	715	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My own thinking is that Kei-Mu and Jing are right, that there are good reasons to believe that r* is likely to be low for years to come.	92	9
201510	716	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If so, it will be even more important for central banks to integrate financial-stability considerations into their policy assessments.	92	9
201510	717	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The QS analysis is a valuable first step along those lines for this Committee, and I will talk about some ways that I hope we can build on it.	92	9
201510	718	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Maybe you can build on that analysis in the next go-round.	92	9
201510	719	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought there already were some very thoughtful comments—I will just echo that I agree with them very strongly—that President Williams and President Rosengren made.	92	9
201510	720	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If r* is going to be low for quite some time to come, that really suggests the need to reevaluate the whole framework of the Committee.	92	9
201510	721	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Are things like LSAPs an emergency tool, a break-the- glass kind of tool, or something that really should be part of the toolkit if r* is going to remain low?	92	9
201510	722	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Contemplating negative interest rates has certainly proven to be useful in Europe as well as potentially contemplating a change in the inflation target itself.	92	9
201510	723	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	All of these, I think, are things for the Committee to think about if, in fact, r* is going to prove to be low for a long time to come.	92	9
201510	724	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But you’ll get some information about that, as President Harker pointed out.	92	9
201510	725	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks a lot.	92	9
201510	726	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201510	727	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	92	9
201510	728	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201510	729	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	I have just a couple of brief comments.	92	9
201510	730	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	According to this excellent staff work, as well as many other estimates and under a variety of definitions, r* has declined over two or three decades to a very low level, now about zero, with no signs yet of recovery.	92	9
201510	731	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	And the markets and a variety of factors suggest that a low r* is likely to be with us for a while.	92	9
201510	732	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	What are the implications of this?	92	9
201510	733	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	In the short term, while r* may be low, short-term rates are now substantially negative.	92	9
201510	734	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	So real short-term rates are providing a good deal of stimulus.	92	9
201510	735	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	For me, that’s appropriate for three reasons: We have inflation below mandate; we have economic growth that is barely above trend; and we have, as page 10 of the handout shows, five years to make up for when the Committee was unable, probably despite significant unconventional monetary policy, to provide adequate support for the economy.	92	9
201510	736	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	For me, the implications of the precise timing of liftoff are more ambiguous.	92	9
201510	737	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	I agree that uncertainty regarding r* argues for some inertia when policymakers are at the zero lower bound.	92	9
201510	738	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Indeed, there are many arguments that support the idea of having inertia at the zero lower bound.	92	9
201510	739	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	But what is the right amount of inertia or patience?	92	9
201510	740	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Is it more or less than the Committee has already employed?	92	9
201510	741	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	This work, to me, doesn’t speak directly to that question.	92	9
201510	742	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	There is also the argument that uncertainty about the level of r* as well as about the level of the natural rate of unemployment should lead us to de-emphasize those factors in setting policy, which tends to lead, then, to something that focuses on the inflation gap, which we are better at observing, and also the change in the output gap, or a first-difference rule.	92	9
201510	743	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	And I would say that the first- difference rule is also consistent with liftoff in the current time frame.	92	9
201510	744	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	So I don’t take any obvious signal about the precise timing of liftoff from this work.	92	9
201510	745	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	I would say that the medium- and longer-term implications of a sustained low r* are clearer and more troubling.	92	9
201510	746	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	If economic growth is going to continue along just a bit above its lackluster trend rate, it would not surprise me if every single rate decision will be very challenging in the coming years.	92	9
201510	747	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	On that growth path, it is going to be extraordinarily difficult— indeed, it would be inappropriate—to raise rates at anything other than a very gradual pace.	92	9
201510	748	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	And, over time, as others have stressed, that very low path implies more frequent and longer episodes at the effective lower bound.	92	9
201510	749	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	On that last point, I read one of Andy Haldane’s clever speeches over the summer titled “Stuck,” which caused me to get into a series of discussions with Bill English and many others.	92	9
201510	750	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	And Bill ran some numbers, which I’ll share.	92	9
201510	751	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Based on historical data, experience suggests that the chance of a recession over the next four years from today is about 40 or 50 percent.	92	9
201510	752	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	The Committee has typically cut rates about 400 basis points, give or take 100 basis points, in a recession.	92	9
201510	753	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	So, if you take the market’s projected path for rates, or even the latest primary dealer survey, you will see that almost any recession for the next several years will return us to zero interest rates.	92	9
201510	754	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	So I would echo what others have said around the table.	92	9
201510	755	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	There really is a need to evaluate all of our tools, including forward guidance, the balance sheet, and negative rates, because much as one might hate to admit it, we may very well need them.	92	9
201510	756	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	In fact, we are likely to need some or all of those tools.	92	9
201510	757	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	The other thing is that a gradual increase in r* to more normal levels is a fundamental assumption underlying the Tealbook forecast for interest rates.	92	9
201510	758	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	And, if this work calls that assumption into question, it really does suggest that the set of issues regarding this question will be the major challenge facing monetary policy in the coming years.	92	9
201510	759	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201510	760	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201510	761	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	92	9
201510	762	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201510	763	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I have many comments on the r* memos.	92	9
201510	764	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Congratulations to the staff on putting together an excellent analysis of this important issue.	92	9
201510	765	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I’ll give you a summary, and then I’ll provide more detail.	92	9
201510	766	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The summary is this.	92	9
201510	767	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	My first comment is that there is a lot of uncertainty about concepts and estimates, and that suggests caution.	92	9
201510	768	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I’ll talk about that a little bit.	92	9
201510	769	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	My second comment is that marginal product of capital is higher and smoother since 1985 than the declining returns on government paper.	92	9
201510	770	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I would take that marginal product of capital to be the more relevant rate, so I’ll talk about that a little bit.	92	9
201510	771	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I’ll talk about the simple New Keynesian model, which was used a lot here in the memo.	92	9
201510	772	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	That model has no capital.	92	9
201510	773	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	It also predicts mean reversion, as we have been talking about already this morning, so I think there are two strikes against that particular model and the policy implications coming out of that.	92	9
201510	774	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I’ll talk a little bit about the Laubach- Williams model-based r* estimate.	92	9
201510	775	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I’d prefer an independent measurement of real returns.	92	9
201510	776	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	On policy, I have several comments.	92	9
201510	777	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	For r* itself, I am going to suggest sticking with constants or modifying the constants only slightly.	92	9
201510	778	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	These are, after all, 25-year trends that we are talking about in a lot of this work.	92	9
201510	779	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I’m also going to say that adopting radical values for r* would require a rhetorical shift on the Committee that I’m not sure we’re really prepared for.	92	9
201510	780	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	We can talk about that a little bit.	92	9
201510	781	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The real returns to government paper have clearly declined, suggesting a safe asset shortage.	92	9
201510	782	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think the policy implications of that are unclear.	92	9
201510	783	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	And, finally, the permanence of the Laubach-Williams estimate suggests possible convergence to a low nominal interest rate–low inflation steady state delineated by Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohé, and Uribe, which has also already been discussed this morning.	92	9
201510	784	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I have a lot of comments.	92	9
201510	785	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I apologize for that.	92	9
201510	786	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	But I just wanted to get my thoughts on the table here.	92	9
201510	787	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Let’s take these one by one.	92	9
201510	788	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	First, regarding uncertainty about the concepts and estimates, the memos clearly indicated that there are a lot of ideas about theoretical concepts relevant to r* and that these concepts are used in different ways by different authors.	92	9
201510	789	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Empirical estimates also vary widely and use different versions of the underlying theoretical constructs.	92	9
201510	790	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The initial table explaining the issue has a myriad of different definitions.	92	9
201510	791	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	This, of course, leads to considerable uncertainty in interpreting empirical results and the associated policy advice.	92	9
201510	792	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	So the first comment is just that we should be quite careful about relying too heavily on new interpretations of r* as a driver of US monetary policy.	92	9
201510	793	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The second comment concerns marginal product of capital versus the returns to government debt.	92	9
201510	794	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	A lot of the empirical results contained in these memos are essentially stating that the real rate of return on government paper today is very low by historical standards.	92	9
201510	795	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The real rate of return to capital, as calculated by Gomme, Ravikumar, and Rupert, and by others, tends to be higher and shows little or no downward trend since 1985.	92	9
201510	796	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The marginal product of capital may be the more relevant concept for real macroeconomic performance, and it is not indicating substantially different behavior from postwar history.	92	9
201510	797	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The high price and corresponding low real returns of government paper suggest that the idea that there is “a shortage of safe assets” globally may have considerable merit.	92	9
201510	798	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	This idea has been analyzed by authors like Caballero and Farhi as well as Andolfatto and Williamson.	92	9
201510	799	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	In these papers, government debt has liquidity value, collateral value, or both.	92	9
201510	800	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	But the policy implications are far from fully settled, and we would need quite a bit more work to put a lot of weight on that.	92	9
201510	801	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The third set of comments concerns the simple New Keynesian models.	92	9
201510	802	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The results on the marginal product of capital versus returns to government debt call into question the policy advice in the memo stemming from the use of the simple New Keynesian model alone.	92	9
201510	803	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	As useful as that model is, there is no capital in the model.	92	9
201510	804	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	If there was capital, its return might be expected to be falling in tandem with the returns on government paper over the past 25 years, which is arguably not happening in the data.	92	9
201510	805	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	In addition, the simple New Keynesian model has a unique steady-state equilibrium, so the model predicts mean reversion of r* to its long-run value.	92	9
201510	806	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	As Laubach and Williams point out, comically but also tragically, in their figure 10, repeated predictions of an imminent rise in r* have turned out to be incorrect during the past six years.	92	9
201510	807	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The time scale over which the Laubach-Williams estimate of a low r* value is beyond ordinary business-cycle frequencies, possibly indicating, instead, convergence to a low nominal interest rate–low inflation steady state.	92	9
201510	808	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	In the fourth set of comments, Laubach and Williams take a longer-run view in their paper and use multivariate estimation with a common filter to interpret recent US inflation behavior as suggesting that potential output must be on a lower path than previously believed and, therefore, that r* must be lower.	92	9
201510	809	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The nature of this analysis is summarized in the outstanding quote from the 1931 QJE article by John H.	92	9
201510	810	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Williams, affectionately known as “H” among the Williams economists.	92	9
201510	811	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	[Laughter]	92	9
201510	812	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	In a nutshell, r* is calculated under the null hypothesis that the model is true.	92	9
201510	813	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Although I think this is an interesting exercise, I would prefer to see independent estimates concerning the relevant rates of return, such as marginal product of capital.	92	9
201510	814	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	For comments on policy, the first comment concerns constants in the intercept term.	92	9
201510	815	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The original Taylor rule-type analyses have constants for r*.	92	9
201510	816	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Much of the usefulness and intuition behind the success of the Taylor rule is based on this type of formulation.	92	9
201510	817	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	It is far from clear that the use of a time-varying version would have worked better over the postwar era.	92	9
201510	818	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The spirit of the original analysis was that the real returns most relevant to economic growth and development, like the marginal product of capital, are relatively smooth and well approximated by a constant.	92	9
201510	819	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Ideas about real rates based on consumption growth or TFP plus population growth also provide relatively smooth measures, which might be viewed as consistent with the original Taylor rule analysis.	92	9
201510	820	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	My advice on this dimension is that we stick with constants or modify them only slightly.	92	9
201510	821	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	A second comment on policy:  Taking on a more radical interpretation of r*, an estimate like the one reported by Vasco Cúrdia, who is at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, which is minus 2 percent, would imply that US monetary policy is currently not accommodative.	92	9
201510	822	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	At least that would be one interpretation.	92	9
201510	823	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	This would require, in my opinion, a dramatic shift in Committee rhetoric, which has repeatedly emphasized “highly accommodative” policy over the past five years.	92	9
201510	824	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	This is probably far too dramatic a shift in rhetoric to be credible.	92	9
201510	825	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think if we wanted to go in that direction, we could do it, but we have told people that we are aiding the recovery, that we have done all we can, we have supplemented zero rates with many other actions, promises to stay at zero longer, and quantitative easing.	92	9
201510	826	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	So we have said that we have a highly accommodative policy.	92	9
201510	827	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think it would be a little bit jarring to say, “Well, you know, it’s not that accommodative after all.”	92	9
201510	828	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	We could make that argument, but it would certainly be a shock, maybe to ourselves and to how people outside this Committee have been thinking about monetary policy over the past five or six years.	92	9
201510	829	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The third comment on policy is that, while the marginal product of capital has arguably held relatively steady, real returns to government debt have declined for many years.	92	9
201510	830	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	This suggests that the “shortage of safe assets” story is a promising direction for future thinking on monetary policy.	92	9
201510	831	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Policy implications are unsettled.	92	9
201510	832	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The last comment on policy is that the permanence of the decline in real returns to government debt and related assets suggests the possibility of convergence to a new steady state, as analyzed by Benhabib and others.	92	9
201510	833	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	If that is the case, then promising an even longer time at the zero bound, directly or through quantitative easing, is not doing anything except reinforcing the BSU steady state.	92	9
201510	834	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201510	835	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201510	836	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	A two-hander from President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201510	837	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I wanted to comment on President Bullard’s point about the rhetoric from the Committee about accommodation.	92	9
201510	838	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think, certainly, the Committee has pointed out that we have used a lot of historically unprecedented forms of accommodation given the fact that we are at the zero lower bound.	92	9
201510	839	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s what I always took the rhetoric about high levels of accommodation to mean—that our tools, because of the evolution of the economy, had to be historically unprecedented.	92	9
201510	840	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I do not think that the American public believes that the economy has evolved according to what would be deemed as being appropriate over the past five or six years.	92	9
201510	841	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I don’t think it will come as a shock for them to find out that inflation has been below target for seven years, or that output has been growing so slowly.	92	9
201510	842	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I don’t think it would take a major change in communications, simply more focusing on the outcomes of our policy on inflation and output.	92	9
201510	843	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s what gives rise to calculations like Cúrdia’s.	92	9
201510	844	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	92	9
201510	845	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I will follow up on this conversation about communications.	92	9
201510	846	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think the very helpful work that the staff presented to us is quite illuminating for how we think about as well as how we talk about what we mean by “normalization.”	92	9
201510	847	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I went to our website, and it equates normalization with steps to raise the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates to more normal levels.	92	9
201510	848	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	But it begs the question, what are more normal levels?	92	9
201510	849	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	It clearly implies that the target range for the federal funds rate is currently below normal.	92	9
201510	850	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	We haven’t, I don’t think, explicitly defined what we mean by “normal,” but the central tendency, or the median, of the path in the SEP might reasonably be considered a rough guide.	92	9
201510	851	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	And by that proxy, the definition of normal has moved down noticeably at all horizons over the course of the Committee’s discussion of what normal is.	92	9
201510	852	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think today’s discussion, and the work that we do based on it, does provide a common analytical framework that should help us get to a more common definition of what we have in mind with “normal.”	92	9
201510	853	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	It also perhaps can help educate the public, which I think is very important.	92	9
201510	854	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think what stands out from the work that was presented here, from the empirical estimates of the shorter-run natural rate of interest from the DSGE models and the other important work that has been done in this area, is that a wide variety of models suggest that r* has been negative in recent years and is only now approaching or is close to zero six years into the recovery.	92	9
201510	855	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	With these estimates far below the average level in previous decades, it implies that the accommodation associated with any given level of the federal funds rate has fallen short of what one might have been thinking about in historical terms.	92	9
201510	856	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	And those shorter-run estimates imply that the current level of the federal funds rate is likely to be mildly accommodative, something that might help explain the very gradual pace of expansion in activity and, in particular, despite being low by historical standards, a very long period of low rates has coincided with only modest growth in investment throughout the recovery.	92	9
201510	857	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	There are, I think, a host of observable reasons that the natural rate might be low currently.	92	9
201510	858	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	And, of course, earlier in the recovery, the dominant explanations focused on domestic factors and headwinds from the crisis.	92	9
201510	859	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	More recently, I think it’s likely that the foreign outlook has become increasingly important as a source of downward pressure on short-run r*.	92	9
201510	860	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Weak economic growth trajectories are now the norm in much of the world.	92	9
201510	861	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	And, as we know, in the other G-7 economies we have seen a very large shift down in 10-year sovereign bond yields, a shift that has been persistent over the past year or so.	92	9
201510	862	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	But also, interestingly, if we look at emerging markets, we have seen a broad-based reduction in interest rates with average real Treasury bill rates falling from about 5 percent earlier to around zero in recent times.	92	9
201510	863	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The way this would spill over into our rates would be through adjustments in the exchange rate.	92	9
201510	864	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think the staff provided a useful simulation to get a sense of how big an adjustment in the federal funds rate might be necessary to restore monetary policy to “normal” in the sense of insulating domestic employment from an appreciation in the dollar.	92	9
201510	865	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	So let’s just take a 10 percent appreciation of the dollar, which is the experiment that they ran, which is about two-thirds of the movement that we have seen in the past year alone.	92	9
201510	866	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	It suggests that in the context of a Taylor (1999) rule with a fixed intercept, normalization of monetary policy in the sense of insulating us from this exchange rate shock would call for lowering the intercept about 60 basis points.	92	9
201510	867	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	And because we’re in the neighborhood of the effective lower bound, that means that you push off liftoff as well as pull the path down.	92	9
201510	868	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Another benchmark we use for determining what constitutes normal is the medium-term FRB/US r*.	92	9
201510	869	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	And there we have seen that, by that metric, the current stance of policy is quite accommodative relative to what would be prescribed by that, which is the level of the funds rate that, if maintained, would close the output gap in 12 quarters.	92	9
201510	870	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	What is important, I think, is that that benchmark actually takes no account of inflation.	92	9
201510	871	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	If you look at that benchmark, it gets us to 1 percent above where we should be on the output gap, and we are still shy of our 2 percent inflation target at the end of the 12 quarters, suggesting that if we cared a lot about inflation, we would actually want a more accommodative stance.	92	9
201510	872	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Or, similarly, we are pretty far along in the recovery, and if we instead wanted to think about policy normalization as closing the output gap in, say, 4 quarters instead of 12 quarters, again, that benchmark regarding what constitutes normal would suggest a lower federal funds rate would be appropriate right now.	92	9
201510	873	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think the discussion around the table has also been good at focusing on several factors that suggest that the medium-run or even long-run natural rate of interest has also shifted down.	92	9
201510	874	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	And for reasons that many people around the table have talked about, and that resonate a great deal with me, if we believe there has been such a shift down, we would want to think very seriously about what that implies for the likelihood that we see the policy rate returning to the effective lower bound with more frequency and with longer duration than has been the case historically.	92	9
201510	875	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	And, in that context, risk-management considerations and the asymmetry of them, I think, would lead one to counsel a cautious stance even today.	92	9
201510	876	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Finally, I think the likely low level of the natural rate of interest in today’s conditions, and the implications for what can be considered normal monetary policy, do suggest we should be thinking very much about our communications and devoting some care and attention to how we talk about what “normal” means and is likely to mean as we go forward.	92	9
201510	877	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think it is very striking that there is a draft bill in the Congress that would codify a 2 percent intercept in a Taylor equation as the benchmark by which monetary policy would be evaluated at a time when most researchers believe the empirical regularities that underpinned that relationship are unlikely to hold.	92	9
201510	878	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think several around the table have also suggested that it may lead us to want to reevaluate unconventional tools and consider whether they will need to be used more frequently.	92	9
201510	879	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	If that is the case, we should really start communicating that now, because I believe there are much higher bars for returning to a realm of unconventional tools than there are for simple adjustments of the interest rate up and down.	92	9
201510	880	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201510	881	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201510	882	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	92	9
201510	883	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201510	884	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Like everyone else, I would like to thank the authors for their very good work, and I would add to their four papers, the paper sent to the FOMC by John Williams, one of those he wrote with Thomas Laubach, “Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest Redux.”	92	9
201510	885	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	I was all ready to summarize everything, and then I looked at exhibit 13 and realized that they had copied what I was going to say and put it into their presentation.	92	9
201510	886	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	It’s on page 13 of the handout, “Equilibrium Real Interest Rates.”	92	9
201510	887	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	I think that it is a good a statement of what the overall findings are in the very interesting work that we have been presented.	92	9
201510	888	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Obviously, the finding that everyone knows is that the natural rate of interest has fallen sharply and shows few signs of recovering.	92	9
201510	889	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	That’s happened since the start of the Great Recession, and it is a common finding among all of the papers.	92	9
201510	890	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	There is, I think, another key point, and here I’m going to diverge a little from what everyone has been talking about.	92	9
201510	891	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	The point is that r* also depends on a set of other variables, some of which are policy-related—for example, fiscal policy; productivity growth, I don’t know to what extent it is policy-related; the real exchange rate, which is monetary policy-related; the relative price of energy; and demographics.	92	9
201510	892	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	All of these are factors affecting r*, and I think we need to start talking about what it is that moved r* more than using r* as a shorthand way of saying, “We’ve got to keep the interest rate very low.”	92	9
201510	893	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	I say that for two reasons.	92	9
201510	894	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	I think we need to speak up much more about the policy responsibilities of other agencies in this town, including the fiscal authorities, which I know we are not allowed to do, but I am never quite sure why.	92	9
201510	895	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	All other central banks do it.	92	9
201510	896	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	And I suspect that productivity growth will have far more influence on future r* than what it is that we do with the interest rate.	92	9
201510	897	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	The interest rate works through investment.	92	9
201510	898	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Since Solow’s initial paper, there hasn’t been another paper that says technical change is not the main driver of economic growth.	92	9
201510	899	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	And I suspect we will end up there one day.	92	9
201510	900	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	I have been trying to figure out what is the use of r*.	92	9
201510	901	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	You read Wicksell, and it is either brilliantly simple or it’s too simple.	92	9
201510	902	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	It says there is a marginal rate of return on capital.	92	9
201510	903	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	And when the interest rate is below that, then there is going to be a high level of investment and more inflation.	92	9
201510	904	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	And when the marginal product of capital is below the interest rate, then we are going to get deflation.	92	9
201510	905	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	And so there is a rate which will keep the price level constant.	92	9
201510	906	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Well, that’s what we calculate in our models, and we get a measure of r* that takes us back to a steady state of some sort over 12 quarters, and that’s what we use.	92	9
201510	907	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	But why don’t we just use the models?	92	9
201510	908	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	What is the extra that we get out of the r* as opposed to what we get out of the different models we consult when we are looking at different policies, which would take us to where we want to go?	92	9
201510	909	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	It was very interesting that one of the findings was that, using r* instead of a calculated optimal policy, you could actually do fairly well.	92	9
201510	910	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Well, that’s an interesting reason to want to know r*.	92	9
201510	911	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	But how do you think—I’m asking the authors.	92	9
201510	912	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	How do you think about r* and what its uses are?	92	9
201510	913	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	It’s obviously a shorthand for us.	92	9
201510	914	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	But as we talk about it, I have a sense very much that it gets more weight in our minds than it should, and that we should also be focusing on other variables.	92	9
201510	915	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Well, to end, I was naive and I tried to answer the three questions.	92	9
201510	916	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	I guess next time, if the other students would only tell me which questions you have to answer, I’d do much better.	92	9
201510	917	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I’ve spoken on that before.	92	9
201510	918	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	It’s a rookie mistake.	92	9
201510	919	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	92	9
201510	920	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Anyway, what does your estimate of current r* imply for the degree of accommodation provided by current monetary policy?	92	9
201510	921	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	I think almost everybody said it—r* is somewhere around zero.	92	9
201510	922	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	The real rate is somewhere around minus 1 percent, minus 1½ percent.	92	9
201510	923	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	So we have, I think, adequate accommodation, which will be higher when the inflation rate rises, I assume, or when productivity growth rises.	92	9
201510	924	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	And, yesterday, in another meeting, some of us here saw a staff model forecast that I’m not sure has been generally accepted by the staff, which showed productivity growth returning to 1½ percent from next year.	92	9
201510	925	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t know if there is anything other than convenience in that chart.	92	9
201510	926	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	What did the exchange rate do to r*?	92	9
201510	927	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	The appreciation probably temporarily reduced r*.	92	9
201510	928	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	And then the third one was, how do I expect r* to evolve, and what are the implications for the appropriate future path of the policy rate?	92	9
201510	929	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Well, there is great uncertainty about future r*.	92	9
201510	930	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	That is what is clear from the various factors that have been mentioned as determining it in the various papers that we have.	92	9
201510	931	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	If productivity goes up at a reasonable rate, if animal spirits return, I assume that r* will rise.	92	9
201510	932	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	If we stay stuck in roughly the equilibrium we are in now, I think that people will begin to be very worried that there is not much in the future and it could potentially fall.	92	9
201510	933	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	My bottom line is that r* is useful.	92	9
201510	934	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Which is what I think is said at the first line of exhibit 13: “r* is a relevant, albeit complex, benchmark to guide the stance of monetary policy.”	92	9
201510	935	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Well, it’s not a definitive benchmark.	92	9
201510	936	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	It’s not the pole star of whether monetary policy is right, but it is something useful that we need to consult.	92	9
201510	937	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	But I think that if we want to get full analyses of the policies we are undertaking, we still need to use models.	92	9
201510	938	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	92	9
201510	939	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201510	940	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	92	9
201510	941	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to the staff for these papers.	92	9
201510	942	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I tried to think over the past several days about my answer to number 3, how is r* likely to evolve, and what are observable factors that, at least, I will be watching to try to figure that out.	92	9
201510	943	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	And I probably didn’t like the answer to my own question, in that, number one, the decline in the working-age population in the United States, that demographic, is a major factor.	92	9
201510	944	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Two, another factor is globalization, and related to globalization, the demographic challenges not only in Japan but in China, which has a severe demographic problem and one that will evolve and grow over the coming years.	92	9
201510	945	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I also believe we are on the flip side of the—for lack of a better term—debt supercycle.	92	9
201510	946	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	We spent the past number of decades leveraging up.	92	9
201510	947	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	We are now more recently, since the crisis, on the flip side of that debt supercycle, and we are having to deal with deleveraging, which I assume has to bring down r*.	92	9
201510	948	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	And then, finally, more regulation in general, across industries in our economy—much of it in financial services was desperately needed—has contributed to the fall in r*.	92	9
201510	949	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	When I look at all of these factors, which are transitory or cyclical and which are secular, almost all of them, unfortunately, appear to me to be secular—that is, they are going to be with us for an extended period of time.	92	9
201510	950	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	So, these are the fundamental issues that I will be looking at, in the years to come, that I would think will result in downward pressure on r* in general, all things being equal.	92	9
201510	951	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201510	952	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	92	9
201510	953	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201510	954	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I, too, would like to thank the staff for a very thorough discussion.	92	9
201510	955	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	For someone like me, who is not deeply experienced in the literature, this is very helpful.	92	9
201510	956	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I would like to just make a few comments on short-term practical considerations in answer to the questions.	92	9
201510	957	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	First, on the question of the current degree of accommodation, the message I take from the second and third memos is that an operating assumption of r* being around zero would not be unreasonable.	92	9
201510	958	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	This is in the ballpark of my working assumption.	92	9
201510	959	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	If I connect that thought with my sense of the degree of remaining slack in the economy and the shortfall of inflation from our objective, I would conclude that the degree of monetary accommodation is not too far from where it should be, though a modest increase in the funds rate target is supportable.	92	9
201510	960	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	On the question of how recent financial conditions and developments affect my notion of r*, I tend to view those developments as risk factors with respect to the outlook more than factors that drive an estimate of r*, which I’d view as a benchmark in any event.	92	9
201510	961	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	So recent financial conditions and the exchange value of the dollar were definitely factors leading to my support for a delay of liftoff at the September meeting, but I am just treating them as emergent risk factors.	92	9
201510	962	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	On the third question about how r* might evolve and what the implications would be, I expect that the underlying value of r* will evolve slowly enough to justify low funds rate targets by historical norms for the foreseeable future.	92	9
201510	963	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I did think the risk-management exercise in the fourth memo was interesting.	92	9
201510	964	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	My own sense is that the economy is firming up enough that the insurance policy aspect of maintaining the funds rate at its effective lower bound is passing or has passed.	92	9
201510	965	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Those are my comments.	92	9
201510	966	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201510	967	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Well, thank you to everyone for a very interesting and productive discussion, and especially to the staff for an excellent set of memos and presentations.	92	9
201510	968	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let me just say that r* has always played a key role in my own thinking about the appropriate stance of policy, and, at various times, a related notion we have called the neutral funds rate has played a central role in FOMC communications about monetary policy strategy.	92	9
201510	969	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Frankly, I think it could potentially assume a more important role as we go forward.	92	9
201510	970	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I will come back to r* in my economic and policy remarks later on.	92	9
201510	971	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	But, for now, if you would permit me, I would like to add a couple of comments of my own on the three questions posed by the staff.	92	9
201510	972	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	The first question pertains to my assessment of current r* and the applied degree of monetary policy accommodation.	92	9
201510	973	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I read the staff memos and the Laubach-Williams paper as confirming that short-run r* is currently quite low, near zero, or, according to some of the DSGE model estimates, below zero.	92	9
201510	974	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	That is higher than the real funds rate at present, but not by all that much.	92	9
201510	975	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think that’s consistent with the fact that economic growth at present appears to be running near or only slightly above trend.	92	9
201510	976	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	And it means that the stance of monetary policy is only modestly accommodative at the current time.	92	9
201510	977	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	It is certainly not imprudently expansionary, especially taking the current low rate of inflation into account.	92	9
201510	978	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	The second question pertains to the effect of the dollar on r*.	92	9
201510	979	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think that is an important question.	92	9
201510	980	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	It is difficult to pin down because the stance of US monetary policy is a key influence on the exchange rate.	92	9
201510	981	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	When we are perceived to be pursuing a tighter policy than previously anticipated, the dollar will rise endogenously.	92	9
201510	982	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	That said, I think it’s reasonable to argue that the marked appreciation of the dollar over the past year mostly reflected policy and economic developments abroad that were independent of our own policy actions and statements.	92	9
201510	983	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	And, if that’s the case, the dollar appreciation would certainly have worked to hold down the short-run natural rate of interest, particularly as movements in the dollar tend to be highly persistent.	92	9
201510	984	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	The analysis by Board staff using the FRB/US model that was distributed last night suggests that a 10 percent depreciation of the broad real exchange rate—it’s about what we have seen over the previous year—would lower the equilibrium real interest rate about 60 basis points.	92	9
201510	985	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	That assumes the initial appreciation fades away substantially over the following six years.	92	9
201510	986	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	That is a large effect.	92	9
201510	987	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	But if the upward shift in the real exchange rate, in contrast, is expected to be more persistent, the FRB/US model calculations suggest that the implied decline in the equilibrium rate would be on the order of 1 full percentage point.	92	9
201510	988	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	And I will say that I view the appreciation of the dollar over the past year, and the resulting downward movement in r*, as a key reason why, in my view, we have not yet lifted off, and for me, it certainly is a reason why my own SEP funds rate path has moved down and flattened.	92	9
201510	989	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	The final question pertains to the likely path of r* over time.	92	9
201510	990	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I interpreted the results reported by the staff as generally consistent with my own view that r* is likely to rise gradually over the next few years but only to a level that is rather low by historical standards.	92	9
201510	991	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I do suspect that the DSGE model simulation results may overstate the level to which the funds rate will eventually need to climb because the steady states of the DSGE models don’t take fully into account the staff’s separate analysis of longer-run trends in the real interest rate and the factors driving those trends.	92	9
201510	992	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think the longer-run estimates reported by staff are pretty much in line with my own expectation that the federal funds rate is likely to settle down only at around 3¼ percent or so over the next decade.	92	9
201510	993	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	That said, whether the underlying strength of the economy will actually improve this much over the next few years is highly uncertain, and the evidence in statistical models, like Laubach-Williams, that the natural rate of interest has shown no signs to date of recovering, suggest to me that the very gradually sloping market-implied path for short-term rates may well end up being a better forecast of future short rates than the more steeply sloped median funds rate projection in our SEP.	92	9
201510	994	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there.	92	9
201510	995	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think at this point we should take a break for lunch, and we will be celebrating, wishing our colleague farewell in a more formal way.	92	9
201510	996	2015-10-28	meeting		[Lunch recess]	92	9
201510	997	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201510	998	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we get started again.	92	9
201510	999	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Our next topic is “Financial Developments and Open Market Operations.”	61	6
201510	1000	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let me call on Lorie Logan to start us off.	61	6
201510	1001	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201510	1002	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	When we met in September, Simon discussed the financial market turbulence that followed the renminbi devaluation in early August.	61	6
201510	1003	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	That volatility abated in recent weeks, and financial conditions retraced some of their earlier tightening, in part because of a perception that the risks of a severe downturn in China and other emerging markets had declined somewhat.	61	6
201510	1004	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Expectations that advanced-economy central banks would provide a more accommodative path of monetary policy also played an important role.	61	6
201510	1005	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Despite the stabilization, some financial markets appear to signal a subdued outlook for the global economy.	61	6
201510	1006	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	In this regard, two areas of continued focus among market participants are the low levels of inflation compensation and the continued widening in some credit spreads.	61	6
201510	1007	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	The decline in market turbulence over the period can be seen in the top-left panel of your first exhibit, which shows that option-implied volatility fell across several asset classes.	61	6
201510	1008	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	The drop in equity-implied volatility, in dark blue, was particularly striking, and currency-implied volatility, in light blue, fell back to levels seen before the renminbi devaluation.	61	6
201510	1009	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Implied volatility of longer-term interest rates, shown in red, was steadier.	61	6
201510	1010	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants have suggested that the relative stability of longer-term rates may reflect the tendency since the renminbi devaluation for the effects of so-called flights to quality, or their reversal, to be offset by fluctuations in reserve manager selling of US dollar assets to fund foreign exchange intervention.	61	6
201510	1011	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Alongside the fall in market volatility, emerging market asset prices reversed a portion of the sharp declines seen over the summer, and outflows from emerging market bond and equity funds appear to have decelerated, as shown in the top-right panel.	61	6
201510	1012	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Despite the recent retracement, emerging market asset prices remain well below levels from earlier in the year.	61	6
201510	1013	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants remain concerned about potential spillovers occurring from a slowdown in China and about possible terms-of- trade shocks that will result in economic and financial challenges for countries closely tied to the export of commodities.	61	6
201510	1014	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	In China, authorities took a number of actions over the intermeeting period to address risks related to capital outflows and weakening economic growth.	61	6
201510	1015	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	In particular, PBOC intervention stabilized the renminbi and supported a convergence between the spot onshore and offshore renminbi–US dollar exchange rates, as shown in the middle-left panel.	61	6
201510	1016	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	The willingness and ability of the PBOC to stabilize the renminbi and converge the onshore and offshore rates increased market confidence in its ability to contain renminbi depreciation.	61	6
201510	1017	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	This may have helped to produce a partial repair of confidence in Chinese policymakers’ broad ability to address the weakening economic outlook in China; that confidence had been fragile following some policy actions in recent months.	61	6
201510	1018	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Additionally, some estimates suggest that Chinese FX intervention has slowed recently as pressure from capital outflows became less acute, although it is difficult to judge this with any confidence given the limitations of available data.	61	6
201510	1019	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Chinese authorities pursued a number of other policy initiatives over the period to support growth, including cuts to interest rates, reserve requirements, and liberalizing bank deposit rates.	61	6
201510	1020	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Further, the PBOC made final preparations for the introduction of a global payment system later this year and announced that some international institutions, including foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds, will now have direct access to the onshore interbank foreign exchange market.	61	6
201510	1021	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	These later steps appear to be aimed at further liberalizing the international use of the renminbi and increasing the odds of its inclusion in the IMF’s SDR basket.	61	6
201510	1022	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	It is not clear how much direct effect these later policy announcements had on market participants’ outlook for the Chinese economy, but they may have helped to bolster sentiment toward Chinese policymaking in the near term.	61	6
201510	1023	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Also underpinning the stabilization in markets were increased expectations regarding monetary policy accommodation in the major advanced foreign economies.	61	6
201510	1024	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	These expectations were driven in part by tepid incoming data on output and inflation and continued declines in and low levels of global measures of inflation compensation, shown in the middle-right panel.	61	6
201510	1025	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Communications stemming from the ECB’s meeting on October 22 bolstered expectations that it would continue its asset purchase program well beyond September 2016.	61	6
201510	1026	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	In addition, comments by President Draghi during his press conference led market participants to believe that the ECB’s effective lower bound on euro-area policy rates is lower than previously indicated and, therefore, to expect a modest further reduction in the ECB’s policy rates later this year.	61	6
201510	1027	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	The bottom-left panel shows the EONIA forward curve after the September, in dark blue, and October, in light blue, ECB meetings.	61	6
201510	1028	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Assuming the spread between the EONIA and deposit rates remains around its current level, the forward curve reflects greater-than-even odds on a 10 basis point cut to the deposit rate by the January ECB meeting.	61	6
201510	1029	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	This would bring the deposit rate to negative 30 basis points.	61	6
201510	1030	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Expectations regarding monetary policy in Japan and the United Kingdom also shifted.	61	6
201510	1031	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the bottom-right panel, UK sterling futures, in dark blue, declined moderately; these rates now price in an increase in the Bank Rate in the fourth quarter of 2016, a shift out of two quarters over the period.	61	6
201510	1032	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	While short-rate futures in Japan, in red, were relatively little changed, the Japanese yield curve flattened a bit, as expectations built that the BOJ would step up the pace of its JGB and ETF purchase programs later this week.	61	6
201510	1033	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	The moves in financial markets over the period were also underpinned by a shift in expectations toward a later liftoff by the Federal Reserve as well as by a slower expected pace of tightening thereafter.	61	6
201510	1034	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	In addition to the Committee’s decision not to tighten policy at the September meeting and its communications associated with that decision, the shift in expectations was driven by weaker-than-expected domestic data—particularly the September Employment Situation report—and ongoing concerns about global economic growth.	61	6
201510	1035	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	The market-implied probability of liftoff before year-end is now about one chance in three, as shown in the top-left panel of your next exhibit, and the market-implied probability of liftoff occurring at this meeting is near zero.	61	6
201510	1036	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	The average probabilities derived from the Desk’s primary dealer and buy-side surveys are in line with these market-based measures.	61	6
201510	1037	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	In addition, the path of the policy rate implied by market prices, shown in the top- right panel, flattened substantially and now rises to only a bit above 1 percent by the end of 2017.	61	6
201510	1038	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Consistent with the flattening in the market-implied path, survey respondents revised lower their expectations for the pace of tightening.	61	6
201510	1039	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-left panel, the average expected pace of tightening in the first and second years after liftoff, conditional on not returning to the zero lower bound, fell to their lowest levels since we introduced this question on the surveys last year.	61	6
201510	1040	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	The middle-right panel presents information about inflation and energy prices.	61	6
201510	1041	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	As can be seen, five-year, five-year-forward inflation, the dark blue line, stabilized somewhat over the period, edging down only slightly after having declined sharply since mid-2014.	61	6
201510	1042	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	This stabilization coincided with a similar bottoming-out in spot oil prices, the light blue line.	61	6
201510	1043	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Far-forward inflation compensation remains close to its lowest levels since March 2009.	61	6
201510	1044	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	In contrast, expected inflation over the same horizon in the Desk’s surveys has been relatively steady at around 2.15 percent.	61	6
201510	1045	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	The Desk’s most recent surveys asked respondents to rate the importance of various factors in explaining the difference between the survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations and the market-based measures.	61	6
201510	1046	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	The responses, which are not shown, suggested that survey respondents put significant weight on three explanations: “inertia” in survey expectations, differences in inflation expectations embedded in survey- and market-based measures, and risk or liquidity premiums in market measures.	61	6
201510	1047	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	More generally, we continue to hear a range of explanations for the low levels of far-forward inflation compensation.	61	6
201510	1048	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Many market participants cite liquidity premiums or “technical factors” unrelated to fundamental macroeconomic expectations.	61	6
201510	1049	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	However, we have not found much direct evidence of increased liquidity strains in the TIPS market, and some market participants have noted that the decline in far-forward inflation compensation seems quite large and persistent for an effect driven by these types of nonfundamental factors alone.	61	6
201510	1050	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Other market participants focus more on how measures of inflation compensation may reflect concerns about low inflation over the next decade and note that negative inflation risk premiums may also be cause for concern.	61	6
201510	1051	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	High-yield corporate credit spreads, shown in the bottom-left panel, continued to widen over the period.	61	6
201510	1052	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	The widening was fairly broad based and not confined to extractive industries affected by recent declines in commodity prices, although spreads on debt of firms exposed to those factors have risen sharply.	61	6
201510	1053	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Moreover, the widening in spreads was also seen in related markets, such as that for commercial mortgage-backed securities.	61	6
201510	1054	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Contacts attribute the widening in corporate credit to a range of factors, including concerns about global growth, a rise in corporate leverage, and a variety of idiosyncratic issues related to individual firms or industries.	61	6
201510	1055	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	To summarize, domestic financial conditions generally eased over the period, as shown in the bottom-right panel.	61	6
201510	1056	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Equity prices increased amid a decline in volatility and real interest rates fell as expectations for monetary policy accommodation increased.	61	6
201510	1057	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	The dollar, for its part, was little changed on net, as expectations for policy rates declined across advanced economies.	61	6
201510	1058	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	As the table shows, standard indicators of financial conditions have now retraced much of the tightening that took place following the August devaluation of the renminbi, the notable exception being credit.	61	6
201510	1059	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Importantly, though, the broader retracement occurred alongside a buildup in expectations for substantially more accommodative monetary policy.	61	6
201510	1060	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	I will now turn to money markets and operational matters.	61	6
201510	1061	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Testing of the Federal Reserve’s RRP operations proceeded smoothly.	61	6
201510	1062	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Outside the quarter-end date, most money market rates were a few basis points below the somewhat elevated levels of the last period amid a reduction in Treasury bill supply, though they largely remained above the ON RRP offering rate.	61	6
201510	1063	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Consistent with lower money market rates, take-up at the Desk’s RRP operations was higher this period, as shown in the top-left panel of exhibit 3, with overnight operations outside quarter-end averaging $118 billion compared with $82 billion during the preceding period.	61	6
201510	1064	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Federal Reserve repurchase agreements with foreign official accounts—the foreign RP pool—also increased, averaging $171 billion.	61	6
201510	1065	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Total ON and term RRP take-up over the quarter-end date was also elevated, as expected, reaching a record level of $450 billion.	61	6
201510	1066	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	This larger take-up than in recent quarter-ends was primarily attributed to a larger-than-usual contraction in IOER arbitrage activity by foreign banking organizations as they sought to temporarily shrink their balance sheets for reporting purposes.	61	6
201510	1067	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	The reduction in Eurodollar activity, shown in the top-right panel, resulted in more cash being reallocated to RRP operations from prime money market funds.	61	6
201510	1068	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Similar to previous quarter-ends, usage of the foreign RP pool was elevated and touched a record high of $191 billion.	61	6
201510	1069	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	There was also some incremental usage of Federal Reserve dollar swap lines by the Bank of Japan, as the rate became relatively more attractive to their counterparties due to temporarily elevated pressures in the yen–dollar swap markets.	61	6
201510	1070	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Over the intermeeting period, there continued to be sizable paydowns in Treasury bills related to the debt ceiling, which garnered increased focus on the part of market participants.	61	6
201510	1071	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Since the September FOMC meeting, and consistent with Treasury Secretary Lew’s projections to the Congress, staff expectations for when the Treasury will exhaust its borrowing authority moved up to November 3.	61	6
201510	1072	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	The staff estimates that the Treasury would have less than $30 billion in cash on that date and will have depleted this cash by mid-November.	61	6
201510	1073	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-left panel, the scheduled debt payments after November 3 include weekly maturities of Treasury bills beginning on November 5 as well as midmonth and end-month principal and interest payments on coupon securities.	61	6
201510	1074	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	In the past 24 hours, the White House and congressional leaders appear to have reached an agreement to extend the Treasury’s borrowing authority to March 2017, though any deal would still need to be passed by both chambers of the Congress.	61	6
201510	1075	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants generally believe that missing a payment on Treasury securities would have extremely negative consequences for financial markets, and we saw some signs of concern in the Treasury bill market over the intermeeting period.	61	6
201510	1076	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Much as in past episodes, the bill market began to price some risk of delayed payments into securities maturing after the November 3 deadline, as seen in the middle-right panel, though since news of the agreement emerged yesterday, this has entirely retraced.	61	6
201510	1077	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	With the exception of early-to-mid-November bills, we saw little signs of stress.	61	6
201510	1078	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Jane will discuss the treatment of delayed securities in Federal Reserve operations and issues around communication in her briefing.	61	6
201510	1079	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Looking ahead, we intend to release a Desk statement about year-end RRP operations shortly after the October minutes are published, provided that the Committee does not increase the target range at this meeting.	61	6
201510	1080	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	As summarized in the bottom-left panel, we would announce a plan to offer $300 billion in term RRPs across three operations in addition to the $300 billion in ON RRP capacity on December 31.	61	6
201510	1081	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	These aggregate amounts are identical to those offered in the 2014 year-end operations and consistent with the authorization from the Committee in March.	61	6
201510	1082	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Further, the statement would note that the Desk will release the remaining details of the term RRP operations after the December FOMC meeting.	61	6
201510	1083	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	At that meeting, the Desk would propose two configurations for the year-end operations, one for use if the Committee decides to tighten policy at that time and the other if not.	61	6
201510	1084	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	The staff also recommends conducting one TDF test operation during the first week of December to continue our periodic testing of the facility and maintain operational readiness.	61	6
201510	1085	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Turning to the bottom-right panel, I would like to provide a short update on the recent changes that were made to improve the FR 2420 data collection.	61	6
201510	1086	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	You may recall that, in an effort to improve the quality of the data in advance of the production of the new median-based effective federal funds rate and overnight bank funding rate, we published a Federal Register notice in July to expand the Eurodollar collection and the panel of domestic banks required to report federal funds transactions.	61	6
201510	1087	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	The new reporting requirements went into effect on October 20, and the data received since have been in line with our expectations.	61	6
201510	1088	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	We believe that we are on track to start publishing the revised effective federal funds rate and the new overnight bank funding rate in early 2016, and we plan to provide more information to you on the proposed implementation at the next meeting.	61	6
201510	1089	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	To conclude with an update on reinvestments, the Desk continues to reinvest principal payments on holdings of agency debt and MBS in agency MBS through secondary-market purchases.	61	6
201510	1090	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Looking ahead to the end of the year, trading volumes in the MBS market typically decline in December and early January.	61	6
201510	1091	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	In line with last year’s practice, the Desk is planning to adjust its purchase calendar so that MBS purchases do not occur during days with the lowest trading volumes.	61	6
201510	1092	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	We do not expect this to have much market effect, as the practice is in line with the scheduling in recent years.	61	6
201510	1093	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	With respect to Treasury reinvestments, the SOMA portfolio will receive $326 million in Treasury principal payments on November 15.	61	6
201510	1094	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Although this falls after the November 3 debt ceiling deadline and the timing of the payment could therefore be at risk if there is no resolution, we expect to be able to roll over the maturing proceeds at auction, in line with the current reinvestment policy.	61	6
201510	1095	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	This would be the last Treasury rollover operation in 2015 before the maturities of Treasury securities increase materially in February of next year, as shown in the top- left panel of your final exhibit.	61	6
201510	1096	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	As we have reported previously, market participants’ expectations regarding when the Committee would cease some or all reinvestments of principal payments have been gradually pushed out over time, a result of both the shift later in expectations for liftoff and the view that there will be a longer interval between liftoff and any change in reinvestment policy.	61	6
201510	1097	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-right panel, the median respondent to the Desk’s surveys currently expects that the FOMC will cease some or all reinvestments of Treasury securities and agency MBS approximately nine months following liftoff, roughly three months later than was expected one year ago following the release of the Committee’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.	61	6
201510	1098	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Respondents’ expectations regarding the timing of a change to reinvestment policy remain dispersed, however, with estimates ranging from roughly concurrent with liftoff to more than several years following.	61	6
201510	1099	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you, that concludes my prepared remarks.	61	6
201510	1100	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for Lorie?	61	6
201510	1101	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	61	6
201510	1102	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201510	1103	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Lorie, you mentioned, in connection with the ON RRP, that some of the foreign banks have pulled back, presumably to try to put their balance sheets in a better light for capital purposes.	61	6
201510	1104	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Given that the ECB, the Bank of England, and the Swiss banking regulator have all recently indicated increased expectations regarding capital among their big internationally active banks, do you think we can expect take-up to be moving up on a durable, rather than transitory, basis because foreign banks will be a little less willing to intermediate?	61	6
201510	1105	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	We’ve seen a decline in repo trading activity, particularly from the European banks, and I think that has marginally affected the level of overnight RRP.	61	6
201510	1106	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	But over the past year, the RRP level has been fairly steady.	61	6
201510	1107	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	Looking ahead, I think market participants are still very attuned to whether that repo activity does continue to decline.	61	6
201510	1108	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	But they’re more focused on the money fund reform and the expectations that government funds are going to have larger amounts of assets under management, and that’s going to be more likely to affect the overnight RRP.	61	6
201510	1109	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Of the three jurisdictions, only the United Kingdom is increasing the leverage ratio.	61	6
201510	1110	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	The other two are just risk based, which presumably won’t have as much of an effect.	61	6
201510	1111	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	We’ve seen a lot of the largest declines already in the European banks, and they’ve suggested in commentary that they’re largely done with that reduction.	61	6
201510	1112	2015-10-28	meeting	LOGAN	But it’s hard to really know, as the firms get better about doing this full assessment across the firm, how different departments are then going to adjust.	61	6
201510	1113	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Okay.	61	6
201510	1114	2015-10-28	meeting	POTTER	And in the unsecured markets, Canadian, Swedish, and Australian banks are doing a lot of the trades.	61	6
201510	1115	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	61	6
201510	1116	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions for Lorie?	61	6
201510	1117	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	61	6
201510	1118	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, let me turn to Jane Ihrig, who is going to talk about issues associated with the debt limit.	96	9
201510	1119	2015-10-28	meeting	IHRIG	Thank you, Chair Yellen.	96	9
201510	1120	2015-10-28	meeting	IHRIG	I would like to take a few minutes to review issues related to the debt ceiling.	96	9
201510	1121	2015-10-28	meeting	IHRIG	As Lorie reported, the Congress seems to be close to an agreement to suspend the debt limit until March 2017.	96	9
201510	1122	2015-10-28	meeting	IHRIG	Proposed legislative text was released last night, and procedural steps are being taken to allow for expedited consideration of an agreement.	96	9
201510	1123	2015-10-28	meeting	IHRIG	This proposed agreement also would lock in spending caps for the next two years, making a government shutdown unlikely before the end of fiscal year 2017.	96	9
201510	1124	2015-10-28	meeting	IHRIG	No votes have been scheduled as of yet, and the contents of a proposed deal could change at any point before legislation is formally brought to the floor.	96	9
201510	1125	2015-10-28	meeting	IHRIG	Rank-and-file members of the House and Senate learned of the proposed deal only yesterday afternoon and were first briefed on the contents of the proposed agreement last night, so there is no guarantee as of yet that a deal would have the votes necessary to pass in both the House and the Senate.	96	9
201510	1126	2015-10-28	meeting	IHRIG	The uncertainty surrounding a resolution in the past couple of weeks was starting to show signs of strains in financial markets; Lorie noted bill yields on securities that are at risk of delayed payment had moved up.	96	9
201510	1127	2015-10-28	meeting	IHRIG	These strains led to some inquiries regarding the Federal Reserve’s operational plans, and the Chair’s letter last week outlined an approach for FOMC participants and Federal Reserve staff to deal with questions.	96	9
201510	1128	2015-10-28	meeting	IHRIG	The hope is to minimize public communications on issues associated with this topic to the extent possible.	96	9
201510	1129	2015-10-28	meeting	IHRIG	However, in response to inquiries, the minutes of the October 16, 2013, videoconference meeting are available on the Board’s public website to reference.	96	9
201510	1130	2015-10-28	meeting	IHRIG	My exhibit provides text in those minutes that might be seen as talking points on debt ceiling matters now and in the future.	96	9
201510	1131	2015-10-28	meeting	IHRIG	With regard to operations involving delayed payments on Treasury securities, policymakers saw “no legal or operational need to make changes to the conduct or procedures employed in open market operations, securities lending, or to the operation of the discount window,” and would “continue to employ prevailing market values of securities in all its transactions and operations, under the usual terms.”	96	9
201510	1132	2015-10-28	meeting	IHRIG	Regarding supervisory policy, policymakers noted that they would “take into account and make appropriate allowance for unusual market conditions.”	96	9
201510	1133	2015-10-28	meeting	IHRIG	If asked about steps the Federal Reserve might take to address market issues resulting from a delay in payments of any obligation of the US government, it may be useful to note that “appropriate responses would depend importantly on the actual conditions observed in financial markets,” and “while the Federal Reserve should take whatever steps it could to address disruptions in market function and liquidity, the risks posed to the financial system and to the broader economy by a delay in payments on Treasury securities would be potentially catastrophic, and thus such a situation should be avoided at all costs.”	96	9
201510	1134	2015-10-28	meeting	IHRIG	In terms of tools that the Federal Reserve has to address financial market pressures, the staff memo sent to the Committee on Thursday reviewed Desk and Reserve Bank operations that may moderate pressures.	96	9
201510	1135	2015-10-28	meeting	IHRIG	These operations include daily, routine operations such as overnight reverse repurchase tests and securities lending, and also repurchase agreement operations and the use of the discount window.	96	9
201510	1136	2015-10-28	meeting	IHRIG	No change would be made to current temporary open market operations without the consultation of the Committee.	96	9
201510	1137	2015-10-28	meeting	IHRIG	The staff will continue to monitor markets for signs of financial strains that pose risks to market functioning and liquidity in case a deal does not go through and could, at a later date, come back to the Committee with options for potential actions as appropriate.	96	9
201510	1138	2015-10-28	meeting	IHRIG	Thank you.	96	9
201510	1139	2015-10-28	meeting	IHRIG	I would be happy to take questions.	96	9
201510	1140	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Jane?	96	9
201510	1141	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, let me ask around the table.	96	9
201510	1142	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	As Jane noted—and I sent a note to the Committee last week on this—the proposal would be that, in answering questions that may arise on this, we continue to act in line with the decisions that were made in 2013.	96	9
201510	1143	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	96	9
201510	1144	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	96	9
201510	1145	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	We discussed this in the Committee on Credit and Risk Management and reviewed what happened last time and what tiny, narrow, little potential credit issue there is.	96	9
201510	1146	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	It seems quite manageable by manual workaround means, so we support this as a communications strategy and a recommendation to our colleagues on the conference as to how they should proceed in response to inquiries.	96	9
201510	1147	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201510	1148	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	And to the extent we have open market operations, we would continue to treat securities at risk in the normal ways.	96	9
201510	1149	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Any concern around the table?	96	9
201510	1150	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	We don’t need a vote, but I want to make sure there’s broad agreement on the strategy.	96	9
201510	1151	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	96	9
201510	1152	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201510	1153	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	We also need a vote to ratify domestic open market operations.	63	6
201510	1154	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	63	6
201510	1155	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Second?	63	6
201510	1156	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	63	6
201510	1157	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63	6
201510	1158	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	63	6
201510	1159	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Now we will go on to the “Economic and Financial Situation.”	11	1
201510	1160	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let me call on David Lebow to start us off.	11	1
201510	1161	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11	1
201510	1162	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	I will be referring to the handout titled “Material for the US Outlook.”	11	1
201510	1163	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	In putting together our economic projection for this FOMC meeting, the primary issue we faced was deciding how to interpret the mixed economic data that we have received since the time of the September Tealbook.	11	1
201510	1164	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	As you know, the September labor market report was somewhat disappointing.	11	1
201510	1165	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	Although the unemployment rate came in as expected, holding at 5.1 percent, the participation rate surprised us to the downside, and we did not get the upward revision to August payroll employment that we had anticipated.	11	1
201510	1166	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	As a result, payroll employment growth is now reported to have averaged just under 170,000 jobs per month last quarter, down from the first half’s average monthly pace of 215,000.	11	1
201510	1167	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	Of course, this is just one report, and we do still see some possibility of an upward revision to the August or September payroll figures.	11	1
201510	1168	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	Accordingly, we took only modest signal from the labor news.	11	1
201510	1169	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	We now expect monthly payroll job gains to average 180,000 in the fourth quarter—25,000 lower than we had previously assumed, but still higher than August and September’s reported average pace of 140,000 jobs per month.	11	1
201510	1170	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	The news from the industrial sector has also been disappointing, with industrial production weakening and the manufacturing surveys generally downbeat.	11	1
201510	1171	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	Of course, two of the most identifiable sources of restraint on the economy, the strong dollar and the effects of low oil prices on energy producers, both have effects that are concentrated in the industrial sector, so this relative weakness may not be surprising.	11	1
201510	1172	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	Some positive news has come on the spending side, an area in which we have had upward surprises to indicators of both household consumption and business fixed investment, although this morning’s advance durables release for September was weaker than we had projected and makes the investment news a little less positive.	11	1
201510	1173	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	In all, private domestic final purchases—which we think tend to carry some momentum—seem to be showing solid growth.	11	1
201510	1174	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	However, net exports continue to decline, importantly reflecting the appreciation of the dollar since the middle of last year.	11	1
201510	1175	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	And the available data on inventory investment now point to a fairly sharp slowing in the pace of stockbuilding last quarter.	11	1
201510	1176	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	Given this mixed array of indicators, as you can see from the first panel of your forecast summary exhibit, our projection regarding real GDP growth in the second half remains modest, with an average pace that is a little lower than in our September forecast.	11	1
201510	1177	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	I should note that, with today’s durable goods data, along with other bits of data received since the Tealbook closed, our estimate of GDP growth in the third quarter is now at 1¼ percent, rather than the 1½ percent in the Tealbook, and that is shown in your exhibit.	11	1
201510	1178	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	Over the remainder of the medium term, our outlook for real GDP growth is essentially unchanged from the September Tealbook.	11	1
201510	1179	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	In addition to the fact that we took little signal from the mixed incoming data, we made only minor revisions this round to our key conditioning factors.	11	1
201510	1180	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	For fiscal policy, we assumed that the Congress and the Administration would find their way to avoid a government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling without causing material disruption to the economy, and, fortunately, that does seem to be playing out.	11	1
201510	1181	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	For monetary policy, we now assume that the federal funds rate will lift off from its effective lower bound after the December meeting; in our previous projection, we had assumed a September liftoff date.	11	1
201510	1182	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	As we noted in the Tealbook, our models suggest that the economic consequences of altering the liftoff assumption by one or two meetings would be quite small, both because the difference in the funds rate path would not be very large and because the models embed the implicit assumption that the public does not take a signal from different liftoff dates for either the monetary policymakers’ reaction function or for the outlook for economic activity or inflation.	11	1
201510	1183	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	With little change to our projection of real output growth, our outlook for the unemployment rate—panel 2—is also little revised since September.	11	1
201510	1184	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	At the end of the medium term, we continue to expect that the unemployment rate will be 4.7 percent, 0.4 percentage point below our estimate of its natural rate.	11	1
201510	1185	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	Panel 2 also indicates that the unemployment rate in the third quarter was equal to our estimate of its natural rate, implying that the unemployment gap has now closed.	11	1
201510	1186	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	As you know, however, for some time we have thought that the unemployment gap understates the margin of slack in the economy, and we view our estimate of the output gap as providing a more comprehensive measure of resource utilization.	11	1
201510	1187	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	In panel 3, the dotted blue line plots the judgmental estimate of the output gap that is reflected in the Tealbook baseline; as you can see, this gap estimate was still negative in the third quarter, though small.	11	1
201510	1188	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	The panel also shows two other gap measures obtained from staff models.	11	1
201510	1189	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	The red line gives the production-function variant of the output gap generated by EDO, one of our DSGE models, while the black line—labeled “FRB/US”—plots an estimate of slack from a state-space model that pools the information from a number of indicators.	11	1
201510	1190	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	Both of these alternative gap estimates also suggest that resource utilization has nearly returned to its sustainable position, though the wide confidence interval surrounding the FRB/US value should give you an idea of some of the uncertainty that surrounds these sorts of estimates.	11	1
201510	1191	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	Panels 4 and 5 summarize the inflation outlook.	11	1
201510	1192	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	As you can see from panel 4, we are no longer projecting an outright decline in total PCE prices in the fourth quarter, mainly because it now looks like the pass-through of this past summer’s oil price declines to consumer energy prices will be a little more spread out over time.	11	1
201510	1193	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	We have also nudged up our near-term projection of core PCE inflation—panel 5—in response to the September CPI report, which came in a little higher than expected.	11	1
201510	1194	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	Over the medium term, our projections of both total and core inflation rates are unrevised from the September Tealbook, and they show inflation gradually approaching 2 percent.	11	1
201510	1195	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	As you know, the primary aggregate measures of labor compensation have shown little sign of accelerating over the past few years, despite a substantial improvement in labor market conditions.	11	1
201510	1196	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	This round, Deb Lindner, John Roberts, and Bill Wascher sent a memo to the FOMC that analyzed the recent behavior of compensation and, in particular, asked how much of a signal it provides regarding the amount of slack remaining in the labor market.	11	1
201510	1197	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	They concluded that the recent evolution of compensation can be reasonably well explained by the recent behavior of structural productivity, trend price inflation, and the staff’s estimate of the unemployment gap.	11	1
201510	1198	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	In panel 6, I have reproduced one of the figures that appeared in their memo.	11	1
201510	1199	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	It uses one of the staff’s empirical compensation models to decompose recent changes in the employment cost index, or ECI, into the contributions of these various underlying factors.	11	1
201510	1200	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	As you can see from the red portion of the bars, which give the estimated contribution of the unemployment gap, the effect of labor market slack in holding down compensation growth is estimated to have been steadily diminishing during the economic recovery.	11	1
201510	1201	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	However, this factor has been largely offset by a slower pace of trend real wage growth—the blue portion of the bars—that in turn reflects a slowdown in structural productivity growth.	11	1
201510	1202	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	These results suggest that it is not necessary to appeal to a wildly different estimate of slack than the staff has assumed to explain recent compensation developments; that said, the memo also finds that point estimates of the natural rate obtained from empirical wage equations are quite imprecisely estimated, and they are sensitive to the specific values of structural productivity growth and trend inflation that are assumed.	11	1
201510	1203	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	Thus, the behavior of wages, taken alone, does not appear to provide much useful guidance about the level of the natural rate.	11	1
201510	1204	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	Finally, the next page updates an exhibit that we have recently been showing you that attempts to provide a high-level summary of some of the key pieces of information that will be available at the next few FOMC meetings.	11	1
201510	1205	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	The data that have become available for today’s meeting are shaded in blue, the data that will first be available at the December meeting are in gold, and the additional observations that will become available in time for the January meeting are in red.	11	1
201510	1206	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	As I mentioned, we expect to see total PCE price inflation that is modestly higher than our September projection, mostly reflecting a somewhat slower anticipated pace of consumer energy price declines.	11	1
201510	1207	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	Nevertheless, even by the time of the January meeting, the 12-month change in total PCE prices is only expected to be about ½ percent, and the 12-month change in core prices will be about 1½ percent.	11	1
201510	1208	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	For real activity, we still think you will be seeing fairly solid payroll job gains and a 5 percent unemployment rate at the time of both the December and January meetings; however, the most recent read on real GDP growth that we will have received—for the third quarter—we think will be lackluster.	11	1
201510	1209	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	Steve Kamin will now continue our presentation.	11	1
201510	1210	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	I will be referring to the exhibit labeled “The International Outlook.”	11	1
201510	1211	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	Panel 1 presents our outlook for economic growth abroad.	11	1
201510	1212	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	As you can see from the solid black line, we estimate that aggregate foreign GDP growth more than doubled from a severely anemic 1 percent pace in the second quarter to a still- subdued 2¼ percent pace in the third.	11	1
201510	1213	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	For the period ahead, we continue to expect that economic growth abroad will pick up to its trend rate of nearly 3 percent by next year, little changed from the September Tealbook.	11	1
201510	1214	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	Altogether, our outlook may appear fairly benign, but, like the smile painted on the face of Bozo the Clown, it masks some pretty deep uncertainties and anxieties.	11	1
201510	1215	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	[Laughter]	11	1
201510	1216	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	To be clear, the advanced foreign economies, or AFEs, are not the source of our sleepless nights.	11	1
201510	1217	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	As shown by the solid green line, we estimate that GDP growth for the AFEs jumped to nearly 2 percent in the third quarter.	11	1
201510	1218	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	Most of that upswing comes from Canada, which has a very large trade-weight in our foreign aggregate.	11	1
201510	1219	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	The Canadian economy had contracted in the first half of this year, depressed both by low oil prices and by transitory outages in the energy sector, but it has since rebounded as energy production came back online and manufacturing activity picked up.	11	1
201510	1220	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	The Japanese economy also looks a bit better after a second-quarter slump, while the UK and euro-area economies continued to expand at a moderate pace.	11	1
201510	1221	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	The AFEs should continue growing about 2 percent over the forecast period, interrupted in early 2017 by Japan’s second consumption tax hike.	11	1
201510	1222	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	We now anticipate more monetary policy accommodation on the part of the Bank of Japan, Bank of England, and European Central Bank than in the previous forecast.	11	1
201510	1223	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	The additional stimulus should be motivated mainly by shortfalls in headline inflation, but concerns about the global outlook will likely also be a factor.	11	1
201510	1224	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	Indeed, while our projection for the EMEs, shown in blue in panel 1, looks reasonably optimistic, with economic growth reaching 4 percent later in the forecast period, the risks around this outlook are quite prominent.	11	1
201510	1225	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	To be sure, a number of the concerns that roiled global markets in August and September have subsided for the time being, as indicated by the decline in CDS spreads shown in panel 2.	11	1
201510	1226	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	China’s authorities kept the renminbi roughly stable over the past couple of months, easing worries that substantial further devaluation would destabilize world markets.	11	1
201510	1227	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	And, as indicated in panel 3, Chinese GDP growth for the third quarter came in unexpectedly strong, at nearly 7 percent on a four-quarter basis, thereby reducing investor fears that a hard landing was in train.	11	1
201510	1228	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	Finally, market expectations for a later Fed liftoff likely played some role.	11	1
201510	1229	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	While some of the risks and uncertainties surrounding the EME outlook have subsided, however, they have hardly gone away.	11	1
201510	1230	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	To begin with, the recent strength of Chinese GDP appeared to reflect an acceleration in services activity (the blue line in panel 3) even as industrial production (the red line) continued to slow.	11	1
201510	1231	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	On the face of it, this development is encouraging evidence of the rebalancing of China’s economy.	11	1
201510	1232	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	But it is difficult to tell how much of the strength in services reflects a transitory surge rather than a more lasting trend.	11	1
201510	1233	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	Certainly, at least part of the recent upswing reflects heightened activity in financial services that should recede as the stock market calms down.	11	1
201510	1234	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	But to the extent that a shift to a services-led growth model is genuinely under way, it will require new models to map incoming data into future growth, making it yet more difficult to project China’s economy.	11	1
201510	1235	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	In the event, we marked up our outlook for China a touch for the next couple of quarters while leaving the rest of our projection unchanged, but we remain quite uncertain about this forecast.	11	1
201510	1236	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	The shift from manufacturing to services may have implications for China’s trading partners as well.	11	1
201510	1237	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	In principle, the rebalancing of the Chinese economy should entail weaker exports, stronger consumption and imports, and thus greater contributions to global demand.	11	1
201510	1238	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	But the consumption and production of services is likely to require fewer imports of commodities, intermediate materials, and even finished goods than manufacturing for export.	11	1
201510	1239	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	As a consequence, although China’s rebalancing should be a positive for the global economy in the long run, in the shorter term it could prove disruptive for EMEs that depend on China’s manufacturing sector for their export sales.	11	1
201510	1240	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	Indeed, declines in China’s imports over the past year, along with declines in commodity prices also associated with China’s slowing, have already been depressing economic growth in other EMEs, as shown in panel 4.	11	1
201510	1241	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	But other factors besides China have also been at work:  Increases in global commodity production have weighed on prices, the recovery of the advanced economies has provided less support for EME exports than we would have expected, and some emerging economies are running into structural bottlenecks that are limiting their growth.	11	1
201510	1242	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	Brazil has been the poster child for such problems, as its government struggles to revive its economy while simultaneously attempting to tamp down rising inflation, achieve fiscal discipline, and restore confidence in its credit.	11	1
201510	1243	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	But economic growth in many other EMEs has also slowed, and the recovery in the second half of this year has thus far been tepid.	11	1
201510	1244	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	These considerations pose two related risks to the outlook.	11	1
201510	1245	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	First, the momentum of EME growth in the period ahead may prove still weaker than we anticipate, leading to further downward revisions to our forecast.	11	1
201510	1246	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	Second, EME corporations have accumulated considerable debt in recent years, and a further slowing of economic growth would make it more difficult to service that debt, boosting the likelihood of default and, at an extreme, possibly leading to financial crisis in one or more emerging market economies.	11	1
201510	1247	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	We do not believe that a widespread EME crisis is likely, but such concerns explain why fears of a hard landing in China proved so disruptive to markets a couple of months ago.	11	1
201510	1248	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	Higher global interest rates would also make debt service more difficult and put pressure on financial conditions in emerging markets.	11	1
201510	1249	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	Returning to panel 2, concerns about the future normalization of US monetary policy are probably adding to emerging market jitters, but they do not seem to have been directly responsible for the upsurge in volatility during the summer, as US yields—the black line—were actually declining during this period.	11	1
201510	1250	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	We doubt that the gradual tightening of FOMC policy envisaged in the staff forecast would be sufficient to trigger much distress in emerging markets.	11	1
201510	1251	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	However, if markets overreact to liftoff and push up yields to a much greater extent than we currently anticipate, more-adverse outcomes are certainly possible.	11	1
201510	1252	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	By the same token, our forecast for the dollar, shown in panel 5, is predicated on our view that Fed liftoff, assumed to take place in December, will not be a great surprise to market participants.	11	1
201510	1253	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	We have built some further dollar appreciation into our forecast even after that event, as some market participants take time to adjust their positions, the subsequent pace of FOMC tightening exceeds market expectations, and investors react to further easing by foreign central banks.	11	1
201510	1254	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	This uplift is offset in our forecast by some depreciation of the dollar against the Chinese renminbi as it resumes its appreciation starting in the middle of next year, and so the broad real dollar remains about flat over the forecast period.	11	1
201510	1255	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	However, forecasting exchange rates is not quite an exact science, and there is certainly a good chance that the dollar could rise further than we are projecting.	11	1
201510	1256	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	Even if it does not, the 14 percent rise in the dollar that has already taken place since the middle of 2014 leads US net exports, shown in panel 6, to continue to be a negative contributor to real GDP growth for the next couple of years.	11	1
201510	1257	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	This result reflects the very long lags we have estimated for the response of trade to exchange rates.	11	1
201510	1258	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	Andreas will now continue our presentation.	11	1
201510	1259	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Thank you.	FS	FS
201510	1260	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Since our last assessment of financial stability in July, amid concerns about slowing Chinese economic growth and the prospects for emerging market economies more generally, financial markets experienced a bout of turbulence, which they appear to have absorbed without causing broader strains in the system.	FS	FS
201510	1261	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	I will start with a discussion of asset valuations.	FS	FS
201510	1262	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	As shown in panel 1, despite the events of the summer, forward P/E ratios remain relatively high, at about their 75th percentile, and valuations for small cap stocks, not shown, are still at the upper end of their historical range as stock prices largely retraced their losses.	FS	FS
201510	1263	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	The imprint of the summer’s events on bond spreads, panel 2, has been more durable, with spreads on speculative-grade bonds in particular now well above their recent lows.	FS	FS
201510	1264	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	This widening represents some mixture of darker expectations about default rates and decreased risk appetite.	FS	FS
201510	1265	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Evidence from the term structure of corporate spreads and other sources also suggest that investor risk aversion has increased, pointing to some continued easing of valuation pressures in the corporate debt markets since late last year.	FS	FS
201510	1266	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	When bond yields rise, of course, prices fall and investors take capital losses.	FS	FS
201510	1267	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	As shown in panel 3, the late-summer losses were accompanied by moderate flows out of mutual funds that hold loans and high-yield corporate bonds.	FS	FS
201510	1268	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	In the event, flows were not particularly large, and certainly well below the flows seen late in 2014 when energy-related concerns prompted a pullback from the sector.	FS	FS
201510	1269	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	(Although it is hard to see on the chart, data so far in October suggest such funds have seen net inflows.) Outflows from mutual funds that hold relatively illiquid assets such as high-yield bonds or loans are a potential concern due to their structural liquidity mismatch, under which investors can redeem their shares at the end of each day, but the underlying assets can take much longer to sell.	FS	FS
201510	1270	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Further, redemption costs are borne by the remaining shareholders in the fund, creating a mild first-mover advantage.	FS	FS
201510	1271	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	On September 22, the SEC put out proposed rules on mutual fund liquidity risk management that went some way to address these concerns.	FS	FS
201510	1272	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	The proposal would require funds to adopt a liquidity risk management policy, to report their own assessment of their liquidity positions, and to set a benchmark for the minimum amount of assets sufficiently liquid that they could be sold in three days.	FS	FS
201510	1273	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	In addition, mutual funds would be able to adopt so-called swing pricing, a scheme used in Europe in which investors pay some of the redemption costs as they exit, decreasing the first-mover advantage.	FS	FS
201510	1274	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	While we are continuing to study the proposal, in principle the changes would represent significant progress in remedying a structural risk in open-end mutual funds.	FS	FS
201510	1275	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Leverage in the financial sector plays an important role in our assessment of vulnerabilities.	FS	FS
201510	1276	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	While we do not have a comprehensive measure of leverage from derivatives or at dealers, we can measure leverage at institutions central to intermediation: insurance companies and banks.	FS	FS
201510	1277	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	As shown in panel 5, debt-to-equity levels at insurance companies are below their pre-crisis levels, suggesting insurance companies are in relatively good positions.	FS	FS
201510	1278	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Panel 6 gives a historical perspective on bank capital ratios.	FS	FS
201510	1279	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	The chart shows the ratio of tangible common equity to total tangible assets at commercial banks.	FS	FS
201510	1280	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Although there is not a specific regulatory expectation regarding this measure, it has the virtue of being roughly comparable over long periods of time despite changing risk-weighting regimes and accounting standards.	FS	FS
201510	1281	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	You can see two distinct episodes when bank capital ratios increased:  after the original Basel capital accords in the early 1990s and again following the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementation of Basel III.	FS	FS
201510	1282	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Whether this is enough capital for financial stability depends on the size of the shock; however, we can say that this is substantially more capital than the industry has seen in several decades.	FS	FS
201510	1283	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Moreover, results from the Federal Reserve’s stress tests suggest that participating institutions have sufficient capital to weather a severe recession.	FS	FS
201510	1284	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	On exhibit 2, I turn to the issue of vulnerabilities stemming from developments in commercial real estate before turning to broader nonfinancial leverage measures.	FS	FS
201510	1285	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	As shown in panel 7, prices for commercial properties have been rising rapidly in recent years, with the increase in prices of apartment buildings particularly notable.	FS	FS
201510	1286	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Fundamentals in this sector have been improving, with rents increasing amid declining vacancy rates.	FS	FS
201510	1287	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	However, ratios of rents to prices—capitalization rates—are at all-time low levels, although cap rates relative to Treasury yields are not unusually low.	FS	FS
201510	1288	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	As further evidence of valuation pressures in CRE, the rise in prices has been accompanied by weakening underwriting standards in securitization markets.	FS	FS
201510	1289	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Panel 8 shows that issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities has picked up in recent years, though it is still well below its pre-crisis levels.	FS	FS
201510	1290	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Rating agencies and market participants have complained that issuers are shopping their securities in order to get better ratings; in addition, they report that recent deals feature loans with higher LTV ratios, a greater portion of interest-only loans, and more loans secured by properties outside the central business districts of major cities.	FS	FS
201510	1291	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	At banks, underwriting standards appear more moderate.	FS	FS
201510	1292	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Panel 9 shows responses from the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices to questions about the level of standards on commercial real estate loans at banks.	FS	FS
201510	1293	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	As you can see from the yellow and orange areas, the bulk of respondents reported that standards were at their midpoint or somewhat easier than the standards since 2005.	FS	FS
201510	1294	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	It is worth noting that standards on construction and land development loans, the rightmost bars, are more in line with their midpoint.	FS	FS
201510	1295	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	These loans carry higher risk of default and generally larger losses conditional on a default.	FS	FS
201510	1296	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Moreover, results from the October survey show a slight tightening of standards, suggesting that the long period of easing that followed the crisis has slowed or perhaps even come to an end.	FS	FS
201510	1297	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	In addition to underwriting standards that largely meet supervisory expectations, the exposure of large banks to these loans appears pretty limited.	FS	FS
201510	1298	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	While prices and underwriting standards show evidence of valuation pressures, it does not look like commercial real estate debt is, as yet, growing in line with these pressures.	FS	FS
201510	1299	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Panel 10 puts CRE debt into perspective.	FS	FS
201510	1300	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Loans backed by commercial properties, including apartment buildings—the blue region—have grown to about $3.5 trillion, just exceeding their pre-crisis peak.	FS	FS
201510	1301	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Total business debt—the blue and green regions together—including bonds, unsecured loans, and so forth, has been growing faster and now stands at about $12.5 trillion.	FS	FS
201510	1302	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	We have flagged the balance sheets of businesses as a potential building vulnerability in our assessments for several rounds.	FS	FS
201510	1303	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Although total business credit, the top line in panel 10, has not been growing particularly rapidly lately, the riskiest forms of business credit—that is, leveraged loans and high yield bonds—have been a particular focus, in part because of weakening underwriting standards on leveraged loans combined with the sustained period of double-digit growth in these forms of debt, shown in panel 11.	FS	FS
201510	1304	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	As you can see, debt growth has decelerated in recent quarters as financing conditions began to tighten in 2014, even ahead of the late summer volatility.	FS	FS
201510	1305	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	A number of papers, including those by Schularick and Taylor, Reinhart and Rogoff, and the IMF, argue that there is an empirical link historically between rapid growth of some forms of credit and subsequent financial instability.	FS	FS
201510	1306	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	In this spirit, panel 12 shows the credit-to-GDP ratio decomposed into debt owed by businesses, the orange region, and that owed by households, the red region.	FS	FS
201510	1307	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	As you can see, the overall debt-to-GDP ratio has been flat for several years now, with the business debt growth I flagged offset by the continued decline in borrowing by families, especially for mortgages.	FS	FS
201510	1308	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Thus, on balance, we judge the vulnerability associated with nonfinancial debt to be moderate.	FS	FS
201510	1309	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Your last exhibit shows our heat map summarizing our current view of financial vulnerabilities (in the rightmost column) compared with our views a year ago (the middle column) and, somewhat speculatively, what we think we would have said in mid-2004 (the leftmost column).	FS	FS
201510	1310	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Reviewing our current assessment, starting at the top, we judge valuation pressures to remain notable despite the rise in risk aversion in some fixed-income markets, vulnerabilities from private nonfinancial leverage to be moderate, vulnerabilities from financial-sector leverage to be low, and vulnerabilities from maturity and liquidity transformation to be moderate.	FS	FS
201510	1311	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Our overall assessment, which is based on the levels and interactions of the individual categories, is that the vulnerability of the financial system is currently moderate.	FS	FS
201510	1312	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Thank you.	FS	FS
201510	1313	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for any of the presenters?	12	1
201510	1314	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	12	1
201510	1315	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201510	1316	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I had a question about the inflation outlook.	12	1
201510	1317	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On page 2 of 2 in the handout labeled “US Outlook,” if I look at the 12-month change in core PCE, going from July up through December—obviously, December is a forecast—we see an increase of 0.3 percentage point in a five-month period.	12	1
201510	1318	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	At that point, the staff is expecting core PCE inflation to either flatten out or even decline slightly over the course of 2016 before beginning its gradual rise back up to target over the remainder of the decade.	12	1
201510	1319	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What’s the story for 2016?	12	1
201510	1320	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Many observers, if your forecast comes to pass in 2015, are going to be saying, “Look, we’re going up 0.3 percentage point in five months.	12	1
201510	1321	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It looks like the Fed is back on track.”	12	1
201510	1322	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But that isn’t your outlook, so I was wondering what the story is behind that.	12	1
201510	1323	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	Most of these movements in the 12-month change in total PCE inflation that you’re referring to have to do with the timing of when the energy price movements are happening.	12	1
201510	1324	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Sorry.	12	1
201510	1325	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I meant to talk about core.	12	1
201510	1326	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The 12-month change in core PCE in July was 1.2 percent, and you expect it to move up to 1.5 in December.	12	1
201510	1327	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If you go to Tealbook A, the outlook for 2016 is actually, I think, 1.4 percent.	12	1
201510	1328	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I was just wondering, what’s the story for the contours of that forecast?	12	1
201510	1329	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	That’s right.	12	1
201510	1330	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	For 2015 as a whole, the four-quarter change is 1.4 percent, and so it’s not surprising that the 12-month numbers you’re seeing in the fourth quarter are at that same level.	12	1
201510	1331	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	One of the factors built into our projection is a little bit of residual seasonality, as we’ve talked about before.	12	1
201510	1332	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	That is not as visible because the September CPI that we just got was higher than expected.	12	1
201510	1333	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	We do have some low-ish numbers built into our monthlies for the next couple of months, and that affects the three-month change pattern that you’re seeing, in which it falls back from 1.5 in November to 1.2 in December.	12	1
201510	1334	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	Broadly speaking, in 2016, we are expecting that some of the effects of the import prices holding down core inflation are going to be waning, according to our projection of what import prices will do.	12	1
201510	1335	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	That in itself would lead you to expect a little higher inflation in 2016.	12	1
201510	1336	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	In fact, that’s worth maybe a couple of tenths.	12	1
201510	1337	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	In 2015, that 1.4 is actually a little higher than we would’ve predicted on the basis of the fundamentals, including the movements of the dollar and import prices.	12	1
201510	1338	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	So that slight positive surprise in 2015 goes away and offsets the dollar effects coming out in 2016.	12	1
201510	1339	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	That’s why we’ve got the same 1.4 in 2015 and 2016 in our projection of core inflation.	12	1
201510	1340	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	Then we have core inflation edging up from there as the import and energy price effects on core dwindle further.	12	1
201510	1341	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Okay.	12	1
201510	1342	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	12	1
201510	1343	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	12	1
201510	1344	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Andreas, we talked a fair amount about leveraged loans last year, and it seems that the talking worked.	12	1
201510	1345	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Was it the talking, or was it something else that was happening at the same time?	12	1
201510	1346	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Yes.	12	1
201510	1347	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Certainly, the evidence from the examinations that our supervisory colleagues have conducted is that the number of so-called nonpass loans—that is, loans violating the guidance—really declined over the past year.	12	1
201510	1348	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	At the same time, there was a pretty substantial increase in risk aversion.	12	1
201510	1349	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	We had the oil price declines in late 2014 and the associated concerns about the outlook for that sector in which there’s a volume of leveraged loans.	12	1
201510	1350	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	So between supervisory pressure, guidance, et cetera, and the increase in risk aversion, it’s hard to judge.	12	1
201510	1351	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	I guess I’d say that the spread widening probably can’t be explained by guidance per se, and that it seems to reflect more risk aversion or risk appetite or the outlook for that sector.	12	1
201510	1352	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	12	1
201510	1353	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	12	1
201510	1354	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	12	1
201510	1355	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201510	1356	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I’d like to ask a question about the Tealbook A box on page 54, “The Recent Decline in Longer-Horizon Inflation Compensation.”	12	1
201510	1357	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	For a little context, we just had the discussion about r*, and one of the things that comes out of that is, it depends a little on your modeling strategy—whether your shocks are basically stationary and you’re not going to have your estimates move around for any great length of time or whether you allow them to be permanent.	12	1
201510	1358	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Our FOMC statement, for quite some time, has pointed to market measures of inflation compensation moving down but survey measures being fixed.	12	1
201510	1359	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	What’s our ability to detect longer-horizon movements in those?	12	1
201510	1360	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Are they baked in the cake, are they never going to move, or do they actually have the opportunity?	12	1
201510	1361	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Now, taking it to the yield curve data—the topic of the box—most of our term structure models have baked into them I(0) stationary assumptions about inflation and the yields and things like that, so they can’t move very far from endpoint inflation expectations.	12	1
201510	1362	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	But in the box you allude to a new model that has I(1) properties, so it has the possibility of seeing them move.	12	1
201510	1363	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	This came up with President Lacker’s comment about different equilibrium and whether inflation expectations can move down.	12	1
201510	1364	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	If I understand it right, its estimate is potentially 50 basis points lower inflation expectations.	12	1
201510	1365	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	That’s viewed as an upper bound.	12	1
201510	1366	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I’m not quite sure how to put all of those things together.	12	1
201510	1367	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	If I remember right, the inflation attractor that the Tealbook uses is around 1.8 percent, and then there’s the assumption that it’s going to move up, and we don’t really know.	12	1
201510	1368	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Could you discuss some of that?	12	1
201510	1369	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Perhaps I can pick up on the upper-bound notion.	12	1
201510	1370	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	That really has to do with the possible persistence of shocks to inflation.	12	1
201510	1371	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	In that sense, rightly, this model takes the view that these shocks might leave a permanent imprint.	12	1
201510	1372	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	You might view that as one polar assumption.	12	1
201510	1373	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	You’re right in pointing out that it matters a whole lot for the implications for longer-horizon inflation expectations whether, technically speaking, you have a unit root, or the root is 0.99.	12	1
201510	1374	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	It makes a huge difference as you forecast further and further out.	12	1
201510	1375	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Of course, I’d add that, sadly, for that reason, the data also don’t speak very loudly on the matter, so we’re presenting this estimate as an interesting case to consider.	12	1
201510	1376	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	But if you asked us about our confidence as to whether it’s this assumption or what’s built into the standard model, it would be very difficult for us to confidently say anything about which of the two it is.	12	1
201510	1377	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	As you know, even in our standard model, there’s some persistence—at the 5-to-10-year horizon, you can generate some decline in inflation expectations, and so it doesn’t revert back very quickly.	12	1
201510	1378	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Nonetheless, it matters a great deal whether you move to the possibility that you literally have permanent imprints on inflation expectations.	12	1
201510	1379	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	I wish we had greater ability to discriminate confidently in the data between these two.	12	1
201510	1380	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	12	1
201510	1381	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I’m sympathetic to all of those issues.	12	1
201510	1382	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	Regarding the inflation projection itself, just to be clear, our projection is predicated on the idea that longer-run expectations are stable and will remain stable for some time more.	12	1
201510	1383	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	In other words, we’re not taking signal for our baseline inflation projection from this news in the TIPS spreads moving lower.	12	1
201510	1384	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	Our assumption is of stable expectations that are consistent with PCE inflation settling out a bit below 2 percent—1.8 percent, as you said.	12	1
201510	1385	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	We do eventually assume that those expectations will drift slightly higher to be consistent with 2 percent inflation in the longer run, but there would be no support for that assumption in the TIPS data— quite the opposite.	12	1
201510	1386	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	12	1
201510	1387	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	12	1
201510	1388	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	12	1
201510	1389	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes.	12	1
201510	1390	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have a couple of questions around financial stability, but these charts also appear in the Tealbook, so it can be a free-for-all.	12	1
201510	1391	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the QS report, chart 1-11 shows cap rates in commercial real estate, which you mentioned are at very, very low levels—in fact, I would say the lowest we’ve seen since 2006 and 2007.	12	1
201510	1392	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Also the price-to-rent ratios in residential real estate are in chart 1-14.	12	1
201510	1393	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t just want to think about financial stability, I want to think about risk to the macroeconomic outlook, because when I talk about financial stability, we immediately go into leverage of banks and this and that.	12	1
201510	1394	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m actually also focused on risk to economic growth.	12	1
201510	1395	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Which should I think of as the better metric, or measure, of risk to the economy?	12	1
201510	1396	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Is it the price-to-rent ratio relative to a historical norm, a cap rate relative to a historical norm, or a cap rate that’s adjusted for where interest rates and other right-hand-side variables may be?	12	1
201510	1397	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	It could be, as we saw in the mid-2000s, that basically all assets were overvalued, and so when you compare commercial real estate cap rates with Treasury securities, everything looks great because everything is in a frothy state while, in fact, there are problems all over the place.	12	1
201510	1398	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Also, in the house-price-to-rent ratio, you have this long-run trend that, as I understand from the footnote, reflects not only some trend in the house-price-to-rent ratio but also carrying costs, which I take to mean interest rates and things like that.	12	1
201510	1399	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	The way I read the house-price-to-rent ratio is that the house prices are about 35 percent above their historical norms, but once you put in this trend and the carrying costs and other things, it actually looks pretty good.	12	1
201510	1400	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Going back to my question, when we think about macroeconomic risks, should I be thinking about the 35 percent, should I be looking at cap rates being really low, or should I be saying, “Maybe I can justify all of this because of very low interest rates?”	12	1
201510	1401	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	If that wasn’t a leading question, it was supposed to be.	12	1
201510	1402	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I have a question for President Williams.	12	1
201510	1403	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Let’s say the risk was all Treasury yields.	12	1
201510	1404	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Then don’t you have the risk of Treasury yields going up a lot?	12	1
201510	1405	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes.	12	1
201510	1406	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s one way to put it.	12	1
201510	1407	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me that it doesn’t matter that much if the cap rates are out of line or the Treasury yields are out of line.	12	1
201510	1408	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Something is out of line; you still have the same risks.	12	1
201510	1409	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Right.	12	1
201510	1410	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s actually how I was thinking about it.	12	1
201510	1411	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Okay.	12	1
201510	1412	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	But then that would argue, “Don’t tell me cap rates are low because Treasury yields are low, so that’s okay.”	12	1
201510	1413	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I also don’t quite understand where this long-run trend that’s in both the Tealbook and the QS report really comes from.	12	1
201510	1414	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	To what extent is that some view about trend price-to-rent ratios—which I don’t have a good understanding of—or to what extent is it really reflecting just interest rates?	12	1
201510	1415	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	At the last FOMC meeting, I said house prices were roughly 30 percent overvalued based on a chart like this, and of course the Tealbook says that’s not correct, they’re actually overvalued by 6 percent.	12	1
201510	1416	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I want to know the right way to think about the risk to the outlook.	12	1
201510	1417	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Maybe they’re both good ways to think about it, but it’s a question.	12	1
201510	1418	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s a leading question.	12	1
201510	1419	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	I know you don’t want to hear about leverage and so forth, but I’m duty bound.	12	1
201510	1420	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	[Laughter]	12	1
201510	1421	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	As someone who labors in the macroprudential-industrial complex, I feel required to mention this.	12	1
201510	1422	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	The question from a stability perspective is, what happens if prices decline a lot?	12	1
201510	1423	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	What I tried to lay out for you was an argument that in the CRE space at least, there wouldn’t be any amplification; there wouldn’t be any second-round effect.	12	1
201510	1424	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	There are no externalities or spillovers from leveraged intermediaries suffering capital losses and so forth.	12	1
201510	1425	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	That is doubly true in the residential space in which all the credit risk is held, for better or for worse, on the public-sector balance sheet.	12	1
201510	1426	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	I heard some questions about the price-to-rent ratio.	12	1
201510	1427	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	I have to talk about that, too.	12	1
201510	1428	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	[Laughter]	12	1
201510	1429	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	I think I might be the original progenitor of the price-to-rent ratio.	12	1
201510	1430	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	As I recall, Josh Gallin and I worked on it 15 years ago.	12	1
201510	1431	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	The problem in residential is that there’s no equivalent of cap rate.	12	1
201510	1432	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	There’s no way that you really observe a house being both available for rent and available for sale.	12	1
201510	1433	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	One way to approach that problem is to compare indexes with indexes—the index of prices with the index of rents.	12	1
201510	1434	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	There are many measurement problems, but the most obvious one is that the stock of rental housing and the stock of owner-occupied housing are divergent in terms of their hedonic qualities over time—the willingness of people to pay for them.	12	1
201510	1435	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	So that’s the main underlying source for the price-to-rent ratio trend.	12	1
201510	1436	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Then the question of the sensitivity of the overvaluation estimate to the trend is a fair one.	12	1
201510	1437	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Back when I was doing this, I tried a bunch of different ways to correct for this, including looking at the Census data directly and actually doing a regression of hedonic characteristics and trying to construct an equivalent rental house and an equivalent occupied house.	12	1
201510	1438	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	A much simpler way to do it is to forget about rent.	12	1
201510	1439	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Let’s just assume that there’s some kind of trend in real house prices for whatever reason—population growth, what have you.	12	1
201510	1440	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	And let’s say that the bubble period began in 2000 or 2001, and let’s estimate the trend through there and then jump it off.	12	1
201510	1441	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	All of these kinds of approaches—the paper that I wrote with our former colleague Morris Davis and the simple-minded jump off from the trend—all give you answers that housing is no longer cheap, but it’s not, I would say, excessively rich.	12	1
201510	1442	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	I don’t know if that helps you.	12	1
201510	1443	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	The issue there is always extrapolating.	12	1
201510	1444	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	You’re extrapolating now 15 years out on the trend, and your out-of-sample period is getting closer to the size of your actual sample.	12	1
201510	1445	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	But that answered my questions on how to think about it.	12	1
201510	1446	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I actually said I wasn’t going to ask about leverage, but you wouldn’t let me do that.	12	1
201510	1447	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	My own view of leverage was that one of the things that we should have better understood was the distribution of leverage and not just the aggregate.	12	1
201510	1448	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	When you look at a picture like yours, it’s really high, it’s lower than it was before, it’s flat, but there’s not a lot of information in here about how many people in California today are buying houses with 95 or 100 percent LTVs, because this is an aggregate statistic.	12	1
201510	1449	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	To the extent that these summary statistics are mushing together my parents, who have no leverage; me, who has a little bit; and then all of my neighbors, who are completely leveraged out—[Laughter]	12	1
201510	1450	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Okay.	12	1
201510	1451	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	I’m really glad you asked that question, although you may live to regret it.	12	1
201510	1452	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	That is an absolute void in our understanding that we identified back when this was first a concern.	12	1
201510	1453	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	The staff here has done an extraordinary amount of work to try to understand precisely the issues that you’re describing.	12	1
201510	1454	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	I don’t know if this is available to you, but there’s a big book of QS assessments, which is a mere 216 pages this round.	12	1
201510	1455	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’re limited at our Federal Reserve Banks in how much we can spend on printers.	12	1
201510	1456	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	12	1
201510	1457	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	I understand.	12	1
201510	1458	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	It’s a high one.	12	1
201510	1459	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	12	1
201510	1460	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	But there’s a limit.	12	1
201510	1461	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	I would say that we do look at the cross-sectional distribution of a variety of different measures.	12	1
201510	1462	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Maybe one to highlight is county-level breakdowns.	12	1
201510	1463	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	If you see house prices move a lot, how much do you see debt in that county grow?	12	1
201510	1464	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	There’s a pretty solid relationship between those two variables in history.	12	1
201510	1465	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Since 2009, that relationship has really broken down.	12	1
201510	1466	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	I don’t know your neighbors, and I don’t know where you live, but my sense is that people are using cash to buy or pay.	12	1
201510	1467	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	You may argue that they’re paying too much, but the point is that they’re not really borrowing money to do it.	12	1
201510	1468	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay.	12	1
201510	1469	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	It would be great to have updates in which we see that kind of information because we are definitely hearing a lot more stories from our banking advisory council, CDIAC, and from our board about very high LTVs in our District—over 90 percent.	12	1
201510	1470	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	12	1
201510	1471	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201510	1472	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I want to build on President Williams’s question, because I think Andreas actually has more to say about it than he has to this point.	12	1
201510	1473	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	President Williams was, I think, implicitly drawing an important distinction between, on the one hand, financial stability considerations, in which leverage is implicated—meaning that there’s some significant risk to the intermediation function—and, on the other hand, the potential effect of leverage as a macroeconomic matter.	12	1
201510	1474	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Nellie and Andreas, I thought we had a pretty good case study of at least thinking that through in the leveraged-lending context that Governor Fischer was mentioning a moment ago.	12	1
201510	1475	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	In that case we were pretty confident that financial-stability risks, as conventionally understood, were not all that implicated by this big growth of leveraged-lending originations because so much of that was getting passed on to ultimate holders who were not themselves intermediators, or at least not highly leveraged intermediators.	12	1
201510	1476	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	But then there was a complementary analysis, which I think came from your office, saying that you would still be concerned because this is upping the risk of quite a few bankruptcies—more bankruptcies with a minor dip than would otherwise take place—and, thus, although we may not have supervisory or regulatory tools to deal with it, it still ought to be relevant.	12	1
201510	1477	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	That was what I understood John to be getting at, which then does argue for more granular data on, as he would put it, how to “disaggregate” that curve.	12	1
201510	1478	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I think I’m characterizing fairly what you said 6 or 8 or 10 months ago.	12	1
201510	1479	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	That’s right.	12	1
201510	1480	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	In mid- or late 2014, as I recall, we asked what the strongest case was to be concerned about the growth of the leveraged finance sector.	12	1
201510	1481	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	The channel that we identified was one in which the business sector gets leveraged and then you have a more fragile industry from now on that’s more likely to face higher credit losses and financing constraints.	12	1
201510	1482	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	One could say that about people who own commercial real estate and people who own houses, too, even though they’re not intermediators, right?	12	1
201510	1483	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Yes.	12	1
201510	1484	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	I see your point.	12	1
201510	1485	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	There’s still the legacy of the old mortgages that are hanging around, but in terms of debt service burdens and so forth, those have come down remarkably in the past few years.	12	1
201510	1486	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I invite you to come to my beautiful District.	12	1
201510	1487	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	12	1
201510	1488	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Thank you.	12	1
201510	1489	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	12	1
201510	1490	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	12	1
201510	1491	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	To follow up on Governor Tarullo’s question, there are two issues.	12	1
201510	1492	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	One, what happens if the interest rate goes up and they’re at 5 percent down on the mortgage?	12	1
201510	1493	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	And the other is, what happens if business conditions deteriorate?	12	1
201510	1494	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Now, both of those could create the bankruptcies about which you talked.	12	1
201510	1495	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	What are you focusing on, or doesn’t it matter?	12	1
201510	1496	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	In the exercise that we did in 2014, we focused more on just the susceptibility of the business sector to shocks—typical, if you will, accelerator-type dynamics.	12	1
201510	1497	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	On the interest rate picture, we often do think about the sensitivity of the system to rates and so forth, but that seems to be a slightly different question.	12	1
201510	1498	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	12	1
201510	1499	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks.	12	1
201510	1500	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	12	1
201510	1501	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Doesn’t it depend a bit on the rollover risk?	12	1
201510	1502	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I could have a leveraged position, when interest rates go up, but as long as I’m term funded, nothing really is going to happen to me for a while, right?	12	1
201510	1503	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Yes.	12	1
201510	1504	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	I think it’s more of an issue in the leveraged finance sector, in which people expect to refinance their big loans even though, as you say, a bond is going to have a term exposure.	12	1
201510	1505	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	The loans themselves are floating rate, so that’s an area in which an increase in rates would pass through, in terms of payment burdens, to the borrower.	12	1
201510	1506	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	But in housing, presumably, people have mostly fixed- rate mortgages.	12	1
201510	1507	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Yes.	12	1
201510	1508	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Exactly.	12	1
201510	1509	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	Housing, autos, and cards are mostly amortization.	12	1
201510	1510	2015-10-28	meeting	LEHNERT	There’s not really an issue there.	12	1
201510	1511	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	12	1
201510	1512	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201510	1513	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought President Williams’s intervention was really food for a lot of thought.	12	1
201510	1514	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I wanted to follow up on one of his comments about thinking about the decomposition of price-to-rent ratios into a risk premium factor, a path- of-short-rates factor, and a term premium factor.	12	1
201510	1515	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Some of these questions about how secure we should feel about the current level of price-to-rent ratios really come down to what you think of the time-series properties of these various factors.	12	1
201510	1516	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One way to respond to his question would be to provide some information to the Committee about the particular time-series properties of these various factors.	12	1
201510	1517	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Obviously not definitive, but, certainly, it would be a starting point.	12	1
201510	1518	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12	1
201510	1519	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Now, we have an opportunity to make comments on financial stability, and a few people have indicated their desire to do so.	FS2	
201510	1520	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let me start with the Vice Chairman.	FS2	
201510	1521	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes.	FS2	
201510	1522	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I’d like to talk about something that we haven’t talked about yet, which is Puerto Rico.	FS2	
201510	1523	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Time is running out there, and nothing that will facilitate an orderly restructuring has yet emerged.	FS2	
201510	1524	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	On the positive side, you’ve probably seen that the US Treasury has taken the initiative in proposing that the Congress pass legislation that would enable the territory—not just the public corporations, but the territory itself—to have the option of filing for bankruptcy.	FS2	
201510	1525	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If they got that authority, that would be important, because that would put pressure on creditors to agree to a voluntary restructuring or, failing that, to have a more organized process for restructuring under bankruptcy protection.	FS2	
201510	1526	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, the Treasury has advocated increasing the earned income tax credit for Puerto Rican residents, improving Medicaid access, and having an oversight board to monitor the restructuring and its aftermath.	FS2	
201510	1527	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	On the negative side, I would say that the congressional response to the US Treasury’s proposal has been lukewarm at best, and it’s unclear whether the Treasury proposals go far enough, frankly, in putting Puerto Rico on a sustainable course.	FS2	
201510	1528	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	There are many other structural impediments that could be addressed that the Treasury is silent on, including exempting Puerto Rico from the Jones Act, allowing a lower minimum wage for Puerto Rico, or taking steps to broaden the tax base, because Puerto Rico has a very large informal economy.	FS2	
201510	1529	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	At this juncture, a hard landing for Puerto Rico seems like a real risk within a few months, and much needs to be done quickly if we’re going to avert that outcome.	FS2	
201510	1530	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If it does transpire, it’s going to be absolutely horrible for Puerto Rico and its residents, but as I said in the past, the systemic effect on the broader US economy and the financial system is still likely to be very modest.	FS2	
201510	1531	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Puerto Rican debt already trades, for example, at a steep discount from par, and municipal bond insurers that are exposed to Puerto Rico play a much smaller role in the municipal bond market now than they did before the financial crisis.	FS2	
201510	1532	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	FS2	
201510	1533	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	FS2	
201510	1534	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	FS2	
201510	1535	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	This follows up on one of Andreas’s charts.	FS2	
201510	1536	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Recently, a number of economic research papers have focused on assessing the information content in credit spreads.	FS2	
201510	1537	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Not so long ago, we were concerned that credit spreads were unusually low, suggesting an underpricing of risk.	FS2	
201510	1538	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is noteworthy that spreads have moved from their unusually low levels.	FS2	
201510	1539	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Particularly at a time when we are actively considering tightening monetary policy, it is somewhat incongruous that we are seeing credit spreads reaching multiyear highs last seen several years ago when concerns over European problems were particularly acute.	FS2	
201510	1540	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	It should be noted, however, that at these levels, the spreads on high-yield bonds relative to Treasury bonds are significantly below the peaks seen during the financial crisis.	FS2	
201510	1541	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	If one looks at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch high-yield corporate bond index, high-yield spreads have risen 267 basis points since June 2014.	FS2	
201510	1542	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Although this increase has certainly been aggravated by the oil and commodity downturn that has significantly affected firms in those industries, the rise in high-yield bond spreads is not coming from that sector alone.	FS2	
201510	1543	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	For example, when the energy sector is excluded from the Bank of America Merrill Lynch high-yield index, high-yield spreads ex energy have widened 210 basis points.	FS2	
201510	1544	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	One explanation for the higher yield is concerns about the future growth of the economy.	FS2	
201510	1545	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, if so, concerns being expressed in bond spreads are at variance with our discussion on policy and the need to tighten rates.	FS2	
201510	1546	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	An alternative is that high-yield securities are now viewed as being more risky because of loosening underwriting standards and the previous willingness of investors to hold riskier assets.	FS2	
201510	1547	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	If so, we should be considering the implications for how these changes in high-yield bond characteristics may affect the performance of these bonds in a future downturn, as well as how such a downturn might cause investors to rapidly reduce their willingness to hold risky assets, further adding to any instability in bond markets.	FS2	
201510	1548	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	FS2	
201510	1549	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	FS2	
201510	1550	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	FS2	
201510	1551	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	FS2	
201510	1552	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m going to comment on these charts from a slightly different perspective as we sit here in approximately year six since the post-2009 low.	FS2	
201510	1553	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I agree with your conclusions.	FS2	
201510	1554	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I actually see a number of markets that seem to me to be quite overvalued.	FS2	
201510	1555	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	The US stock market leads the list for me when you consider that corporate earnings for 2015 are estimated to be down year-over-year and the market is still trading at about 19 times 2015 earnings.	FS2	
201510	1556	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	It’s one thing for the market to be trading at 17 or 18 times earnings when earnings are rising, but these earnings are actually declining.	FS2	
201510	1557	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	This multiple really strikes me as full.	FS2	
201510	1558	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Having said that, unlike a so-called bubble in which you have severe overvaluation that could lead to a boom and a bust, what I see that worries me maybe as much is a significant and prolonged trend in behavior affecting asset allocation, involving pools of capital, the choice between bonds and more risky assets, and carry trade taking place in various forms.	FS2	
201510	1559	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Let me explain one particular aspect of this that probably bothers me the most, and that is the change in the behavior of people running companies and what it means today to run a nonfinancial business.	FS2	
201510	1560	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	By the way, I would say that in the sixth year of an expansion, you would normally see more excess than we are seeing, but, not to be gratuitous, I think financial regulation has helped tamp it down, except in the area of people running companies.	FS2	
201510	1561	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Increasingly, CEOs have had to become not so much operators as financial engineers.	FS2	
201510	1562	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	This is widespread.	FS2	
201510	1563	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	It is now unusual for me to talk to a CEO who is not dealing with an activist, or the fear of an activist, in their stock and who is not actively being pressured to use financial engineering, often to buy back their stock in size.	FS2	
201510	1564	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	If you ask them what they would be doing if they were a private company or without the activists, a fraction of them would actually be using their resources to do things that would yield more revenue growth.	FS2	
201510	1565	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	But their time frames are much, much shorter.	FS2	
201510	1566	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	This is because—even though there have always been activists—in the past several years, the recent emergence of very, very large pools of activist capital means that the pools of capital are dramatically bigger now, as people are willing to allocate to riskier assets.	FS2	
201510	1567	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	It’s not surprising because not only time frames are shorter, but also the tenure of CEOs in this country is much shorter.	FS2	
201510	1568	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	It’s not a coincidence.	FS2	
201510	1569	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	These pools of capital have an extremely short time horizon, to the point at which I would call them renters of the stock, not owners of the stock.	FS2	
201510	1570	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	They’re not going to be around a year from now, they may not even be around six months from now, but they will stay around long enough to get a CEO—or groups of them will get a CEO—to take an action.	FS2	
201510	1571	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	These pools of capital can’t afford to be patient because the people who bought the pool themselves have made allocations away from bonds to riskier assets.	FS2	
201510	1572	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	And they’re probably overallocated to riskier assets, so they don’t have a lot of patience either.	FS2	
201510	1573	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	So what’s the point of all of this?	FS2	
201510	1574	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	A lot of this is a byproduct—not fatal yet, maybe, but I think it’s getting to be dangerous.	FS2	
201510	1575	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Considering our dual mandate, particularly real GDP and unemployment, I think this type of behavior continuing at this scale probably cannot be helpful to our desire to foster GDP growth and lower unemployment.	FS2	
201510	1576	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I don’t think it helps foster a flow of capital into more productive resource allocation that might actually grow revenue, create jobs, and increase productivity.	FS2	
201510	1577	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	This is something I haven’t seen before.	FS2	
201510	1578	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I’ve seen a lot of waves of takeover artists and others that were driving mergers, and, in a way, I like that trend better.	FS2	
201510	1579	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	These activists are not owners, they are short-term traders, and I am concerned that behavior is starting to be affected in a widespread way.	FS2	
201510	1580	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I think that, at some point, it is likely to undermine our ability to achieve our own mandate.	FS2	
201510	1581	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	That’s the comment I’d make on financial stability.	FS2	
201510	1582	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	FS2	
201510	1583	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	FS2	
201510	1584	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	FS2	
201510	1585	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	I want to say a few words about the QS and the work that’s being done in the Office of Financial Stability.	FS2	
201510	1586	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	The QS report we received on October 20, 2015, is really extremely useful, and it’s well summarized in two charts.	FS2	
201510	1587	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	The first one is on page 3, which we’ve talked about already.	FS2	
201510	1588	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	It’s the overall evaluation of what’s going on, with the overall assessment being that risks and vulnerabilities are moderate.	FS2	
201510	1589	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	The other one is on page 32—the radar chart that is sometimes known as “the spider’s web.”	FS2	
201510	1590	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	If we look at the one on page 32, it tells a very interesting story.	FS2	
201510	1591	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	On the side that says “Financial Sector Vulnerability,” relative to what there was before the crisis, there’s almost nothing that looks dangerous until we get around to consumer credit.	FS2	
201510	1592	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	And then commercial real estate sticks out as the one area in which we’re now in worse shape, according to this, than we were in 2006.	FS2	
201510	1593	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	This is a very useful chart for concentrating the mind and telling the story in a very vivid way.	FS2	
201510	1594	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	By the way, on page 32, there are a few things for which we don’t yet have the data—as far as I can see, we don’t yet have the data for nonfinancial business—so there may be something more that is problematic.	FS2	
201510	1595	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Now, the question is, “what are we supposed to do with this if we detect a problem area?”	FS2	
201510	1596	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	We’re likely to say, “Use macroprudential policy,” but we don’t have a whole lot of macroprudential tools.	FS2	
201510	1597	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	We have the countercyclical capital buffer, which is gradually making its way into regular examination by the Board.	FS2	
201510	1598	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	We have margin requirements, which we haven’t used for a long time.	FS2	
201510	1599	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	We have supervisory capacities, which, at least to those lenders we supervise, we can use to try to control risks.	FS2	
201510	1600	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	And we’ve got OMP, which is “open mouth policy,” which may do well in some circumstances.	FS2	
201510	1601	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	We don’t know how well this all works, and it’s something we’ll have to feel our way into.	FS2	
201510	1602	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	The other half of this—the stuff that Governor Tarullo and his colleagues in the FSOC are doing—is structural reforms, and that becomes the far more important part of what we have to do to reduce the potential costs of future crises or what might have been future crises.	FS2	
201510	1603	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	There’s a lot going on there.	FS2	
201510	1604	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	There are the very large increases in capital.	FS2	
201510	1605	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	We hope there will be improved resolution procedures soon.	FS2	
201510	1606	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	So we can feel a bit better about all of that, and we can feel that the effort that Nellie and her colleagues are putting into the surveillance is very, very useful.	FS2	
201510	1607	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	But we also have to remind ourselves that surveys like this and the work that goes on in the FSOC, which is monitoring, is essentially an intelligence exercise—it’s the exercise of an intelligence agency, which is inherently difficult.	FS2	
201510	1608	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	History tells you that however good the intelligence agencies are, they make mistakes and they miss things, which means, once again, that this is very, very important.	FS2	
201510	1609	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Getting the structure right, getting the ability to absorb losses is probably more important, without detracting in any way from what is being done by the people doing financial stability analysis.	FS2	
201510	1610	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	The only other thing I think we have to warn ourselves about is this great concern that every time you get into a crisis, the more you look, the more you find that there are problems that you missed, and so not to believe that small sectors don’t lead occasionally to big problems, and to keep that up.	FS2	
201510	1611	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	This is very important work that’s being done.	FS2	
201510	1612	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	It needs to be accompanied by other very important work on strengthening the financial sector’s ability to deal with shocks and problems.	FS2	
201510	1613	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	FS2	
201510	1614	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	FS2	
201510	1615	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	FS2	
201510	1616	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	FS2	
201510	1617	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I often say in public remarks that the Federal Reserve has a much better understanding of financial system vulnerabilities and risks than it did a decade ago.	FS2	
201510	1618	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I feel safe in saying that because of the work of the QS group, and I want to thank Nellie, Andreas, and the other QS contributors from all around the System for their thorough and thoughtful measurements and analysis.	FS2	
201510	1619	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I suggested earlier today, I believe that r* will be low for many years to come.	FS2	
201510	1620	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If so, the FOMC will achieve its dual-mandate objectives only in the presence of signs of financial instability, like high and possibly volatile asset prices.	FS2	
201510	1621	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This observation suggests to me that financial-stability considerations are likely to be a central consideration at FOMC discussions for years to come.	FS2	
201510	1622	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Committee will need to become even more systematic in its approach to these issues.	FS2	
201510	1623	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There are two key points as you think about how to become more systematic.	FS2	
201510	1624	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	First, as already noted, our statutory mandate is to promote price stability and to promote maximum employment.	FS2	
201510	1625	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I see financial stability mattering for this Committee only insofar as it affects the risks to the outlooks for inflation and unemployment.	FS2	
201510	1626	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The stance of monetary policy should not be influenced by a risk that some bondholders or collection of bondholders will lose money because of a rapid rise in term premiums.	FS2	
201510	1627	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	A relevant question for monetary policy is whether such a sudden revaluation of bonds lead to a decline in employment and prices that is not readily addressable using ex post monetary policy tools.	FS2	
201510	1628	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We need to have a way to trace the manifestations of financial instability into price and employment outcomes.	FS2	
201510	1629	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The second issue is, we need to know how changes in monetary policy would mitigate financial-stability concerns, mitigate the risks that I mentioned earlier.	FS2	
201510	1630	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Right now, I’m not sure that I even know the signs involved, let alone the magnitudes.	FS2	
201510	1631	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	For example, if we’re concerned about undue increases in house prices that could eventually lead to a housing bust, should we address the stability concerns by removing monetary accommodation to slow the rise in house prices or by adding monetary accommodation to cushion an eventual fall?	FS2	
201510	1632	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Presumably, it depends on the position you are in the cycle, but, as we know, that timing is hard to judge.	FS2	
201510	1633	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I said at the beginning, I feel the current financial stability briefing process has served the FOMC well, but I see it only as a first step.	FS2	
201510	1634	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The current approach implicitly treats financial stability as an add-on concern for the Committee’s consideration.	FS2	
201510	1635	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Committee and its staff should aim for the financial-stability briefing to be more seamlessly integrated into Tealbook A.	FS2	
201510	1636	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me be somewhat more specific about what I have in mind.	FS2	
201510	1637	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Tealbook A currently focuses on how monetary policy influences the modal outlook, which is grounded in the certainty equivalence principle that emerges from quadratic objectives.	FS2	
201510	1638	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I’ve discussed both here and in various conference settings, we can incorporate financial-stability considerations by seeing them as a way in which monetary policy influences the risks to the outlook beyond just the modal outlook itself.	FS2	
201510	1639	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would say the ultimate goal should be a Tealbook A that allows the Committee to gauge, in a systematic and quantitative way, how its monetary policy decisions will influence both the modal outlook and the risks associated with that outlook.	FS2	
201510	1640	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m optimistic that through the collective effort of QS and monetary economists around the System, this goal could well be achievable in a couple of years.	FS2	
201510	1641	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I was at the conference that the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston hosted on macroprudential tools—a great conference—and Lars Svensson presented some interesting work that started to push in this direction, and he threw down a gauntlet.	FS2	
201510	1642	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As those of you who have heard Lars before know, he’s done that before.	FS2	
201510	1643	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	He challenged people to find big effects of monetary policy on employment and price risks through financial stability.	FS2	
201510	1644	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	He was not able to find very much along those lines in his own calculations.	FS2	
201510	1645	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	While it’s not the way the System should think about financial stability, I think it would be great for this Committee to have a more integrated approach.	FS2	
201510	1646	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	FS2	
201510	1647	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	FS2	
201510	1648	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Can I just ask President Kocherlakota—this is your last meeting, so I’m not going to have this opportunity again—on that point you just made, I recall the fact that risk-management systems, particularly quantitative risk-management systems, of banks broke down because they were so bad at dealing with tail events.	FS2	
201510	1649	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I’m wondering whether there’s a similar problem here.	FS2	
201510	1650	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	The risk to financial stability—at least in the Williams–Tarullo understanding of it—is about intermediation.	FS2	
201510	1651	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	When those risks mature, it is a very big deal indeed, as we saw a few years ago, but because they tend not to go incrementally, it’s a tail-risk issue.	FS2	
201510	1652	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	And I’m wondering how the Tealbook kind of approach could be modified to incorporate tail risks in a sensible fashion like that.	FS2	
201510	1653	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it would be useful to actually draw upon thinking beyond the people in this room to try to address this.	FS2	
201510	1654	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Jeremy Stein, I think, when he was still Governor, made reference to the idea of having an objective that would be nonquadratic in nature.	FS2	
201510	1655	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So that starts to get at moments of the distribution beyond mean and variance.	FS2	
201510	1656	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It starts to force you to think about tail events.	FS2	
201510	1657	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Tail events are hard because they don’t occur very often, but I think the way you start to force yourself to think about them is to think about not just the mean, not just the variances, as I’ve emphasized in some of my talks or that Svensson has, but also these higher moments.	FS2	
201510	1658	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll give you my biases upfront.	FS2	
201510	1659	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Because of the uncertainties of how monetary policy actually influences all of these financial-stability considerations, I think it’s going to be hard to build a case in which you’re going to actually tighten to trade off the deterioration of the modal outlook you might get in order to achieve the lower probability of the tail events.	FS2	
201510	1660	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But that’s the way you would start to build it—to have an objective function that was starting to bring in aspects of the probability distribution other than just the mean and the variance.	FS2	
201510	1661	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	FS2	
201510	1662	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	FS2	
201510	1663	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Just one follow-up to that comment.	FS2	
201510	1664	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	The Survey of Professional Forecasters does try to provide a distribution.	FS2	
201510	1665	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’d say it doesn’t do very well at capturing the distribution, particularly in the tail.	FS2	
201510	1666	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	So it probably means thinking a bit more in terms of simulation exercises rather than trying to do what the Survey of Professional Forecasters does because my past experience with that is, it almost never captures tail events, and very rarely did the tails seem to widen prior to actual problems occurring.	FS2	
201510	1667	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I agree with what President Rosengren is saying.	FS2	
201510	1668	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My own guess about what the Survey of Professional Forecasters does is that they have normal Gaussian errors, they generate a bunch of simulations based on that, and they look at tails based on that Gaussian distribution.	FS2	
201510	1669	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s almost like you want to use scenario analysis to try to inform yourself and then think about how monetary policy might be influencing the probability of those scenarios.	FS2	
201510	1670	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it’s a very rich and, I hope, rewarding journey.	FS2	
201510	1671	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	2	2
201510	1672	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest we take a break at this point for about 15 minutes, and that takes us to about 3:50 pm  Then we’ll return to begin the economic go-round.	2	2
201510	1673	2015-10-28	meeting		[Coffee break]	2	2
201510	1674	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’re ready to begin the economic go-round.	2	2
201510	1675	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let me just mention before we do this that some of you may note a slight change from past practice.	2	2
201510	1676	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	It has been traditional, both in the economic go-round and in the policy go-round, for the Governors to speak at the end, after all of the presidents.	2	2
201510	1677	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	But—in a radical break with tradition—we’re going to shake this up a little bit and, from now on, just as you were polled on when you would like to speak, the same will be true for the Governors.	2	2
201510	1678	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	We are told when to speak.	2	2
201510	1679	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	2	2
201510	1680	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	So you may see a violation of the traditional order.	2	2
201510	1681	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s start the economic go-round with President Rosengren.	13	1
201510	1682	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	1683	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	The most serious concerns about the outlook that were raised at the September meeting seem now to have diminished.	13	1
201510	1684	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Neither the slower economic growth in many parts of the world nor the financial market turbulence at the end of August have spilled over noticeably into the domestic economy.	13	1
201510	1685	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Private domestic final purchases grew at a robust 3.9 percent rate in the second quarter, and the Tealbook forecasts similar growth for the third quarter at a 3.8 percent rate.	13	1
201510	1686	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston forecast is consistent with that outlook, with consumption expected to grow more than 3 percent in the second half of this year and residential investment continuing as a source of strength for the economy.	13	1
201510	1687	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	While the data for private domestic final purchases suggest little spillover from foreign developments to the domestic economy, strong domestic final demand has been needed to offset the greater-than-expected weakness in exports and inventories.	13	1
201510	1688	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	The effects of the appreciating dollar and continued disappointing economic growth among trading partners are largely responsible for our bank’s forecast of growth over the next six quarters only a bit faster than 2 percent.	13	1
201510	1689	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	With relatively sluggish productivity growth holding potential down, this pace of growth should gradually diminish the remaining labor market slack.	13	1
201510	1690	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	And relatively slow economic growth should also give us the flexibility to raise rates very gradually—possibly closer to current market expectations than to our last median SEP.	13	1
201510	1691	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Financial markets have recovered some of their lost ground, helped by policy easing abroad.	13	1
201510	1692	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Boston staff analysis of stock market movements since the middle of August finds little effect on the stock prices of firms with large foreign exposure.	13	1
201510	1693	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Firms with a larger share of shipments abroad generally—or, more specifically, with significant trade with China—registered cumulative stock price changes that were virtually unchanged from the middle of August to the end of September.	13	1
201510	1694	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	And since that time, stock markets have improved somewhat more.	13	1
201510	1695	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	With the recovery in stock markets since the August tumult and no notable effect on firms with the largest exposure to foreign trade, it is not surprising that the US economy has not suffered the potential collateral damage that encouraged us to defer the onset of tightening at our September meeting.	13	1
201510	1696	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	With my forecast projecting the unemployment rate to decline to 5 percent by the end of the year and continuing to decline in 2016, I am now reasonably confident that inflation will gradually move to 2 percent.	13	1
201510	1697	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	While core PCE inflation is still well below our target, recent price data do seem consistent with some firming since earlier this year.	13	1
201510	1698	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	And while we have consistently overestimated how quickly inflation will return to 2 percent, we have also consistently underestimated how quickly the unemployment rate would decline.	13	1
201510	1699	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	While U-3 is nearly at its full employment level, the broader U-6 measure is not yet back to normal.	13	1
201510	1700	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	And although U-6 has declined to 10 percent, it still needs to decline further.	13	1
201510	1701	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Work by my staff looking at U-6 and U-3 reveals that both remain elevated in some states relative to the period before the recession, consistent with our position that some slack remains in labor markets.	13	1
201510	1702	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is noteworthy that, in states in which U-3 has normalized, U-6 is still running above its pre-recession levels.	13	1
201510	1703	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	This may suggest that at least some of the elevated spread between U-6 and U-3 will be more persistent.	13	1
201510	1704	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	In summary, while I believe we are still somewhat above the natural rate of unemployment and I am comfortable probing a bit lower for it, especially given the low readings on inflation, I also recognize that we are already at or below the natural-rate estimates of many Committee members.	13	1
201510	1705	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Given the amount of monetary stimulus from low interest rates and our hefty balance sheet, I do not want unemployment to undershoot significantly our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment.	13	1
201510	1706	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because we have significantly underestimated the speed at which the unemployment rate has declined over the past four to five years, we need to be cognizant of the risk that labor markets could tighten more quickly as well as more slowly than we are currently anticipating.	13	1
201510	1707	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Tomorrow, I will discuss the implications of that heightened risk.	13	1
201510	1708	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	1709	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201510	1710	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13	1
201510	1711	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	1712	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	The Fifth District economy continued to expand at a moderate pace, with activity in the service sector generally more robust.	13	1
201510	1713	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Manufacturing activity was flat, according to our survey numbers, but our directors and contacts provided mostly positive reports on the sector.	13	1
201510	1714	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Falling energy prices reduced the cost of inputs for some manufacturers, but some of our contacts in the rail and trucking sectors noted a slowdown in manufacturing shipments in September that they attributed in part to an unfavorable exchange rate.	13	1
201510	1715	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	The service sector, on the other hand, continued to shine in October, according to our strong survey numbers and reports from contacts.	13	1
201510	1716	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	The frequency of reports of difficulties finding qualified workers has continued to trend upward.	13	1
201510	1717	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	We again heard reports of wage pressures in particular industries and skill groups, and the wage index numbers in our surveys remain elevated.	13	1
201510	1718	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Residential real estate markets continued to improve across many areas in the Fifth District, including notably the Hampton Roads area in southeastern Virginia, where defense cutbacks have been damping activity of late.	13	1
201510	1719	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	One exception to the positive residential news is Baltimore, where traffic is down notably over last year.	13	1
201510	1720	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	The outlook for commercial real estate continued to improve, although rising labor costs are said to be constraining construction activity.	13	1
201510	1721	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	In general, contacts reported strong demand, strong sales, rising rents, increased construction, and “lots of cranes in the air.”	13	1
201510	1722	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	One exception to the positive commercial news is D.C., where consolidation by defense contractors and others has thrown a lot of excess office space on the market.	13	1
201510	1723	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	At our last meeting, I argued that the national economic conditions were such that it would be prudent to start raising rates.	13	1
201510	1724	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	We had seen strong, sustained consumption growth and enough improvement in labor market conditions that slack seemed all but gone.	13	1
201510	1725	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Firm monthly inflation numbers for the first half of the year made me reasonably confident that inflation would return to target over the medium run.	13	1
201510	1726	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	What’s changed since September?	13	1
201510	1727	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	The inflation reports have not altered the picture much.	13	1
201510	1728	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Gasoline prices have dragged down top-line inflation as expected, but the core CPI was largely firm through September.	13	1
201510	1729	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Based on the experience from January to June, I think we should continue to be confident that overall inflation will return to target if oil prices stabilize or increase at moderate rates, as predicted by the Tealbook.	13	1
201510	1730	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	The retail sales report might have been a shade lower than expected, but the ex gasoline numbers strongly suggest that consumer spending continues to be strong.	13	1
201510	1731	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Indeed, the Tealbook is forecasting consumption growth at an annual rate of 3 percent for the second half.	13	1
201510	1732	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	As I discussed at the previous meeting, I think strong consumption growth argues for higher rates, even if we acknowledge evidence that the natural real rate might be low by historical standards.	13	1
201510	1733	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	As we discussed earlier today, estimates of the natural real rate based on semistructural approaches, such as the Laubach-Williams model and its variants, or less restrictive VAR approaches, such as those estimated by some economists in Richmond, are low but they are not negative.	13	1
201510	1734	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	In fact, the range of estimates is clustered at or just above zero.	13	1
201510	1735	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	On the other hand, the actual real rate is currently negative.	13	1
201510	1736	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	The Tealbook estimate is negative 1¼ percent using four-quarter lagged core PCE inflation, which is currently 1.3 percent, as a proxy for expected inflation, and that strikes me as at the low end of plausible estimates of expected inflation when you think about measures based on inflation compensation or surveys.	13	1
201510	1737	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	You get about negative 2 percent for the real rate if you proxy expected inflation with our inflation target, for example.	13	1
201510	1738	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	So even though the uncertainty surrounding estimates of r* is wide, the current real rate appears to be substantially below the natural rate, which suggests that we should expect the real rate to rise.	13	1
201510	1739	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	The September employment report seemed to disappoint market participants, but payroll employment growth was still substantially above the rate consistent with a stable employment-to-population ratio.	13	1
201510	1740	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	So if any slack remains in the labor market, it continues to decline.	13	1
201510	1741	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Some of the slowdown in payroll employment certainly may represent a softening in demand, particularly in manufacturing.	13	1
201510	1742	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	However, I think we need to take seriously the notion that some of the slowdown may represent increasingly binding supply constraints.	13	1
201510	1743	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	This would be consistent with widespread anecdotal reports of increasing difficulty in finding workers and the fact that job openings, despite ticking down a bit, are still quite elevated compared with a year ago, and they’re still quite elevated relative to hiring rates, which have flattened out this year.	13	1
201510	1744	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Indeed, slowing employment growth is just what one would expect if slack were disappearing.	13	1
201510	1745	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	One often hears the argument that if there is no longer any slack in labor markets, then we should see increasing nominal wage growth.	13	1
201510	1746	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	The presumption of a relationship between nominal wage growth and the elimination of slack makes intuitive sense, but the staff memo on compensation points out that slack is just not a major driver of nominal wage growth.	13	1
201510	1747	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	This analysis is consistent with a long line of empirical research on the cyclicality of real wages, most of which finds, at best, only weakly pro-cyclical aggregate real wages.	13	1
201510	1748	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Furthermore, what evidence there is for procyclical wages seems predominantly attributable to observations associated with large increases in the unemployment rate.	13	1
201510	1749	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	During periods of declining unemployment or low unemployment, you don’t see much relationship at all between wages and the unemployment rate.	13	1
201510	1750	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	So in current circumstances, we shouldn’t count on wages as our canary in the coal mine.	13	1
201510	1751	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Our September decision to wait and see was motivated to some degree by a desire for more information about the implications of global economic and financial developments for US economic growth.	13	1
201510	1752	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	On this front, the intermeeting news has made little difference for the modal outlook, it seems.	13	1
201510	1753	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	The Tealbook notes that somewhat disappointing news from emerging markets and Japan has been offset by stronger-than-expected economic growth in China and Canada.	13	1
201510	1754	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Dollar appreciation has reversed course, US equity prices have largely erased their decline, and volatility indexes have fallen.	13	1
201510	1755	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	I think it is fair to say that, if anything, the downside concerns about the US outlook associated with global developments have subsided since September.	13	1
201510	1756	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	To summarize, consumer spending is still going strong, slack is still gone, inflation is still likely to rise, and global concerns have been allayed.	13	1
201510	1757	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	So I think the case to raise rates is still strong.	13	1
201510	1758	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201510	1759	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13	1
201510	1760	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	1761	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The Eighth District economy continues to grow modestly other than in industries closely related to natural resources, energy, and perhaps agriculture.	13	1
201510	1762	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The District unemployment rate, which is measured across metropolitan statistical areas, is 4.9 percent.	13	1
201510	1763	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	That’s a little bit below the national level.	13	1
201510	1764	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The Eighth District has not been below the national level in the last several years.	13	1
201510	1765	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	St Louis board members did talk about wage prospects for 2016 and uniformly were talking about a total wage bill increase of 3 percent across the organization, for both skilled and unskilled employees.	13	1
201510	1766	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	So I do think we’ll see higher wages in the future.	13	1
201510	1767	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	They also said, which they have been saying for a long time, that there are pockets of areas like IT in which they’ve had to really work hard to meet the market.	13	1
201510	1768	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	But I was surprised by this 3 percent number across the board in both unskilled and skilled industries.	13	1
201510	1769	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Tyson, for instance, which is in the Eighth District, increased its starting wage by 10 to 15 percent.	13	1
201510	1770	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Generally speaking, I’d say that large multinationals report weakness, but domestically oriented companies are doing much better or very well.	13	1
201510	1771	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Nationally, tracking estimates for Q3 real GDP growth are low.	13	1
201510	1772	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	We think, as the Tealbook does, that this is mostly an outsized effect of inventory adjustment.	13	1
201510	1773	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	We have real GDP growth at negative 1¼ percent based on that.	13	1
201510	1774	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Final sales in the second half, as President Lacker was just noting, look pretty strong.	13	1
201510	1775	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	We’ll see how the third quarter actually comes out.	13	1
201510	1776	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	One of the tracking forecasters that tends to be an outlier on the high side, the St Louis news index model, currently projects 2¾ percent growth for the third quarter.	13	1
201510	1777	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	That index actually predicted the second quarter pretty closely, so we’ll see how that works out.	13	1
201510	1778	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	As other people have said earlier today, we interpret financial stress as having receded since our last meeting.	13	1
201510	1779	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The St Louis Fed Financial Stress Index is down.	13	1
201510	1780	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Equity prices are up over the intermeeting period.	13	1
201510	1781	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The VIX is down, trading below its longer-run average.	13	1
201510	1782	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	All of those things will tend to move the Financial Stress Index down.	13	1
201510	1783	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	For labor markets in the United States, I continue to see improvement, though we do have issues with some labor market indicators other than unemployment or nonfarm payroll employment.	13	1
201510	1784	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	There I would see a contest between things like claims, which are wildly low—the lowest they’ve been in many, many years—or job openings, which are very strong, and part-time for economic reasons or labor force participation, which tend to be weaker.	13	1
201510	1785	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	If you look at the Board’s labor market conditions index, the level is way above its long-run average value since 1976.	13	1
201510	1786	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I would take that as an indicator that, all things considered, we have a pretty good labor market, and it is continuing to get stronger.	13	1
201510	1787	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I do take seriously the idea that job growth is going to slow from here on, and I think this is a major challenge for the Committee.	13	1
201510	1788	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	It will probably drop below 200,000 jobs per month, down to 150,000 or below, and as that slowing is occurring, we will be trying to enter into a normalization cycle.	13	1
201510	1789	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think that’s going to be a very difficult thing for us and something that we’re going to have to face.	13	1
201510	1790	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	District and national contacts suggest that preparations are being made for a strong holiday season.	13	1
201510	1791	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think that’s consistent with the pretty good consumption growth that we’ve seen.	13	1
201510	1792	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Regarding the risks associated with the debt ceiling, I agree with others here in expecting to see a deal soon, based on developments in the last 24 to 48 hours.	13	1
201510	1793	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Chinese economic growth came in stronger than expected during the intermeeting period.	13	1
201510	1794	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I notice that the IMF did not downgrade China’s economic outlook very meaningfully in its most recent report.	13	1
201510	1795	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I interpret these things as indications that the risk of a hard landing in China is at least diminished for now.	13	1
201510	1796	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Regarding policy, I think the risk of the Fed not moving off the zero lower bound is up dramatically since our September decision.	13	1
201510	1797	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Why do I think this?	13	1
201510	1798	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	In broad-brush terms, the staff forecast is for very slow growth, steady unemployment, and inflation low and continuing below target.	13	1
201510	1799	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	So I think that the convergence to the steady state described by Benhabib and his co- authors that we were talking about earlier today is now more likely than not for the United States, and I’m going to talk about that for just a little bit.	13	1
201510	1800	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	My main concern is that the Committee has not really thought about this as a possible outcome despite my haranguing you about it for a couple of years, and now I think we might have to take it a lot more seriously.	13	1
201510	1801	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Another thing that’s worrying me is the global convergence that’s going on.	13	1
201510	1802	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	It used to be just Japan, but now you’ve got Japan plus the euro zone.	13	1
201510	1803	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The euro zone is going to be at zero policy rates for quite a long time, and that seems like a clear reality.	13	1
201510	1804	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	This is not a good outcome, in my view.	13	1
201510	1805	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	It’s a second-best outcome.	13	1
201510	1806	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	It would be much better to go back to the equilibrium that we know and love from the 1980s and 1990s.	13	1
201510	1807	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Most of our intuition about monetary policy comes from that equilibrium, but now I think that we’ve got a better than 50–50 chance of not being able to get back to that equilibrium.	13	1
201510	1808	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	So my main message here is that the Committee needs to face up to this likely outcome.	13	1
201510	1809	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I thought I’d just list seven of the consequences of convergence to the unintended low nominal interest rate, low inflation steady state from the Benhabib et al. analysis.	13	1
201510	1810	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	First, monetary policy becomes passive at this steady state.	13	1
201510	1811	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	What does this mean?	13	1
201510	1812	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	It means that shocks hit the economy, and monetary policy doesn’t really react.	13	1
201510	1813	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	You’re at the mercy of shocks that hit the economy.	13	1
201510	1814	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	You might think of Japan as being in this situation over the past 10 years.	13	1
201510	1815	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	They’ve had several recessions during that period.	13	1
201510	1816	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Second, promising to remain at the zero lower bound simply reinforces the equilibrium, and it is no longer counted as accommodative policy because everyone already expects that you’re going to stay at the zero lower bound.	13	1
201510	1817	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	So that’s where the steady state is.	13	1
201510	1818	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	And whether you want to promise directly that you’ll stay at the zero bound longer or you want to go through a QE route, in which the QE is interpreted as promising to stay at the zero bound longer, either way you wouldn’t have any effect if you’ve already converged to this equilibrium outcome.	13	1
201510	1819	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Third, inflation would remain below target, and you would not be able to get inflation to the target.	13	1
201510	1820	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	And just so that you’re not completely giving up hope with me, I do buy into the idea that the energy price shock is going to wear off and inflation is going to come back to target.	13	1
201510	1821	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I’m not completely buying into the Benhabib et al. steady state here.	13	1
201510	1822	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	But if we did get stuck in that steady state, inflation would just stay below target.	13	1
201510	1823	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Fourth, medium-term economic growth would still be driven by human capital and technological improvement, as it is in most of our analysis, but you wouldn’t have the accompanying stabilization policy that you would normally have.	13	1
201510	1824	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	So you’d be at the mercy of shocks that hit the economy, though long-run growth would still be driven by the same things that it’s always driven by.	13	1
201510	1825	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Fifth, the risk of an asset price bubble would be high.	13	1
201510	1826	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Real interest rates would be low.	13	1
201510	1827	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	As we were talking about earlier today, the nominal interest rate would be zero.	13	1
201510	1828	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	This would presumably put you at risk of volatile asset price movements.	13	1
201510	1829	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	One thing I sometimes emphasize here is that the policy of r equals zero, or just any policy of an interest rate peg under which the interest rate doesn’t react to shocks that come into the economy, is actually the worst policy in the New Keynesian model because it allows many volatile equilibriums to occur.	13	1
201510	1830	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	So if you think that those are realistic possibilities, you could think of that as one reason why making the policy rate equal zero forever would lead to the possibility of excessive asset price movements.	13	1
201510	1831	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Sixth, there would be no prospect of simple normalization.	13	1
201510	1832	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Talk of normalization would just dwindle to nothing.	13	1
201510	1833	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	And, seven, there would be much more contemplation of extraordinary monetary policy, such as a Shinzo Abe–type effort to get away from the zero lower bound, and all the difficulties associated with that.	13	1
201510	1834	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	So I am worried about this possibility.	13	1
201510	1835	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think we’ve gotten much closer to it this fall, and I’ll comment more on this possibility tomorrow.	13	1
201510	1836	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	1837	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201510	1838	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13	1
201510	1839	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	1840	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I continue to believe the economy is on a solid growth track, growing at a moderate pace.	13	1
201510	1841	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I believe much of the recent softness in some data can be explained by short-term factors that do not amount to a serious headwind that would require altering my outlook.	13	1
201510	1842	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	My base-case outlook sees economic growth above trend, higher than the staff forecast, with continuing progress, broadly defined, in labor market indicators.	13	1
201510	1843	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I also continue to believe inflation will begin converging to target in 2016, once transitory factors work through.	13	1
201510	1844	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	My team conducted more than 80 interviews over the six weeks since our previous meeting.	13	1
201510	1845	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	We also had meetings of all of our advisory committees.	13	1
201510	1846	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Anecdotal feedback was largely consistent with my interpretation of the data and the outlook I just characterized.	13	1
201510	1847	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	There are pockets of weakness, but it is not broad based.	13	1
201510	1848	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Contacts whose activities are substantially domestic remain generally positive about business prospects.	13	1
201510	1849	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	However, those connected to the external sector and energy sector are experiencing the weakness that the data portray.	13	1
201510	1850	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Here is some color commentary from the Sixth District.	13	1
201510	1851	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Activity in ports, particularly outbound cargo to Asia, has declined sharply.	13	1
201510	1852	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Energy-related firms are feeling stress.	13	1
201510	1853	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Layoffs in the oil and gas sector have increased, and more adjustments are projected for 2016 if oil prices don’t recover.	13	1
201510	1854	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Domestic shipping has softened across all major modes of transport.	13	1
201510	1855	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	A significant share of that slowing appears to be tied to reduced export activity and a dropoff in commodity hauls, especially coal.	13	1
201510	1856	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Excess capacity in long-haul trucking was reported, which is a notable change from a year ago.	13	1
201510	1857	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	We probed on the question of inventory conditions.	13	1
201510	1858	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Our contacts with visibility in inventory trends—logistics firms, for example—did not treat the inventory picture as cause for concern.	13	1
201510	1859	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Several sources advised that a wide range of imports, from finished autos to raw commodities, are being stockpiled in the United States simply because sales opportunities are likely to be better here than elsewhere.	13	1
201510	1860	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Some contacts opined that it is conceivable that global influences could be felt in the near term in markets that are usually insulated from foreign competitors.	13	1
201510	1861	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	The auto sector continues to produce and sell at a strong pace by historic standards.	13	1
201510	1862	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Our director, who heads the country’s largest auto retailer, believes the sales pace is likely to be sustained even if interest rates rise.	13	1
201510	1863	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Residential real estate in my District remains healthy in terms of both new construction and sales.	13	1
201510	1864	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Finally, some retailers noted a slowdown in sales in the third quarter, but most remain optimistic, expecting that sales this quarter will pick up and be equivalent to or better than the fourth quarter a year ago, which they considered very good.	13	1
201510	1865	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	You will recall that PCE last year rose at an annual rate of 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter, and it was broad based.	13	1
201510	1866	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	To find the signal in the recent mixed data and anecdotal input, my staff and I are putting emphasis on real final sales.	13	1
201510	1867	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	According to our most recent GDP tracking estimate for the third quarter, final sales to domestic purchasers appear to show growth at an annual rate of around 3½ percent, which is essentially unchanged from the robust second quarter.	13	1
201510	1868	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	That said, we see the bottom line for third-quarter real GDP growth as weak compared with the second quarter, reflecting inventory swings and the suppressing effect of net exports.	13	1
201510	1869	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Our numbers indicated that net exports could take 0.7 percentage point off the real final sales top line, so to speak, and inventory rebalancing could reduce growth another 2 percentage points.	13	1
201510	1870	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Nonetheless, I am prepared to look through these effects, and I think the continuing strength of real final sales is the story.	13	1
201510	1871	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I am also sticking to my belief that recent subtarget inflation readings are mostly due to a stronger dollar and falling global commodity prices, and that stronger inflation readings are likely as the global situation stabilizes.	13	1
201510	1872	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I have taken notice of the reduced speed of job growth in August and September.	13	1
201510	1873	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	But, as we know, a complete picture of the labor market is hard to see from a single indicator over just a few months.	13	1
201510	1874	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	The level of unemployment continues to fall.	13	1
201510	1875	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Jobless claims are still pushing lower.	13	1
201510	1876	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	The share of workers working part time for economic reasons and the associated broad measure of joblessness, U-6, both fell sharply in September.	13	1
201510	1877	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Layoff and discharge rates remain low and steady, and job openings are elevated.	13	1
201510	1878	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	The entirety of the labor market data, at this date, at least, has me leaving my unemployment rate projection unchanged and essentially the same as the Tealbook.	13	1
201510	1879	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	To summarize, I acknowledge there are risks to my rather positive spin on the outlook.	13	1
201510	1880	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	The risks may be reflected in some recent data.	13	1
201510	1881	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Recent developments such as the drag due to weakness in net exports could be both underestimated and more persistent.	13	1
201510	1882	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	That said, I think the prospects that data will confirm my assessment of the economy by the time we meet in December are reasonably good.	13	1
201510	1883	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	And I would prefer that the policy statement reflect that possibility—even, I would argue, likelihood—in language that achieves a soft lean toward liftoff.	13	1
201510	1884	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I will comment further on that in tomorrow’s policy go-round.	13	1
201510	1885	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	1886	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201510	1887	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13	1
201510	1888	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	1889	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I’m going to offer a bit of a brief against data dependence and do that as cover for explaining why my outlook hasn’t changed very much since September.	13	1
201510	1890	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	And when I say “a brief against data dependence,”	13	1
201510	1891	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think there is anything terribly original in what I’m about to say.	13	1
201510	1892	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I think the problems with data dependence don’t manifest themselves very much in this room, because I think people tend to give their actual outlooks.	13	1
201510	1893	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	But I think these problems have been manifesting themselves in our public communications, in which a focus on one or a few pieces of data somehow implies that whether there are, for example, three good and two bad data points over the course of the next month or two is going to make a difference to policy.	13	1
201510	1894	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	As we all know, what’s going on in the economy generally doesn’t change fundamentally from month to month.	13	1
201510	1895	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	We all have, either implicitly or explicitly, our own narrative as to what is basically going on in the economy.	13	1
201510	1896	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	This narrative should be, and I think is for most of us, resistant to a few, or maybe even more than a few, incongruous data points.	13	1
201510	1897	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	To change it takes something that suggests that you have to rethink the story you’re telling yourself about the economy.	13	1
201510	1898	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Those subtleties often don’t come through in public communication, though, particularly when coupled with the identification of a particular time when we think the data may be right for liftoff.	13	1
201510	1899	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I think it can leave people with a misimpression about how the actual decisionmaking is taking place here, and, indeed, how everybody individually is assessing the economy.	13	1
201510	1900	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I want to now explain why my basic outlook, my own narrative, hasn’t changed that much since September and explain why that outlook leaves me in the position that I’ve been in for a while now of having been externally characterized as being in the “show me” group of members of the FOMC.	13	1
201510	1901	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	In September, I think the basic components of my outlook were the following:  We had modestly above-trend economic growth, though likely with some slowing, particularly in the labor market.	13	1
201510	1902	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	There was no evidence of a pickup in inflation or, to the degree it’s relevant, nominal wage growth in the context of a globally disinflationary environment.	13	1
201510	1903	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	There were continued puzzles in various economic developments—again, particularly in the labor market—reflecting the continued difficulty of determining the degree to which we are just in an elongated reversion to pre-crisis conditions and correlations, or the degree to which secular changes may be under way that mean that those conditions and correlations may not reappear.	13	1
201510	1904	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	And, finally, there was a very high degree of uncertainty about the global economy, with potentially dramatic downside risks following the August market movements in China, and there was resulting increased upward pressure on the dollar.	13	1
201510	1905	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	So what have we seen since September?	13	1
201510	1906	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	First, there has been some softening of incoming data, particularly in industrial production, employment, and recently even in housing, which had looked to be gaining strength.	13	1
201510	1907	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	But, as several of you have commented, consumer spending has stood up fairly well during this period.	13	1
201510	1908	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Second, I think it is probably too early to know exactly how much the labor market has slowed down or whether it has slowed down as much as the current September numbers suggest.	13	1
201510	1909	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	People have already noted that August and September job numbers are more susceptible to revision than your average monthly job numbers, so we may see some change there.	13	1
201510	1910	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	As to the external environment, possible downside risks certainly seem less dramatic than at the September meeting.	13	1
201510	1911	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	But as reflected in the actual and anticipated actions of the People’s Bank of China, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of Japan, economic prospects in those major economies are still quite uncertain, with significant remaining downside risks.	13	1
201510	1912	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	The trend of the dollar in the coming quarters really does matter—I think significantly.	13	1
201510	1913	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	It’s had a major effect on economic performance this year, and it certainly could be a disappointing source of downside risk over the next year as well.	13	1
201510	1914	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	It’s hard to say at the moment whether the upward pressure on the dollar created by the various anticipated central bank moves in the rest of the world will be offset by significantly enhanced economic growth abroad or more than transitory effects on asset prices in the United States or both.	13	1
201510	1915	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	However, in light of the relatively sober expectations regarding earnings reports, to which President Kaplan referred this morning, we can’t be sure that this will be the case.	13	1
201510	1916	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	What are the implications of these changes for my outlook and, thus, for policy?	13	1
201510	1917	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	As I said, I don’t think it changes them much.	13	1
201510	1918	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Looking at our dual criteria of continued improvement in labor markets and reasonable assurance that inflation will return to target, I don’t see these data as having provided a reason to change that outlook very much.	13	1
201510	1919	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to labor markets, we are likely to be seeing some slowing.	13	1
201510	1920	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Thus, while I’m still inclined to believe we can have some further improvement in labor markets without negative inflationary consequences, it seems to me, at least, even more likely that any pickup in inflation won’t get away from us.	13	1
201510	1921	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	And I think the case for a lower short-term natural rate of unemployment continues to be fairly strong.	13	1
201510	1922	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I am not going to repeat what I said last meeting—or, for that matter, in numerous earlier meetings—on the level of uncertainty that attends efforts to pin down, with any degree of precision, the natural rate or relationship of unemployment to price inflation.	13	1
201510	1923	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I will just note that the staff memo on labor compensation and the Tealbook box on Okun’s law are two further reminders of how sensitive the inferred relationships are to assumptions about unobservables.	13	1
201510	1924	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Several of you have mentioned job openings.	13	1
201510	1925	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	The run-up to a historically high level of job openings over the past year has been hard to understand when quits and hires have not moved much in tandem, or even with a lag, in relation to openings.	13	1
201510	1926	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Decomposition of the data showing that, for example, professional services openings have increased by 50 percent over the past year suggest the measure may be a bit misleading, a conclusion that is reinforced by the fact that using the Conference Board’s numbers for openings would leave the recent plotted points on the Beveridge curve pretty consistent with its pre-crisis shape.	13	1
201510	1927	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	But there is probably some information value in the fact that both the Labor Department’s and Conference Board’s total job openings numbers have been trending down a little bit of late, though I’m not sure how much information value there is there.	13	1
201510	1928	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to inflation, the arguments here are pretty familiar.	13	1
201510	1929	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	We have already heard a couple, and I’ll bet you that over the rest of this go-round the familiar arguments on both sides will likely be repeated.	13	1
201510	1930	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t want to take direct issue with the argument that most of the current downward pressure on inflation can be attributed to declines in energy prices and increases in the dollar, but I do want to observe, again, that we are in a generally disinflationary environment.	13	1
201510	1931	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	It is also worth noting that the pattern of the past several years has been that most observers keep expecting a bigger increase in inflation than turns out to be the case.	13	1
201510	1932	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I am going to take a random example:  us, meaning both the staff and FOMC participants.	13	1
201510	1933	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	If you look at the evolution of the staff forecast in each of the past three years, the forecast for inflation toward the end of the year preceding the year forecasted was consistently 0.2 to 0.4 percentage point above where it ended up.	13	1
201510	1934	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I’m including 2015 here, assuming that the current projection in the Tealbook for 2015 ends up more or less to be the case.	13	1
201510	1935	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Similarly, the SEP shows repeated overestimation of what core PCE inflation will be in the succeeding year.	13	1
201510	1936	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	In September 2012, the central-tendency projection of core inflation in 2013 was 1.7 to 2 percent; actual inflation in 2013 was 1.5 percent.	13	1
201510	1937	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	In September 2013, the central-tendency projection for 2014 was 1.5 to 1.7 percent; the actual was 1.4 percent.	13	1
201510	1938	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	In September 2014, the central-tendency projection for 2015 was 1.6 to 1.9 percent, and as we sit here at the end of October, we are now expecting somewhere around 1.4 percent.	13	1
201510	1939	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	In fact, if you look at those three SEPs in September preceding the beginning of the year for which the projection was made, it appears that there was only one projection of inflation among all of us during that period that turned out to get the number right, and no projections that anticipated inflation would be lower than it actually turned out to be.	13	1
201510	1940	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	As a group, we have also been wrong on real GDP growth pretty consistently in the same direction.	13	1
201510	1941	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	As President Rosengren pointed out, we have been wrong on employment pretty consistently as well.	13	1
201510	1942	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	There is quite likely some correlation in GDP and inflation, but something else is going on with respect to unemployment.	13	1
201510	1943	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	That pattern suggests that there may be some underlying fundamentals affecting inflation, and possibly economic growth, in a more persistent way, and that we mistake the transitory nature of specific depressing factors for below-target inflation itself being transitory.	13	1
201510	1944	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Now, just because that has been the case for the past three years doesn’t mean it’s going to be the case indefinitely in the future.	13	1
201510	1945	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	But when I put the difficulties of using past correlations together with our systematic overestimation of what inflation will be as well as with the number of questions that many of us are asking inside and outside this room about possible secular changes in the economy, it does put me in a position of wanting to rely on data that provide more direct evidence of meeting the inflation target than what I would term “inferential evidence,” or evidence from which inferences can be drawn.	13	1
201510	1946	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	So what I will be looking for over the course of the next couple of months and beyond are data points that make an argument for changing that outlook.	13	1
201510	1947	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	And I can certainly imagine what they may be.	13	1
201510	1948	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I can imagine them in the next couple of months, and I can imagine them taking a little bit longer.	13	1
201510	1949	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I’ll end by saying that while I do think we should resist the tendency to be data dependent in a talismanic fashion, we certainly don’t want to be data insensitive either.	13	1
201510	1950	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	1951	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201510	1952	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	13	1
201510	1953	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	1954	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Our District, like the nation, has seen a step down in economic growth.	13	1
201510	1955	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Job growth has pretty much stalled, and manufacturing has declined.	13	1
201510	1956	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	However, retail sales, especially those at auto dealers, remain strong.	13	1
201510	1957	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	There is a high degree of confidence among both consumers and firms, and unemployment insurance claims are down.	13	1
201510	1958	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Overall, I would still categorize economic growth in the Third District as modest.	13	1
201510	1959	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Employment growth slowed in both August and September, and unemployment has remained flat.	13	1
201510	1960	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Participation rates have remained flat over the past year as well.	13	1
201510	1961	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Indicators of Third District manufacturing activity have also indicated weakness.	13	1
201510	1962	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	The current activity index in our manufacturing Business Outlook Survey was negative for the second month in a row, and it displayed substantial weakness in all of the subindustries as well.	13	1
201510	1963	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Although manufacturers remain optimistic, it is safe to say they are currently hurting a bit.	13	1
201510	1964	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Meanwhile, the service sector is performing much more strongly than manufacturing.	13	1
201510	1965	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	In our nonmanufacturing Business Outlook Survey, employment bounced back strongly in October, and the index is solidly in positive territory.	13	1
201510	1966	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	The general activity index in the October survey rebounded after a relatively weak summer, and respondents remain optimistic.	13	1
201510	1967	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Sales of light vehicles are at near-record levels, and bank lending has been growing rapidly.	13	1
201510	1968	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Regarding real estate, growth in both residential and nonresidential construction lags that of the nation, and house prices continue to rise more slowly as well.	13	1
201510	1969	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	The exception is the Philadelphia area.	13	1
201510	1970	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	With respect to price pressures, the prices received index has resurfaced from negative territory, and both future prices paid and received have entered positive territory.	13	1
201510	1971	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	So while there is no evidence of rapid price increases, disinflationary pressures appear to be waning.	13	1
201510	1972	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Turning to the nation as a whole, I believe the real economy remains healthy overall, even though economic growth has slowed somewhat.	13	1
201510	1973	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Although it is not totally unscathed, the economy appears to have weathered the significant late summer decline in stock prices, the temporary increase in financial market volatility, the effects of weakening growth in China, the fall in oil prices, and an appreciation of the dollar.	13	1
201510	1974	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Further, the waning in price pressures appears to be a temporary phenomenon, and I am somewhat more confident that inflation will gradually firm in the coming months.	13	1
201510	1975	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Thus, I agree for the most part with the Board staff’s assessment of the economy.	13	1
201510	1976	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	The Committee is placing a lot emphasis on labor market conditions in its assessment of when to begin policy normalization, and I would like to suggest an examination of how the Affordable Care Act may be affecting some of the measures we look at—namely, wage pressures and the number of involuntary part-time workers.	13	1
201510	1977	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	A number of recent papers investigate how that law is affecting these variables, and some of that research is being done in our own research department.	13	1
201510	1978	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	While there is certainly no consensus on the magnitude or the nature of the increase in part-time work that is ensuing as a result of the ACA, the legislation represents a significant change in the labor market landscape.	13	1
201510	1979	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	I’m thinking here of research by Aizawa and Fang, Nakajima and Tüzemen, Even and McPherson, and Mulligan.	13	1
201510	1980	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	This research points to the possibility that the ACA is increasing the prevalence of part-time work in the economy and may have caused an increase in the incidence of U-6 unemployment.	13	1
201510	1981	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	I believe we should keep this growing body of research on the ACA in mind when assessing labor market conditions.	13	1
201510	1982	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	The labor market of the future may not, and probably will not, look exactly like the labor market of the past.	13	1
201510	1983	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Thus, the wage growth we are experiencing may indicate a healthier labor market than we think, and the somewhat larger than historical difference between U-6 and U-3 may be due in part to a structural transformation in the labor market.	13	1
201510	1984	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	1985	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13	1
201510	1986	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	1987	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	The incoming data suggest that economic activity has slowed a bit since midyear.	13	1
201510	1988	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Payroll job gains have eased from 210,000 per month in the first half to 170,000 per month in the third quarter, with 180,000 expected for the fourth quarter.	13	1
201510	1989	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	GDP growth has stepped down just a little bit, from a 2¼ percent rate in the first half to an expectation of a 1¾ percent rate in the second half.	13	1
201510	1990	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Despite that, I see the underlying economic growth narrative as generally intact.	13	1
201510	1991	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	And that narrative is based on continued strong growth of private domestic final purchases in the range of about 3 percent, underpinned by the strong job gains of the past three years, increases in real income, continued gradual healing in housing markets, and improved household confidence.	13	1
201510	1992	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	That rate of growth should also mean continued job creation at a pace that will materially reduce labor market slack.	13	1
201510	1993	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	The drag on GDP growth generated by the downshift in inventory investment is likely a one-off event.	13	1
201510	1994	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Activity is likely to pick up in the current quarter.	13	1
201510	1995	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	The drag arising from net exports will continue for a while longer but should begin to fade next year if the dollar roughly stabilizes.	13	1
201510	1996	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	I am also a bit more confident in the outlook than I was at the last meeting.	13	1
201510	1997	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	The September meeting followed a month of rising uncertainty about prospects in China and the emerging markets and was accompanied by substantial financial turmoil.	13	1
201510	1998	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	At that time, I did not see that the modal outlook had changed, but rather that the chances of realizing downside cases had increased.	13	1
201510	1999	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	And many emerging markets, of course, remain vulnerable to slower growth in China, lower commodity prices, and substantial leverage.	13	1
201510	2000	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	But the risk of an emerging market– driven crisis that would have substantially affected US economic growth seems to me to have receded.	13	1
201510	2001	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Most importantly, the data have reinforced the view that China is not facing a hard landing.	13	1
201510	2002	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Mutual fund outflows from emerging market funds have stopped for now, corporate debt spreads have declined, most EME stock markets are up since the September FOMC, and their currencies have, for now, appreciated against the dollar.	13	1
201510	2003	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Average hourly earnings, the only piece of wage data that we received during the intermeeting period, rose at a 2¼ percent pace over the 12 months ending in September, the same pace as in the previous 12 months.	13	1
201510	2004	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	There has been much discussion about the lack of acceleration in wages and what it might mean, and the memo on wages and slack did an excellent job of reviewing what we can and cannot glean from wage data.	13	1
201510	2005	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	The paper’s basic finding is that, under current staff assumptions regarding trend inflation, structural productivity growth, and the natural rate of unemployment, wages are not growing unusually slowly.	13	1
201510	2006	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	The underlying narrative is that the effects of declining slack and disappointing productivity are more or less offsetting.	13	1
201510	2007	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	But the model uses averages of productivity growth over fairly long periods of time as its benchmark for the trend.	13	1
201510	2008	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	If, by contrast, actual businesses were looking at shorter-term trends, which I suspect might be the case, then one could argue that wage growth is relatively high, as productivity has for a number of years been well below the 1½ percent trend used by the model.	13	1
201510	2009	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	That would also imply that the natural rate of unemployment would be higher.	13	1
201510	2010	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	To be clear, I’m not arguing that; I’m just suggesting that the risks seem to me to be well balanced on both sides.	13	1
201510	2011	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	In addition, as recently shown in a paper by Ekaterina Peneva and Jeremy Rudd, as well as many other papers over the years, wages have not been a reliable predictor of price inflation for a long time.	13	1
201510	2012	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	The implication of all that is that the FOMC should not be using nominal or real wages as a litmus test but should instead monitor them, as they may provide some information about the natural rate of unemployment.	13	1
201510	2013	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Turning to inflation:  The picture is slightly improved since our September meeting, with a bit more inflation over the second half of the year.	13	1
201510	2014	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	The Tealbook has 1.4 percent core inflation in both Q3 and Q4 despite residual seasonality, so the true underlying number could be a bit higher.	13	1
201510	2015	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	If you more or less mechanically add onto that number the effect of import prices and a little bit of leakage through from lower oil prices—a total of 30 basis points or so—one could easily see underlying core inflation as running in the range of 1¾ percent.	13	1
201510	2016	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	And from there, it requires no great leap of faith for me to see inflation returning to 2 percent over the medium term once these transitory factors recede provided, critically, that resource utilization continues to tighten.	13	1
201510	2017	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	A key question for me is whether economic growth will continue to be materially above trend for some time.	13	1
201510	2018	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	With some slack remaining in the economy and with inflation below target, we need above-trend growth to continue the healing process.	13	1
201510	2019	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	And while I expect economic growth to be above trend, the margin is not a large one.	13	1
201510	2020	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	This question, which I will return to tomorrow, has important implications for policy, and I hope for some intermeeting clarity from the data—perhaps yet another example of the triumph of hope over experience.	13	1
201510	2021	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	2022	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201510	2023	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13	1
201510	2024	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	2025	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	In my remarks on the economic situation in the past few meetings, I have said I believed that we were closing in on full employment, and that I was reasonably confident inflation would rise to 2 percent in the medium term.	13	1
201510	2026	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Well, those statements are still true, but they may not be as firmly held as they were in September in light of the two most recent job market reports.	13	1
201510	2027	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	So I’d like to discuss the two main issues I will be watching most in the coming weeks as we decide what we want to do in December.	13	1
201510	2028	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	The first and most important issue is whether the economy is continuing to expand.	13	1
201510	2029	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	There would be two reasons for concern if the economy is stalling.	13	1
201510	2030	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	First, if it is stalling, we will need to be thinking about instituting some expansionary monetary policy, and that wouldn’t be consistent with raising the interest rate.	13	1
201510	2031	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Second, if the economy is stalling, I would be becoming less confident that we will reach our 2 percent inflation goal as soon as I would like.	13	1
201510	2032	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	So that is the critical concern.	13	1
201510	2033	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Although the macro data have been indicating further expansion almost all year, the most recent two labor reports were not encouraging.	13	1
201510	2034	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	And in the next couple of months, I’d like to see payrolls rise by at least enough to keep the unemployment rate steady and perhaps falling slightly.	13	1
201510	2035	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	I would also like to be sure before the end of tomorrow that we have a good idea of what the figure for maintaining the unemployment rate steady will be, and I think we should all hear from the staff on what those numbers would be.	13	1
201510	2036	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Ideally, we might also get some upward revisions to weak August and September readings.	13	1
201510	2037	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	This seems possible because domestic demand, particularly consumption and business investment spending, appears to be holding up quite well.	13	1
201510	2038	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	So that’s the main issue that we should be looking at.	13	1
201510	2039	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thinking about all that, one of the things I like about these meetings is listening to the presidents tell us what is going on in their Districts.	13	1
201510	2040	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	And I am impressed that an increasing number of presidents think that whatever is going on in their Districts suggests that we should raise the discount rate.	13	1
201510	2041	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Of course, not every president who has spoken so far today has reported improvements in economic developments in their District.	13	1
201510	2042	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	I thought President Harker was, at best, balanced and possibly reported a slight negative trend.	13	1
201510	2043	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	But for those who remember that Texas is key to economic growth in the United States—something we all learned previously— economic activity is growing again in the—what is that, the Eighth District?	13	1
201510	2044	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	13	1
201510	2045	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I think it is still the 11th District.	13	1
201510	2046	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Still the 11th.	13	1
201510	2047	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Of course.	13	1
201510	2048	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	I didn’t know you were so far away.	13	1
201510	2049	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	The Twelfth is very large.	13	1
201510	2050	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Do you think they did that to make the Texans mad, that they’re not the biggest District?	13	1
201510	2051	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	There wasn’t that much out there 100 years ago.	13	1
201510	2052	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	13	1
201510	2053	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Anyway, I’m glad that Texas is growing again, so that the world is coming back to normal in that respect.	13	1
201510	2054	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	The second issue relates to wage growth.	13	1
201510	2055	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	When talking about prices, I keep being bothered about the emphasis that is placed on wage growth and why it hasn’t risen.	13	1
201510	2056	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	I read with interest the memo that was sent to us by Deb Lindner, John Roberts, and Bill Wascher on compensation and labor market slack.	13	1
201510	2057	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	I thought the memo was remarkably clear, and I was particularly struck by their specification of the wage equation, which showed wage growth depending, inter alia, on a weighted moving average of structural productivity growth.	13	1
201510	2058	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	With structural productivity growth having been so weak in recent years, it is probably not surprising that we are seeing disappointing real wage growth.	13	1
201510	2059	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	That is, on the demand side, it’s hard to see why, when productivity is barely rising, real wages would be expected to be rising at any significant rate.	13	1
201510	2060	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Having said that, there may nonetheless be more wage gains occurring in the economy than we are seeing in our favorite wage measures.	13	1
201510	2061	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	The Lindner, Roberts, and Wascher memo showed in its figure 6 that some measures of wage pressures have been rising more robustly than the employment cost index and average hourly earnings.	13	1
201510	2062	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	And in March, we had an alternative- view Tealbook box in which Jeremy Nalewaik showed that these alternative measures do a pretty good job of predicting current-year growth of the wages and salaries component of compensation per hour.	13	1
201510	2063	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	We are also aware that the actual data on compensation per hour are often subject to large revisions of their initial estimates.	13	1
201510	2064	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	We have also seen the forecast, which I have mentioned several times today—and I apologize if I keep coming back to it—that the staff is predicting labor productivity growth, which includes the effect of capital deepening, will return to 1½ percent per annum next year.	13	1
201510	2065	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	And that would indicate some moving up of wages and perhaps some pressure on prices.	13	1
201510	2066	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	So I continue to expect that we will see inflation moving toward our target before too long.	13	1
201510	2067	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	I still believe we are meeting the criteria that the labor market continues to strengthen.	13	1
201510	2068	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Subject to discussions on how much it takes to keep it at the same level of strength as it is now, we will be able to see that in the data early next month and then early in December.	13	1
201510	2069	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	I do believe that we are going to see inflation rising toward 2 percent in the medium run, but we will come back to several of these issues tomorrow.	13	1
201510	2070	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	2071	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201510	2072	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	13	1
201510	2073	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	2074	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Economic conditions in the Fourth District are little changed since our last meeting.	13	1
201510	2075	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Business contacts expect economic growth to continue in a moderate pace in coming months.	13	1
201510	2076	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The auto sector and nonresidential and multifamily construction continue to show strong levels of activity.	13	1
201510	2077	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	There was a notable increase in activity in the retail sector, and residential construction remains steady.	13	1
201510	2078	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	That said, manufacturing and energy-related sectors continue to be soft spots, showing reduced activity over the past six weeks.	13	1
201510	2079	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Our diffusion index of business contacts reporting better versus worse conditions fell from plus 9 in September to minus 5 in October, a level consistent with stable economic conditions.	13	1
201510	2080	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The decline was driven by a sharp fall in a subindex for manufacturing, which was only partially offset by an increase in the subindex for the retail sector.	13	1
201510	2081	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Our manufacturing contacts cited the strong dollar, the slowdown in energy exploration, and weaker economic growth in emerging markets as factors leading to reduced activity.	13	1
201510	2082	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Retailers cited increased consumer confidence and reduced gasoline prices as contributing to stronger sales.	13	1
201510	2083	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Reports of stronger retail sales are consistent with the pickup in sales tax receipts in the state of Ohio.	13	1
201510	2084	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Conditions in District labor markets remain positive.	13	1
201510	2085	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Year-over-year payroll growth softened to 1 percent in September from 1.3 percent in August, but the pace of growth is higher than it was over the previous expansion.	13	1
201510	2086	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The District unemployment rate continued to decline in September to 4.7 percent, which is below the national rate of 5.1.	13	1
201510	2087	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Ohio’s unemployment rate ticked down to 4.5 percent.	13	1
201510	2088	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	This is below the Cleveland Federal Reserve staff’s 4.8 percent estimate of the state’s longer-run normal unemployment rate, which is based on a model of labor market flows.	13	1
201510	2089	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Reports of upward wage pressure were largely concentrated in specialized occupations like construction and IT.	13	1
201510	2090	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Construction contacts reported that the primary downside risk they face is a shortage of labor, not higher interest rates.	13	1
201510	2091	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Prices of finished goods and inputs were generally steady except for lower prices for products related to oil, such as steel and plastic.	13	1
201510	2092	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Turning to the national economy, last December the Committee shifted its forward guidance to emphasize the data dependence of its policy decisions.	13	1
201510	2093	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Forward guidance has gone through several formulations as the economy has emerged from the crisis and recession and as we’re moving toward more normal conditions.	13	1
201510	2094	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	With the end of the asset purchase program, data dependence signaled we were getting back to a more normal policy setting as well.	13	1
201510	2095	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	In my view, one of the unintended consequences of data dependence is that it has contributed to the natural inclination of market participants and others to focus on short-run developments in the economy rather than on the medium-run outlook, which is the more appropriate time horizon for monetary policy decisions.	13	1
201510	2096	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Similarly, I have some concerns that the public’s expectations about what constitutes a healthy economy are not necessarily in sync with reality.	13	1
201510	2097	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	I think our communications should play a role in helping the public interpret the monthly data releases.	13	1
201510	2098	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	We can put them into context and create a narrative that provides a proper gauge with which to evaluate economic developments.	13	1
201510	2099	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The incoming data since our last meeting have been mixed.	13	1
201510	2100	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Economic growth slowed in the third quarter, which is perhaps not unexpected after the second quarter’s strong 3.9 percent pace.	13	1
201510	2101	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The question is whether this slowdown is pointing to a loss of momentum that would change the medium-run outlook.	13	1
201510	2102	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	My current read on that question is similar to the Tealbook’s.	13	1
201510	2103	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	I haven’t changed my medium-run outlook.	13	1
201510	2104	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	After a temporary slowdown, I expect economic growth to pick back up to an above-trend pace in 2016.	13	1
201510	2105	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The consumer sector remains strong.	13	1
201510	2106	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Investment has strengthened, and labor markets continue to improve.	13	1
201510	2107	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The stronger dollar and slower economic growth abroad have restrained growth in manufacturing, and the decline in oil prices continues to weaken investment in the energy sector.	13	1
201510	2108	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	However, we’ve recently seen some stability in both the dollar and oil prices.	13	1
201510	2109	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The volatility seen in financial markets at the time of our last meeting, which largely reflected a reassessment of growth abroad, has largely died down.	13	1
201510	2110	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	These are welcome developments, but it’s important to acknowledge that slowing in the global economy does remain a downside risk to the forecast.	13	1
201510	2111	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The increase in nonfarm payrolls in September was 142,000, and the August increase was revised down to 136,000, which is slower than the average pace seen earlier this year.	13	1
201510	2112	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The unemployment rate held steady at 5.1 percent.	13	1
201510	2113	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	As we often say, it’s important not to read too much into one month’s employment report, in view of the month-to-month variation in these readings.	13	1
201510	2114	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	But even if these numbers do not get revised up, as they have in recent years, we need to put them in their context.	13	1
201510	2115	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	With the economy at or nearly at full employment, we should expect the pace of job growth and declines in the unemployment rate to slow.	13	1
201510	2116	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	How we characterize developments is going to be very important for setting reasonable expectations regarding progress in the labor market, which is an important part of the criteria we’ve set for liftoff.	13	1
201510	2117	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	In my view, labor markets continued to improve over the intermeeting period.	13	1
201510	2118	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	First, the pace of job growth we’ve seen over the past two months, though slower than what we saw earlier this year, is consistent with continued declines in unemployment.	13	1
201510	2119	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Across different models and assumptions about labor force participation, estimates suggest that monthly payroll growth in the 75,000 to 120,000 range is sufficient to put downward pressure on the unemployment rate.	13	1
201510	2120	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	So the September increase in payrolls is well above the range of steady-state growth.	13	1
201510	2121	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Last month we also saw declines in many of the broader estimates of underemployment, such as the long- term unemployment rate and the U-6 measure.	13	1
201510	2122	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Taken together, I think September’s employment report is consistent with further improvement in the labor market.	13	1
201510	2123	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	I say this even though the Board staff’s labor market condition index, which summarizes developments across a wide range of labor market statistics, was unchanged in September.	13	1
201510	2124	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	We’re lucky enough to have Bruce Fallick on the staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.	13	1
201510	2125	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Bruce is one of the authors of the research behind the LMCI.	13	1
201510	2126	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	One of the things he pointed out is that the index makes use of estimated statistical trends for each included data series.	13	1
201510	2127	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Since the Great Recession, the trends underlying the LMCI have been excessively cyclical, which means that the gaps have been insufficiently cyclical.	13	1
201510	2128	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The implied trend of private payroll growth used in constructing the LMCI has moved higher, and it’s now considerably higher than the private payroll growth that would be consistent with the 75,000 to 120,000 range for trend total payroll growth I just mentioned.	13	1
201510	2129	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	So the LMCI interpreted September’s private payroll gain of 118,000 as being well below trend, and this pulled down the index substantially.	13	1
201510	2130	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The LMCI is likely then underestimating the improvement in labor markets during the expansion, while it understated the deterioration of labor markets during the recession.	13	1
201510	2131	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	What this means is that if the LMCI is overestimating trend private payroll growth by even a small amount, which seems likely, then the index reading would have been above zero in September, consistent with the improvement we saw in a number of labor market indicators, including the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s labor market momentum index.	13	1
201510	2132	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Turning to inflation, incoming data are consistent with the inflation dynamics that the Committee has been expecting.	13	1
201510	2133	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	As oil prices and the value of the dollar have begun to stabilize, the downward pressure on inflation from earlier changes has started to abate.	13	1
201510	2134	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Headline inflation remains well below our 2 percent target, but recent readings on underlying inflation, including the core, trimmed mean, and median CPI measures, have moved up.	13	1
201510	2135	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s median CPI measure, rose to 2½ percent in September.	13	1
201510	2136	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	There’s considerable uncertainty around any inflation forecast, but analysis by Cleveland Reserve Bank staff and others suggests that core measures of inflation can improve forecasts of headline inflation, at least over some time horizons.	13	1
201510	2137	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	In some cases, the improvement is statistically significant.	13	1
201510	2138	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Thus, I find firming in the core measures to be a factor supporting the modal forecast that inflation will gradually move toward 2 percent over the medium run.	13	1
201510	2139	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The other important factor supporting the forecast is stable longer-term inflation expectations.	13	1
201510	2140	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The Tealbook’s analysis suggests we should be cautious in inferring much signal from inflation expectations from the recent downward movement in market-based measures of inflation compensation.	13	1
201510	2141	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The survey-based measures have been broadly stable.	13	1
201510	2142	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s measure of 10-year inflation expectations is higher than it was at the beginning of the year.	13	1
201510	2143	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	It did move down slightly in October, but that reflected a change in near-term inflation.	13	1
201510	2144	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The five-year, five-year-forward measure was essentially unchanged in October at a bit less than 2 percent.	13	1
201510	2145	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	With inflation expectations anchored, the effects on inflation of past declines in energy prices and dollar appreciation beginning to dissipate, and the economy expected to resume growing at an above-trend pace after a weak third quarter, I think we can be reasonably confident that inflation will move gradually back to our target over the next few years.	13	1
201510	2146	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	I do not want to imply that there are no risks associated with the forecast, or that there are no developments that would shake confidence in the outlook.	13	1
201510	2147	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	For example, a significant slowdown in consumer spending or in payroll growth would necessitate a reassessment.	13	1
201510	2148	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	But if economic developments continue along the lines we’ve seen in recent months, I would view them as indicating that the conditions we’ve set for liftoff have been met, and I think a prudent course of action would be to follow through in December.	13	1
201510	2149	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Thereafter, should either downside risks or upside risks actually manifest themselves, the Committee will be in a position to adjust the pace of further policy actions around a path that is already anticipated to be a gradual one.	13	1
201510	2150	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	I view this course as balancing the various risks, while maintaining the credibility of our earlier communications.	13	1
201510	2151	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Of course, we need to ensure that the communications coming out of this meeting give us the opportunity to implement this course, and we’ll talk about that tomorrow.	13	1
201510	2152	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	2153	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201510	2154	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	13	1
201510	2155	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	2156	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m going to start, as I did in the September meeting, with the outlook for the energy sector.	13	1
201510	2157	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	You may remember that we said in the last FOMC meeting that the daily global supply of oil exceeded demand by approximately 2 million barrels a day.	13	1
201510	2158	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	That has improved slightly since then; our best estimate is that it is now about 1.8 million barrels a day—mainly because of a reduction in drilling in the United States, which I’ll talk more about, and a slight firming of demand estimates for China.	13	1
201510	2159	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	In addition to this supply and demand, though, we estimate that the current OECD inventory of oil stands at about 3 billion barrels.	13	1
201510	2160	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	In our view, that is an excess inventory of approximately 300 million barrels.	13	1
201510	2161	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	For the oil market to get into some degree of overall balance, daily supply and demand first needs to get to some level of balance, and we still have a ways to go.	13	1
201510	2162	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Then there needs to be sufficient excess demand to begin to work off this high level of inventory.	13	1
201510	2163	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	In our view, we’re not likely to get to the first part of this process, the balance of daily supply and demand, until late 2016 or early 2017.	13	1
201510	2164	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	This helps explain why there has been so much volatility—which I’ll comment on in a moment—in the price of oil.	13	1
201510	2165	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	There are several factors we’re going to be closely watching.	13	1
201510	2166	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	One is, obviously, ongoing reductions in capital expenditures.	13	1
201510	2167	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Rig counts just since the September FOMC meeting have decreased 9 percent.	13	1
201510	2168	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	We will continue to closely watch expected demand from US consumers as well as expected demand from emerging market countries, particularly China.	13	1
201510	2169	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	We will be watching political and military events in the Middle East, which threaten disruption.	13	1
201510	2170	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	This is why Russia’s intervention in Syria several weeks ago appeared to have such an effect on oil prices, because it raised fears of disruption.	13	1
201510	2171	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Ironically, these temporary upward spikes in oil prices may, in fact, ultimately slow the process of getting into supply–demand balance because it might cause producers to pause or sell into the futures market instead of further reducing their capital expenditures.	13	1
201510	2172	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	We continue to believe that Iran and Libya will come back online, which we now believe will add approximately 3¾ million barrels per day to world oil production.	13	1
201510	2173	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	With all this said, this is still a process in which several possible endings could unfold, and we should expect that there will be significant swings up and down in the price of oil because participants are struggling to get a grip on the speed of this balancing process.	13	1
201510	2174	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	In the meantime, in the United States, at least, we expect to see more bankruptcies, restructurings, and mergers because, as we’ve said before, the pain of these reductions in supply is going to be felt at its worst in the United States because the United States, particularly in Texas and, to some extent, North Dakota—and, to some extent, in Canada as well—has the highest concentration of marginal production—that is, shale.	13	1
201510	2175	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	With all of that background, I’ll turn back to the 11th District.	13	1
201510	2176	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	This oil situation has continued to create negative spillovers, as we reported last time, in our District.	13	1
201510	2177	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	For starters, the new orders component of our manufacturing survey was negative 4.6 percent in September and negative 7.6 percent in October versus an August reading of negative 12.5 percent.	13	1
201510	2178	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Meanwhile, the service sector in Texas continues to grow and add jobs, with the health-care, leisure, and hospitality sectors driving much of the increase.	13	1
201510	2179	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Overall employment in the District has, to us, been surprisingly resilient given the diversified nature of the Texas economy to date.	13	1
201510	2180	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	In addition, we’ve had a significant expansion of the petrochemical industry in the Gulf Coast because of the low price of natural gas, which is a key input into petrochemicals.	13	1
201510	2181	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	So we’ve got a boom in that industry going on in Texas at the same time the oil industry itself is contracting.	13	1
201510	2182	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	We had, through July, an annualized rate of job growth in Texas of 1.4 percent.	13	1
201510	2183	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	That dropped to still-positive job growth in August and September of 0.7 percent.	13	1
201510	2184	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	We are expecting 0.8 percent growth for the remainder of the year.	13	1
201510	2185	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	And when all is said and done, our judgment is that job growth for 2015 in Texas will still be a positive 1.2 percent, compared with 3.6 percent growth in 2014.	13	1
201510	2186	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Despite weakened job growth this year, the unemployment rate in Texas has held basically steady around 4.1 or 4.2 percent for the past eight months.	13	1
201510	2187	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	This low rate of unemployment, by the way, is even lower in cities like Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio—that is, in cities not predominantly reliant on oil.	13	1
201510	2188	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	And this statewide rate matches the pre-recession cyclical low of 4.2 percent in 2007.	13	1
201510	2189	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	We continue to see labor shortages in construction trades, machinery, food manufacturing, nursing, truck driving, retail, and restaurants.	13	1
201510	2190	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	In terms of wage pressure, both the manufacturing and service-sector surveys suggest upward wage pressures since June, and the outlook for wage growth among respondents continues to be strongly positive for the next six months.	13	1
201510	2191	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	In terms of commercial real estate, we see, not surprisingly, higher vacancy rates in cities like Houston, but we continue to see strong commercial real estate in other cities, like Dallas–Fort Worth and San Antonio.	13	1
201510	2192	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Statewide, Texas home prices in the month of August rose 7.3 percent year over year.	13	1
201510	2193	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	And home inventories across the state remain tight, with two to four months of inventory in each of our major markets.	13	1
201510	2194	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	So this is still a challenge.	13	1
201510	2195	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	In terms of prices, though, the majority of our respondents in manufacturing reported price declines for the ninth consecutive month.	13	1
201510	2196	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	But in the service sector, our selling price index still went up 3 percent in September and 3½ percent in October.	13	1
201510	2197	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	So we have a number of crosscurrents in the District.	13	1
201510	2198	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	On the national economy, our views are not materially different than they were in September.	13	1
201510	2199	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	We still expect to see the unemployment rate reach its longer-run sustainable rate of 5 percent by the end of this year and to fall below that level thereafter.	13	1
201510	2200	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	The August reading for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas trimmed mean PCE inflation rate was 1.67 percent year over year.	13	1
201510	2201	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	If you take six months over six months, the rate was 1.97 percent, or almost 2 percent for the past six months.	13	1
201510	2202	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Our 2016 forecast for inflation is 1.8 percent, and we continue to expect inflation to reach our 2 percent objective by the end of 2017.	13	1
201510	2203	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Lastly, as we said before, we continue to believe economic events in non-US countries, particularly Japan, China, Turkey, and Brazil, have the potential to negatively affect the United States for an extended period of time.	13	1
201510	2204	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	In particular, we believe issues such as the level of debt to GDP in these countries; the need, particularly in China, to restructure state-owned enterprises; efforts, particularly in China, to shift from an economy driven by investments and net exports to one that is consumer oriented; severe demographic challenges in several countries, particularly China; and other secular challenges will create headwinds for US real GDP growth as well as inflation for an extended period of time.	13	1
201510	2205	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	The one thing that makes us feel somewhat better, though, is that, as Governor Powell mentioned, stock markets outside the United States, particularly in China, look, at least to us, like they have adjusted to a great degree to this new reality.	13	1
201510	2206	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	2207	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201510	2208	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13	1
201510	2209	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	2210	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	With the exception of the state of Colorado, the pace of economic activity in the 10th District has slowed compared with the nation.	13	1
201510	2211	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	While unemployment rates remain low in most District states, employment growth is flat or down over the past six months due to weakness in energy and agriculture, which appears to now be spilling over into other sectors.	13	1
201510	2212	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	In the energy sector, our District energy survey paints a picture of continued headwinds.	13	1
201510	2213	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	With the breakeven price of oil at around $60, District firms are not expecting a return to profitability for some time.	13	1
201510	2214	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	As a result, capital spending plans are being downgraded and firms continue to shed workers, though anecdotal evidence suggests that some displaced workers are finding jobs in sectors such as aerospace.	13	1
201510	2215	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Some District energy companies have faced credit downgrades, and one company recently filed for bankruptcy in an attempt to shed around $3 billion in debt from its balance sheet.	13	1
201510	2216	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Conditions in the District’s agriculture sector also remain soft.	13	1
201510	2217	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Cattle prices, which had been holding up, have declined, and prices for commodities such as wheat and corn remain low.	13	1
201510	2218	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Overall, weakening farm income has led to increased borrowing by farmers and less capital spending.	13	1
201510	2219	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, weak demand for exports has weighed on manufacturing activity, which, according to our District manufacturing survey, has declined for eight straight months.	13	1
201510	2220	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	These business contacts point to international conditions as a primary factor weighing on demand for their products.	13	1
201510	2221	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	For the national economy, I expect economic growth to average around 2 percent in the second half of 2015 before moving up to around 2¾ percent next year.	13	1
201510	2222	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	The drag due to the behavior of net exports is likely to continue to weigh on headline growth.	13	1
201510	2223	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Otherwise, growth in private domestic demand has been running at more than 3½ percent for more than a year, a pace that looks to have continued and possibly strengthened in the third quarter.	13	1
201510	2224	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Given demographic and productivity trends, I view this pace of domestic growth as quite robust.	13	1
201510	2225	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Consumer spending, of course, has been a driving factor.	13	1
201510	2226	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Notwithstanding the sluggishness of core retail sales in recent months, they increased at a solid pace in the third quarter.	13	1
201510	2227	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Vehicle sales and consumer confidence remain at high levels.	13	1
201510	2228	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	The momentum in consumer spending appears broad based, and growth in real PCE has steadily picked up over the past few years.	13	1
201510	2229	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	For example, the year-over-year growth in consumer spending was about 1.3 percent at the end of 2012.	13	1
201510	2230	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Now it’s running at 3.3 percent.	13	1
201510	2231	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	In contrast, net exports have weighed on the outlook, and I see them subtracting about ¾ percentage point from GDP growth this year, reflecting the stronger dollar and soft foreign economic growth.	13	1
201510	2232	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Because this forecast has taken developments in recent months in financial and international markets on board, I view the risk from abroad as currently balanced.	13	1
201510	2233	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Along these lines, domestic and foreign financial markets have largely stabilized since our previous meeting.	13	1
201510	2234	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	The recent deceleration of payroll employment growth bears watching in coming months, but we have seen such bumps before, most recently this March.	13	1
201510	2235	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	So it’s hard to judge whether this deceleration stems from the start of a more general slump in economic activity or slowing momentum in the pace of employment gains.	13	1
201510	2236	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Given the momentum we’ve experienced over the past two years, I do expect some moderation in the monthly pace of payroll growth over the next year to below 200,000 because of demographic factors and the fact that the economy is likely close to full employment.	13	1
201510	2237	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Even if the slower pace of the past two months continues in the next two employment reports, such a pace would continue to comfortably exceed the minimum growth necessary to continue reducing labor market slack.	13	1
201510	2238	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Of course, the slowing in employment growth would be more concerning if measures of unemployment were rising.	13	1
201510	2239	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	That said, initial claims are currently very low, at levels last reached in 1973, and the U-6 broad unemployment rate continues to make steady downward progress.	13	1
201510	2240	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	While most measures of labor market slack have shown significant improvement over the past two years and suggest that only a modest amount remains, some have pointed to lingering concerns that persistently low levels of nominal wage growth are indicative of higher levels of slack.	13	1
201510	2241	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Recent research by my staff aligns with the findings in the Board staff memo showing that current measures of wage growth are in line with readings from our main labor market indicators.	13	1
201510	2242	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Using the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s labor market index as a broad measure of labor market conditions, the analysis found that a model of real wage growth based on this index and labor productivity predicts real wage growth consistent with actual real nominal wage growth.	13	1
201510	2243	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	This leads me to believe that the current low level of real wage growth is related more to weak productivity growth and not necessarily to hidden slack.	13	1
201510	2244	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, turning to inflation, the foreign exchange value of the dollar and energy price movements have been primary factors affecting my outlook.	13	1
201510	2245	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	While core inflation remains somewhat low, it has been stable in 2015.	13	1
201510	2246	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	The 12-month change in the core PCE index has stayed at 1.3 percent since January, even amid further appreciation of the dollar and additional declines in energy prices.	13	1
201510	2247	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	This may suggest that diminishing slack has been compensating for downward pressure arising from these temporary factors.	13	1
201510	2248	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	If so, as the effects of these temporary factors fade, it would seem reasonable to expect that both headline and core inflation will begin to move toward our 2 percent goal.	13	1
201510	2249	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	13	1
201510	2250	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201510	2251	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13	1
201510	2252	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	2253	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	The positive reports I received this round were outnumbered by the more pessimistic comments.	13	1
201510	2254	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	On the plus side, automakers continue to be quite optimistic about their ability to sustain high sales rates into 2016.	13	1
201510	2255	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Of course, low auto loan rates have helped sustain the 17.2 million unit sales pace we’ve seen so far this year.	13	1
201510	2256	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	In addition, reports on bank lending in the Seventh District were quite strong.	13	1
201510	2257	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	That said, many of my contacts were somewhat more pessimistic than they were in September.	13	1
201510	2258	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	The gloom was most pronounced among manufacturers who have a large international business exposure.	13	1
201510	2259	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	They’ve been downbeat for a while, but things took a turn for the worse this round.	13	1
201510	2260	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Steelmakers were particularly dour, as they are looking at global excess capacity and prices that are down 30 percent or so from a year ago.	13	1
201510	2261	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	They see no market-based relief in sight and have filed legal challenges to help counter alleged dumping.	13	1
201510	2262	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Heavy- equipment manufacturers were nearly as pessimistic as steelmakers, as they continue to report weak demand and additional layoffs.	13	1
201510	2263	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	However, not all of the new concerns came from the international front.	13	1
201510	2264	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Our Beige Book survey showed sharp cutbacks in hiring and capital spending plans not just among manufacturers, but also by firms in the service sectors.	13	1
201510	2265	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Low crop prices are weighing on rural economies, and, notably, we heard a good deal of talk from our contacts in capital markets regarding tighter credit conditions in the United States.	13	1
201510	2266	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	These reports go beyond financing for the energy sector or commodity-dependent businesses.	13	1
201510	2267	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	We also heard of wider bond spreads for domestic health-care and technology firms, and even Ford noted that spreads had increased on their commercial paper.	13	1
201510	2268	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	In culling through these reports, it seems difficult to separate the contributions from the strong dollar, weak foreign growth emanating from China and other emerging market economies, and tighter domestic financial conditions.	13	1
201510	2269	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	But on top of these, there also seems to have been a noticeable pullback in risk appetite across a range of industries.	13	1
201510	2270	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I suppose an executive summary of this was my conversation with a Fortune 100 CEO who asked me if I was hearing anything positive, because virtually none of his business roundtable counterparts was optimistic.	13	1
201510	2271	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	The front page story in the Wall Street Journal on Monday captured this sentiment very well, too.	13	1
201510	2272	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	For today, I’m filing all of these concerns as important risks to monitor, but not yet as factors that we ought to build into a weaker baseline outlook.	13	1
201510	2273	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	So like the Tealbook, our forecast for economic activity hasn’t changed much from September.	13	1
201510	2274	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	For now, we too continue to see economic growth running moderately above trend over the next couple of years.	13	1
201510	2275	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	The incoming data have not raised my confidence that inflation is poised to return to target over the medium term.	13	1
201510	2276	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Our full suite of models still forecasts 2018 inflation in the 1¼ to 1¾ percent range.	13	1
201510	2277	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	The Tealbook box that I referred to on I(1) inflation in term structure models got me thinking:  One way or another, I suppose, all of our FOMC forecasts have inflation getting back to our 2 percent objective at some point in time.	13	1
201510	2278	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	The question is, how fast will we get there?	13	1
201510	2279	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	More specifically, do we have models that forecast quick convergence to 2 percent yet still match the degree of persistence observed in the actual inflation data?	13	1
201510	2280	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I’m skeptical that we do.	13	1
201510	2281	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	At the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, we have two structural models that are capable of generating persistence in the data if the data call for it, and these both see slow convergence of inflation back to our 2 percent objective.	13	1
201510	2282	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	One is our term structure model, which will forecast persistently low inflation whenever the stationary but highly persistent level factor from the yield curve data is low.	13	1
201510	2283	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	That is an important reason why today this model is predicting that inflation in 2018 will only be back up to about 1½ percent.	13	1
201510	2284	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	The other is the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago DSGE model.	13	1
201510	2285	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	It can generate slow convergence back to target because real rigidities mean certain shocks will have persistent disinflationary effects.	13	1
201510	2286	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	The model identifies that such shocks have been important in explaining the low economic growth and low inflation of the past several years.	13	1
201510	2287	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	As a result, our DSGE model is also projecting inflation at just 1½ percent in 2018.	13	1
201510	2288	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I recognize that there are many different models of inflation, that prescient inflation forecasting is difficult to come by, and that our uncertainty measures are pretty large in this arena.	13	1
201510	2289	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Many statistical models have stationarity and rapid mean reversion to 2 percent inflation essentially baked in the cake, but these models also fail to match the persistence actually observed in the inflation data.	13	1
201510	2290	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	In contrast, models with unit-root I(1) inflation processes or stochastic volatility or both can generate much more persistent deviations from 2 percent, as can models with strong real rigidities and persistent stationary factors, such as our Chicago Fed DSGE and term structure models.	13	1
201510	2291	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I put more weight on these latter models.	13	1
201510	2292	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	So my bottom line is that I have difficulty feeling confident that inflation is headed back to 2 percent any time soon.	13	1
201510	2293	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Also, I have to believe an important ingredient in the President Lacker/President Bullard/Benhabib/Schmitt-Grohe/Uribe low inflation equilibrium is that the public is expecting inflation to be below our 2 percent objective.	13	1
201510	2294	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	So, again, I think that committing in public that we are focused on getting inflation symmetrically up to 2 percent is an important feature of knocking out that low equilibrium.	13	1
201510	2295	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	One other thing that occurred to me in looking around the table as President Bullard was making his comments is that I’m not sure how many people understand that model analysis.	13	1
201510	2296	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Frankly, when I hear comments in my Bank that I don’t understand and that I think might be bad, I try to make sure everybody tries to figure it out or I get some advice.	13	1
201510	2297	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I think that it is probably incumbent on us to have somebody, perhaps from the Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond and St Louis, put together a briefing memo so we all understand this important feature, if it is important.	13	1
201510	2298	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	2299	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201510	2300	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13	1
201510	2301	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	2302	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I suggest that President Evans come to Tomorrowland in the 12th District and meet with my directors, because you mostly were seeing the people who were pessimistic, and as one of my advisory council members said, “In La-La Land, no one is pessimistic.”	13	1
201510	2303	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13	1
201510	2304	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	At the previous meeting, I argued that the economy was finally in good enough shape to begin monetary policy normalization, and since then the data received have only reinforced that view.	13	1
201510	2305	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Importantly, the key global economic and financial concerns that stayed our hand in September have receded.	13	1
201510	2306	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Financial market volatility has moderated as data from China and other emerging markets have come in at or above expectations, and fears of a hard landing have diminished.	13	1
201510	2307	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	As noted in the QS report, the US financial system weathered this global turbulence without any systemic strains, and, furthermore, US equity markets have retraced more than half of their late summer selloff.	13	1
201510	2308	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Altogether, these intermeeting improvements resulted in more favorable readings in a variety of broad indexes of financial conditions.	13	1
201510	2309	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	On balance, US macroeconomic data since our previous meeting have also been in line with my expectations.	13	1
201510	2310	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	The monthly data on the crucial drivers of final demand, such as consumer spending and business investment, have continued to show solid gains.	13	1
201510	2311	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Despite these gains, third-quarter real GDP growth will likely be held down by the inventory correction.	13	1
201510	2312	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Still, real GDP remains on track to grow at 2 percent this year, and that’s the same average pace of growth we’ve seen over the past five years, which was fast enough to bring the unemployment rate down from 10 percent to close to 5 percent.	13	1
201510	2313	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I view the risks to the solid economic growth forecast as well balanced.	13	1
201510	2314	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	As I’ve already mentioned, the downside tail risks from abroad have diminished in two ways.	13	1
201510	2315	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	First, the probability of an adverse fallout and contagion among emerging markets has come down.	13	1
201510	2316	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Second, some systemic resilience to such shocks has been demonstrated for the next episode of volatility.	13	1
201510	2317	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	On the upside, domestic growth could certainly surpass my expectations.	13	1
201510	2318	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	For example, residential construction continues to perk up.	13	1
201510	2319	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Both homebuilder sentiment and household formation have jumped to new highs for this expansion, and that should support increased building.	13	1
201510	2320	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Turning to the labor data, the recent jobs report did not change my view that the unemployment rate will fall to 4.7 percent by the middle of next year.	13	1
201510	2321	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Under current labor force and population dynamics, any monthly job growth above 100,000 will tend to reduce labor market slack.	13	1
201510	2322	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, employment grew by less than 140,000 jobs per month on average in August and September, and that pace was enough to lower U-3, U-4, and U-5 by 0.2 percentage point each and U-6 by 0.4 percentage point, continuing their ongoing downward trends.	13	1
201510	2323	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Given the strength of the economy and the lagged effects of any near-term policy tightening, I’m confident that the economy will overshoot full employment next year.	13	1
201510	2324	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Unfortunately, I have become much more pessimistic that such overshooting will boost labor force participation.	13	1
201510	2325	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	My staff has reexamined the prospects for a cyclical resurgence in participation, and the data are not showing the rebound that was hoped for.	13	1
201510	2326	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	In particular, it is disappointing how few have entered the labor force during this recovery despite the substantial increase in employment.	13	1
201510	2327	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	For example, consider the “marginally attached.”	13	1
201510	2328	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	These are nonparticipants who report that they’re willing and available to work, who have searched for work within the past year, but who aren’t currently looking for a job.	13	1
201510	2329	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	This marginally attached group contains the candidates most likely to reenter the labor market.	13	1
201510	2330	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, as the unemployment rate dropped over the past five years, the reentry rates for the marginally attached have actually come down.	13	1
201510	2331	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	A similar pattern emerges for other groups of nonparticipants.	13	1
201510	2332	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	These results are consistent with evidence recently highlighted by Alan Krueger that labor force entry rates are not cyclical.	13	1
201510	2333	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	All in all, this suggests that overshooting full employment by running a high-pressure economy will not bring a large number of those out of the labor force back into it at a faster pace.	13	1
201510	2334	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	It also suggests that nonparticipants are not really an indicator of a significant degree of more slack.	13	1
201510	2335	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I would like to make one point on that.	13	1
201510	2336	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I find the Board staff’s calculation of the potential worker rate to be very useful.	13	1
201510	2337	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	It appears, I think, in the Monday morning Board briefing.	13	1
201510	2338	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Basically, it’s the unemployed plus the nonparticipants who say they want a job, which is a pretty broad definition of unemployed.	13	1
201510	2339	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s broader than U-5, so you could think of it as “U-5 extended,” or “U-5 plus.”	13	1
201510	2340	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	That rate has come down significantly—more than 1 percentage point in the past 12 months.	13	1
201510	2341	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	And if you look at its current level of about 8.5 percent, that kind of number has historically been associated with an unemployment rate of 5.3 or 5.4 percent.	13	1
201510	2342	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	That is higher than the current 5.1 percent, but it suggests that, at least on this broadest definition of underemployment, the unemployment rate is only understating the degree of slack by about 0.3 percentage point.	13	1
201510	2343	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	If you narrow it down to U-5, the difference is only about 0.1 percentage point.	13	1
201510	2344	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	So at least based on measures of people who actually say they want a job, there really isn’t a lot more slack out there.	13	1
201510	2345	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	There’s somewhat more slack, but not a lot more slack than the U-3 measure.	13	1
201510	2346	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Turning to price inflation, I expect that overshooting full employment next year will offset some of the transitory disinflationary pressures associated with the pass-through of lower import and energy prices into core prices.	13	1
201510	2347	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	This, along with the waning effects of these price shocks, will help speed a return to our 2 percent target.	13	1
201510	2348	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Still, I expect inflation to remain below our target for some time.	13	1
201510	2349	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	The natural question is, is the fact that inflation remains low an indication that the economy remains well below capacity—meaning there is actually more slack out there?	13	1
201510	2350	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Analysis by my staff suggests caution on this front.	13	1
201510	2351	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Core PCE inflation has been pushed down by a decline in health services inflation driven by public payment adjustments, including limits on Medicare payment growth associated with the Affordable Care Act and the “doc fix” bill.	13	1
201510	2352	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	These public payment adjustments are especially important because private payments tend to follow Medicare’s lead.	13	1
201510	2353	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, the PCE price index that we follow is actually based on these PPI measures of how much the government and other payers pay hospitals, doctors, and other providers.	13	1
201510	2354	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Because the PCE price index places a relatively large weight on health-care prices, the unusually weak health-care inflation may obscure evidence of a cyclical rebound in underlying inflation.	13	1
201510	2355	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Therefore, the low rate of core PCE inflation cannot be taken fully onboard as an indication that there’s still substantial slack in the economy.	13	1
201510	2356	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	All in all, these findings make a good case for looking to other inflation indicators, such as the Dallas Fed trimmed mean.	13	1
201510	2357	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	The trimmed mean is currently particularly attractive because it removes some of the legislative and administrative price changes in the health-care sector.	13	1
201510	2358	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	All told, while inflation remains low, this is the result of a confluence of transitory and special factors.	13	1
201510	2359	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s not indicative of the performance of the broad economy, which remains solid.	13	1
201510	2360	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	As slack continues to diminish and the influences of the strong dollar, low energy prices, and the effects of these legislative changes to health-care prices fade, I’m confident that inflation will move back to our 2 percent target.	13	1
201510	2361	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13	1
201510	2362	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201510	2363	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13	1
201510	2364	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	2365	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Economic data since September have been mixed, but on balance they suggest little difference in my assessment from when we last met.	13	1
201510	2366	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Although some of the heightened risk aversion that led to declines in the prices of risky assets over the summer has faded, the key risk associated with the outlook—the potential for weak foreign demand to weigh even more heavily on economic growth and inflation in the United States—is not materially different.	13	1
201510	2367	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Turning first to the labor market, measures of labor utilization suggest that there has been little change in labor market slack since September.	13	1
201510	2368	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The unemployment rate was unchanged last month while other indicators of slack were mixed:  The drop in the participation rate suggested no reduction in slack, and the decline in the share of involuntary part-time workers pointed to some further lessening.	13	1
201510	2369	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Both of these alternative measures, together with no sign of a pickup in wage growth, continue to suggest there may be labor slack remaining.	13	1
201510	2370	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	At the same time, the pace of job gains appears to have slowed somewhat in recent months.	13	1
201510	2371	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonfarm payroll employment increased 142,000 in September, little different from the currently published figure for August.	13	1
201510	2372	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, the average monthly change in the third quarter is somewhat below the pace of job gains in the first half of the year.	13	1
201510	2373	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The slowing in employment growth looks to coincide with a similar slowing in output growth.	13	1
201510	2374	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	After rising at a 2½ percent rate over the first half of the year, real GDP growth appears to have downshifted to a pace below 2 percent in the third quarter.	13	1
201510	2375	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	However, a decline in inventory investment, a factor that boosted activity in the first half, likely accounts for that reduction in GDP growth.	13	1
201510	2376	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Abstracting from this component of aggregate demand, which is characteristically volatile, final sales increased at close to a 2 percent pace in the first half of the year, and I’d expect a similar increase in the second half.	13	1
201510	2377	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I’m encouraged that consumer spending appears to have increased at more than a 3 percent pace in the middle two quarters of the year, with auto sales rising strongly.	13	1
201510	2378	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Business fixed investment also looks to have moved higher over this period despite considerable drag generated by sharp declines in energy-related investment.	13	1
201510	2379	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The housing sector also continues to expand, though the pace is very gradual and activity remains well below what population growth would suggest.	13	1
201510	2380	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	And recent developments on Capitol Hill hold out hope that the debt limit, a key source of uncertainty, may be addressed in a broader deal that could lead to federal government spending that is slightly higher than what was earlier projected.	13	1
201510	2381	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	However, recent trade data, which will get updated tomorrow, suggest that net exports, after subtracting close to 1 percentage point from GDP growth in the first half of the year, held down growth again last quarter.	13	1
201510	2382	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Turning to inflation, measures of underlying inflation trends remain below our 2 percent target.	13	1
201510	2383	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The 12-month change in core PCE is estimated to have been 1.4 percent in September, while the 3-month change is estimated to have been about 1.5 percent, little different from the average pace of increase over the recovery.	13	1
201510	2384	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	On balance, these data suggest an underlying trend in inflation that is between 1¼ and perhaps 1¾ percent.	13	1
201510	2385	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Progress toward our goals will be heavily affected by the competing influences of relatively robust private demand in the United States, on the one hand, and weak foreign economic growth on the other.	13	1
201510	2386	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Despite extraordinary monetary stimulus in Japan and the euro area, growth remains very weak.	13	1
201510	2387	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Real GDP in Japan appears to be increasing at a rate barely above zero, while growth in the euro area is increasing at a relatively modest rate of between 1½ and 2 percent.	13	1
201510	2388	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Over much of the recovery, weakness in advanced economies has been offset by strong economic growth in emerging market economies, but this has changed.	13	1
201510	2389	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Trade- weighted real GDP growth in emerging market economies has slipped from an annual average of 4½ percent from 2009 to 2013 to 1 percent less than that last year and to an annual rate of only 2 percent in the first half of this year.	13	1
201510	2390	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, total foreign economic growth was 1½ percent in the first half of the year, the lowest two-quarter growth rate since the recession.	13	1
201510	2391	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Weak foreign demand pushes down the contribution to real GDP growth from net exports both directly and indirectly by putting upward pressure on the dollar.	13	1
201510	2392	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, concerns about the foreign outlook have at times led to a pullback by investors from risky assets and heightened worries of deflationary pressures.	13	1
201510	2393	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	A worsening global outlook has likely been responsible for much of the deceleration in employment and overall activity in the United States this year.	13	1
201510	2394	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Whether this downward pressure eases or intensifies is an open question.	13	1
201510	2395	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The most recent news regarding emerging markets, particularly China, has been mixed.	13	1
201510	2396	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	One the one hand, real GDP in China is reported to have risen at an annual rate of more than 7 percent in the third quarter, consistent with an overall slowing trend but a considerably better outcome than some had feared.	13	1
201510	2397	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, estimates of employment have held up well, and services-sector output looks to have accelerated.	13	1
201510	2398	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	On the other hand, growth in industrial production remained depressed in September.	13	1
201510	2399	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	If this reflects a structural shift that persists, it suggests that downward pressures on commodity prices and commodity exporters are unlikely to ease measurably going forward.	13	1
201510	2400	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Chinese policymakers are currently pursuing several competing goals—transitioning to a more services- and consumer-oriented economy, pushing through difficult financial and economic reforms, and preventing a significant undershooting of economic growth—making their task tremendously complicated.	13	1
201510	2401	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Those complications are enhanced by the poor quality of their macroeconomic data and challenges in the communication of their policies.	13	1
201510	2402	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	That poses risks both to the upside and the downside.	13	1
201510	2403	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	It is possible that Chinese policymakers, in an attempt to minimize economic underperformance and the attendant political risks, will institute a full-scale fiscal stimulus, which would boost economic growth, with positive ramifications globally.	13	1
201510	2404	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Under this scenario, the US economy might move somewhat more rapidly toward our goals than is currently expected.	13	1
201510	2405	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	However, the most common method for Chinese policymakers to expand is to channel funds into local governments.	13	1
201510	2406	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	These policies have led to large amounts of wasteful investment and huge increases in leverage, and they could work against the longer-term structural reform agenda that the policymakers have laid out.	13	1
201510	2407	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, we may see continued hesitation to reemploy this method of stimulus.	13	1
201510	2408	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	In that case, slower economic growth would continue to pose risks to the downside, as financial stress would increase and confidence might erode.	13	1
201510	2409	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s possible, in that scenario, that slowing in global growth continues or intensifies and that upward pressures on the dollar increase, weighing further on our economic growth and inflation.	13	1
201510	2410	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	2411	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201510	2412	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13	1
201510	2413	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	2414	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	My views on the economy haven’t changed much since the September meeting.	13	1
201510	2415	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The good news is that domestic final sales still seem to be rising relatively briskly, and the rise appears to be broad based.	13	1
201510	2416	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Consumption, housing, and business fixed investment all seem to be growing at a respectable pace.	13	1
201510	2417	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The bad news, though, is that the economy may be downshifting to a somewhat slower overall growth pace.	13	1
201510	2418	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	As many people have mentioned, inventory drag is going to be a big factor in the weakness we see in the third quarter, and net trade is not only going to be a drag in the third quarter, it’s going to be a drag for many quarters to come.	13	1
201510	2419	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The improvement in labor market conditions, at least measured by the Board’s broad- based measures, stalled out in September, but it’s unclear to me whether this is a one-time blip or the start of a new phase in which payroll gains slow and the improvement in the labor market grinds to a halt.	13	1
201510	2420	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me that labor market developments over the next two months are going to be very important in assessing whether the timing is right for liftoff in December.	13	1
201510	2421	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The key question for me is, will the slowdown in economic growth that I think we’re seeing lead to lower payroll gains, and will those lower payroll gains, in turn, lead to weaker consumption growth?	13	1
201510	2422	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	A number of people have postulated that consumption will stay strong regardless, but if you have a weaker economy leading to lower payroll gains, there’ll be less income, and I start to worry about how that dynamic will play out.	13	1
201510	2423	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the downside risks to the outlook arising from overseas developments have subsided.	13	1
201510	2424	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	It is noteworthy that we actually do see real GDP growth abroad finally accelerating in the third quarter, compared with the second quarter.	13	1
201510	2425	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	And although the level of market stress increased very sharply late this summer, I think it is quite significant that even though we really ratcheted up the degree of stress, nothing of significance seems to have broken in response to that stress.	13	1
201510	2426	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	This is important because the way that a situation like this gets out of hand, as we saw in 2008 and 2009, is that stress causes things to break, which creates more stress, and events start to unfold in a very bad way.	13	1
201510	2427	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the fact that equity prices in emerging markets have rebounded quite significantly in recent weeks is also significant.	13	1
201510	2428	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The big question I have with respect to that is, how much of that improvement is due to the fact that nothing is broken, which some people are taking some comfort from, and how much is due to the fact that there’s been a shift in expectations about our own policy rate path?	13	1
201510	2429	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	And, at this point, I just don’t know the answer to that.	13	1
201510	2430	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Nevertheless, it is a positive development.	13	1
201510	2431	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	On the inflation side, I think the news has been relatively constructive in the sense that the core rate of inflation has been broadly stable despite the downward impetus to commodity prices due to the behavior of the US dollar.	13	1
201510	2432	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Although we haven’t seen any meaningful uptick in nominal wage growth, I think the anecdotal reports are generally consistent with emerging pressures.	13	1
201510	2433	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, you hear the story about the truck drivers almost everywhere at this point.	13	1
201510	2434	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	But we need to be careful about the inference that we take away from the fact that nominal wage growth has not picked up.	13	1
201510	2435	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I found the staff memo on compensation and labor market slack very helpful in terms of my own thinking.	13	1
201510	2436	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	And I agree that it’s certainly possible that the wage gains have been restrained because headline inflation has fallen and productivity growth has faltered, and that those two factors may be offsetting the effect of a labor market that is, in fact, closing in on full employment.	13	1
201510	2437	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	What I take away from that is, one, I’m pretty uncertain, and, two, as a consequence I wouldn’t be comfortable making a pickup in wages a necessary condition for liftoff.	13	1
201510	2438	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The pressure may already be there, but we’re just not seeing it in the aggregate data because the upward pressure has been offset by these other factors that are restraining nominal wage growth.	13	1
201510	2439	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The fly in the ointment on the inflation side, which people haven’t really commented on very much, is the persistent decline in inflation compensation.	13	1
201510	2440	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I understand why inflation compensation is coming down over the near term because of the weakness in oil prices and other commodity prices, but the persistent declines in the five-year, five-year-forward measures are more difficult to explain and, therefore, more troubling.	13	1
201510	2441	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Although I don’t have any reason to dispute the model results—that this is mostly about the liquidity risk premium and what people are willing to pay for inflation protection—I do have some anxiety that we’re putting a lot of weight on particular models to disentangle the sources of the decline in inflation compensation.	13	1
201510	2442	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The fact that some of the models are constructed in such a way that they beg the conclusion and push that weight onto liquidity risk and the price of inflation protection makes me a bit more concerned.	13	1
201510	2443	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	So I wouldn’t want to dismiss the decline in five-year, five-year-forward inflation compensation altogether.	13	1
201510	2444	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think what I need to see is economic data that make me comfortable that the economy is likely to continue to grow at an above-trend pace in 2016, that core inflation is flat or rising, and that inflation expectations are well anchored.	13	1
201510	2445	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If I see that, I think we can definitely justify liftoff and probably justify a liftoff at the next meeting.	13	1
201510	2446	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I do think, though, that we need to talk about alternatives to that scenario, and I’m going to talk tomorrow a little bit about what should happen if the economy should fall meaningfully short of the baseline forecast.	13	1
201510	2447	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I do think we need a Plan B for monetary policy in case the economy disappoints, because if we don’t lift off in December, the next question for the Chair is going to be, what happens if the economy continues to weaken, and what are you actually prepared to do about it?	13	1
201510	2448	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	And I really don’t think we’ve had that conversation around the Committee table yet to a sufficient degree.	13	1
201510	2449	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this is very important, and I very much welcome your thoughts on that tomorrow.	13	1
201510	2450	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m going to go at the very end, as I always do, but if you have anything to say earlier, I’d love to hear what you think we should do if the economy disappoints and we don’t lift off in December, because I think we need to have an answer.	13	1
201510	2451	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Narayana, maybe you’ll have a few thoughts on that.	13	1
201510	2452	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	2453	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let me turn it over to you, President Kocherlakota.	13	1
201510	2454	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201510	2455	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I guess it’s a first for me to go last in this round.	13	1
201510	2456	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	It’s the first and last for you.	13	1
201510	2457	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	13	1
201510	2458	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	13	1
201510	2459	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It gives me the opportunity to comment on other peoples’ thinking at this point.	13	1
201510	2460	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But, no, I will stick to my prepared remarks.	13	1
201510	2461	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	13	1
201510	2462	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Madam Chair, the recent reports from our directors in the Ninth District and other contacts in the intermeeting period were somewhat mixed.	13	1
201510	2463	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think one of our directors summed it up best by saying that her contacts saw patches of growth coexisting with patches of decline.	13	1
201510	2464	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s a little bit more nuanced, or at least not as strong as what we had been hearing in the past from our contacts in the Ninth District.	13	1
201510	2465	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Our recent data are pretty much consistent with that.	13	1
201510	2466	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It suggests that even outside the oil patch in North Dakota, the labor market in the Ninth District is showing signs of stagnation, if not actual deterioration.	13	1
201510	2467	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In North Dakota, obviously, the situation is much worse than that, but that’s pretty much what you would expect given the challenges facing the oil industry that President Kaplan outlined.	13	1
201510	2468	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Just to level-set everyone, Minnesota is a very diversified economy that is not reliant on oil, agriculture, or anything like that.	13	1
201510	2469	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The employment-to-population ratio in Minnesota has fallen over the past year.	13	1
201510	2470	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Since April, payroll employment in Minnesota has been essentially flat.	13	1
201510	2471	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Over that time we have seen declines of 1 percent or more in employment in construction, manufacturing, and mining.	13	1
201510	2472	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Mining is not as surprising because of some external demand issues.	13	1
201510	2473	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Manufacturing may also not be a surprise, but it’s quite disturbing to me that we have seen a decline of such magnitude in construction.	13	1
201510	2474	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In short, I think that you have to say the Ninth District’s economic recovery is flagging, including in sectors that you would generally view as sensitive to policy-related changes in the value of the dollar and the expected real interest rates.	13	1
201510	2475	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me turn now to the national economy.	13	1
201510	2476	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I will speak first about inflation and then turn to employment.	13	1
201510	2477	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And, just to satisfy the Vice Chairman’s demand for it, I will talk about inflation compensation.	13	1
201510	2478	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of inflation, the story is a familiar one.	13	1
201510	2479	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Inflation is well below target.	13	1
201510	2480	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Tealbook A projects that inflation will get back to target in 2019, four years from now.	13	1
201510	2481	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One comment I will make is that I think it would be useful to have more conversations about why some principals don’t agree with Tealbook A’s forecast for inflation.	13	1
201510	2482	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Someone specifically mentioned they expect inflation to get back to target more rapidly.	13	1
201510	2483	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What are the elements of your modeling that lead you to have that confidence?	13	1
201510	2484	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Frankly, for myself, I think the staff’s analysis of inflation is a compelling one.	13	1
201510	2485	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But there is a leap of faith about underlying inflation or inflation expectations: Longer-run inflation expectations, or whatever you want to call them, are at 1.8 percent, then something happens and they get pulled back up to 2 percent.	13	1
201510	2486	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	While that’s good for us, it’s a very optimistic piece of the outlook.	13	1
201510	2487	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But it could make you want to think that inflation might not get back to target in 2019.	13	1
201510	2488	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So following up on some of President Evans’s comments about whether you are just assuming it or whether it is driven by something more fundamental, I think a conversation on this would be interesting and useful.	13	1
201510	2489	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My outlook under Tealbook A’s baseline policy assumption is the same: We will get back to target in 2019.	13	1
201510	2490	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, the FOMC could facilitate a faster return of inflation to target by adopting a more accommodative policy stance than in Tealbook A.	13	1
201510	2491	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The question is, what would be the cost of having that more accommodative stance?	13	1
201510	2492	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The main cost identified in the optimal control exercise in Tealbook B is that the unemployment rate would fall below the rate that we currently think is the natural rate.	13	1
201510	2493	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I have two comments about the supposed cost of having supposedly unduly low unemployment.	13	1
201510	2494	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The first is that I take our congressional mandate to promote maximum employment literally.	13	1
201510	2495	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we can create more jobs without causing excessive inflation, the Congress requires us to do that, and that’s what promoting maximum employment means to me.	13	1
201510	2496	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The second comment is on the economics of the situation: I remain considerably more optimistic than most of you about our ability to create jobs without creating inflation.	13	1
201510	2497	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Some of that optimism is due to the inflation picture that I described earlier, but a lot of it is tied to data on household employment.	13	1
201510	2498	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Here I am going to be giving, I suppose, a countervailing story with regard to what President Williams described.	13	1
201510	2499	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Household employment fell dramatically during the recession.	13	1
201510	2500	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Recovery from that decline, even for prime-age workers, remains highly incomplete.	13	1
201510	2501	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The fraction of those aged 25 to 54 who have a job remains 3 percentage points below its pre-recession peak in early 2007.	13	1
201510	2502	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we split this group more finely by age, the story remains the same:  If you look at those aged 25 to 34, 34 to 45, and 45 to 54, EPOP is down 3 percentage points.	13	1
201510	2503	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If you split it by sex, EPOP for men aged 25 to 54 is down by 3½ percentage points; for women in that age group, it is down by only 2½ percentage points.	13	1
201510	2504	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You can split it by race: Among African Americans aged 25 to 54, EPOP is down by 3 percentage points compared with 2007.	13	1
201510	2505	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The bottom line is, however you want to slice the data, prime-age employment is about 3 percentage points lower than in 2007.	13	1
201510	2506	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Given what we know about labor supply elasticities for prime-age workers, it seems very challenging to rationalize this large decline as being due to structural changes in the labor markets.	13	1
201510	2507	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So we have some room for inflation, and this strong decline in prime-age employment that suggests that we have more room to work on that front as well.	13	1
201510	2508	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me turn, then, to inflation expectations.	13	1
201510	2509	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I have already noted, inflation has been low for years, is currently low, and is expected to remain low for years to come.	13	1
201510	2510	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Prime-age employment has been low for years, is currently low, and is expected to remain low for years to come.	13	1
201510	2511	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	To achieve our goals more rapidly, it would seem like we should be providing more accommodation.	13	1
201510	2512	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But the tilt of policy is very much toward a continuation of the gradual tightening cycle that the Committee began in May 2013, as opposed to providing an increase in accommodation, as seems appropriate given where we are.	13	1
201510	2513	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So there is a disconnect between our policy direction and our policy goals, and I think this disconnect creates a significant credibility risk.	13	1
201510	2514	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The public and the markets may come to believe that we will not achieve our stated longer-term objectives.	13	1
201510	2515	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I don’t think of this credibility risk as being a theoretical one.	13	1
201510	2516	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As alternative A correctly states, the Federal Reserve’s measure of five-year, five-year-forward inflation breakevens is near or at historical lows.	13	1
201510	2517	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Alternative B is more cagey about this point, simply saying that it has slipped a little bit.	13	1
201510	2518	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I would counsel the Committee to be more transparent about that in the statement.	13	1
201510	2519	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Then if you choose to ignore that information, that’s fine.	13	1
201510	2520	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I think the facts of the matter are that inflation breakevens are near or at historical lows.	13	1
201510	2521	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Low breakevens are often dismissed as being due to a decline in liquidity premiums, risk premiums, or inflation expectations.	13	1
201510	2522	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of liquidity premiums, we see the same low measures of longer-term inflation expectations in zero-coupon inflation swaps.	13	1
201510	2523	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And this was not always true.	13	1
201510	2524	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If you go back to the end of 2008, zero-coupon inflation swaps did not fall anywhere near as much as inflation breakevens or TIPS did.	13	1
201510	2525	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I would say that there is little evidence that liquidity premiums are the key driver of the low breakevens in 2015.	13	1
201510	2526	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of risk premiums, I thought the Tealbook box was very interesting in terms of how you might try to decompose between risk premiums and expectations and how complicated that is.	13	1
201510	2527	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But, as I have argued before, our point of view in Minneapolis is that you should think about risk premiums as being highly informative from an economic point of view.	13	1
201510	2528	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Investors are increasingly betting that inflation will be unduly low at exactly the same time that economic activity is low.	13	1
201510	2529	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Put another way, investors are increasingly betting that the FOMC will be willing to miss both of its mandates at the same time, in the same direction, over the longer term.	13	1
201510	2530	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	These bets aren’t crazy.	13	1
201510	2531	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	They seem entirely reasonable given the persistent disconnect between our actions and our putative objectives.	13	1
201510	2532	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I somewhat share President Bullard’s concerns that the markets, at least, are putting more weight on our being in a low-inflation, low-economic-activity outcome.	13	1
201510	2533	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Where I disagree with him is that I don’t think it is because we have committed to a low interest rate policy.	13	1
201510	2534	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In fact, the decline in inflation expectations that you see in market-based measures really set in in early 2013.	13	1
201510	2535	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That is associated with the Committee beginning its gradual tightening cycle, not with committing to low interest rates.	13	1
201510	2536	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Madam Chair, I will summarize briefly.	13	1
201510	2537	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Inflation is low and is expected to remain low for years.	13	1
201510	2538	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Prime-age employment is low and is expected to remain low for years.	13	1
201510	2539	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And yet the tightening cycle and talk about it continues, and that creates a troubling belief in markets that we may be willing to fail in both our mandates for years to come.	13	1
201510	2540	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I will build on this theme in our discussion of policy tomorrow when, ironically enough, I get to lead off.	13	1
201510	2541	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	13	1
201510	2542	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But thank you for listening.	13	1
201510	2543	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13	1
201510	2544	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is President Kocherlakota’s last meeting, and I know he would be very disappointed if I didn’t contradict him contradicting me.	13	1
201510	2545	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13	1
201510	2546	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do think we know more about why labor force participation for prime-age men and women is low.	13	1
201510	2547	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	If you compare the shift by age of those outside the labor force between1999 with 2014, and look at the answers to the question of why they are outside the labor force, there has been a significant increase in the number of people who designate themselves as disabled or retired, people who are taking care of family, and people in school.	13	1
201510	2548	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	There are a lot of reasons for these “deltas” in relation to 1999.	13	1
201510	2549	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	If you look at the groups that want a job but are not in the labor force and ask why they aren’t in the labor force, those are higher.	13	1
201510	2550	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, again, this is the reason the staff looked at this very carefully.	13	1
201510	2551	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s not a very big group, and it has changed very little.	13	1
201510	2552	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	The other group that is not explained is not part of this group at all.	13	1
201510	2553	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the survey responses, the answer to the question “why are fewer prime-age people in the labor force relative to 1999, which was a very strong economy?” is basically that the number of those disabled and retired has increased.	13	1
201510	2554	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I suppose the question I have is, can monetary policy change that?	13	1
201510	2555	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Madam Chair, may I answer President Williams’s question?	13	1
201510	2556	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	13	1
201510	2557	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The answer is “yes,”	13	1
201510	2558	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	President Williams.	13	1
201510	2559	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13	1
201510	2560	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I feel better.	13	1
201510	2561	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13	1
201510	2562	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll say a couple of things by way of response.	13	1
201510	2563	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think this information is very valuable, first of all, and I think it’s important to keep in mind.	13	1
201510	2564	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	With that said, when you look into the flows, as your staff does so ably, you do see that people who have no interest in getting a job do transit to a job all the time.	13	1
201510	2565	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I think that’s important to keep in mind.	13	1
201510	2566	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The question for us is, how much of an inflation cost do we have to pay to bring these folks back into the labor force?	13	1
201510	2567	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	When I look at men aged 25 to 34, maybe you’re happy with their being retired from the labor market.	13	1
201510	2568	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	They’re in school, which you should like.	13	1
201510	2569	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13	1
201510	2570	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Men aged 25 to 34, their employment-to-population ratio is down 5 percentage points from 2007.	13	1
201510	2571	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Women’s ratios are down considerably less.	13	1
201510	2572	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I think there are margins on which we can work.	13	1
201510	2573	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I certainly agree that there are limits to what monetary policy can do, but I don’t think we have plumbed those limits yet.	13	1
201510	2574	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	13	1
201510	2575	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks to everyone for an interesting and thoughtful round of comments.	13	1
201510	2576	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I know it’s been a long day, but with your permission, I would like to add some comments of my own on the outlook, and in the process anticipate tomorrow’s policy discussion.	13	1
201510	2577	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I want to start by reviewing how, in my view, the economic situation has evolved over the past few months.	13	1
201510	2578	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	At the time of our July meeting, my expectation was that if the federal funds rate remained near zero, monthly payroll gains would remain close to 200,000, and the unemployment rate would steadily decline.	13	1
201510	2579	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Delaying liftoff until the transitory effects of low oil prices and dollar appreciation on 12-month inflation had totally dissipated—something that looked quite unlikely before spring of 2016—risked a situation in which the unemployment rate might well hit 4½ percent by the middle of next year, with further declines quite likely.	13	1
201510	2580	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I worried that excessive pressure on resources could well develop under these conditions, eventually generating an unwelcome rise in inflation or inappropriate risk-taking in financial markets.	13	1
201510	2581	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	To avoid ending up in a situation in which we might need to tighten policy abruptly— something that could easily disrupt the economy—I anticipated that it would be appropriate to start tightening at our September meeting.	13	1
201510	2582	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	In September, of course, we decided to keep the funds rate unchanged, in large part because of concerns about global financial and economic conditions and the associated potential for adverse spillovers to the US economy.	13	1
201510	2583	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Although downside risks surely remain, I would say that developments on the global economic front have been largely reassuring.	13	1
201510	2584	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	That said, incoming information, primarily pertaining to the labor market, has for me served to cloud the outlook, with the consequence that I am less confident now than in July that resource utilization will in fact continue rising at the solid pace I anticipated then.	13	1
201510	2585	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Now, it is entirely possible that no change in my midsummer assessment of the modal economic outlook and its policy implications is warranted.	13	1
201510	2586	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	If that’s true, I would see lifting off at the next meeting as entirely appropriate.	13	1
201510	2587	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	But I think it would be wise for us to collect some additional information before making up our minds on December.	13	1
201510	2588	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to the pace of economic growth, I consider an underlying trend that is expected to be materially in excess of the growth of potential to be a prerequisite for tightening.	13	1
201510	2589	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Third-quarter real GDP growth looks likely to fall short of that trend, but a big swing in the contribution from inventory investment is a significant but temporary restraining factor.	13	1
201510	2590	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	And although net exports will likely continue to exert a sizable drag on GDP growth, the pace of final domestic demand seems pretty solid to me based on incoming data.	13	1
201510	2591	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I expect, in line with the Tealbook, that economic growth will run around 2 percent or a bit more in Q4 and beyond.	13	1
201510	2592	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	But we will know a good deal more by the time of the December meeting.	13	1
201510	2593	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	What worries me more are the weaker readings we have received on the labor market.	13	1
201510	2594	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Monthly payroll gains were appreciably smaller in the past two labor reports, the unemployment rate stopped falling, and the labor force participation rate declined appreciably.	13	1
201510	2595	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, recent JOLTS data on job openings, quits, and hiring have leveled out or weakened.	13	1
201510	2596	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	As President Mester and the Vice Chairman noted, our staff’s labor market conditions index was flat in September, suggesting that the labor market just treaded water—although I did take on board President Mester’s interesting comments, and I think we should pursue those issues with the staff.	13	1
201510	2597	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I will do that.	13	1
201510	2598	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	It is unclear whether this apparent slowdown is merely transitory or whether it represents something more persistent, such as a pickup in productivity growth or a decline in overall economic growth momentum.	13	1
201510	2599	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Fortunately, with two more labor reports in hand, we should have a better sense of what is going on by December.	13	1
201510	2600	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	If payroll growth does pick up to 180,000 per month, as the staff projects, and data on spending suggests growth at least in line with the Tealbook, I would be more confident that my late summer assessment remains broadly correct.	13	1
201510	2601	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Specifically, liftoff would be appropriate in order to slow the pace of expansion to a more prudent rate.	13	1
201510	2602	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	But if payroll gains remain around 140,000, I would see the case for an immediate tightening as at least less compelling.	13	1
201510	2603	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Job growth at this pace would imply a slower take-up of slack in coming months.	13	1
201510	2604	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	We have had a good discussion about labor force participation.	13	1
201510	2605	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	But if the staff is correct that the participation rate is likely to remain stable through much of next year, and the ratio of household employment to payroll employment is likely to edge down, then payroll gains of this magnitude would also be consistent with little or no change in the unemployment rate in 2016.	13	1
201510	2606	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	An important consideration in deciding when to begin tightening is the amount of slack that remains in the labor market.	13	1
201510	2607	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	On this issue, my assessment has changed slightly since late July.	13	1
201510	2608	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	As I noted at our previous meeting, the disappointing news on wages was an important factor in leading me to revise down my estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate in my September SEP submission to 4.8 percent.	13	1
201510	2609	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	This revision still seems appropriate to me.	13	1
201510	2610	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Not only have the wage data remained disappointing, but the recent memo by the Board staff confirms that wage data are informative about slack.	13	1
201510	2611	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Interestingly, the state-space model used to examine this issue yields an estimate of the current natural rate of unemployment equal to 4½ percent, conditional on assuming, as I do, that longer-run inflation expectations are currently anchored at 2 percent.	13	1
201510	2612	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	If that estimate is accurate, then we are even further away from full employment than I previously thought.	13	1
201510	2613	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Now, I readily admit that all estimates of slack are imprecise, and that confidence intervals are sufficiently wide to include the possibility that we are already effectively back to full employment, on this metric.	13	1
201510	2614	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	But because at least one point estimate puts the current unemployment gap at more than ½ percentage point, and because involuntary part- time employment remains elevated while the labor force participation rate remains below the staff’s estimated trend, I think we still have a ways to go before we can confidently assert that we have fulfilled our employment mandate.	13	1
201510	2615	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Furthermore, allowing the unemployment rate to move lower for a time may be necessary for us to achieve our inflation mandate within a reasonable period of time.	13	1
201510	2616	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Looking beyond the near term, one critical factor that will influence the future pace of tightening will be the speed and extent to which the underlying strength of the economy improves over time.	13	1
201510	2617	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	As I noted during the r* session, I anticipate that the equilibrium real rate will move up somewhat over the next few years as various forces restraining growth gradually abate.	13	1
201510	2618	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	But this is only a forecast, and the outlook is highly uncertain.	13	1
201510	2619	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	In the face of such uncertainty, we will need to proceed cautiously in adjusting the stance of policy to verify, as time passes, that higher interest rates are in fact appropriate.	13	1
201510	2620	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	The staff memo on the policy implications of r* uncertainty supports this conclusion.	13	1
201510	2621	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	The memo demonstrates that when estimates of r* are uncertain, optimal monetary policy markedly attenuates the response of the funds rate to signs that the natural rate is rising, as long as the risk is high that adverse shocks could cause the zero lower bound to bind in the near future.	13	1
201510	2622	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	And, unfortunately, that is a risk we are likely to face for some time.	13	1
201510	2623	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, the staff finds that r* uncertainty increases the weight on inflation and optimized policy rules—a result I interpret, in view of how low inflation is at present, as strengthening the case for gradualist policy.	13	1
201510	2624	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, on inflation, I don’t have much to add to what others and the Tealbook have said.	13	1
201510	2625	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	The incoming data have come in more or less as expected.	13	1
201510	2626	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	My outlook remains unchanged.	13	1
201510	2627	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	On a 12-month basis, I anticipate that PCE inflation should move up markedly over the course of next year, as the transitory effects of low energy prices and dollar appreciation fade.	13	1
201510	2628	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thereafter, I expect inflation will gradually complete its return to 2 percent in the context of a labor market in which the unemployment rate modestly undershoots its longer-run level for a time.	13	1
201510	2629	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	That is, the Phillips curve, in my view, plays a role in helping us achieve our inflation goal.	13	1
201510	2630	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think that completes our economic go-round.	13	1
201510	2631	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	We have hit 6:00 pm  Why don’t we begin our policy go-round in the morning with Thomas’s briefing?	2	2
201510	2632	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	We will reconvene at 9:00 am, and I think that will give us plenty of time to discuss policy.	2	2
201510	2633	2015-10-28	meeting		[Meeting recessed]	2	2
201510	2634	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	October 28 Session .	2	2
201510	2635	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	2	2
201510	2636	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	We’re going to start this morning with an update from Steve Kamin about the trade numbers that came in this morning.	11	1
201510	2637	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11	1
201510	2638	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	This morning we received the advance trade release for September.	11	1
201510	2639	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	This was a release just for the goods part of trade in goods and services.	11	1
201510	2640	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	The full report comes a few days later.	11	1
201510	2641	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	But in this release, September exports came in strong, and stronger than we were expecting.	11	1
201510	2642	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	Imports fell more than we were expecting.	11	1
201510	2643	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	All told, that leads to a smaller drag in the third quarter of net exports on GDP growth.	11	1
201510	2644	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	So we’ve revised from a drag in the October Tealbook of minus 0.6 percentage point to a much smaller drag of about 0.1 percentage point in the third quarter.	11	1
201510	2645	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	That said, first, these data for trade in goods are going to be subject to some further revision.	11	1
201510	2646	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	Second, when we receive trade data and parse them through to look at the effect on GDP, we also take into account any other responses to inventories and things like that.	11	1
201510	2647	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	And then, finally, we have yet to receive the data on services.	11	1
201510	2648	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	So this is a very preliminary estimate, but right now, we’re looking at a smaller drag on net exports in the third quarter.	11	1
201510	2649	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	I’ll be happy to take any questions.	12	1
201510	2650	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	How many airplanes?	12	1
201510	2651	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	These data are preliminary, and we just received them.	12	1
201510	2652	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	So you don’t have the disaggregation of aircraft sales?	12	1
201510	2653	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	We don’t have the disaggregated data at that level of granularity.	12	1
201510	2654	2015-10-28	meeting	KAMIN	I understand from our very first snapshot that the strength in exports was concentrated in consumer goods, but that’s all we know at this point.	12	1
201510	2655	2015-10-28	meeting	LEBOW	Whereas I mentioned in my remarks yesterday that the 1½ percent number we had in the Tealbook for our estimate of GDP growth in the third quarter was now at 1¼ because of incoming data on the advanced durables and a couple of other small pieces, this news would put us back at 1½ percent.	12	1
201510	2656	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12	1
201510	2657	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s get started on monetary policy, and I’ll turn to Thomas for his briefing.	21	2
201510	2658	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21	2
201510	2659	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21	2
201510	2660	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	In light of the discussion you had about different measures of the equilibrium real interest rate and their implications for the conduct of monetary policy, I thought it might be useful to return to an analysis that I presented at the March meeting, which considered what your SEP submissions implied for the path, over coming years, of one particular concept of the equilibrium real rate.	21	2
201510	2661	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	To set the stage, the upper-left panel shows a noteworthy aspect of the median paths for the unemployment gap, core inflation, and the real federal funds rate in the September SEP:  The median of your projections of the real federal funds rate rises by nearly 3 percentage points over the next three years, while the medians of your projections of the unemployment gap and core inflation change very little.	21	2
201510	2662	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	As summarized in the upper-right panel, I use an IS equation that relates the unemployment gap (u minus u*), as a measure of the cyclical position of the economy, to the real rate gap, defined as the deviation of the real federal funds rate (r) from a time-varying equilibrium level (r*).	21	2
201510	2663	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	This definition of the equilibrium real rate has the property that, if the actual real rate were kept at its equilibrium level, over time the unemployment gap would close.	21	2
201510	2664	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Thus, in this set-up, the equilibrium real rate is a medium-run concept of what Chris Gust called the neutral policy rate, which varies over time in response to shocks that cause persistent shifts in the position of the IS curve.	21	2
201510	2665	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	The coefficients on the lagged unemployment gap and the lagged real rate gap in this equation are estimated using historical data for the fourth quarter of each year, so as to be consistent with the data that you provide in your SEPs, and using the staff’s historical estimates for u* and estimates for r* taken from the Laubach-Williams model.	21	2
201510	2666	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	With the estimated coefficients in hand, I then insert each participant’s projected values for the unemployment rate and the real federal funds rate, as well as his or her estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate, and solve the equation for the implied values of the time-varying r* at the end of each year over the forecast horizon.	21	2
201510	2667	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	The implied values for each participant’s projection are shown as the blue dots in the middle-left panel.	21	2
201510	2668	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Reflecting the diversity of your views about the economic outlook and appropriate monetary policy, these r* estimates are fairly dispersed.	21	2
201510	2669	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	The median (shown by the red line) is close to zero in both 2015 and 2016, then rises to ½ percent by 2017 and to a little below 1 percent by 2018, gradually approaching the longer-run median estimate of 1½ percent.	21	2
201510	2670	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Your projected paths for the real federal funds rate continue to run well below your longer-run normal values for the next year or two.	21	2
201510	2671	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	If r* were at its longer-run value, the IS equation would predict substantially more rapid declines in the unemployment rate than those in your projections.	21	2
201510	2672	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	To reconcile your unemployment rate projections with your real rate projections, it must be the case that this concept of r* remains depressed in 2015 and 2016.	21	2
201510	2673	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	This analysis suggests that the relevant measure of policy accommodation is the real rate gap, defined as the difference at each point in time between the real federal funds rate and the time-varying equilibrium real rate.	21	2
201510	2674	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	The middle-right panel shows that, for most of you, your projections imply a moderate degree of accommodation at present, but that, by this measure, monetary policy will no longer be accommodative by the end of 2017 despite the fact that most of you project the federal funds rate to remain low by historical standards.	21	2
201510	2675	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Of course, the expectations of market participants regarding the funds rate path are also an important element of the transmission of your monetary policy decisions to medium- and longer-term interest rates.	21	2
201510	2676	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Your final two panels examine the degree to which the expectations of market participants are aligned with the SEP.	21	2
201510	2677	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	The dark- blue dots in the lower-left panel show that the median respondent to the Desk’s latest primary dealer survey projected a path for the federal funds rate somewhat below the median SEP path from September, the light-blue dots.	21	2
201510	2678	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Against this backdrop, it is striking that the expected path for the federal funds rate implied by OIS quotes, the red line, lies substantially below the survey medians; the gap between survey measures and market-based estimates of the federal funds rate path has been persistent and has progressively widened over the course of this year.	21	2
201510	2679	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	One potential explanation, noted in the lower-right panel, is that the investors whose views determine these prices have a substantially more pessimistic economic outlook than the economists employed by the primary dealers.	21	2
201510	2680	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	We do not have any evidence to assess this possibility.	21	2
201510	2681	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	A second explanation could be that investors perceive predominantly downside risks to the outlook:  The dealer survey represents expectations of the most likely, or modal, outcomes, whereas the path implied by OIS quotes reflects a mean expectation.	21	2
201510	2682	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	For example, the dealers continue to place a 1-in- 5 probability on the outcome that the federal funds rate will have to return to the zero lower bound within two years following liftoff.	21	2
201510	2683	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Finally, the gap might reflect sizable negative term premiums:  Investors might place substantial probability on adverse economic outcomes materializing over the next few years.	21	2
201510	2684	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	If these contracts, and Treasury securities at similar maturities, offer insurance against such outcomes, investors could be willing to accept a low or even negative expected return.	21	2
201510	2685	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Turning to the draft statements for this meeting:  Your second exhibit, alternatives A, B, and C offer different assessments of current conditions, the outlook, and progress toward the Committee’s stated criteria for beginning policy normalization.	21	2
201510	2686	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	As indicated in the bullets in the top panel of your second exhibit, paragraph 1 of alternative B would provide an assessment that, despite soft net exports, real GDP has been expanding at a moderate rate, supported recently by “solid” gains in household and business spending and further improvement in the housing sector.	21	2
201510	2687	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	The Committee’s overall assessment of labor indicators in paragraph 1 would continue to be that, despite some softer data recently, “on balance, ... underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year.”	21	2
201510	2688	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	And its assessment of recent inflation trends would be largely unchanged, although you will need to decide how to adjust the description of the change in measures of inflation compensation over the intermeeting period.	21	2
201510	2689	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	As of yesterday’s close, 5-to-10-year inflation compensation from TIPS had declined 10 basis points since the September meeting.	21	2
201510	2690	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	In summarizing the outlook, paragraph 2 would convey that the Committee again expects economic activity to expand at a moderate pace.	21	2
201510	2691	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	The Committee’s statement of its expectations that labor market indicators and inflation will move toward mandate-consistent levels over the medium term would be unchanged.	21	2
201510	2692	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	With regard to risks to the outlook, paragraph 2 drops the separate sentence on foreign developments that the Committee added in September and instead reports that, while the Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook as “nearly balanced,” it is monitoring “global economic and financial developments.”	21	2
201510	2693	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	These changes would signal that the Committee is now less concerned about the implications of developments abroad than was the case in September.	21	2
201510	2694	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	On the Committee’s criteria for increasing the target range for the federal funds rate, alternative B would convey that the Committee still needs to see “some further improvement in the labor market” and is not yet reasonably confident that “inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.”	21	2
201510	2695	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	However, in paragraph 3, the Committee would update its communications about the timing of the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.	21	2
201510	2696	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Rather than focusing on “how long to maintain” the current target range, the Committee would suggest that such a decision may be close by indicating that “in determining whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range later this year”—or, alternatively, “at its next meeting”—the Committee will, “based on incoming data,” assess realized and expected progress toward its objectives.	21	2
201510	2697	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Although this guidance would leave the Committee wide latitude at the December meeting, it would likely suggest to some market participants a higher likelihood of a December liftoff than they perceived in advance of this meeting.	21	2
201510	2698	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	In contrast, alternative A would cause investors to push out the most probable date of the first increase in the target range and would likely lead them to shift down their expectations of the path thereafter.	21	2
201510	2699	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative A would provide a less sanguine reading of recent data on economic activity, citing the “drag” from inventory investment and net exports, and it would note the leveling out of the unemployment rate.	21	2
201510	2700	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	It would also indicate heightened concern about economic and financial developments abroad by stating that they have tilted the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market to the downside.	21	2
201510	2701	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative A would also convey much greater concern about the outlook for inflation by citing “subdued” rates of inflation, core inflation, and hourly compensation as well as the very low market- based measures of inflation compensation.	21	2
201510	2702	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Accordingly, alternative A would set aside the Committee’s current statement of its criteria for liftoff and, instead, state that “if incoming information does not soon indicate that inflation is beginning to move back toward 2 percent, the Committee is prepared to use all tools necessary to return inflation to 2 percent within one to two years.”	21	2
201510	2703	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative C would begin policy normalization by announcing an increase of 25 basis points in the target range for the federal funds rate, reflecting a confident assessment that current and expected economic conditions have met the Committee’s criteria for liftoff.	21	2
201510	2704	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Specifically, the Committee would report that recent labor market indicators, including ongoing job gains, show further improvement and confirm an appreciable reduction in underutilization of labor resources since early in the year.	21	2
201510	2705	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	It would state that with appropriate adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, labor market indicators are expected not just “to move toward,” but also to “reach,” mandate-consistent levels.	21	2
201510	2706	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	In addition, the Committee would upgrade its assessment of risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market to “balanced.”	21	2
201510	2707	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	As would the other alternatives, under alternative C the Committee would acknowledge that “inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term” and would note that “market-based measures of inflation compensation remain near the low end of the range seen in recent years.”	21	2
201510	2708	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	But it would state with greater assurance that the effects of declines in energy prices and in prices of non- energy commodities that are currently holding down inflation “will dissipate.”	21	2
201510	2709	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	And under alternative C the Committee would say that with continuing improvement in the labor market and stable longer-term inflation expectations, “the Committee is reasonably confident that inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term.”	21	2
201510	2710	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	The forward guidance about the expected path of the target range of the federal funds rate in today’s draft of alternative C is much the same as we presented in September.	21	2
201510	2711	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	It states that “the timing and size of future adjustments” will be determined by the Committee’s assessment of realized and expected “economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.”	21	2
201510	2712	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative C presents the option to retain, in paragraph 4, the indication that the Committee “will take a balanced approach” to pursuing its objectives.	21	2
201510	2713	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21	2
201510	2714	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	That completes my prepared remarks.	21	2
201510	2715	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	I will be happy to take questions.	21	2
201510	2716	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	21	2
201510	2717	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Thomas?	22	2
201510	2718	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	22	2
201510	2719	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201510	2720	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Thomas, I want to ask a question about exhibit 1.	22	2
201510	2721	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	It’s always hard to know exactly how much to make of the dots that you show because we don’t really identify who the dots are.	22	2
201510	2722	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I do think we have a missed opportunity, in that we don’t share with each other the identities of our explanations.	22	2
201510	2723	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	It would be so much more effective if I could associate the good explanations that I read in the SEP with everybody’s commentary.	22	2
201510	2724	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	But, having said that, on these calculations in the second row, is it the case that the relative ordering of people’s funds rate dots is largely preserved?	22	2
201510	2725	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Is there something about your IS calculation that scrambles the identities around very much?	22	2
201510	2726	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	There can be instances, actually, in which they are being scrambled, because it really depends very much on your projected path for the unemployment gap.	22	2
201510	2727	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	You can have someone who has, say, a relatively high federal funds rate but who has a very shallow unemployment rate path.	22	2
201510	2728	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Therefore, actually, that person sees very little accommodation, whereas you could have somebody who still has a relatively low unemployment rate but sees a sharp decline in the unemployment rate and, consequently, must see a whole lot of accommodation.	22	2
201510	2729	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	That’s basically the approach to backing out the estimates.	22	2
201510	2730	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Is there a lot of that action, then?	22	2
201510	2731	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	In principle, I can see that.	22	2
201510	2732	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	I’d really have to go dot by dot to give you a good answer of how high the correlation is between departures of r* estimates from the median and departures of funds rates from the median.	22	2
201510	2733	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	I think that’s what you would like to know.	22	2
201510	2734	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	I’ll get back to you on that.	22	2
201510	2735	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	22	2
201510	2736	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Yes, I have a comment on exhibit 1.	22	2
201510	2737	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	This is interpreting people through the lens of this particular model.	22	2
201510	2738	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	People could have other materially different models that have very different implications for the real rate of interest.	22	2
201510	2739	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Absolutely.	22	2
201510	2740	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think it’s interesting to look at this, but it’s not clear that everyone is using exactly this model.	22	2
201510	2741	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	I’m fairly confident that this is not the model that everyone used.	22	2
201510	2742	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	[Laughter]	22	2
201510	2743	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	If I may say, it is, of course, based on an estimated historical relationship.	22	2
201510	2744	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	There are other models that would have different implications that are also based on estimated historical relationships.	22	2
201510	2745	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	So there are a lot of assumptions about how you’re going to interpret the data.	22	2
201510	2746	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	22	2
201510	2747	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201510	2748	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m going to turn to exhibit 2 and the panel on alternative B.	22	2
201510	2749	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The last bullet says that alternative B leaves the Committee “wide latitude” at the December meeting.	22	2
201510	2750	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	When we discussed the changes in language in alternative B, particularly paragraph 3, at the Minneapolis Reserve Bank, we were concerned that those changes did not leave the Committee with a lot of latitude at the December meeting.	22	2
201510	2751	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me explain our thinking on that.	22	2
201510	2752	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If the Committee were writing the very first FOMC statement of all time, it would be true that considerable latitude would be left by that language at the December meeting.	22	2
201510	2753	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That is not the case.	22	2
201510	2754	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Committee is choosing with intention to bring up a specific reference to the next meeting at this time.	22	2
201510	2755	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Our concern was that it would be read by market participants as signaling a relatively strong intention on the Committee’s part to initiate liftoff in December.	22	2
201510	2756	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Clearly, the staff here had a different perspective on this.	22	2
201510	2757	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’d be interested in hearing your thoughts.	22	2
201510	2758	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	I’ll be glad to share my perspective.	22	2
201510	2759	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	A literal reading of this red language is, in my view, desirably agnostic because, effectively, all it states is that the Committee is going to wrestle with this question at the December meeting.	22	2
201510	2760	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	That, of course, should come as a surprise to no one.	22	2
201510	2761	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	There is nothing here that says anything about the likely timing of the liftoff itself.	22	2
201510	2762	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	It is only about how, at that meeting, the question will be on the table.	22	2
201510	2763	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Now, I understand that the literal reading is one thing and what it’s taken to signal is a very different one.	22	2
201510	2764	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes, I think I would grant your literal reading, but it’s really about the choice to make the change to this particular wording at this time, signaling an intention.	22	2
201510	2765	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	One question is whether the public will look at this and say, “Well, they could have said it a lot more pointedly, but they chose to say something fairly hands-off.”	22	2
201510	2766	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	So it at least admits the interpretation that the FOMC is not yet very certain that it will want to lift off at the December meeting.”	22	2
201510	2767	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	But how this will be interpreted by market participants, for example, is very difficult for me to predict.	22	2
201510	2768	2015-10-28	meeting	POTTER	I would add one thing.	22	2
201510	2769	2015-10-28	meeting	POTTER	I think the market or the public, however you want to say it, knows that we know that they’re not expecting large changes to paragraph 3.	22	2
201510	2770	2015-10-28	meeting	POTTER	So the fact that they know that we know suggests that there is some signal in that if people understand it.	22	2
201510	2771	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, the changes are clearly designed to put December on the table to some degree, and the question is, how much signal does the market want to take from that?	22	2
201510	2772	2015-10-28	meeting	POTTER	Yes, that was President Kocherlakota’s point, I believe.	22	2
201510	2773	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	There is some uncertainty about how the market will actually take this.	22	2
201510	2774	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	22	2
201510	2775	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My staff and I felt that December is already on the table to a certain extent.	22	2
201510	2776	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that’s consistent with the surveys, et cetera.	22	2
201510	2777	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Then the question is, given that December is already on the table in the minds of those from the survey and the people who are betting with their money in the markets, what is the intent of the Committee in adding this additional language at this time?	22	2
201510	2778	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	How people will interpret our intent is one of the questions.	22	2
201510	2779	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the expectation is that it would push the probability expectation up somewhat, but because it is agnostic in its true language, the expectation is not that much.	22	2
201510	2780	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Simon, what is the probability today—roughly 30 percent for December?	22	2
201510	2781	2015-10-28	meeting	POTTER	Somewhere between 30 and 40.	22	2
201510	2782	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s 30 to 40 percent.	22	2
201510	2783	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	So maybe it takes it to 40 to 50.	22	2
201510	2784	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	But we don’t really know, and that’s the hard part of the parsing we do.	22	2
201510	2785	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Does the market look at it with a literal interpretation, or does the market say, “Oh, gee, you changed this, and therefore you’re trying to provide a signal.”	22	2
201510	2786	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there’s a range of uncertainty about that.	22	2
201510	2787	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	What might also be helpful is the insertion of “based on incoming data.”	22	2
201510	2788	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Again, this should come as news to nobody, but my sense is that this can be read as saying that it really depends on the data that will be received between now and your December meeting.	22	2
201510	2789	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	22	2
201510	2790	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Madam Chair, it’s worth mentioning, I think, that you have some opportunities to elaborate further in the next few days.	22	2
201510	2791	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Next week, I will be testifying on supervision before the House Financial Services Committee, but, of course, during the hearing I might be asked questions about monetary policy.	22	2
201510	2792	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Then, in early December—a couple of days before the November employment report comes out—I’m going to give a speech on the outlook and monetary policy, and the next day, I’m testifying on the economy and monetary policy before the JEC.	22	2
201510	2793	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	So I will have some opportunities and, arguably, one in the very near term, at least next week, if there seems to be some misinterpretation of what’s happening.	22	2
201510	2794	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the intent here is to make people view this as possible, not probable.	22	2
201510	2795	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If, for some reason, the market reacts that this is probable as opposed to possible, we’re going to have to communicate in a way that makes clear that what this language is meant to mean is “possible,” not “probable.”	22	2
201510	2796	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	22	2
201510	2797	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	On the same point, I also reacted to the “wide latitude” as perhaps a little out of context with what I’ve been reading in the market newsletters, which have been looking very carefully at this language.	22	2
201510	2798	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	If we say “whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range ...	22	2
201510	2799	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	, the Committee will, based on ...	22	2
201510	2800	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think that will be seen as a lean and as providing wide latitude.	22	2
201510	2801	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	When we also add “later this year” or “at its next meeting,” that closes the latitude a bit and leans even further.	22	2
201510	2802	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	So it’s a question at this juncture as to whether that additional precision regarding “at its next meeting” and “later this year” really does not just boost the probabilities—something that I understand is the intent here—but also locks us into something that we then will need to try to figure out how to exit, if the world doesn’t turn out the way we expected.	22	2
201510	2803	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	From my perspective, the hardest piece is to anticipate how the markets will interpret what the incoming data say about the likelihood of liftoff.	22	2
201510	2804	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	That is, suppose we get middling employment reports.	22	2
201510	2805	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	The world is easy if you get very strong or very weak ones.	22	2
201510	2806	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	If you get middling reports, how will they be read?	22	2
201510	2807	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	What inference will market participants draw:  “Is this good enough, or is it not good enough?”	22	2
201510	2808	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	All this language can do is to point to the fact that your mind is not made up one way or the other.	22	2
201510	2809	2015-10-28	meeting	LAUBACH	In that regard, the “based on incoming data” is helpful.	22	2
201510	2810	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	22	2
201510	2811	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m going to pick up on a point, which I completely agree with, that Governor Tarullo made yesterday, and that’s about this issue of “based on incoming data.”	22	2
201510	2812	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have no problem with the sentence.	22	2
201510	2813	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	It is a compromise.	22	2
201510	2814	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s an uncomfortable compromise for me but perhaps on the opposite side of some of the concerns that were just raised.	22	2
201510	2815	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	But this “based on incoming data” does, I think, feed right into the point Governor Tarullo made yesterday.	22	2
201510	2816	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m a big believer in data dependence.	22	2
201510	2817	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I absolutely love the phrase “assess progress—both realized and expected—toward its objectives,” because it is a medium-term outlook and it is about our objectives.	22	2
201510	2818	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	When you say “based on incoming data,” we have to accept that we are falling, in my view, into the trap that Governor Tarullo talked about, in which everybody is going to be looking at one employment report and the next employment report, looking for each and every one of us to focus on whichever data release it is.	22	2
201510	2819	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	The reality is, we have to say, as I’ve had to do in every interview I’ve done and every speech I’ve done, “I’m not going to say anything about this employment report, these trade data, or whatever piece of news comes out that morning.	22	2
201510	2820	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m going to talk about the medium-term outlook in terms of our progress—both realized and expected—toward our goals.”	22	2
201510	2821	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do think that when you put in a phrase that says “based on incoming data,” we are just priming everybody to react to these specific short-term noisy data.	22	2
201510	2822	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m not saying that we will do that.	22	2
201510	2823	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I hope we will look at it through the lens of, what does it mean for the next year or two?	22	2
201510	2824	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	But what this phrase is telling people to do is to look at the couple of data points that are coming up.	22	2
201510	2825	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, it’s a compromise.	22	2
201510	2826	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s an attempt, as I think Thomas nicely explained, to have your cake and eat it, too.	22	2
201510	2827	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	But that’s just the cost of this.	22	2
201510	2828	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	22	2
201510	2829	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I have two quick observations.	22	2
201510	2830	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I do think, like Governor Brainard, that if we say “at its next meeting,” that indicates “probable,” not “possible.”	22	2
201510	2831	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we actually want “possible,” something like “soon” would be a fuzzed-up word.	22	2
201510	2832	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think we have to distinguish between what we would prefer and what we think we’re signaling.	22	2
201510	2833	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would prefer to say “at its next meeting,” because I’d rather make it probable.	22	2
201510	2834	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	But if the goal is to make it possible, I would probably just say “soon.”	22	2
201510	2835	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Everybody can have a different view of the English connected with this, but I do think that, when you add a specificity of “at its next meeting,” it focuses the attention and the rest of the caveats get lost.	22	2
201510	2836	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	That’s just my own view of the English.	22	2
201510	2837	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	After the go-round, we can get a sense of where the Committee is on that.	22	2
201510	2838	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	The question I had was on alternative C.	22	2
201510	2839	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Assuming that the economic conditions come in such that we actually are planning on taking action at the December meeting, I’m wondering whether the language in alternative C gives enough information about the rate path.	22	2
201510	2840	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	If part of the goal would be, in effect, a dovish first tightening—which is to say, we are tightening, but the path we’re taking is expected to be very gradual—I’m not sure the current version of C conveys that to the extent that I might want.	22	2
201510	2841	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	So, as you’re thinking about the next meeting, if it does seem to be appropriate, I’d suggest maybe rethinking that paragraph a little bit to more strongly indicate the path.	22	2
201510	2842	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	22	2
201510	2843	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Right now, I’m not sure I could deduce what the path or the likely path is from the language.	22	2
201510	2844	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	If that’s the intent—to signal the path—then we might want to craft some language that does that.	22	2
201510	2845	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any further questions?	22	2
201510	2846	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	22	2
201510	2847	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s begin the go-round.	23	2
201510	2848	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	23	2
201510	2849	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	2850	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Our first job as a central bank is to maintain the nominal anchor.	23	2
201510	2851	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It is a common belief among citizens in this country that inflation will be at 2 percent over the longer run.	23	2
201510	2852	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I see plenty of evidence to suggest that we’re failing in this task.	23	2
201510	2853	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Inflation has been low for years.	23	2
201510	2854	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Core inflation has been below target for most of the past seven years and is expected to remain low for years to come.	23	2
201510	2855	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Wage and compensation growth both remain subdued and, based on information from our labor contacts, are expected to remain so.	23	2
201510	2856	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Global disinflationary trends are strong and expected to remain so.	23	2
201510	2857	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In my view, financial market data actually provide the most compelling evidence on this point.	23	2
201510	2858	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The low inflation breakevens are sending a clear message.	23	2
201510	2859	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Investors believe that there’s a significant risk that the Federal Reserve will be unwilling to do what is necessary to hit either of its mandates over the longer run.	23	2
201510	2860	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	To reiterate a point that I made yesterday and have made earlier in these meetings, the low risk premiums that have been deduced out of the low breakevens are signaling that people think low inflation is going to take place at the same time as low economic activity.	23	2
201510	2861	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So they view nominal Treasury securities as being a better protection with regard to those low-economic-activity states.	23	2
201510	2862	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s what that shrinkage in breakevens is signaling.	23	2
201510	2863	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What does that mean?	23	2
201510	2864	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It means that investors believe that we’re going to have low economic activity for very long periods of time, taking place at the same time as low inflation.	23	2
201510	2865	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What is that about?	23	2
201510	2866	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We have control over inflation, especially over long periods of time.	23	2
201510	2867	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s a signal that investors do not believe we’re going to do what is necessary to deliver on our inflation goals at the time when there is low economic activity, either because we’re going to face constraints in what we’re able to do or because we’re going to choose not to do it.	23	2
201510	2868	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, Madam Chair, is available evidence definitive that our nominal anchor has slipped from its 2 percent resting place?	23	2
201510	2869	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thankfully, I would say, “Not yet.”	23	2
201510	2870	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But the evidence from around the world and from our own history is clear on this point.	23	2
201510	2871	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we wait for certainty on this point that inflation expectations have left their mooring, either up or down, we will have waited too long.	23	2
201510	2872	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Committee needs to respond aggressively now to the risk of credibility loss to avoid facing the certainty of credibility loss.	23	2
201510	2873	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Such a loss of credibility would significantly constrain our ability to support the economy in the face of future adverse shocks, especially in the kind of world we contemplated yesterday, in which r* is persistently low.	23	2
201510	2874	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In view of the risk to our credibility, I would recommend that the FOMC initiate a new round of asset purchases and publicly announce its intention to explore the feasibility of negative interest rates.	23	2
201510	2875	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Vice Chairman asked for suggestions on what kinds of interventions we might contemplate if needed.	23	2
201510	2876	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think such interventions are needed at this time, so I’m suggesting some.	23	2
201510	2877	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m obviously not wedded to these particular ones.	23	2
201510	2878	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There are a number of ways one could proceed.	23	2
201510	2879	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Simply announcing the intention to never halt reinvestments, by itself, actually has a lot of accommodative power.	23	2
201510	2880	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Announcing your intention to explore the feasibility of negative interest rates—say, by as much as negative 50 basis points or negative 75 basis points—starts, by itself, to provide accommodation in states of the world in which I think investors are concerned that the FOMC will not be able to deliver.	23	2
201510	2881	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I think there’s a lot of scope in terms of what one might do.	23	2
201510	2882	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The announcements I’m suggesting for this meeting, which would be a new round of asset purchases and an intention to explore the feasibility of negative interest rates, would come as a large surprise to market participants.	23	2
201510	2883	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We need to engender exactly such a surprise.	23	2
201510	2884	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It is clear from the data that market participants put significant weight on outcomes in which the FOMC will not take the actions that are necessary to achieve its objectives over long periods of time.	23	2
201510	2885	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s time for this Committee to prove market participants wrong on this point.	23	2
201510	2886	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Madam Chair, this is my last FOMC intervention.	23	2
201510	2887	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So if you’ll indulge me, I’d like to offer a final thought on communications for your consideration.	23	2
201510	2888	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Many of us around the table spend a considerable amount of time communicating with the public about our individual views on monetary policy.	23	2
201510	2889	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As someone who did a lot of this activity, I think this kind of communication is entirely appropriate.	23	2
201510	2890	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The public has a right to know the thinking of its representatives about these key policy questions.	23	2
201510	2891	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As well, for those of us who are presidents, this kind of communication helps provide a key link between the decisionmaking in this room and the far-flung residents of our various Districts.	23	2
201510	2892	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	However, this kind of communication does have its limitations.	23	2
201510	2893	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Most, if not all, of this communication offers the perspectives of individual participants about policy.	23	2
201510	2894	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There is, I believe, a shortage of Committee communication that would provide the public with a sense of what the Committee has done and is likely to do in response to the evolution of economic conditions.	23	2
201510	2895	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Chair is uniquely positioned to communicate to the public on behalf of the Committee.	23	2
201510	2896	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I believe that the public would have a better understanding of the likely evolution and direction of Committee decisions if it got to hear more from the Chair.	23	2
201510	2897	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I note that in 2005, according to FRASER, Chairman Greenspan gave 35 sets of remarks, testimonies, and speeches.	23	2
201510	2898	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The evolution of media technology and media focus suggests to me that the appropriate level of engagement is at least as high now and possibly much higher.	23	2
201510	2899	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think, too, that the evolution of the media means that this engagement needs to be more proactive than has been traditional.	23	2
201510	2900	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The communication needs develop, as we were just talking about in terms of miscommunications of the Committee’s intentions.	23	2
201510	2901	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Committee has to fill that need, potentially on relatively short notice.	23	2
201510	2902	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Madam Chair, I have to say that you are uniquely positioned to communicate to the public on behalf of the Committee.	23	2
201510	2903	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I should say, too, that you are also uniquely qualified to do so.	23	2
201510	2904	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As my staff and I were able to experience during your recent visit to the Minneapolis Bank, you communicate with a rare clarity, a rare candor, and a rare genuine humanity and warmth.	23	2
201510	2905	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You would serve the Federal Reserve well by engaging even more with the public than you currently do.	23	2
201510	2906	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You may be wondering where to have that communication.	23	2
201510	2907	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I will note that there are convenient nonstop flights from D.C. to Rochester, New York, I believe, almost daily.	23	2
201510	2908	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	23	2
201510	2909	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s just a suggestion for your consideration.	23	2
201510	2910	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I appreciate the invitation.	23	2
201510	2911	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Madam Chair, it has been an enormous honor to serve with my colleagues around this table under your leadership.	23	2
201510	2912	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I wish all of you the best of success in your future decisionmaking.	23	2
201510	2913	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23	2
201510	2914	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23	2
201510	2915	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	2916	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	The outcome of this meeting should surprise no one.	23	2
201510	2917	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	We were not expected to start the normalization process at this meeting, and we should not and will not do that.	23	2
201510	2918	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Rather, this is a scene-setting meeting at which we have first to review where we are and where we might be going and then to communicate our conclusions accurately to the public, the markets, and ourselves.	23	2
201510	2919	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	In September, we took a pause to evaluate recent developments in the global economy, particularly in China.	23	2
201510	2920	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	We can now conclude that the global economy is not at the start of a serious crisis; that global financial markets remained robust in the face of the September surprises; and that the external effect on US economic activity and inflation of foreign developments is likely to be substantial but not inconsistent with a continuation of economic growth, the strengthening of the labor markets, and a gradual return to our 2 percent inflation target.	23	2
201510	2921	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	By the time of the critical December decision, we will need to decide whether the employment reports for October and November that are due just over a week from now and early in December, respectively, are consistent with a continuation of economic growth and the strengthening of the labor market.	23	2
201510	2922	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	What numbers will we be looking for?	23	2
201510	2923	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Well, staff calculations are that it would take hiring of roughly 50,000 to 75,000 a month to maintain the unemployment rate at 5.1 percent if the participation rate were to drift downward in parallel with its structural trend, and that it would take hiring of roughly 125,000 a month if the participation rate were to hold steady.	23	2
201510	2924	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	We might want to build in a cushion for these numbers, but they seem to me the right place to start, and I think we need some more clarity on this issue before the end of the meeting.	23	2
201510	2925	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	As usual, the staff has done an excellent job in producing the Tealbooks.	23	2
201510	2926	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	I believe the general feeling that things are not going well economically, as well as more generally, in the United States—which we sometimes hear around this table and elsewhere—is based in part on the expected slowing of economic growth.	23	2
201510	2927	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	One of the many interesting features of staff growth forecasts is the powerful effect of declines in participation on the aggregate growth rate.	23	2
201510	2928	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	That is clearly seen in the table “Decomposition of Potential GDP,” on page 26 of Tealbook A, in which the contribution from participation is forecast to decline 0.5 percentage point a year through 2018.	23	2
201510	2929	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	It’s also interesting that the contribution of the growth of multifactor productivity to overall growth is expected to rise only slowly from 0.3 percentage point this year to 0.7 percentage point in 2018, while the contribution of capital deepening to growth is expected to be constant at 0.8 percentage point—that is to say, more than double the rate of total factor productivity growth  from 2015 through 2017—and then to decline to 0.7 percentage point, the same as the contribution of TFP growth.	23	2
201510	2930	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	I take two messages from this.	23	2
201510	2931	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	First, economic growth is more in the hands of others than of the FOMC, something we all know but may, from time to time, forget.	23	2
201510	2932	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Second, the effect of investment is potentially more powerful than I, at least, had thought.	23	2
201510	2933	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	These are messages we’re entitled to broadcast to a wider public.	23	2
201510	2934	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	On inflation, I have little to add to my previous comments, which were essentially that once the transitory effects of energy price and non-energy and food import price declines pass, we will be close to our target range.	23	2
201510	2935	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Further, if the staff forecasts for the unemployment rate are correct—namely, a decline by 2017 to 4.7 percent unemployment—I believe we’re likely to move all of the way to 2 percent.	23	2
201510	2936	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	And we should also remind ourselves that not all shocks to inflation are negative.	23	2
201510	2937	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	They used to all be positive, and we will again see positive inflation shocks.	23	2
201510	2938	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	We just don’t know when.	23	2
201510	2939	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	I think we should also consider the risks to the forecast, but I’ll leave them aside for now and perhaps return to them during the general discussion of where we’re going.	23	2
201510	2940	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	I’d like to conclude with a few words on our communications coming out of this meeting.	23	2
201510	2941	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	I believe we should aim to influence expectations to the point at which the public and market participants expect us to move in December if our conditions are met, which could be translated into wanting expectations—and now I’m talking about probability—of an increase in the federal funds rate to rise to 50 percent or above after this meeting.	23	2
201510	2942	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	But—and now I’m talking not about communications to the public, but about what we need to do—we need also to begin preparing ourselves for the possibility that we will decide not to move in December.	23	2
201510	2943	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	And here, in the presence of President Kocherlakota, I think he must feel like Moses looking at the Promised Land with what I’m going to say.	23	2
201510	2944	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	23	2
201510	2945	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	He’s, regrettably, being exiled.	23	2
201510	2946	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	If we say nothing other than what we implied after the June and September meetings—that we will continue along the same path, waiting for the economy to strengthen—we may give the impression that we will not any time soon find conditions that would persuade us to move.	23	2
201510	2947	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	The message that three times—in June, September, and December—we’ve decided that the economy is too weak to raise the interest rate sends a disturbing message.	23	2
201510	2948	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	If we don’t move in December, we may need to say both to ourselves and to the public that we simply don’t like the path that the economy is on, and that we think we need to see stronger economic growth to be confident that inflation will return to our goal.	23	2
201510	2949	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	In short, we should consider moving to an expansionary monetary policy, one that will involve at least some of the measures that might be expansionary:  first, forward guidance regarding the path of the federal funds rate, provided that guidance is real or else carefully and expertly qualified; second, extending the maturity of our portfolio by lengthening the maturity of the Treasury obligations we hold, a move that Vice Chairman Dudley has mentioned several times; and, third, reducing the IOER rate and possibly the target range for the federal funds rate, though I doubt the wisdom of moving to a negative interest rate.	23	2
201510	2950	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	No doubt there are other measures to consider.	23	2
201510	2951	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	But part of the reason I’m concerned is that there is no other game in town than the Fed when it comes to policy relating to the macroeconomy at the moment.	23	2
201510	2952	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	We’re it—the only active policy player in town.	23	2
201510	2953	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	If we sit on the sidelines after we’ve reached the conclusion, for the third time, that the economy cannot withstand normalization, that message will be reinforced.	23	2
201510	2954	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Rather, we should help get the economy to a situation from which it can normalize, for we are certainly not in a normal situation at present.	23	2
201510	2955	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	23	2
201510	2956	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201510	2957	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23	2
201510	2958	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	2959	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I continue to prefer to take the first step in policy normalization at this time as described in alternative C.	23	2
201510	2960	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	At our September meeting, I argued that realized and expected progress toward our goals warranted liftoff.	23	2
201510	2961	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Incoming data reinforced that view.	23	2
201510	2962	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Labor markets continued to improve.	23	2
201510	2963	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even at the slower pace of job growth we saw in the most recent report, we’ll overshoot full employment next year in my forecast.	23	2
201510	2964	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Other economic indicators, such as consumption and investment, are in line with my projections from our September meeting.	23	2
201510	2965	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Importantly, downside risks have also abated substantially as concerns about risks to the global economy have ebbed.	23	2
201510	2966	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, inflation measures do remain low.	23	2
201510	2967	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is partly attributable to transitory factors, including dollar appreciation and drops in commodity prices, and those should dissipate over the course of this year and next year.	23	2
201510	2968	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	The waning of downward pressure from these factors, along with the continued improvement in the labor market, give me confidence inflation will move back to our 2 percent target over the medium term.	23	2
201510	2969	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	All in all, given the reduced downside risks from the global economy and my assessment that we’ll reach our inflation target and exceed our full employment mandate over the medium term, optimal policy dictates starting to raise rates soon.	23	2
201510	2970	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, most standard policy rules suggested raising rates some time ago.	23	2
201510	2971	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	While I find a case for liftoff at this meeting at least as compelling as December, I am willing to delay, again, what I would consider to be the appropriate policy action and go with alternative B as written.	23	2
201510	2972	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	One of my staff members had suggested to describe my mood as “grumpy.”	23	2
201510	2973	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I was a little fearful that people would find one of the other dwarves to describe my mood or my behavior.	23	2
201510	2974	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	23	2
201510	2975	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Picking up on some of the themes that Governor Fischer mentioned, we cannot continue this waiting strategy indefinitely.	23	2
201510	2976	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’re keeping financial markets on tenterhooks and, I think, sowing confusion.	23	2
201510	2977	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I gave a lot of speeches and met with a lot of people, both our boards and members of the public, since our September meeting, and I was struck by how many times I heard, “You know, we thought you guys were raising rates, and we thought it made sense.	23	2
201510	2978	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now we really don’t understand.	23	2
201510	2979	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Do you know something about the economy that we don’t know?”	23	2
201510	2980	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I said to my own board members, “Well, you know me.	23	2
201510	2981	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’re not that smart.”	23	2
201510	2982	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	But it is striking how difficult it is to convey—especially, I think, in our September statement, which I thought was actually a very good statement—this message that we are just sitting and waiting for something that people really don’t quite understand what we’re waiting for.	23	2
201510	2983	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, as our discussions make abundantly clear, the data and analysis will never be bulletproof.	23	2
201510	2984	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	There will always be uncertainties.	23	2
201510	2985	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, based on what I expect to see in the data in the next six weeks, I’m convinced it’ll be appropriate to lift off in December and—picking up on President Rosengren’s comment, which I agree with 100 percent—to signal when we go to C a “go slow” approach to further tightening over the next year as conditions unfold.	23	2
201510	2986	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I am not only convinced that r* for the next couple of years is very low, but I also think there are significant odds that the longer-run r* is low.	23	2
201510	2987	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Those are arguments for being clearer about a very gradual or shallow path when we do raise rates.	23	2
201510	2988	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23	2
201510	2989	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201510	2990	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	23	2
201510	2991	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	2992	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B.	23	2
201510	2993	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	The current language suggests to me, and may signal to financial markets, that unless the incoming data surprise to the downside, the Committee is prepared to raise rates at the December meeting.	23	2
201510	2994	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	While this language nudges expectations toward raising rates in December, a nudge that I think is appropriate, it embodies the necessary flexibility to defer actions if incoming data indicate a more pronounced domestic slowdown than we currently expect.	23	2
201510	2995	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I do view the current language as signaling “probable” rather than “possible,” and that’s actually where I am in terms of my views.	23	2
201510	2996	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Like President Williams, I strongly prefer a gradual increase in removing accommodation.	23	2
201510	2997	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Waiting longer risks the need to remove accommodation more quickly, and, given the uncertainty discussed yesterday about the equilibrium real interest rate, a more rapid increase might run a greater risk of overshooting the equilibrium rate.	23	2
201510	2998	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	In fact, I prefer a tightening cycle that is closer to the path currently predicted by the market, which would be a bit slower than the median SEP numbers in September.	23	2
201510	2999	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	With inflation persistently lower than our 2 percent target, we have the luxury of removing accommodation more slowly than in previous tightening cycles.	23	2
201510	3000	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would make the steepness of the interest rate path conditional on our confidence in reaching the inflation target.	23	2
201510	3001	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Even my currently expected gradual path is contingent on improved confidence in reaching the inflation target.	23	2
201510	3002	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Should our confidence in attaining that goal not improve in coming months or should we be surprised by a more rapid return toward An additional benefit from moving in December with a plan to move gradually is that we will have time to analyze the effectiveness of our monetary policy tightening tools.	23	2
201510	3003	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we were to wait longer and need to potentially move rates at each meeting, we might have less flexibility to respond to surprises about the effectiveness of our tools or potential financial surprises from the initial tightening.	23	2
201510	3004	2015-10-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	3005	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201510	3006	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23	2
201510	3007	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	3008	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	I’ll be brief because I want to make sure to save my voice for the roll call.	23	2
201510	3009	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	23	2
201510	3010	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	At our September meeting, I was convinced that economic conditions warranted an increase in the interest rate target range, based on my sense that labor markets were in line with our past assessment of what constitutes full employment and on my confidence that inflation will move back toward 2 percent once the most recent disinflationary impulse is past.	23	2
201510	3011	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Since then, as I discussed in our earlier go-round, economic reports haven’t appreciably altered the assessment for me, and the more worrisome consequences related to global economic developments now seem less likely.	23	2
201510	3012	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	So I continue to see a rate increase as warranted, and I support alternative C, although I suspect we will not adopt that alternative today.	23	2
201510	3013	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	If alternative B is adopted, I think the additional language emphasizing December as a live option would be useful.	23	2
201510	3014	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Market expectations regarding liftoff appear to have overreacted since the September meeting, and it would be helpful to push back on that.	23	2
201510	3015	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	I had an experience very similar to that of President Williams during the intermeeting period, hearing from many commentators.	23	2
201510	3016	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Maybe these people weren’t up to date on the federal funds futures markets, but they seemed to view us as highly likely to change going into September and came away from our decision a bit confused while wondering about our criteria, with many of them taking a negative signal for the economic outlook from our decision.	23	2
201510	3017	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	But it would be useful to add that language only if December is a serious possibility.	23	2
201510	3018	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Listening to your comments at the end of the day yesterday, Madam Chair, I thought it seemed as if you were setting a relatively high bar.	23	2
201510	3019	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	That’s how it struck me.	23	2
201510	3020	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	I’ll go back and read the transcript when it comes out.	23	2
201510	3021	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	But if December doesn’t have a substantial chance or it isn’t probable, in the words of President Rosengren, we’re risking a big hit to our credibility to go into that meeting with this language coming out of this meeting and not move in some circumstances.	23	2
201510	3022	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	In that case, if that’s our intention—to set a fairly high bar—we’d probably be better off leaving this language out of the statement.	23	2
201510	3023	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	23	2
201510	3024	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23	2
201510	3025	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	3026	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I support alternative B at this meeting.	23	2
201510	3027	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I am in favor of the changes in paragraph 3 that include the bracketed language making reference to the December meeting.	23	2
201510	3028	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Like others I’ve already heard, I think signaling that December is in play for liftoff is particularly important at this meeting.	23	2
201510	3029	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	It’s entirely plausible that we’ll get to the December meeting with employment growth that is at least as strong as in the past quarter, with real-time GDP growth in the 2½-ish range, and with an inflation trend pretty much as it looks today.	23	2
201510	3030	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	If these conditions appear to be in place at the time of the December meeting, I believe it will be appropriate to pull the trigger.	23	2
201510	3031	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Based on my view of the appropriate policy course if economic conditions evolve as I expect, I think an appropriate communication would have public expectations centered on a roughly 50–50 probability of liftoff by the time of the December meeting.	23	2
201510	3032	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	To me, roughly even odds after this meeting is what we need to see to support a truly data-dependent decisionmaking process as we approach the next meeting.	23	2
201510	3033	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Market participants are clearly placing current odds of a December move well below 50–50.	23	2
201510	3034	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Coming into this meeting, my view was that we should craft a statement that would communicate a posture of preserving liftoff in December as a live option but not a certainty.	23	2
201510	3035	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	It’s my judgment that my preferred outcome, this roughly 50–50 perceived chance of a December liftoff, is most likely with a statement that makes explicit reference to December as a decision point using the language “at its next meeting.”	23	2
201510	3036	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	My guess is that the proposed paragraph 3 language without this reference will not send a strong enough signal to move market expectations from where they are today.	23	2
201510	3037	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Should the Committee go in a different direction and decide on a version of paragraph 3 without any reference to our next meeting, there is a word change that I think is important.	23	2
201510	3038	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Without the bracketed reference to the December meeting, the phrase “In determining whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range” is a construction that may be construed as implying an indefinite delay of liftoff.	23	2
201510	3039	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	In the event that the bracketed language of paragraph 3 is omitted, I suggest the statement be adjusted to read “In determining when it will be appropriate to raise the target range.”	23	2
201510	3040	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	As to the specific options in alternative B, I think the “slightly” modifier in paragraph 1, describing the decline in market-based inflation compensation, is accurate.	23	2
201510	3041	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	3042	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart, could I ask you a question?	23	2
201510	3043	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	In the brackets in paragraph 3, there are two choices—“later this year” or “at its next meeting.”	23	2
201510	3044	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	You indicated a preference for “at its next meeting.”	23	2
201510	3045	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	“At its next meeting.”	23	2
201510	3046	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, that refers to December, but “later this year” also refers to December.	23	2
201510	3047	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Well, I see no difference between the two, so I don’t know why we would play around with “later this year.”	23	2
201510	3048	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	We’d just say “at the December meeting.”	23	2
201510	3049	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Because it’s a phrase that we’ve repeatedly used.	23	2
201510	3050	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	But my point is, if we choose not to put that in, then I take some issue with “whether” and suggest substituting “when.”	23	2
201510	3051	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	You’re asking a slightly different question, though.	23	2
201510	3052	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Could you live with either of those constructions?	23	2
201510	3053	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Yes, I can live with either one.	23	2
201510	3054	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	You can.	23	2
201510	3055	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201510	3056	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I think they’re basically the same.	23	2
201510	3057	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	That was really my question.	23	2
201510	3058	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I prefer being as explicit as we can, so the word “December” would be in it.	23	2
201510	3059	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	But I can live with either one.	23	2
201510	3060	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201510	3061	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks.	23	2
201510	3062	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	That’s very helpful.	23	2
201510	3063	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23	2
201510	3064	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	3065	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I support alternative B, and, in a moment, I’ll refer to the language issues that have been raised.	23	2
201510	3066	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I want to say a couple of things first, though, and they center on this issue of whether we now have to move because people have suggested we’re going to move and there was some expectation that we were going to move.	23	2
201510	3067	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I think the optimal approach to policymaking is, before you say something, to be pretty sure that what you say is what you’re going to do.	23	2
201510	3068	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	But the second-best is not to go ahead and do something that is ill advised because you suggested to people beforehand that you might do it.	23	2
201510	3069	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	The second best is to treat your earlier suggestion as essentially some variation on a sunk cost and then go ahead and do what makes sense.	23	2
201510	3070	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	The first point I’d make is that this, to some degree, is a self-inflicted wound.	23	2
201510	3071	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I agree with people who have said that there’s a lot of confusion out there, and that there was an expectation as well as a lot of discussion centering on September.	23	2
201510	3072	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	How could the markets and the commentators not be focused on September when so many of us were out talking about September?	23	2
201510	3073	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	This notion that, “Gee, the markets have focused on September—we’d better do it,” is somehow linked to the way in which our public statements have been date and calendar centered rather than talking about the narratives, as I put it yesterday, or the outlook, as many of you refer to it, that would guide our sense of when it’s appropriate to move.	23	2
201510	3074	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	There is a lot to what President Williams and others have said about there being some sense of, do we know something that the markets don’t know?	23	2
201510	3075	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	But I think we’ve created that problem, and we’ve created it by talking about dates.	23	2
201510	3076	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	For so long, President Bullard was trying to get us off dates and onto state contingency.	23	2
201510	3077	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	We finally got off of dates, and then we immediately went back to talking about them, which I just don’t think has been helpful.	23	2
201510	3078	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	The second point is, I’m still having some trouble with “act sooner so that you don’t have to make a big move later.”	23	2
201510	3079	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	When I say I’m having some trouble, I don’t mean I reject it, but I am having some difficulty understanding it for two reasons.	23	2
201510	3080	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	One reason is—I assume we all agree with this—the effect of an increase of 25 basis points in the target range will be substantially greater than what the models say an increase of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate will be.	23	2
201510	3081	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	The increase is reversing a lot of positions.	23	2
201510	3082	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	It’s reversing a psychology.	23	2
201510	3083	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	It’s going to have a big effect.	23	2
201510	3084	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I keep getting told by CEOs to expect a lot of turbulence when it happens.	23	2
201510	3085	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Now, that is not a reason not to do it.	23	2
201510	3086	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I agree with Jeremy Stein’s notion that we cannot be driven by what the bond market reaction is going to be.	23	2
201510	3087	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	We sometimes just have to fly through that.	23	2
201510	3088	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	But I do think there’s going to be an effect, and there’s going to be a tightening of financial conditions well beyond what 25 basis points would normally suggest, particularly when, as yesterday’s discussion pointed out, 25 basis points is probably a good bit of the way toward what almost everybody would agree a neutral rate is.	23	2
201510	3089	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	It’s not as though we think, “We’ve got a long way to go, so this is just a little bit.”	23	2
201510	3090	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Now let me turn to the language itself.	23	2
201510	3091	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t have a view on paragraph 1, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	3092	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Whatever you want to do on that is fine with me.	23	2
201510	3093	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	On paragraph 3, I would have preferred no change to the language at all—that is, keeping what we said in September—but it’s obvious that that’s not where the center of the Committee is.	23	2
201510	3094	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	So I actually thought that the formulation of shifting toward saying the question we’re asking is whether—or, in President Lockhart’s formulation, when—it’s appropriate to raise rates, as opposed to talking about how long to maintain the existing target range, is, as I said, a clever way to signal that the question of an increase is now on the table.	23	2
201510	3095	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I believe that language change cannot help but be noticed by people and will have the desirable signaling effect.	23	2
201510	3096	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Although, again, my preference would be no change in language, understanding where the Committee as a whole is, I think this was a much better way to do it than the formulation that was in the original alternative B that was circulated.	23	2
201510	3097	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	However, on the inclusion of “later this year” or “at its next meeting,” coming from my policy position, I’m likely to be biased against making it probable as opposed to possible.	23	2
201510	3098	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I think President Rosengren is right.	23	2
201510	3099	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	It will make it seem probable, and that’s not where I want to be.	23	2
201510	3100	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I’m not sure that’s where the Committee is prepared to be right now as to wanting to keep it on the table.	23	2
201510	3101	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	By the way, if there’s a sentiment favoring removal of the reference to “later this year” or “at its next meeting,”	23	2
201510	3102	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I think President Lockhart’s suggestion to say “when” rather than “whether” would be fine.	23	2
201510	3103	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Finally, for the reasons John has already articulated—which will keep my intervention shorter—I don’t think “based on incoming data” is helpful because, to the degree that we want people to think that we’re looking at the data, they already know that, and John said well why.	23	2
201510	3104	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	It may give an undue emphasis on a couple of pieces of data.	23	2
201510	3105	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	That’s it, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	3106	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	23	2
201510	3107	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Did you have a view, Governor Tarullo, on “later this year” versus “at its next meeting”?	23	2
201510	3108	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Oh, do you mean if my impassioned plea to omit them is ignored by everybody else?	23	2
201510	3109	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Correct.	23	2
201510	3110	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Yes, under those circumstances—“Once we’ve decided we’re sending you to Elba, what kind of house would you like to live in?”	23	2
201510	3111	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	23	2
201510	3112	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I think probably “later this year,” and the reason for that is, I believe it maintains a little more optionality for us, because we have to drop “later this year” in December, one way or another.	23	2
201510	3113	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	If we drop it but like the formulation, we can substitute “at its next meeting” and the world will think, “Oh, they just couldn’t say it, but it’s the same formulation.”	23	2
201510	3114	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	If we decide—as President Lacker was suggesting and as Governor Fischer, in some respects, was suggesting—that you have to reorient if we’re not moving, it gives us the opportunity to do that as well.	23	2
201510	3115	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201510	3116	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	23	2
201510	3117	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	3118	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Given our economic forecast, my position on policy remains that we should raise rates this quarter and we should better prepare markets for that event.	23	2
201510	3119	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	I think the language in alternative B will help accomplish this goal.	23	2
201510	3120	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	I believe it will be interpreted as the Committee signaling that a December move is very much on the table.	23	2
201510	3121	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Currently, markets are heavily discounting the probability of any move this year, making it harder to act.	23	2
201510	3122	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	My fear is that we are losing credibility for liftoff, and alternative B will, I hope, get market participants to change their beliefs, at least to some extent.	23	2
201510	3123	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	The continued, consistent underlying economic strength, in spite of recent headwinds, leads me to believe that we will see steady and modest economic growth.	23	2
201510	3124	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	With that in mind, and as I stated yesterday, my assessment of r* is that it is currently around zero and perhaps a tad positive, which is pretty much in line with much of the evidence presented in the memos.	23	2
201510	3125	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Subsequently, I anticipate that r* will gradually increase to around 1.75 percent.	23	2
201510	3126	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	That implies that our current policy stance is overly accommodative and will become increasingly so if we do not begin raising the funds rate.	23	2
201510	3127	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	However, I also continue to believe that the process of normalization should be gradual, and that starting sooner makes that scenario more likely.	23	2
201510	3128	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Thus, I anticipate that monetary policy will be characterized by some degree of accommodation over the near term, but that the current degree of accommodation is excessive.	23	2
201510	3129	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Although I can’t quantify the effect it will have, I think raising rates this year will send a reassuring message and bolster confidence.	23	2
201510	3130	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	It will strongly reflect the view that we have indeed come a long way, that the fundamentals are sound, and that we are approaching a degree of normalcy that has been absent for eight years.	23	2
201510	3131	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Indeed, it increasingly appears to me that the most abnormal aspect of the economy is the current stance of monetary policy.	23	2
201510	3132	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Thus, I support alternative B.	23	2
201510	3133	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	In support of President Lockhart’s view, I would prefer “at its next meeting,” but I could live with either.	23	2
201510	3134	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	I also support President Williams’s and Governor Tarullo’s view concerning dropping the phrase “based on incoming data.”	23	2
201510	3135	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	3136	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201510	3137	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23	2
201510	3138	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	3139	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	I will support alternative B today.	23	2
201510	3140	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	On the statement language, I would like, if I could dial this in perfectly, to have the market price in a 50 percent probability of liftoff in December.	23	2
201510	3141	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Then I would like the data to move it up and down from there as we move toward the meeting.	23	2
201510	3142	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	For that reason, on the language, I like the red language “whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range,” and I like “later this year.”	23	2
201510	3143	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	I could live with “at its next meeting,” but I like “later this year” for the reasons that Governor Tarullo articulated.	23	2
201510	3144	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	I am actually attracted to President Williams’s idea of eliminating “based on incoming data,” because, in this context, it puts a bright spotlight on the two I employment reports and I don’t think that’s how we should make policy.	23	2
201510	3145	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	So I could lose “based on incoming data.”	23	2
201510	3146	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	That’s what I would do there.	23	2
201510	3147	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Implicit in that is that if the economy continues on the current path, with job growth sufficient to continue to materially reduce labor market slack, I would support liftoff at the December meeting, and I would present such a decision in a context of a very broad agreement among the membership of the Committee that the path of rate increases will be a gradual one.	23	2
201510	3148	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	For me, the tightening cycle can be very slow.	23	2
201510	3149	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	The market path does not trouble me, although, of course, the data will dictate that.	23	2
201510	3150	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	The question is, why move at all in December?	23	2
201510	3151	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Why not wait another three months or six months—or even a year or two years?	23	2
201510	3152	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	And I would offer two considerations.	23	2
201510	3153	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	First, I believe that the test that we’ve articulated will be met if we get one more cycle of solid data.	23	2
201510	3154	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	I also believe that a well-telegraphed move of 25 basis points, presented in a context of a very broad Committee consensus favoring a shallow path, should not have a sustained material effect on financial conditions.	23	2
201510	3155	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Second, I would point to the Committee’s own communication, and let me be clear: I’m not arguing here that we should mistakenly do this because we’ve said we would.	23	2
201510	3156	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	I’m arguing that, in a close call, I would lean toward going if we get a chance to do that.	23	2
201510	3157	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	I don’t think it would be a mistake.	23	2
201510	3158	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	The reason is, we’ve carefully guided the public to expect liftoff this year.	23	2
201510	3159	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Many on the Committee, including me and many others, have publicly embraced that expectation.	23	2
201510	3160	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	The September SEP has 13 of the 17 of us supporting liftoff this year.	23	2
201510	3161	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	In the September SEP, we had median expectations regarding second-half real GDP growth of 2 percent and unemployment at 5 percent.	23	2
201510	3162	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Those will be met, hypothetically.	23	2
201510	3163	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	I think there will be a cost to appearing to change our minds, and we would simply need to weigh the benefits against that cost.	23	2
201510	3164	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	I guess I would really like to move past this essentially tactical decision about the precise date of liftoff and shift the focus toward the very broad agreement about the gradual path.	23	2
201510	3165	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	With that backdrop—and here I echo what others have said—I suspect that a decision not to move in December will not be, and will not be seen by the public as, just another step in a data-driven, meeting-by-meeting evaluation of policy but rather a fundamental change in the Committee’s framework as it’s been expressed in communications this year.	23	2
201510	3166	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	One implication would be a sense that we are seriously troubled by the path of the economy.	23	2
201510	3167	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	An additional implication would be a significant further period at the effective lower bound.	23	2
201510	3168	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Any restatement of our objective function risks setting the bar at a level that may not be met for a year or more.	23	2
201510	3169	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	In addition to the costs of appearing to change our mind, I am concerned with the buildup of financial and economic imbalances over time if, in fact, we’re going to remain at the zero lower bound for an extended period.	23	2
201510	3170	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	The question is how high to set the bar for incoming data between now and the December meeting—particularly on two payroll reports, if I can admit that.	23	2
201510	3171	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	I would simply say that I would not be setting it excessively high.	23	2
201510	3172	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	I’ll end with the thought that I really do believe it’s essential that for the period ahead we see economic growth above its trend rate.	23	2
201510	3173	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Otherwise, I’m not sure why we are raising the federal funds rate.	23	2
201510	3174	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	But if we do see that by some reasonable margin, I will be prepared to go forward.	23	2
201510	3175	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	3176	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201510	3177	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23	2
201510	3178	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	3179	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	There’s been little change in my medium-run outlook, and I continue to believe there’s a good case for moving policy off the zero lower bound.	23	2
201510	3180	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	In my view, the criteria we’ve set out for liftoff have been met.	23	2
201510	3181	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Such a move is consistent with the Tealbook’s optimal control simulations, which balance the macroeconomic risks of lifting off too early versus too late, and with various versions of monetary policy rules.	23	2
201510	3182	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	We have already taken out insurance against downside risks by keeping interest rates considerably lower than prescriptions from almost all of the policy rules, even as the Tealbook-consistent estimate of r* has been rising.	23	2
201510	3183	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	This estimate moved up more than 25 basis points to 74 basis points in this Tealbook.	23	2
201510	3184	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The funds rate remains well below estimates of the longer-run equilibrium rate.	23	2
201510	3185	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	In addition, even if they are not imminent, there are likely to be some building risks to financial stability from keeping rates low for a long time.	23	2
201510	3186	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	We need to be cognizant of these even if they are not in our models and are difficult to measure.	23	2
201510	3187	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Indeed, we have said in our own Monetary Policy Reports that we consider this a potential cost of the necessary extraordinary monetary policy actions we took during the crisis and recession.	23	2
201510	3188	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Yesterday’s discussion of r* suggests that there are good reasons to think that the natural rate of interest may be lower than it’s been historically and perhaps significantly lower.	23	2
201510	3189	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Given the shocks that inevitably hit the economy, this means the odds of getting pushed to the effective lower bound are higher than they’ve been historically.	23	2
201510	3190	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	To deal with the recent crisis and recession, the Federal Reserve developed a set of monetary policy tools that can be used in such situations.	23	2
201510	3191	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	There are many studies showing that these tools were effective in easing monetary and financial conditions, and I’d like us to be in a position to be able to use these tools again if we ever find ourselves in a situation in which they’re needed.	23	2
201510	3192	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	However, there continues to be some skepticism about the efficacy of these tools.	23	2
201510	3193	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Ultimately, the verdict will depend on demonstrating that there is a way out.	23	2
201510	3194	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Failure to navigate a good exit has the potential to take these tools off the table.	23	2
201510	3195	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	This risk is another factor that persuades me to favor taking an initial action to raise rates rather than waiting too long or too much longer, even in the face of some uncertainty regarding the outlook.	23	2
201510	3196	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	I’d rather address those uncertainties by adjusting the slope of the policy rate path after liftoff, if need be, because of shocks as we learn more about the longer- run growth of the economy and r*.	23	2
201510	3197	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Liftoff remains an unlikely outcome at today’s meeting.	23	2
201510	3198	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Our next decision point is December.	23	2
201510	3199	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The public is going to be looking at today’s statement as providing information about what we need to see between now and December in order to lift off.	23	2
201510	3200	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Have we gotten closer to meeting the criteria for liftoff or not?	23	2
201510	3201	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	If I saw data similar to what we saw in this intermeeting period—including payrolls in the 140,000 range or even lower, above the 125,000 that the Tealbook staff has said is necessary to keep the unemployment rate constant—I’d be prepared to raise the federal funds rate in December.	23	2
201510	3202	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	However, others may see things differently, and the statement needs to convey a sense of the consensus view.	23	2
201510	3203	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	I admit the communications in this environment are very challenging, but we should always be taking steps to meet those challenges.	23	2
201510	3204	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	I believe that the public read a more negative outlook in our September FOMC statement than was intended.	23	2
201510	3205	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The guessing game coming into that meeting reminded me of the old Clairol hair color tag line: “Does she or doesn’t she?”	23	2
201510	3206	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	That tag line actually won an advertising award.	23	2
201510	3207	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	I’m not sure we can say the same about our own communications.	23	2
201510	3208	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	[Laughter]	23	2
201510	3209	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	My main concern with the language in alternative B is that the characterization of labor market developments will convey a more negative message than we intend and set up the wrong expectations.	23	2
201510	3210	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The first paragraph drops language stating whether we’ve seen labor market improvement since September and then cites the slowdown in payroll growth and no change in the unemployment rate.	23	2
201510	3211	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Payrolls continue to grow above trend.	23	2
201510	3212	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Payroll growth of 140,000 per month, if sustained, should put downward pressure on the unemployment rate, and, in this stage of the business cycle, slowing in the pace of job gains is to be expected.	23	2
201510	3213	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	It’s a feature of many economic forecasts, including the Tealbook and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland staff model.	23	2
201510	3214	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Indeed, I interpreted the adjustment we made in the liftoff criteria in July, changing “further improvement” to “some further improvement,” as a recognition that we expected the pace of gains to slow.	23	2
201510	3215	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	In addition, other measures of unemployment continued to decline since our September meeting.	23	2
201510	3216	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	By omitting these relevant facts, the tone is negative, and the public may infer we have moved further from meeting the labor market condition for liftoff.	23	2
201510	3217	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	I fear we’re feeding expectations that monthly job gains close to 200,000 are needed for us to conclude there’s been some further improvement in the labor market.	23	2
201510	3218	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	If that’s true, we should say so.	23	2
201510	3219	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Essentially, what we’ve done is to add another liftoff criterion by suggesting that the second derivative of employment, and not just the first derivative, matters.	23	2
201510	3220	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	If it’s not true, then it’s a problem allowing that expectation to stand.	23	2
201510	3221	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	So let me offer a suggestion—I know I’m tilting at windmills—that we change the characterization of labor markets by saying: “While the pace of job gains slowed last month, the pace is consistent with some further improvement in the labor market.	23	2
201510	3222	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	The unemployment rate held steady, while other measures of underemployment declined.”	23	2
201510	3223	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	I think this characterization is consistent with the facts and conveys the proper sentiment.	23	2
201510	3224	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Regarding the other changes suggested in alternative B, I support making the change in paragraph 3, and I favor saying “later this year” instead of “at its next meeting.”	23	2
201510	3225	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Out of an abundance of caution, we do take market expectations into account in our decisions to lift off.	23	2
201510	3226	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	I understand that.	23	2
201510	3227	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	So I think we do need to change expectations in order to keep December alive.	23	2
201510	3228	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	I believe that the language does offer us flexibility if the data disappoint and our outlook changes.	23	2
201510	3229	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	I also support the suggested change in paragraph 2.	23	2
201510	3230	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	In paragraph 1, I have a small preference for saying “slightly” to characterize the change in market-based measures of inflation compensation to acknowledge that the decline was smaller over this intermeeting period than it was last time—10 basis points versus 20 basis points.	23	2
201510	3231	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Finally, if the Committee truly believes it’s unlikely that we will have enough information by December to make a judgment about progress toward our goals and therefore to make a liftoff decision, then let’s say so now rather than setting up another round of the guessing game.	23	2
201510	3232	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	Thank you.	23	2
201510	3233	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201510	3234	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	23	2
201510	3235	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	3236	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I support alternative B.	23	2
201510	3237	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Based on how it’s written now, pointing to the December meeting or later this year for our increase in the policy rate, let me mention three or four data points that I and my staff will be particularly looking at.	23	2
201510	3238	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Number one, on inflation—and forgive me for mentioning Dallas—we will certainly be crunching our numbers for the headline inflation and then crunching our numbers for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas trimmed mean inflation.	23	2
201510	3239	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	We are looking for that number to stay within a range of 1.6 to 1.7 percent.	23	2
201510	3240	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	If it fell below that, that would concern me.	23	2
201510	3241	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	With a range of 1.6 to 1.7, which is basically where it is right now, we would continue to feel confident about our forecast for 2016 of 1.8 percent inflation and continue to be confident that we would reach 2 percent inflation by the end of 2017.	23	2
201510	3242	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	So we’ll be looking hard at that.	23	2
201510	3243	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Number two, on the jobs report—and Governor Fischer alluded to this—we’ll be looking for job creation in excess of 100,000.	23	2
201510	3244	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I don’t think we’ll be disappointed if it’s only 100,000.	23	2
201510	3245	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Why?	23	2
201510	3246	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Because we’ll see that as being sufficient to certainly not increase unemployment, and if job growth is 100,000 or more, it may, based on our numbers, slightly help it improve.	23	2
201510	3247	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Number three, we’ll be looking at the ISM series for not only manufacturing, but also services.	23	2
201510	3248	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	We expect manufacturing to be weak.	23	2
201510	3249	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	We’re expecting that in advance for many reasons, including global overcapacities and the strength of the dollar.	23	2
201510	3250	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	What we’ll be looking for is that it doesn’t get weaker than it is.	23	2
201510	3251	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	If it stabilizes, that would be great, but we’re not expecting very good manufacturing numbers in this next series of releases.	23	2
201510	3252	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	We will, though, be looking hard at services to see that that sector is still healthy and strong and continues to be solid.	23	2
201510	3253	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Lastly, we’ll be looking at the various data series on consumer spending and so on.	23	2
201510	3254	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	If the data come in along the lines I’ve just described, I’d be inclined in December, then, to say we should, in fact, raise the federal funds rate.	23	2
201510	3255	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I agree with President Rosengren that we should emphasize, though, in that statement that we will remain highly accommodative and make clear that the path of the federal funds rate is going to be very shallow.	23	2
201510	3256	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I also think it will be very important for all of us in our public comments to emphasize the things we agree on rather than the things we disagree on.	23	2
201510	3257	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	To my ear, listening around this table, I think we have a very strong agreement that we should remain highly accommodative for some extended period of time.	23	2
201510	3258	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I know there’s disagreement on some of the tactics and the first step, but it would be good publicly to emphasize where there is a consensus around this table rather than to emphasize the differences.	23	2
201510	3259	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I do agree with the comments that the process—we’re talking about liftoff and then pulling back—has probably gotten to the point at which it is no longer serving us well.	23	2
201510	3260	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	It was probably necessary to provide us with the optionality, and the world has obviously been very complicated.	23	2
201510	3261	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	However, I believe the process of stepping up and then pulling back has created a greater fear of the unknown and magnified the perceived importance of this initial decision, maybe out of proportion to its likely economic significance.	23	2
201510	3262	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I get a number of comments also from people saying, “Gee, I thought liftoff meant 25 basis points.	23	2
201510	3263	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Does it mean something more than that?	23	2
201510	3264	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I guess you see something that we don’t see in the economy.	23	2
201510	3265	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	What am I missing?”	23	2
201510	3266	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I see these comments as fairly widespread.	23	2
201510	3267	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	This thinking has caused businesspeople to doubt what they’re seeing in their own businesses and, in some cases, to pause or pull back somewhat from confidently making decisions and to maybe even shorten their time horizons.	23	2
201510	3268	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I do agree with the comments that were made today that, if we decide in December we are not going to raise the funds rate, it’s going to be very critical to look again at the paradigm for our communication.	23	2
201510	3269	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	In particular, what I’d like to see us avoid is this thought: “We’re about to take action right around the corner—just wait.	23	2
201510	3270	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	But it’s data dependent.”	23	2
201510	3271	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I’d like to see us get out of that cycle depending on what we decide in December.	23	2
201510	3272	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	23	2
201510	3273	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201510	3274	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23	2
201510	3275	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	3276	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I support alternative B, and I agree with Governor Tarullo’s comments that, in paragraph 3, it would be acceptable if you omitted the bracketed language “later this year” or “at its next meeting.”	23	2
201510	3277	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	On the other hand, if I’m being issued a ticket to the same location as Governor Tarullo, I’ll take “later this year” as well.	23	2
201510	3278	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	That might influence Governor Tarullo’s decision.	23	2
201510	3279	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	23	2
201510	3280	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Given the location that he described, I don’t think it matters.	23	2
201510	3281	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Maybe I’m the only one who heard that.	23	2
201510	3282	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I’d also find it acceptable to take out the “based on incoming data” language, as President Williams and Governor Tarullo mentioned.	23	2
201510	3283	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	President Williams made a comment about how our communications last time had been misinterpreted by the public.	23	2
201510	3284	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I had a very similar experience.	23	2
201510	3285	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I was speaking at Marquette University in Milwaukee not long ago, and, after giving my speech, I was taking questions.	23	2
201510	3286	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	They had microphones out in the audience, and people had to go up to the microphone, so I could see as we moved across the microphones an elderly gentleman moving up into the position for the next question.	23	2
201510	3287	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I cringed and braced myself for the inevitable “saver” question.	23	2
201510	3288	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	That wasn’t what he asked.	23	2
201510	3289	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Instead, he said, “Gosh, everybody was paying so much close attention to what you were talking about, and, in your speech, you talked about how important communications are.	23	2
201510	3290	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Gosh, you guys just completely blew it.	23	2
201510	3291	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Everybody expected it.	23	2
201510	3292	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	You didn’t do it.	23	2
201510	3293	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Now we don’t know what to make of this.	23	2
201510	3294	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	This is just a mess.	23	2
201510	3295	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	You guys just need to take an action and be done with it.	23	2
201510	3296	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Now, by the way, I have a second question.	23	2
201510	3297	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	The second question is, are you familiar with the fact that a lot of large corporations have a tremendous international exposure and what you guys are doing to the dollar is killing them?”	23	2
201510	3298	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I think that captures the schizophrenia that is in play with so many members of the public.	23	2
201510	3299	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	They want us to get off the zero bound, but they don’t want the implications of what might transpire afterwards.	23	2
201510	3300	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	So we have to be careful about that.	23	2
201510	3301	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I’m not eager to support a December rate liftoff.	23	2
201510	3302	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I continue to believe current conditions and my outlook indicate that would be premature.	23	2
201510	3303	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I think we need continued very strong accommodation to signal our aggressive commitment to a symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.	23	2
201510	3304	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Yesterday’s interventions by Presidents Lacker and Bullard, as well as the Tealbook box on inflation compensation, suggest there’s a costly risk that the public’s understanding of our commitment may be less than complete.	23	2
201510	3305	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Unless the intermeeting data take an unlikely turn toward a notably stronger inflation path, I continue to believe that delaying liftoff until mid-2016 is the best way to achieve this inflation goal.	23	2
201510	3306	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Madam Chair, if I shared your optimism about the possible trajectory of unemployment heading well below 5 percent next year, I would be more enthusiastic toward a December move.	23	2
201510	3307	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Nevertheless, I could be open to such a move in December with the right communications in place.	23	2
201510	3308	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I have heard your commentary, along with those of Governor Fischer and others, that too much weight has been placed on the first move and the path is more important.	23	2
201510	3309	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	My own prescription is for three quarter-point increases between now and the end of December 2016.	23	2
201510	3310	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	If language regarding a shallow path was crafted to be not too much steeper, I could be open to a December liftoff.	23	2
201510	3311	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	And President Rosengren made a comment suggesting that the market expectations path might be one approach that’s reasonable.	23	2
201510	3312	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	In meeting with our CDIAC group a few weeks ago, I anticipated that they, being bankers and credit union people, would be anxious to talk about liftoff.	23	2
201510	3313	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	So we got that out of the way—yes, they would like liftoff—and then I wanted to talk about the path and how steep it should be.	23	2
201510	3314	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	To fix ideas, I said, “Well, I suppose if you look at the dot chart, you might think that, at the end of 2016, a funds rate of about 1½ might not be unreasonable,” and they almost gasped.	23	2
201510	3315	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	It was such a large number, basically, was what they were saying.	23	2
201510	3316	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Again, others have said this, too.	23	2
201510	3317	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	There’s a desire to get off of zero, but how high is really up in the air, and it’s not nearly as high as some people probably think.	23	2
201510	3318	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I’m sorry—did I mention that I have “over 11:15” in the pool for when this ends?	23	2
201510	3319	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	23	2
201510	3320	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I’ll try to cut some things out, I promise.	23	2
201510	3321	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Now, let me say again why communicating a shallow policy rate path is appropriate.	23	2
201510	3322	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	First, the r* memos and our discussion yesterday made a strong risk-management case for keeping rates low in order to help avoid bad outcomes associated with the effective lower bound on interest rates.	23	2
201510	3323	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	For me, this is a powerful argument, because it captures the asymmetry in the risks we face.	23	2
201510	3324	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	That is, currently, I’m not hearing many discussions of similarly bad outcomes on the other side of the ledger.	23	2
201510	3325	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	If you are worried about high inflation, even if events changed quickly and underlying inflation was headed to 3 percent or even 4 percent, our interest rate policy tools could be employed effectively to rein it in.	23	2
201510	3326	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	There’s a second reason why I support an aggressive commitment to a symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.	23	2
201510	3327	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	It’s that we are likely in a regime in which even during normal times we could all too often run out of capacity to lower the funds rate to deal with recessionary shocks or below-target inflation.	23	2
201510	3328	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Longer-run measures of r* are plausibly in the range of 1 to 1½ percent.	23	2
201510	3329	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	So, with our inflation objective of 2 percent over the longer run, the nominal federal funds rate ought to average about 3 to 3½ percent.	23	2
201510	3330	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	This means our monetary policy capacity on the accommodative side is only 350 basis points.	23	2
201510	3331	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	This is a brave, new, risky world for FOMC recession fighting.	23	2
201510	3332	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	In the period that included the 1990–91 recession, the Greenspan FOMC lowered the funds rate from a peak of 9¾ percent to 3 percent.	23	2
201510	3333	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	That’s 675 basis points.	23	2
201510	3334	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	They were a little bit above steady state.	23	2
201510	3335	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	In the cycle that included the 2000 recession, the Greenspan FOMC lowered the funds rate from a peak of 6½ percent to 1 percent.	23	2
201510	3336	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	That’s 550 basis points.	23	2
201510	3337	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	In the most recent cycle, the Bernanke FOMC lowered the funds rate more than 500 basis points, and we clearly wanted to do much more.	23	2
201510	3338	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	We instead resorted to increasing our balance sheet to about $4½ trillion.	23	2
201510	3339	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	The point is that having only 300 to 350 basis points of room to lower the funds rate to zero from a neutral level will likely pose a serious challenge for our future recession-fighting and inflation-inducing capabilities.	23	2
201510	3340	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Historically, 350 basis points has not been enough.	23	2
201510	3341	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I agree with the suggestions given by Presidents Williams and Rosengren yesterday that we need to review our tools for more regular use at the effective lower bound.	23	2
201510	3342	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Well, I’ve got more comments on symmetry, but I’ll skip those.	23	2
201510	3343	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	These issues inform my strong conviction that we need to make sure our policy rate path over the next 12 to 18 months is appropriately accommodative.	23	2
201510	3344	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	We need the time to assess domestic and global risks that we might normally discount, but that today impose asymmetric losses due to the constraints of the effective lower bound.	23	2
201510	3345	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	And we need the time that a shallow path allows to make sure inflation is heading to our target in a symmetric fashion and not stalling out in a way that would even further impinge on our ability to fight future recessions or disinflations.	23	2
201510	3346	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	3347	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201510	3348	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23	2
201510	3349	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	3350	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	My assessment is that the best we can probably do is to raise the rate in December and have it be a dovish increase while getting the policy idea across that we’re going to have a gradual pace of increases.	23	2
201510	3351	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	That’s what I’m hoping for.	23	2
201510	3352	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I’m willing to recommend alternative B for today.	23	2
201510	3353	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I like the “slightly” language in paragraph 1, and I like the “at its next meeting” language in paragraph 3.	23	2
201510	3354	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I support President Mester’s suggestion on the characterization of the labor market in paragraph 1.	23	2
201510	3355	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I thought she made good points on that.	23	2
201510	3356	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I also support President Lockhart’s suggestion if we were not going to include the bracketed language in paragraph 3.	23	2
201510	3357	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with President Williams that there’s a good argument for alternative C at this meeting.	23	2
201510	3358	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	We cited global financial turmoil in September, which has settled down or reversed.	23	2
201510	3359	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with Governor Fischer that a near-term hard landing in China seems unlikely.	23	2
201510	3360	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think our arguments are based on cumulative progress toward goals, and that argues that now is a good time to begin normalization.	23	2
201510	3361	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	So you could make a case for alternative C today, but, because the preparation for C is not in place, I’d go with alternative B for today.	23	2
201510	3362	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I want to follow up on some of my comments from yesterday, and, perhaps hazardously, I’m going to comment a little bit on what other people have said this morning.	23	2
201510	3363	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	We made a case for normalization beginning in 2011 and later revised that plan.	23	2
201510	3364	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	We’ve had four years of communication of the idea that the Committee intended to normalize.	23	2
201510	3365	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The case for normalization suggests that the policy rate would return to historically normal levels, and that the balance sheet would return to levels more consistent with historical values, once the economy returned to normal.	23	2
201510	3366	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Today the national unemployment rate is 5.1 percent, very close to historical norms and well below the median unemployment rate over the past 50 years in the United States, which is 5.8 percent.	23	2
201510	3367	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Net of the oil shock, inflation is close to target—1.6 percent or 1.7 percent.	23	2
201510	3368	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	On the Dallas Fed trimmed mean, it’s 1.7 percent on a year-over-year basis.	23	2
201510	3369	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	So, again, net of the oil shock, inflation is actually pretty close to target.	23	2
201510	3370	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Arguably, this is about as good as the Committee has ever done with respect to its goals, yet the Committee has not moved to try to normalize either the balance sheet or the policy rate, even though both dimensions of our goals are arguably relatively close to normal.	23	2
201510	3371	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The private sector may reasonably conclude, or may be forgiven for concluding, that we intend to keep the zero interest rate policy, or ZIRP, at least through the medium term.	23	2
201510	3372	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Even with liftoff, as Governor Powell and others emphasized yesterday, the pace of rate increases is likely to be so gradual that a moderately negative shock would easily compel the Committee to return to the zero lower bound.	23	2
201510	3373	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	My point is that the probabilities are fairly high at this juncture that we will simply keep ZIRP—or, if not ZIRP, near-ZIRP—in place.	23	2
201510	3374	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I do not think that this is the intention of the Committee.	23	2
201510	3375	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	All of us—the Committee and the staff—have in our heads that we’re going to return to the equilibrium of the 1980s and 1990s, which we know and love, and that we’re going to move the funds rate around according to typical policy prescriptions from that era.	23	2
201510	3376	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	But I’m not sure I really see that happening, given the way things are evolving and how difficult it’s proving to be to move off the zero lower bound.	23	2
201510	3377	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think the Committee should at least begin to prepare some for the possibility that we have either a ZIRP or a near-ZIRP in place for some time.	23	2
201510	3378	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	In particular, if this is the way this proceeds, we would have to de-emphasize our rhetoric about normalization and our rhetoric about exit strategy, and I don’t think this would be easy for the Committee to do, because we spent four years talking about it.	23	2
201510	3379	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	But then we just de-emphasize all of that and say, “Well, the balance sheet is not going to return to normal very soon—maybe not at all—and the policy rate is also not going to return to normal very soon.”	23	2
201510	3380	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Or, “our concepts of ‘normal’ have changed so dramatically that it’s completely warped to think about the 1980s or 1990s equilibrium as being relevant in today’s policy environment.”	23	2
201510	3381	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	We should at least think about this.	23	2
201510	3382	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Now, a lot of people around the table still think that, if we commit to an even longer period of ZIRP, we’ll produce what the New Keynesian model says it will produce, which is a consumption boom today and higher expected inflation today.	23	2
201510	3383	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	After six or seven years of this, you have to start to admit that the model is not generating anything like the kind of prediction that would come out of the basic analysis.	23	2
201510	3384	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	So it seems very unlikely that a further commitment to ZIRP is going to help us, given the current outlook.	23	2
201510	3385	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Keep in mind that the staff’s outlook is a very subdued outlook.	23	2
201510	3386	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	It’s a 2 percent growth rate.	23	2
201510	3387	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	It’s a flat unemployment rate, more or less.	23	2
201510	3388	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	And it’s inflation below target for all of the way through the forecast horizon.	23	2
201510	3389	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	So almost nothing happens.	23	2
201510	3390	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	It’s unlikely that we would get any kind of business cycle dynamics out of further commitment to the low interest rate policy.	23	2
201510	3391	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	What’s more likely is that we’d get results that look a lot like Japan’s.	23	2
201510	3392	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Japan’s policy rate has not been above 50 basis points for 20 years.	23	2
201510	3393	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	There’s no consumption boom there.	23	2
201510	3394	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	There’s no boom in inflation expectations there, either.	23	2
201510	3395	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	We’d get something very similar.	23	2
201510	3396	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think that the probability that we have converged to something like that is getting much higher than it has been until recently.	23	2
201510	3397	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	We still may be able to lift off modestly, and I hope we can, in December.	23	2
201510	3398	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	It’s definitely possible that the economy will surprise to the upside, allowing normalization to proceed as we have it in our heads.	23	2
201510	3399	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	This economy has definitely been resilient in the past, which could happen again.	23	2
201510	3400	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	But after seven years of ZIRP, we need to prepare for a more permanent policy of this type.	23	2
201510	3401	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	In response to some of the comments around the table here, I thought it was an excellent set of comments, and I wanted to react to some of them.	23	2
201510	3402	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I have some sympathy with President Kocherlakota’s citation of the low TIPS breakevens, which I have cited myself at times in the past and have been very concerned about.	23	2
201510	3403	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	He says the evidence is not definitive yet that inflation expectations are falling, but I think we need to worry about this.	23	2
201510	3404	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	As those of you who have listened to what I’ve said about this know, I’ve noted that the oil price seems to be so highly correlated with the TIPS breakevens that I can’t make any sense of it in this current environment, in which the oil price has declined.	23	2
201510	3405	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	But now the oil shock is more than a year old, and I’m starting to wonder if we should start to infer more of a signal from this.	23	2
201510	3406	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	So I take President Kocherlakota’s admonition on this seriously.	23	2
201510	3407	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I also agree with President Kocherlakota on Chair communication.	23	2
201510	3408	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I thought he eloquently stated the case, and I was intrigued by the data on Alan Greenspan and his communications strategy for the Committee.	23	2
201510	3409	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	President Kocherlakota is not known primarily as a data guy.	23	2
201510	3410	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	He’s known as a theory guy.	23	2
201510	3411	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	But here he came up with some excellent data.	23	2
201510	3412	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	FRASER, man.	23	2
201510	3413	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with those around the table who said that the goal here is to reel in the market expectations of when the liftoff will occur.	23	2
201510	3414	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The goal is to put some more probability on December.	23	2
201510	3415	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	If we could get that above 50 percent, it would be good.	23	2
201510	3416	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	If we can’t, then we might have to follow up with communications after the meeting.	23	2
201510	3417	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t know how that would work.	23	2
201510	3418	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	But I think the basic idea is that September was perceived as more dovish than at least my interpretation of where the Committee is, and that the markets have moved way out, some into 2017, on when they think liftoff will occur.	23	2
201510	3419	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	This is part of what’s making me very concerned that we’ll just get stuck with ZIRP long term.	23	2
201510	3420	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with Governor Fischer on the implications of not moving in December.	23	2
201510	3421	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think the words he used were, “That would indicate we just don’t like the economic outcomes we see,” and I believe that’s right.	23	2
201510	3422	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	The argument about normalization is an argument about cumulative progress.	23	2
201510	3423	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	To mix that up with what’s going on day to day in the economy is mixing two types of arguments.	23	2
201510	3424	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	If we don’t like the way the economy is performing, that’s fine, but the Committee should just admit this and then chart a new course for policy.	23	2
201510	3425	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Governor Fischer laid out some possibilities in that case.	23	2
201510	3426	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with John Williams and others—we can’t continue to wait indefinitely on this.	23	2
201510	3427	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	We’re sending a pessimistic signal on the economy that might be unwarranted.	23	2
201510	3428	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Governor Tarullo has made comments about the “data dependent” sentence, and I actually agree with him on this.	23	2
201510	3429	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	In this context, having that data dependence is really going to put a lot of pressure on the various reports that come out.	23	2
201510	3430	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Most likely, they’re going to be muddled.	23	2
201510	3431	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	We’d do better by saying we’re going to focus mostly on cumulative progress.	23	2
201510	3432	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with everyone who says you don’t want to make this interest rate move in an environment of a slowing economy.	23	2
201510	3433	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I appreciate that.	23	2
201510	3434	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	But as long as we can make the case that we’re okay and we can cite cumulative progress, we should be able to get off zero in December.	23	2
201510	3435	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with the Governor even though I have been the big advocate of saying, “We need state-dependent policy, and we’ve got to depend on the data.”	23	2
201510	3436	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	But it does have this feedback to us that every little wiggle in the data is something that’s going to change FOMC policy.	23	2
201510	3437	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with Governor Powell that if we don’t move in December, we’re going to have to consider a fundamental change in the policy outlook advanced by the Committee—how we’re thinking about normalization and how we’re thinking about our framework as we go forward.	23	2
201510	3438	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	23	2
201510	3439	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201510	3440	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23	2
201510	3441	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	3442	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	I can support alternative B today because it leaves our options open for the December meeting.	23	2
201510	3443	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Based on what we know today, however, I continue to see a strong case for raising the funds rate.	23	2
201510	3444	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Final private domestic demand is growing at a healthy pace; unemployment looks to be at or near its natural rate; and inflation, though below target, in our forecast is expected to rise over the medium term as energy prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar stabilize.	23	2
201510	3445	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Moreover, all of our reference rules are telling us that the liftoff is overdue.	23	2
201510	3446	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	The memos on r* were surprisingly consistent in suggesting that, while various measures of r* are currently low by historical standards, they are all generally above the current level of the real federal funds rate.	23	2
201510	3447	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, I was struck by just how far the Tealbook-consistent r* is above the current real federal funds rate.	23	2
201510	3448	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	The difference in those two rates is now almost 2 percentage points, a gap that has persisted for some time.	23	2
201510	3449	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	For example, over the past decade, 12 of the 14 largest gaps between Tealbook-consistent r* and the real federal funds rate have occurred since June 2014, a sign that we’ve kept monetary policy exceptionally accommodative for some time.	23	2
201510	3450	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, my own policy views aside, I would strongly support those who have urged better communication and clearer direction on the Committee’s expectations regardingnormalization and the path of rates.	23	2
201510	3451	2015-10-28	meeting	GEORGE	I’m happy to see the Chair lead on this front at any of her upcoming opportunities.	23	2
201510	3452	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201510	3453	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23	2
201510	3454	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	3455	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I see the state of the economy as well as the outlook as very similar to what we faced in September.	23	2
201510	3456	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Improvements in resource utilization look to be gradual, and the recent data on inflation continue to suggest an underlying trend below our 2 percent target.	23	2
201510	3457	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Important downside risks to the outlook for activity and inflation remain, with global economic growth decelerating and key foreign economies continuing to face difficult challenges.	23	2
201510	3458	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s not yet clear what effect on US activity the recent slowing in global growth will have.	23	2
201510	3459	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result and with the deterioration in inflation compensation, I’m not yet reasonably confident that inflation will return to 2 percent over the medium term, and I think it’s appropriate to keep the federal funds rate in its current target range while we receive more information on the resilience of the underlying momentum in the economy.	23	2
201510	3460	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	For some time, there’s been a conversation concerning the normalization of monetary policy that equates normalization with moving off the zero lower bound and tightening.	23	2
201510	3461	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think the discussion of the natural rate of interest yesterday grounds that discussion in terms of the distance of the effective federal funds rate relative to a time-varying natural rate of interest.	23	2
201510	3462	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	We’ve discussed a host of reasons why that natural rate of interest might be low at the moment and might remain somewhat low in the medium term, ranging from the empirical estimates that have been circulated to the Committee, to the persistent financial headwinds of the crisis, to the observation that world interest rates appear to have moved quite low and exerted a downward pull on US interest rates by the exchange rate and financial market channels.	23	2
201510	3463	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	On balance, the materials developed for the Committee’s consideration suggest important reasons why our current monetary policy stance may be closer to neutral than may be implied by conventional monetary policy empirical regularities based on historical relationships.	23	2
201510	3464	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Importantly, the asymmetry in risk-management considerations also argues for being somewhat cautious.	23	2
201510	3465	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The persistence of the forces holding down r* suggests it will remain low relative to historical norms.	23	2
201510	3466	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	This, together with downside risks from abroad, points toward an elevated risk of being constrained in the future by a lower bound on policy rates.	23	2
201510	3467	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	In those circumstances, prudence dictates ensuring that momentum in real activity and inflation is robust enough to withstand adverse shocks before initiating a tightening cycle.	23	2
201510	3468	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	If risks were skewed in the opposite direction—if there were a sufficiently large chance that policy would have to tighten unusually rapidly in response to an abrupt tightening in resource utilization and a substantial buildup in inflationary pressures—then it would be prudent to begin lifting off to guard against the risks to the stability of the economy.	23	2
201510	3469	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	However, given that inflation has run persistently below our target, that inflation breakevens have moved down substantially and persistently, that wage and other indicators suggest that slack is diminishing but still remains, that estimates of the effect of resource utilization on inflation are relatively modest at present, and that r* is estimated to be lower than historical norms, I believe that risk to be somewhat modest.	23	2
201510	3470	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Even rapid tightening in today’s circumstances would be well within the norm of historical tightening cycles.	23	2
201510	3471	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	A possible reason for lifting off is a desire to move away from the zero lower bound, perhaps because there is a stigma or a discomfort associated with that policy setting.	23	2
201510	3472	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think those who are influenced by this view but are also concerned about risk management, given a low medium-term r* and substantial downside risks to demand, might recommend lifting off and then moving very slowly.	23	2
201510	3473	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	That has some merits, but it also carries substantial risks of resulting in excessive tightening in financial conditions, especially given the possibility of an excessive reaction through foreign exchange values.	23	2
201510	3474	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	My own perspective on this, I’d have to say, is colored by the many episodes in other advanced economies of raising, reversal, and regret.	23	2
201510	3475	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	These considerations lead me to want to be somewhat more confident before we initiate a tightening path, which argues for waiting another meeting or two to gauge the underlying momentum of domestic demand.	23	2
201510	3476	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Since March, we’ve stated that the timing of liftoff is data dependent, and I believe it is advisable to maintain this stance.	23	2
201510	3477	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s possible that the data we receive between now and the December meeting will justify lifting off or keeping the policy rate at its current level.	23	2
201510	3478	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	With regard to the communications and recognizing there is considerable sentiment in this room in favor of a December liftoff and legitimate concern to ensure that markets are on notice, I agree with the desire to make sure that a liftoff in December is viewed as possible, although not too probable.	23	2
201510	3479	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	So maybe I’m in the 55 percent range.	23	2
201510	3480	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	As against this, I believe it is inadvisable to reintroduce calendar-based guidance after working so carefully and deliberately to eliminate it.	23	2
201510	3481	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	For those reasons, I’m a bit concerned about introducing language regarding “later this year” or “at its next meeting,” which we will then potentially have to remove if it gets stale very quickly and which in turn risks reinforcing perceptions of “lurchiness” in our communications.	23	2
201510	3482	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I actually think the new version of the sentence in paragraph 3 without either version of the bracketed language will clearly put market participants on notice that the Committee is actively debating a rate rise at the next meeting.	23	2
201510	3483	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The suggestions by President Lockhart and by President Rosengren did a nice job of balancing these two considerations, and I would probably put those suggestions above either of the versions currently on the table.	23	2
201510	3484	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	With regard to my preference for the wording of those bracketed items on the table, I would probably put “at its next meeting” slightly above “later this year,” because of the possibility that we could carry it forward.	23	2
201510	3485	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The final thing I would say is, I think the perceptions of “lurchiness” in our communications had as much to do with intermeeting communications by participants as they did with the way that we reacted to incoming data.	23	2
201510	3486	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I, for one, would have been very reluctant to utter any calendar-based statement in the days and months leading up to this meeting, and I would be very happy to continue taking a pledge not to utter any calendar-based statements myself if other members of the Committee also wanted to leave to the Chair the sole voice on any calendar-based prognostications between now and December.	23	2
201510	3487	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	3488	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201510	3489	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23	2
201510	3490	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	3491	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B.	23	2
201510	3492	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the language does a good job of making it clear that a December liftoff remains a possibility, without going so far as to imply that liftoff is highly likely.	23	2
201510	3493	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The statement makes it clear that we’re still data dependent.	23	2
201510	3494	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	It gives us a chance to parse that data and decide whether we think the economy has sufficient forward momentum to justify liftoff or not.	23	2
201510	3495	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If the data are consistent with lifting off, then I would anticipate that expectations about December would shift up as we approach the meeting.	23	2
201510	3496	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	But if this doesn’t happen sufficiently on its own, then I think we should give the markets a nudge.	23	2
201510	3497	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	My own view is that, in December, we want market participants to be expecting liftoff if we are planning to lift off or not expecting liftoff if we’re not planning to lift off.	23	2
201510	3498	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	This is how we behaved historically, and, given our recent track record on communications, this is very important if we’re going to enhance our credibility with the public.	23	2
201510	3499	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of language, I favor “slightly” in paragraph 1 because, as someone said—I guess it was Loretta—10 basis points is less than 20 basis points.	23	2
201510	3500	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of “later this year” and “at its next meeting,” that’s a really tricky one.	23	2
201510	3501	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I like “at its next meeting” better because I think it’s more explicit, but, on the other hand, I take Governor Tarullo’s point that it’s a lot easier to take out “later this year” than it is to take out “at its next meeting,” because it has to come out automatically.	23	2
201510	3502	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	So I guess if push came to shove, I’d be in favor of “later this year” because of the ease of taking it out of the statement.	23	2
201510	3503	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	You don’t have to live with “at its next meeting.”	23	2
201510	3504	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If we take out “at its next meeting” and we don’t move in December, then people are going to find that quite noteworthy.	23	2
201510	3505	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I do like the “based on incoming data.”	23	2
201510	3506	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	We’ve said we’re data dependent.	23	2
201510	3507	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s a little weird now to all of a sudden say, “Well, the data are really noisy, so we’re not going to pay attention to them.”	23	2
201510	3508	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s not saying we’re going to just take the data literally.	23	2
201510	3509	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s saying we’re going to use the data to assess our progress, both realized and expected.	23	2
201510	3510	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	So it’s only to the extent that the data inform our views of the progress, both realized and expected, that we’re going to consider those data.	23	2
201510	3511	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Talking about the data is important because we want market participants to react to the incoming data to assess the probability of liftoff.	23	2
201510	3512	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	We want them to think right along with us.	23	2
201510	3513	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, we know what we’ll do if the economy continues to grow at an above-trend pace and the labor market tightens further.	23	2
201510	3514	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	As I said yesterday, I think we also have to come up with some good answers of how we’ll respond, if the economy doesn’t cooperate, to the potential assertion that we’re going to be out of weapons.	23	2
201510	3515	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	We need to have a “plan B” just in case, and we need to have more discussion among the Committee participants about what that plan B might consist of, because if we don’t move in December, the next question for the Chair is going to be, “Okay, so what are you going to do if the economy continues to disappoint?”	23	2
201510	3516	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The more full and credible answer she can give, the more reassuring it will be to confidence.	23	2
201510	3517	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	There are a number of options worth considering.	23	2
201510	3518	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m just going to run through a bunch of options to put them on the table.	23	2
201510	3519	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The first is the very obvious one:  We could extend the duration of our balance sheet.	23	2
201510	3520	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The Treasury securities have been aging.	23	2
201510	3521	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	We have a lot of Treasury securities maturing next year.	23	2
201510	3522	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	So, clearly, extending the duration is a real, live possibility.	23	2
201510	3523	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	When we consider extending duration, a lot of times we think, “Well, we’ll let the short-dated Treasury securities mature and then invest in longer-term Treasury securities, or we’ll sell the short-dated Treasury securities and invest in longer-term Treasury securities.”	23	2
201510	3524	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	But there’s also another MEP program:  We could sell short-dated Treasury securities and buy agency mortgage-backed securities.	23	2
201510	3525	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s another possibility that I think we should at least look into, because it may turn out to have a more powerful effect on economic activity than just buying Treasury securities.	23	2
201510	3526	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I said “look into,”	23	2
201510	3527	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	President Lacker, not necessarily “do.”	23	2
201510	3528	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	23	2
201510	3529	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	You’ll have your day in court if we go down this path.	23	2
201510	3530	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If we were to decide to extend the duration of the portfolio, it’s also going to be very important in terms of how we message this.	23	2
201510	3531	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	We don’t want people to conclude that we’re extending our duration because we somehow have this balance sheet constraint.	23	2
201510	3532	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If you’re going to talk about extending duration, you also have to say that’s the first step in what would be subsequent potential steps to actually expand the balance sheet and do large-scale asset purchases.	23	2
201510	3533	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If we don’t talk about that at all, people will reach the conclusion that the reason you’re extending the duration is that somehow you have this very solid balance sheet limitation.	23	2
201510	3534	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that would not be reassuring to people.	23	2
201510	3535	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	That would actually be somewhat alarming to people.	23	2
201510	3536	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of another large LSAP program, I’ve never heard anything compelling about why the current balance sheet size is the limit.	23	2
201510	3537	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If someone has a really strong argument for why this is the limit, I’d like to hear it.	23	2
201510	3538	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	But it seems to me that $4½ trillion or $5½ trillion—it’s not obvious that we’re out of ammunition here.	23	2
201510	3539	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	And, to me, if the option was to be stuck at the zero lower bound indefinitely with inflation far below our objective versus more QE that could maybe avert that outcome, I would favor more QE, thank you.	23	2
201510	3540	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The IOER rate is more controversial.	23	2
201510	3541	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	We could cut the IOER rate.	23	2
201510	3542	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	We could probably cut it into negative territory.	23	2
201510	3543	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	We decided not to do this earlier because of concerns about the unintended consequences, but maybe the European experience makes us more comfortable that the costs are less than we’d feared.	23	2
201510	3544	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	So I would encourage the staff to work on updating our view of the costs and benefits of a reduction in the IOER rate.	23	2
201510	3545	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	We could even say in our communications, if the economy were to disappoint, “We’re looking at this.	23	2
201510	3546	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	This is potentially on the table, and we’ll be back to you on that.”	23	2
201510	3547	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The last thing I would point to—and this is going to be a little bit more controversial—is that I think we should consider price-level targeting.	23	2
201510	3548	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I really do.	23	2
201510	3549	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If things get bad and you’re worried about inflation expectations getting unanchored to the downside, price-level targeting is a strategy to lean against that and is particularly relevant in the current environment because we’ve been underperforming on our inflation goals for quite some time.	23	2
201510	3550	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The current policy of bygones—that we just forgive all of the past misses on inflation—does run the risk over time of having inflation expectations become unanchored to the downside.	23	2
201510	3551	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	A PLT policy pushes against that.	23	2
201510	3552	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we discussed that a few years ago.	23	2
201510	3553	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	We decided not to go there because we thought it was hard to explain, but my own personal view is that it’s not that hard to explain.	23	2
201510	3554	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If you’re really worried about inflation expectations getting unanchored to the downside, it is actually a pretty credible tool to address this.	23	2
201510	3555	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, in extremis, if all of these tools were insufficient, we probably should call a spade a spade and say to the Congress and the Administration, “Look, monetary policy can only do so much.	23	2
201510	3556	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	There is this thing called fiscal policy that could be used to support economic activity.”	23	2
201510	3557	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, a pretty strong argument can be made for a large infrastructure investment program if you have a very low level of interest rates.	23	2
201510	3558	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Looking around the Second District, I know we need a second rail tunnel from New Jersey into New York City.	23	2
201510	3559	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Of course, with more federal support, that might occur a little bit more quickly.	23	2
201510	3560	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	A dedicated tunnel.	23	2
201510	3561	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	To Montclair?	23	2
201510	3562	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	In conclusion, there are two things I want to stress.	23	2
201510	3563	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	We need to be fully ready with a plan should our base-case expectations not materialize.	23	2
201510	3564	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think there is some work for the staff to do in terms of developing recommendations.	23	2
201510	3565	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s some work for us to do in terms of communicating with one another about what our preferences and orderings would be.	23	2
201510	3566	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	We want to give the Chair as much ammunition as possible if she has to go to that press conference after not having lifted off in December.	23	2
201510	3567	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, as Vice Chairman, I want to say a few words of thanks to Narayana.	23	2
201510	3568	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I thought what was said yesterday was very much on point.	23	2
201510	3569	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	You’ve been an absolutely terrific colleague—very collegial, thoughtful, a great listener, and someone who is attentive to other people’s perspectives.	23	2
201510	3570	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	You’ve also been very creative and offered different perspectives that have been very useful for all of us to consider and evaluate.	23	2
201510	3571	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Most noteworthy to me—and this is something the Chair touched on yesterday—is how your thinking has evolved over time.	23	2
201510	3572	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	You’ve responded to new evidence, and you’ve rethought about how the world works, not just in theory, but also in practice.	23	2
201510	3573	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	You have been a great role model for all of us in terms of how to be open minded as we parse this complex work.	23	2
201510	3574	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Narayana, you’re going to be very much missed on this Committee, but we’re quite happy to have you in the Second District.	23	2
201510	3575	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	23	2
201510	3576	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	And I’m looking forward to paying you a visit at the University of Rochester in the near future.	23	2
201510	3577	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Bill.	23	2
201510	3578	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I look forward to your visit.	23	2
201510	3579	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201510	3580	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks.	23	2
201510	3581	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	We’ve had a very rich and full discussion of the issues.	23	2
201510	3582	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I’ve heard widespread support for alternative B for today, but we do have a number of wording issues that I’d like to take up individually and resolve.	23	2
201510	3583	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s start with paragraph 1.	23	2
201510	3584	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	The first issue is the bracketed “slightly.”	23	2
201510	3585	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	In light of the fact that inflation compensation has declined 10 basis points, as I think Thomas told us, to me, it seems reasonable to put in “slightly.”	23	2
201510	3586	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I heard some support for this, but a number of you didn’t weigh in, so let me ask, is there anyone who would have a problem with “slightly”?	23	2
201510	3587	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	23	2
201510	3588	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201510	3589	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Then let’s go with unbracketing “slightly,” which we’ll put in.	23	2
201510	3590	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Second, I did hear a suggestion, and a second of the suggestion, to substantially change the discussion about labor market performance.	23	2
201510	3591	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	But it was a very substantial edit that was proposed.	23	2
201510	3592	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I did not hear broad-based support for it around the table, so I want to give people an opportunity to comment.	23	2
201510	3593	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	If you think it really is appropriate for us to change the wording about the labor market and what we’ve seen in the intermeeting period, would you let me know?	23	2
201510	3594	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	23	2
201510	3595	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201510	3596	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard and President Lacker.	23	2
201510	3597	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I did pick up on it because we crossed out the “labor market continued to improve,” and maybe that would be a signal that we thought the labor market was getting worse.	23	2
201510	3598	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I’m not sure that that’s really what we intend to communicate.	23	2
201510	3599	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I agree that it was a more involved edit than we usually do at this stage, but that’s the part that caught my attention.	23	2
201510	3600	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	A reason for having it was that there were mixed signals.	23	2
201510	3601	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	We do have various labor market conditions indexes.	23	2
201510	3602	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	We did have a good discussion.	23	2
201510	3603	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester raised some important points about that index that we need to take up with the staff.	23	2
201510	3604	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Nevertheless, while I would agree—and I think the staff would probably agree—that the pace of job gains for the past couple of months remained above the level that is needed to produce further gains in the labor market, there were other things that moved in the wrong direction.	23	2
201510	3605	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	For example, the labor force participation rate fell, hours fell, the quits rate moved sideways, and job openings declined, and these things show up with weight in the labor market conditions index.	23	2
201510	3606	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	We do refer to looking at many indicators of the labor market.	23	2
201510	3607	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	That was partly the motivation for the wording we have.	23	2
201510	3608	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	Could I ask a question about this, Madam Chair?	23	2
201510	3609	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Of course.	23	2
201510	3610	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	It sounds relatively benign to point out that we are expecting a step-down in employment growth at some point in a mature recovery, so this is just acknowledging that.	23	2
201510	3611	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	We don’t report in the SEP what payroll employment numbers we expect to see associated with our outlook.	23	2
201510	3612	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	But if, all of a sudden, people think that now it’s likely that the number is actually moving down, wouldn’t that suggest the unemployment path is not going to be going as low as we previously had it?	23	2
201510	3613	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	It doesn’t really sound as benign as just the simple observation that, eventually, we’ll get there.	23	2
201510	3614	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I don’t know if that’s a feeling around the table or not.	23	2
201510	3615	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	That’s why I’ve been puzzled by the discussion.	23	2
201510	3616	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I would agree with what you just said—that it does have implications for the unemployment gap and for policy.	23	2
201510	3617	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Paragraph 1 is supposed to report the facts.	23	2
201510	3618	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	And it did seem to me that the description is not inaccurate.	23	2
201510	3619	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	It is a judgment about “the labor market continued to improve.”	23	2
201510	3620	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Let’s put it this way, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	3621	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s easier to support the statement “the pace of job gains has slowed and the unemployment rate has leveled out” than it is to support the case that “the labor market continued to improve.”	23	2
201510	3622	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that, on balance, it’s a lot easier to support the statement we have than to go back to the other statement.	23	2
201510	3623	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I agree.	23	2
201510	3624	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	My own preference would be to keep it as it is in alternative B.	23	2
201510	3625	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I see two or three people in favor.	23	2
201510	3626	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Are there others who support changing it?	23	2
201510	3627	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	23	2
201510	3628	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201510	3629	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing that it is a minority view, I recommend keeping the wording we have.	23	2
201510	3630	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s go to paragraph 3.	23	2
201510	3631	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	There are a number of decisions to be made here.	23	2
201510	3632	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think the first is whether to include one of the bracketed options pointing explicitly to the December meeting.	23	2
201510	3633	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I did hear some sentiment in favor of getting rid of what’s in the brackets.	23	2
201510	3634	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	But, on the other hand, I heard quite a bit of support around the table for including one of the bracketed phrases on the grounds that, if we want December to be a live meeting, we probably need, in light of market expectations, to signal it but to do so in a soft way that doesn’t indicate we’ve already made a decision.	23	2
201510	3635	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Can I suggest that we first decide whether we want one of the two bracketed languages?	23	2
201510	3636	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	That’s what I’m suggesting.	23	2
201510	3637	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we first decide whether we want some reference to the next meeting.	23	2
201510	3638	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Do we want one of the bracketed options, or some other option?	23	2
201510	3639	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23	2
201510	3640	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Madam Chair, the market newsletters clearly indicate that the market is looking for a clear signal from us that December is on the table.	23	2
201510	3641	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	The market loves to discount our words these days.	23	2
201510	3642	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	If neither of these is in here and we just changed “whether” to “when,”	23	2
201510	3643	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	I would predict that the probability of liftoff in December will go down.	23	2
201510	3644	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	Now, the risk of putting one of these in is that it goes up more than we want.	23	2
201510	3645	2015-10-28	meeting	POWELL	But I think the data will drive the answer, so I strongly encourage keeping one of the two in.	23	2
201510	3646	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Is there anybody else who wants to comment on this?	23	2
201510	3647	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	23	2
201510	3648	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	I share those views.	23	2
201510	3649	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201510	3650	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	23	2
201510	3651	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I agree with everything Governor Powell just said.	23	2
201510	3652	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	But I also agree with the comment that leaving either one of them in, which I’m fine with, makes this much closer to probable in the mind of the outside world than a lot of people around the table would like.	23	2
201510	3653	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m fine with that, and I’m prepared, in terms of what data I’m looking for in the next 45 days, to have maybe a lower bar than others.	23	2
201510	3654	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	But if we leave it in, people need to be prepared that, if there are choppy data, we are saying it’s still probable.	23	2
201510	3655	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m okay with it.	23	2
201510	3656	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m not sure everybody else is, though.	23	2
201510	3657	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I was going to defer to what you were inclined to do, Madam Chair.	23	2
201510	3658	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	But after Jay’s and Rob’s comments, I feel as though I’m being pushed into opposition, and that we’re making the decision now.	23	2
201510	3659	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I would like to say that my own view is what it literally says here— that, at our next meeting, we will make a decision about whether it is appropriate to raise rates, and that that decision has not been made.	23	2
201510	3660	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Now, we’ll come to the “based on incoming data,” but I do not regard this decision as having been made at this meeting.	23	2
201510	3661	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	But I believe this language is intended to place December squarely on the table as a meeting at which we might make this decision.	23	2
201510	3662	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, there is a bias here in favor of moving, in the sense that we wouldn’t include this language unless we thought there was some reasonable chance we would see data that would make us comfortable.	23	2
201510	3663	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	If we thought the odds that we were going to see data that would make us comfortable moving were very low, it would not, to my mind, be advisable to include this.	23	2
201510	3664	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	For example, if the staff forecast bears out, then, in my view, it is appropriate to move.	23	2
201510	3665	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	And if we take that as a modal forecast of what we’re going to see, that’s sufficient justification to have it in there.	23	2
201510	3666	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	But it isn’t decided, and, to my mind, it really does depend on the data.	23	2
201510	3667	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I don’t want, at this point, to get into exactly what number of jobs or other things we need to see, but I think it depends on the data.	23	2
201510	3668	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The argument for having this language in here is the fact that the current probability seems lower than the Committee’s own assessment, so we clearly want to move in the direction of pushing that probability up.	23	2
201510	3669	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The question is, we don’t know how far this is going to do it.	23	2
201510	3670	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	But I would argue that, if the market were to overreact, it would be pretty easy to underline that this is possible, not probable, in public communications.	23	2
201510	3671	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, especially given that I’m going to testify next week.	23	2
201510	3672	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	If we saw an interpretation emerging that this was a done deal and decided, my own inclination would be to push back on that.	23	2
201510	3673	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23	2
201510	3674	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Can this problem be solved through the minutes?	23	2
201510	3675	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Would the minutes summarize the sense of how the voters interpret this?	23	2
201510	3676	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I actually don’t like this “possible” versus “probable.”	23	2
201510	3677	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that is actually separating us.	23	2
201510	3678	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	“Probable” sounds like “highly likely,” and “possible” sounds like “unlikely,” depending on which side you’re on.	23	2
201510	3679	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it’s almost 50–50.	23	2
201510	3680	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m where Governor Powell was.	23	2
201510	3681	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s what I was about to say.	23	2
201510	3682	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	It could be something indicating that we saw that the odds were roughly equal, or some kind of description in the minutes that described it as being the way you said, that we’re trying to get the probability up to a value implying there’s a good chance of something.	23	2
201510	3683	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Is there a way to do that that lessens some of these concerns?	23	2
201510	3684	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Of course there is.	23	2
201510	3685	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	The staff will certainly try to draft something that you’ll have a chance to review that accurately portrays where the Committee stands and what the range of views are.	23	2
201510	3686	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23	2
201510	3687	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Yes.	23	2
201510	3688	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	If the minutes were to state that we saw roughly equal odds, that would be very meaningful.	23	2
201510	3689	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	But I’m not sure I was hearing that around the room.	23	2
201510	3690	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	But if people think that’s something that could comfortably appear in the minutes, I believe that does do what Jay was suggesting, which seems effective.	23	2
201510	3691	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201510	3692	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	With those provisos, my recommendation would be to keep in one of the bracketed options, and then that takes us to which bracketed option to keep in.	23	2
201510	3693	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I heard support for both of the options.	23	2
201510	3694	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’re a little bit divided on that.	23	2
201510	3695	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Either way, both of these options point to December.	23	2
201510	3696	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	“Later this year,”	23	2
201510	3697	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think, can only be our next meeting.	23	2
201510	3698	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I guess a reason to have that language is, it’s language we’ve used—I’ve used it repeatedly—so it’s playing off that.	23	2
201510	3699	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	An advantage, in a way, is that it is a one-shot-only thing.	23	2
201510	3700	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	It has to be removed in December.	23	2
201510	3701	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	My own view is, if we’re not comfortable moving by December and we feel the economy is too weak, then we really have to change our communications substantially.	23	2
201510	3702	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	To me, that’s an advantage, and I heard some of you echo that thought.	23	2
201510	3703	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	“At its next meeting” is also very explicit about December.	23	2
201510	3704	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	It is language that we could keep meeting after meeting, but, frankly, even though we could, I think it’s unlikely that it would be desirable to do so.	23	2
201510	3705	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	If we don’t move in December, we really need to rethink our communications and not keep markets on tenterhooks all the time, thinking that we’re just on the verge of moving.	23	2
201510	3706	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	But I can live with either one of these things.	23	2
201510	3707	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	So let me ask, how many people prefer “later this year”?	23	2
201510	3708	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	23	2
201510	3709	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	How many people prefer “at its next meeting”?	23	2
201510	3710	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	23	2
201510	3711	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Madam Chair, you could always say “at its next meeting later this year.”	23	2
201510	3712	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	[Laughter]	23	2
201510	3713	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I actually see more support for “at its next meeting.”	23	2
201510	3714	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Is there anybody who just can’t live with “at its next meeting”?	23	2
201510	3715	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	They mean the same thing, substantively.	23	2
201510	3716	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	The other question is, who can live with both?	23	2
201510	3717	2015-10-28	meeting	HARKER	Because I would prefer one versus the other, but not strongly.	23	2
201510	3718	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Is there anybody who feels strongly?	23	2
201510	3719	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I could go with whatever your favorite is.	23	2
201510	3720	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m happy to defer to the Chair.	23	2
201510	3721	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	“Later this year” are words we’ve used repeatedly.	23	2
201510	3722	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	But, on the other hand, “at its next meeting” is extremely straightforward and clear.	23	2
201510	3723	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	If “later this year” is December, why not just say “December” or “at its next meeting”?	23	2
201510	3724	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	So I suppose, the more I think about it, “at its next meeting” sounds good.	23	2
201510	3725	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Can people live with “at its next meeting”?	23	2
201510	3726	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	23	2
201510	3727	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201510	3728	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s go with that.	23	2
201510	3729	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Then the final issue is “based on incoming data,” and those are words we could remove.	23	2
201510	3730	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Now, a reason for having them there is, I really think it does hinge on incoming data.	23	2
201510	3731	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	This is a decision that could go either way.	23	2
201510	3732	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	My own view is that I am going to be looking at incoming data very carefully because my own sense is that we have an economy that seems as though it’s growing at a rate pretty close to trend.	23	2
201510	3733	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	For me, I need to think the economy is growing above trend, and I’m going to be looking at data on that.	23	2
201510	3734	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I want to make sure the labor market is improving at a sufficient pace.	23	2
201510	3735	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	That’s crucial to me.	23	2
201510	3736	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	But I also agree we’ve had a lot of problems with data dependence and trying to have the world understand that data have to feed into a view about the medium-term outlook.	23	2
201510	3737	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I realize there is a downside of “based on incoming data.”	23	2
201510	3738	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Even if you were to get rid of it, the new language makes clear that December is on the table, but it hasn’t been decided.	23	2
201510	3739	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I could certainly be supportive of getting rid of “based on incoming data,” but, having heard a number of people say they preferred to get rid of it, I’d like to go around on that again.	23	2
201510	3740	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Does anybody want to speak on the issue of “based on incoming data”?	23	2
201510	3741	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23	2
201510	3742	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, as I said before, we’ve been saying that we’re data dependent, so I just don’t understand why, all of a sudden, we want to drop it.	23	2
201510	3743	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me that we want the market to adjust their probability of their assessment in December based on information that we receive between now and the meeting, and that’s per Governor Powell’s point.	23	2
201510	3744	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	By having it in the statement, you’re basically telling people, “Pay attention to what’s happening to the incoming data in terms of how they inform the economic outlook.”	23	2
201510	3745	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	And it does explicitly say that we’re assessing the outlook.	23	2
201510	3746	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Right.	23	2
201510	3747	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s not the data just for the data’s sake.	23	2
201510	3748	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s the data in terms of how they affect our view of the progress toward our goals.	23	2
201510	3749	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23	2
201510	3750	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Yes, I think the principles discussed by Kocherlakota and Laubach are relevant here.	23	2
201510	3751	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Obviously, it’s true, but if we leave it out, it’s obviously true, too.	23	2
201510	3752	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	We’re selecting what to emphasize here.	23	2
201510	3753	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	To Bullard’s point, we laid out a criterion a year ago in terms of cumulative progress, and this makes it sound as though we’re waiting for the last little smidgen of employment gains.	23	2
201510	3754	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	That tilts me toward leaving it out.	23	2
201510	3755	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	When you say that things are based on cumulative progress, I’m not sure I totally understand that.	23	2
201510	3756	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	That’s part of it, but our outlook regarding where we’re going is very important.	23	2
201510	3757	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	In particular, it’s important to having reasonable confidence in the inflation outlook.	23	2
201510	3758	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I can’t be entirely backward looking when it comes to evaluating that.	23	2
201510	3759	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	And to be forward looking, I need to be revising my outlook based on incoming data.	23	2
201510	3760	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	So I’m not sure I understand.	23	2
201510	3761	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Well, Madam Chair, I think one of the things often said in the wake of September is “moving the goalposts”—that there’s some confusion about what our criterion is.	23	2
201510	3762	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	We said “considerable improvement in labor market conditions.”	23	2
201510	3763	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	We put that phrase down there.	23	2
201510	3764	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	That was our criterion, and that suggests a cumulative quantum of progress.	23	2
201510	3765	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	On net.	23	2
201510	3766	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	We also said “reasonable confidence” about inflation though, too.	23	2
201510	3767	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Right.	23	2
201510	3768	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Yes, we did.	23	2
201510	3769	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	We had both of those.	23	2
201510	3770	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Granted, the way we conduct policy has to do with the outlook and all of those things, but we laid down these more specific tactical criteria for lifting off.	23	2
201510	3771	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, but reasonable progress and reasonable confidence are forward looking.	23	2
201510	3772	2015-10-28	meeting	LACKER	Well, on inflation, but on the labor market side, it was “considerable improvement.”	23	2
201510	3773	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	23	2
201510	3774	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	Madam Chair?	23	2
201510	3775	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23	2
201510	3776	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	John and I were the original progenitors of this idea, and, speaking only for myself, I think it’s a secondary issue.	23	2
201510	3777	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think it’s probably worth, in the end, having a fight about it.	23	2
201510	3778	2015-10-28	meeting	TARULLO	If you’re more comfortable with it, I’m fine with that.	23	2
201510	3779	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	I agree with that as well.	23	2
201510	3780	2015-10-28	meeting	EVANS	If you’re more comfortable with including it, I’m fine with that.	23	2
201510	3781	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201510	3782	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s see.	23	2
201510	3783	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	There are other people.	23	2
201510	3784	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	23	2
201510	3785	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	Yes, I’m sorry—I hate to pile on here.	23	2
201510	3786	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	But, to me—and I’m coming at this as a, for lack of a better word, businessperson or market participant—this data dependence is confusing and sends the wrong signal.	23	2
201510	3787	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	It’s implicit that we’re going to be data dependent, but, by saying it, it suggests that this is more of a short-term decision than I actually think it is.	23	2
201510	3788	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	They understand that we have a long-term narrative, which is a very fundamental view of what’s going on in the economy, and that the data are a part of it.	23	2
201510	3789	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	But, at least to a layman participant, it’s somewhat confusing.	23	2
201510	3790	2015-10-28	meeting	KAPLAN	It suggests it’s much more of a short-term assessment than I actually think is reflected in the way we’re going to go at this.	23	2
201510	3791	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23	2
201510	3792	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I could live with it either way, but the fact that we’re inserting it after so much emphasis on data dependence strikes me as a little gratuitous.	23	2
201510	3793	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	It’s going to generate a whole lot of intricate analysis—“What did they mean by that?”—when we have made this point before.	23	2
201510	3794	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	So, on balance, I favor not including it.	23	2
201510	3795	2015-10-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I can live with it either way.	23	2
201510	3796	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota, did you want to—	23	2
201510	3797	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	No, I do not.	23	2
201510	3798	2015-10-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	23	2
201510	3799	2015-10-28	meeting	ARULLO	That’s the wisest last intervention in the history of the Federal Reserve.	23	2
201510	3800	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23	2
201510	3801	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m going to repeat what Governor Tarullo said.	23	2
201510	3802	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with him.	23	2
201510	3803	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	First of all, you should do on this what you think is best.	23	2
201510	3804	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m not trying to fight the fight, but I am going to react a bit to your interaction with President Lacker.	23	2
201510	3805	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	The fact is, the September statement says that “the Committee will assess progress—both realized and expected—toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.”	23	2
201510	3806	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	That sentence has everything you were asking for.	23	2
201510	3807	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	What this does is, it inserts into that the additional phrase “based on incoming data.”	23	2
201510	3808	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Which is always implicit.	23	2
201510	3809	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Which is always implicit.	23	2
201510	3810	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	You were reacting to President Lacker a little bit like, “Well, we have to make sure we talk about inflation.	23	2
201510	3811	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	We have to make sure we talk about the outlook.”	23	2
201510	3812	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	This sentence has the outlook.	23	2
201510	3813	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	It has inflation.	23	2
201510	3814	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	The sentence has everything you said we should have.	23	2
201510	3815	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	The only question is—and to President Lockhart’s comment—does it help on the margin to add in this extra clause “based on incoming data”?	23	2
201510	3816	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	When I read “assess progress, both realized and expected,” maybe I’m just wedded to this language too much, but I think it captures what Governor Tarullo and I have been talking about a little bit yesterday and today.	23	2
201510	3817	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is the right way to think about monetary policy.	23	2
201510	3818	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I agree with President Kaplan.	23	2
201510	3819	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	It sounds as though there’s something short term that we’re looking for, too.	23	2
201510	3820	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I realize this is your choice, and you should be comfortable with the language.	23	2
201510	3821	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	23	2
201510	3822	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Well, as I said, I’m actually comfortable taking it out.	23	2
201510	3823	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I do understand the point here, and I think it has merit.	23	2
201510	3824	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I am comfortable taking it out.	23	2
201510	3825	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I do recognize that we sometimes focus markets on every little data point, and we want them, of course—as you’ve said, Vice Chairman—to be responsive and to know that we are thinking December is live.	23	2
201510	3826	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	We’re thinking about it.	23	2
201510	3827	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Obviously, we haven’t made a decision.	23	2
201510	3828	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Obviously, it depends on the data.	23	2
201510	3829	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	There’s an open question as to whether we’re going to move.	23	2
201510	3830	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes, I really don’t think this is a big deal.	23	2
201510	3831	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think the markets are going to be way in one place versus another whether we have this in or out.	23	2
201510	3832	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	So I’m happy to defer to your judgment.	23	2
201510	3833	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23	2
201510	3834	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	I want to remind people that the next sentence basically tells us that “this assessment will take into account a wide range of information.”	23	2
201510	3835	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	In some sense, you’ve already said we’re looking at a lot of information here in making the assessment.	23	2
201510	3836	2015-10-28	meeting	MESTER	So I think you could take it out without doing damage.	23	2
201510	3837	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23	2
201510	3838	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	Madam Chair, it’s up to you, of course, but I agree with Presidents Lockhart and Kaplan here.	23	2
201510	3839	2015-10-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think it is a bit confusing, and we already had this language in here.	23	2
201510	3840	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23	2
201510	3841	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I’ll defer to you as well.	23	2
201510	3842	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think the reason that it’s inserted here is as a counterbalance to inserting what seems like calendar-based language.	23	2
201510	3843	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	All it’s doing is reminding people that, although we’re now being very explicit about December, we are also continuing to be data dependent.	23	2
201510	3844	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	That’s why I think it is actually a balancing concept within this sentence even though, in the broader context, people have already been put on notice.	23	2
201510	3845	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	But I would defer to the Chair.	23	2
201510	3846	2015-10-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’re putting you on the spot.	23	2
201510	3847	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	What do you think?	23	2
201510	3848	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I just don’t think it’s that important, frankly.	23	2
201510	3849	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	As people have said, it’s really a question of whether you want to underscore that it’s not about December per se—it’s about the incoming information.	23	2
201510	3850	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	With regard to Governor Brainard’s point, the question is, how much do you want to lean against the time element?	23	2
201510	3851	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s really the fundamental question.	23	2
201510	3852	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	I think there’s more to it.	23	2
201510	3853	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	There is a question of whether we’re giving ourselves another way out, and leaving that impression is not something we want to do.	23	2
201510	3854	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	We’ve got enough to form a complete judgment based on everything that’s in here.	23	2
201510	3855	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	So then the question would be, “Why did they say that?”	23	2
201510	3856	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, I think it is not a done deal.	23	2
201510	3857	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s a close call, and the data will inform the view of whether you’re over the line or not.	23	2
201510	3858	2015-10-28	meeting	FISCHER	But, Vice Chairman Dudley, as President Mester pointed out, following that, there is everything we’re going to look at.	23	2
201510	3859	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	It says it.	23	2
201510	3860	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s fair, that’s fair.	23	2
201510	3861	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	But that’s not new.	23	2
201510	3862	2015-10-28	meeting	BRAINARD	This sentence is new.	23	2
201510	3863	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	All right.	23	2
201510	3864	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	It could go either way.	23	2
201510	3865	2015-10-28	meeting	DUDLEY	So when in doubt, don’t put something new in.	23	2
201510	3866	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I agree.	23	2
201510	3867	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s get rid of it.	23	2
201510	3868	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s get rid of “based on incoming data.”	23	2
201510	3869	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Before we take a vote, if you would permit me a couple of words to wrap up the policy round, I would like to say a few words about communications.	23	2
201510	3870	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	The dealer survey this time contained grades on our communications performance and detailed comments that made for very painful reading.	23	2
201510	3871	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	We all bear responsibility here, myself included.	23	2
201510	3872	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Looking forward, we have seven weeks to go before the December meeting.	23	2
201510	3873	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	And I believe it’s exceptionally important to maintain discipline in our communications.	23	2
201510	3874	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Following up on what President Kocherlakota said earlier, I think our objective should be to try to make clear where we stand as a Committee.	23	2
201510	3875	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	That principle is the very first guideline contained in our policy on external communications— namely, every Committee participant has an obligation to enhance the public’s understanding of monetary policy, including its rationale.	23	2
201510	3876	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think today’s statement means that, although no decision has been made on December, it very well may be appropriate to move at our next meeting if nothing new and unexpected happens to alter the outlook and the incoming data support our expectation that the economy is growing above trend and will continue to do so, with the labor market continuing to improve at an acceptable pace.	23	2
201510	3877	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Our statement indicates to the markets that December is a “live” possibility, but also, importantly, that no decision has been made.	23	2
201510	3878	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I would urge you all to keep an open mind regarding the December decision and not to declare a position publicly before our next meeting.	23	2
201510	3879	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I recognize that there may be some need for me to communicate about incoming information.	23	2
201510	3880	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I mentioned earlier that, during the intermeeting period, I will be giving Congressional testimony twice and a speech.	23	2
201510	3881	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think we also agree that, in spite of the intense focus on the timing of the first move, what matters for financial conditions and the outlook is the entire path of policy.	23	2
201510	3882	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Importantly, based on the discussion we had about r* and in the policy round, we broadly agree that it will probably be appropriate for policy to follow a gradual path.	23	2
201510	3883	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I did hear suggestions that we reconsider what’s now in paragraph 5 if we lift off, and we will work during the intermeeting period to do that.	23	2
201510	3884	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	But I want to remind you that, in a way, we live or die on the basis of these SEP numbers.	23	2
201510	3885	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	That dot plot is probably the most important form of communication we have about our expectations, and, if we move in December, it will play a disproportionate role in signaling to the markets the Committee’s expectations concerning the path of the policy rate.	23	2
201510	3886	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	So, in that regard, I think yesterday’s discussion about r* was very valuable and well timed, and I hope everyone will give a great deal of thought to what they write down in the SEP in December, understanding it is a very important communications device.	23	2
201510	3887	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there, and I’ll ask Brian to read the statement and directive.	23	2
201510	3888	2015-10-28	meeting	MADIGAN	This vote will be on the FOMC statement language in alternative B on pages 7 and 8 of Thomas’s handout, with the inclusion of the word “slightly” in paragraph 1, the inclusion of the phrase “at its next meeting” in paragraph 3, and the deletion of “based on incoming data” in paragraph 3.	23	2
201510	3889	2015-10-28	meeting	MADIGAN	It also covers the directive on page 12 of Thomas’s handout.	23	2
201510	3890	2015-10-28	meeting	MADIGAN	Chair Yellen Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Brainard Yes President Evans Yes Governor Fischer Yes President Lacker No President Lockhart Yes Governor Powell Yes Governor Tarullo Yes President Williams Yes .	23	2
201510	3891	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	1	1
201510	3892	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	That leaves me to mention that the dates of our next meeting are Tuesday and Wednesday, December 15 and 16.	1	1
201510	3893	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Lunch is available, and Linda Robertson is prepared to give a legislative update.	1	1
201510	3894	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest we grab some lunch and then have Linda brief us while we’re eating.	1	1
201510	3895	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	1	1
201510	3896	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s adjourn.	1	1
201510	3897	2015-10-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, everybody.	1	1
