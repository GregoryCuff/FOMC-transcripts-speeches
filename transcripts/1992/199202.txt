199202	34	GREENSPAN	 Without objection. I would now call on Ted Truman to review the three foreign currency instruments and the warehousing agreement. 	41	41	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	35	TRUMAN	" We would recommend that you approve the Foreign Currency Authorization, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the Procedural Instructions as they now stand. With respect to the warehousing authority, as we discussed at earlier meetings of the Committee last year, the warehousing agreement with the Treasury on behalf of the Exchange Stabilization Fund and the Treasury's general fund is subject to annual review. You have received a memorandum from me on this subject. To summarize that memorandum, the amount of DM warehoused has been reduced from a peak of $9 billion in March of 1990 to the current $2 billion. And with the prospect of a further reduction in the near term to zero, it would seem appropriate to us to reduce the size of the arrangement from the current $10 billion to the more historically normal level of $5 billion; that level prevailed from 1978 to 1989. Therefore, I recommended a renewal of that size and Bill McDonough concurs with that recommendation. I would note three points. First, if the Exchange Stabilization Fund repurchases the remaining $2 billion, as we assume and expect it will, its dollar position will be relatively low, so we might have to reverse that later. Secondly, the Treasury has expressed some anxiety that conditions could change such that they might want to warehouse more than $5 billion. In staff conversations with the Treasury, we noted that the size of the arrangement has been increased in the past and we assured them that the Committee is prepared to consider any reasonable request for changes in the future. Lastly, Bill McDonough and I have told the Treasury that once the $2 billion is repurchased, the terms of the arrangement should be adjusted marginally to conform more closely to market practice. In the future, the forward ""leg"" would be at a forward market rate rather than being flat. This seems more sensible. It basically equalizes our interest returns and our foregone earnings. The Treasury staff has agreed in principle to this change and has agreed that it is appropriate to make the change not in the middle of an arrangement but once we've gotten it cleaned away. I'd be pleased to answer any questions. "	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0

199202	37	ANGELL	 I would be happy to move the adoption of the proposals that have been presented by Mr. Truman. And I would like to express appreciation and gratitude that we're back to [an authorized level of] $5 billion and [the amount warehoused] will not be close to that amount. ﻿ 	41	41	0.0	1.0	43.0

199202	47	MCDONOUGH	 The period since your last meeting has seen some significant rate movements in the foreign exchange market. The dollar's decline that began in the summer of 1991 continued through the end of the year and brought the dollar close to its all-time lows. Then, in a sudden reversal, the dollar strengthened in the first weeks of January. As the dollar's upward movement seemed to slow, at the initiative of the United States Treasury the United States and Japanese monetary authorities surprised the market by intervening to sell dollars. That settled the dollar into a new trading range centered around 125 yen and 1.6 DM. The dollar's continued decline in December is relatively straightforward to explain. Around the time you last met, sentiment toward the prospects for a United States recovery were still rather gloomy. Thus, most market participants believed dollar interest rates still had room to fall. In contrast, the prevailing view on Germany was that policy tightening had yet to run its course. Although a further reduction in Japanese interest rates was expected, the timing was thought to be well into the first quarter. The market was surprised by the rapid succession of monetary policy decisions at year end. The Bundesbank raised official interest rates 50 basis points on December 19th, the Federal Reserve lowered the discount rate a full percentage point on December 20th, and the Bank of Japan cut its official rate by 50 basis points on December 30th. In terms of direction, none of these changes came as a surprise. But their timing and magnitude had certainly not been anticipated. The dollar declined from December 18th through the first weeks of January by roughly two and three-quarters percent on a trade-weighted basis, and slightly more than three and a half percent against the mark. Then why did we experience the sudden reversal that occurred at the end of the first full week of trading in January? Most market participants concluded in early January that interest rate differentials had become about as stretched as they were likely to get. They held the view that there was sufficient monetary accommodation in the pipeline for the Federal Reserve to avoid the need for any further reduction in rates. Moreover, the Bundesbank's December rate increase appeared to be its final tightening. In part, this view grew out of early evidence that the German economy was beginning to turn down and the strong, negative reaction of Germany's European neighbors to the Bundesbank's December rate hike. Japan is still considered to have further to go in reducing interest rates. Shifting sentiment on expectations for interest rate differentials alone, however, cannot account for the speed and magnitude of the reversal. These appear largely to be the result of the market's technical condition. By late December, the dollar was well into its sixth month of an uninterrupted downtrend. Market participants of all types had built up substantial oversold positions. Thus, as sentiment shifted on the interest rate outlook, the need to cover short positions accelerated the dollar's rise. The short position of the overall market was demonstrated on the morning of January 8th, when several news services announced that President Bush had ìcollapsedî at a state dinner in Tokyo. Such reports would normally cause a substantial dollar sell-off. But the dollar moved only slightly lower and recovered within about 30 minutes, indicating that market participants were unwilling to extend their existing short positions. In fact, there were two waves of short covering which carried the dollar to its period high on January 16. On January 17, what on the surface appeared to be very good trade figures for November were interpreted gloomily, attributing the better numbers to lower imports caused by a weak economy. The dollar weakened somewhat. Then, at the initiative of the Treasury, the United States and Japan intervened based on Treasury's view that the still significant strength of the dollar was excessive in relation to economic fundamentals. The desk sold $100 million against yen, half for Japan and half shared equally by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. We entered first at 127.20 yen and went as low as 125.40, with the average yen rate at 126.09. There are several reasons why the market was surprised by the intervention. First, the dollar was about steady at the time we entered the market, but had weakened during the morning. Second, the intervention occurred at an unusual time. The operation began in the afternoon of a Friday just preceding a long weekend and, thus, at a time when the market tends to be relatively illiquid. Third, by pure chance, the wire services began carrying a report of a speech Bundesbank President Schlesinger was giving in Toronto, which was bullish for the mark and gave the impression that the U.S.-Japanese intervention was being given verbal support by the Germans and that this must have been all planned in advance. Fourth, the market did not think any official action would take place until after the G-7 meeting. Because of the surprise, market participants searched for a reason. Some saw it as a direct result of the Bush visit to Japan and interpreted the intervention as an effort to counter calls for protectionist measures against Japan. Others believed that it was linked to the Administration's world growth initiative and, perhaps, was designed to demonstrate the dollar's weakness in order to make the idea of a reduction in German interest rates more palatable to the Bundesbank. Most just scratched their heads and decided to worry about the G-7 meeting. The intervention does seem to have had the positive effect of lessening the appetite for large speculative positions going into that meeting and of the continuing uncertainty since, resulting in choppy intra-day trading without a major one-way move. There is a lot of confusion on likely exchange rate developments, which I fully share. The macro situations of the three major countries and interest rate differentials suggest that the present exchange rate ranges could endure for the period until your next meeting. The major uncertainty now comes from capital flows which could be triggered by political concerns about all three major currencies. The weakness of the Miyazawa government causes nervousness about the yen, but concern about President Bush's fiscal proposals and what the Congress may do to increase them creates an overhang for the dollar. Yesterday's wage settlement of a 6.4% increase for German steelworkers is more than German productivity improvement justifies and further dents Germany's reputation for managing itself well. These uncertainties, especially with the speculators not having big positions and therefore having their ammunition fully available is rather menacing because it means that an unanticipated event could move the market a lot more than the event would appear to justify. Careful watching is in order. On another point, I would like to inform the Committee that we have begun discussions with the Bundesbank on the possibility of another exchange of reserve balances. The final leg of last year's DM 10 billion exchange settled in December and, in January, Jerry Corrigan and I proposed a similar transaction to Dr. Tietmeyer for 1992. At the same time, Dr. Tietmeyer is pressing us to agree to a restructuring of both the System's and the United States Treasury's investment facilities to fit our deposits with the Bundesbank better into their asset-liability structure and their domestic monetary operations. We are also discussing moving a portion of our mark holdings from the Bundesbank to the B.I.S. to help reduce the size of the Bundesbank's balance sheet. On each of these three issues, both sides have already agreed in principle that these changes will be made and I hope we will be able to reach consensus on the details before your next meeting. When we do, I will inform the Committee of the proposals. I would also like to inform you that we have now received confirmation of renewal of all of the System's reciprocal swap arrangements. Mr. Chairman, I request the Committee's approval for the Federal Reserve's sale of $25 million against yen on January 17th, our only operation on behalf of the System during the period. This represents the Federal Reserve's half of the $50 million sold by the United States authorities as part of the joint intervention with the Japanese monetary authorities. 	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0

199202	49	SYRON	 I'm just curious about the intervention. I don't have any real problem with it, but could you give us a little more background on what was going on at the time? Were the markets felt to be particularly disorderly? What was happening that precipitated the decision to intervene at that particular point in time, presuming that we don't have a target? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	51.0
199202	50	MCDONOUGH	" The dollar had rallied very strongly and very quickly, as I mentioned, almost certainly basically on short covering. And that strength had continued through Thursday, January 16th. In the morning we had a rather [sloppy] market because of the questioning of how best to interpret the trade figures. At that time the Treasury expressed a very strong view that it was ""appropriate,"" as they put it, to cap the dollar and to adjust it downward somewhat. "	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199202	51	TRUMAN	 One additional point: This had been discussed at least in principle the day before in the context of a strong dollar--the dollar having gone up. The ambiguity came when we had the market that we had on Friday. On our part we felt that since the dollar was backing off. the Treasury probably would no longer be interested [in intervening]. But they turned out to be interested and we had to confront the question of whether to go along; we felt that on balance it was better to go along. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0

199202	63	GREENSPAN	" Let me just take a minute to update you on the G-7 meeting. That meeting obviously comes out of the Tokyo meeting between President Bush and Prime Minister Miazawa in which, as you may recall, there was a communique which specified that they were jointly in agreement on the issue of a ""growth agenda"" without specifying particularly what that concept meant. There was in the context of those discussions a reaching out to the other members of the G-7 to join them in that particular view of the world. And the Treasury decided that a meeting of the G-7 finance ministers and central bank governors would be the ideal vehicle by which that could occur. So the meeting was planned and as the days went on, in endeavoring to create the usual advance communique, it became fairly clear that uniformity of view was not exactly how one would describe the nature of those negotiations. As a consequence of that at the end we all moved up to Garden City. It turned out that while the Treasury, I think, was quite successful in moving its broad philosophy of growth, it nonetheless acquiesced in language which very specifically maintained the long term anti-inflationary posture of the G-7 and the need to continue not to dissipate the gains that have been made against inflation. Discussions on potential intervention really got very little support and, as Bill McDonough indicated, the communique in that regard was relatively noncommittal. We discussed the Soviet--or I should say the former Soviet-- republics and their problems a good deal. The issue of a stabilization fund was raised by It got remarkably little support in the group; that never really proceeded very far. Although I suspect there is considerable latent support within the group to do something when the time is right, nobody at that meeting really held the view that the timing was such as to make it particularly useful. As a consequence, the communique ended up with a [statement in] support of the growth scenario promulgated in Tokyo and a number of individual country reports on their specific policies which struck me very much as national travel agencies describing the goodies of coming to visit. But nothing much else was involved. I think it was a harmonious meeting, certainly compared to the one in Bangkok. It did have a significant element in that there was a very ﻿ clear tilt in the basic philosophy of that group, which I must tell you I would more readily describe as the views of the finance ministers because we central bankers were sitting there on our hands to a large extent. The substance beyond the growth area was mainly in the discussion of the Soviet quota in the IMF; there was considerable discussion of it. It was assumed that a specific conclusion would not be reached except that obviously there [would be] discussions leading up to the Interim Committee meeting. Is that in April, Ted? "	9	95	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	64	TRUMAN	 Late April. 	9	95	0.0	0.0	999.0
199202	65	GREENSPAN	 That meeting would bring that to fruition. There was very strong support for a fairly quick resolution of the Russian federation's application and that of several of the other republics. That was pretty much all that was involved in the meeting. It was not one of the more significant endeavors on the part of the G-7, but certain things were accomplished. Any questions? I'd be glad to entertain them. If not, we'll now move on to the Domestic Desk and Peter Sternlight. 	9	95	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	66	STERNLIGHT	 The System's policy stance was initially held unchanged following the December 17 Committee meeting, but soon afterward--on December 20--an easing move was made in light of the weak performance of the economy, the subsidence of inflationary pressures and slow growth in the broad money measures. This move entailed a full percentage point reduction in the discount rate, to 3 1/2 percent, and a 1/2 point cut in the expected Federal funds rate, to 4 percent, as outlined in a Committee conference call on the morning of the 20th. Associated with the move, the path borrowing allowance was raised by a net $25 million to reflect the re-emergence of a spread in the Fed funds rate over the discount rate, partly offset by a small downward technical adjustment in recognition of lower seasonal borrowing. Later in the period, the borrowing allowance was trimmed back by $25 million in technical recognition of the further shrinkage of the seasonal component. Actual funds rates receded from the 4 1/2 percent area in the opening days of the period to average around 4.20 percent in the weeks surrounding Christmas and year-end, as moderate seasonal pressures were encountered despite sizable Desk reserve injections. The volatility in funds rates around year-end was mild compared with the extraordinary gyrations encountered a year earlier, when we saw rates as high as 100 percent and as low as zero within a matter of days. Once past the first week of the new year, the average funds rate held quite close to the expected 4 percent level, and somewhat below at times when reserves were released in abundance by declines in required reserves and shrinkages in currency in circulation. This past Friday saw some elevated rates, though, as the Treasury balance at the Fed spiked higher and clearing funds were needed in connection with the settlement of new Treasury issues. Borrowing levels were fairly close to path allowances, except for a sharp surge at the end of the January 8 reserve maintenance period. A reserve shortage had been projected on that settlement day, but a soft funds market that morning discouraged us from injecting reserves lest we risk providing a misleading policy signal to the market. Through year-end, and a few days beyond, the Desk faced large needs to add reserves, reflecting the usual seasonal factors such as currency outflows and higher required reserves, but also some unusually high Treasury balances. Since we were looking forward to a substantial over-abundance of reserves shortly after year-end, all of the heavy needs early in the interval were met through repurchase agreements, including both System and customerrelated operations. On a few occasions the Desk entered the market a little earlier than the usual time, partly in view of early market closing schedules and partly to head off potential strains around the year-end date. Fairly soon after year-end, the Desk turned to the task of seasonal reserve absorption. This was accomplished through sales of about $1.6 billion of bills to foreign accounts, and runoffs of another $1.6 billion of bills at weekly auctions. There were also several small run-offs of agency issues scattered through the period, totaling $130 million. In addition, to drain reserves temporarily, the Desk arranged several rounds of matched sale-purchase transactions in the market, including yesterday and today. Last Friday, though, reserves were injected through weekend RPs to cope with that day's temporary shortage. There were two distinct phases to market interest rate changes over the intermeeting period--first a broad downward sweep propelled by weak reports on the economy and especially by the December 20 policy-easing moves, but then an upswing beginning about January 9 or 10 as sentiment shifted on the likelihood of further easing and concern mounted with respect to current and prospective supplies of debt offerings. The net result for the period was mixed. Bills were still down by a net of 20 to 30 basis points--anchored by the lower funds rate and day-to-day financing costs. The commercial bank prime rate, which was cut by a full percentage point to 6 1/2 percent just after the discount rate move, stayed down at that level. Short to intermediate-term Treasury coupon issues rose by a net of some 10 to 20 basis points as increases of 40 to 60 basis points after early January swept aside earlier sharp declines. At the long end, the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond was just about unchanged on balance, beginning and ending a shade over 7 3/4 percent but touching a low just under 7.40 percent earlier in the new year. In the bill area, which saw a moderate net paydown by Treasury of about $4 1/2 billion, the latest 3- and 6-month issues were auctioned at 3.86 and 3.93 percent, respectively, down from 4.14 and 4.19 percent just before the last meeting. At the same time, the Treasury raised about $24 billion in the coupon market. The change in sentiment in early January seemed to have as much to do with psychology as with hard evidence on the economy, although the December employment report on January 10, with its small rise in nonfarm payrolls, appeared to mark something of a critical point in market participants' minds. Some later downbeat reports on retail sales, industrial production, new orders, and consumer sentiment seemed to pack less punch in terms of stirring anticipations of further easing steps. Meantime, concerns increased over the prospects of Federal fiscal stimulus, while the market also coped with heavy corporate borrowing--some $30 billion in the intermeeting period. Statements by Fed officials were seen to be playing down the likelihood for additional near-term easing steps and this, too, weighed on sentiment. It should not be read from these comments that market participants are highly confident of a near-term pick-up in the economy. The current quarter is widely expected to be flat--a small plus or minus. Some see the flat trend extending to midyear but probably more look for a modest pick-up in the second quarter. A large majority anticipate moderate growth in the second half of the year but this view is not held with rock-solid conviction. Many analysts remind themselves that they had anticipated a recovery a year ago that seemed to get off to a decent start but then evaporated. Against that background, a certain amount of scepticism remains regarding the current outlook. Nor has all the anticipation of further monetary policy easing been removed; some observers do anticipate further modest easing steps in coming months, although this view is not held with great conviction, either, and apparently is not priced in to current market levels. A particular focus of market conjecture right now is the Treasury's quarterly financing package to be announced tomorrow afternoon, given all the speculation on whether the Treasury might reduce the size of its long term issues. Market comments suggest that a moderate reduction--perhaps a cut of $2 to $4 billion in what has recently been a $12 billion offering--is anticipated and about priced in. This uncertainty, at least, will be resolved soon. I'd like to add a few words about market reaction to the interagency report on the Government securities market. By and large, reaction has been rather low key. Particular interest has focused on the possibility for the Treasury to reopen scarce issues, with a major question in the minds of market participants as to just what set of conditions might cause the Treasury to act, and in what form they might act. My sense is that there would be appreciable interest in a lending program as distinct from outright reopenings, in order to deal with temporary scarcities in the financing market. There is also considerable interest, but at this point much scepticism, in regard to the Report's proposal for a new type of open or iterative auction. I have yet to hear any degree of enthusiasm for the proposal from market sources but mainly they just want to gain a better understanding as to how it might work. As to the revisions in the administration of the Fed's primary dealer arrangements, the documents are being read with interest. The dropping of our over-all market share requirement is being welcomed by most dealers, though I have also heard concern expressed about whether this might not impinge on the market's liquidity in difficult times. One also hears the comment that trading activity may tend to become more concentrated at a few large dealers. Further, I've heard some concerns expressed about the need to be more careful about one's counterparties given the Fed withdrawal from dealer surveillance--which seems to me a healthy reaction. So far there's no big line-up of potential applicants to be our counterparties. 	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0

199202	77	PRELL	 We shall be referring this afternoon to the packet of charts that has been placed before you. The first of those charts provides a brief summary of the staff forecast. The plot of real GDP in the top panel illustrates several features of the current cycle. Notably, although the decline in activity in late 1990 and early 1991 was not large, neither is the upswing thereafter terribly dynamic. Indeed, the prior peak level of output is not reattained until the third quarter of 1992, an exceptionally prolonged recovery phase. And, of course, net growth over the 1989-1992 period as a whole is remarkably meagre. The box at the right shows that it is not until the second half of this year that we expect growth to move above a 2 percent annual rate. It is at that point that we anticipate that the unemployment rate, in the middle panel, will start to decline. Even at the end of 1993, however, the jobless rate is predicted still to be in the upper 6s. With this slack in the economy, we project inflation, as measured by either the overall CPI or the CPI ex food and energy, will slow appreciably, to less than 3 percent next year. Chart 2 highlights some of the key factors underlying this forecast. The first is our basic monetary policy assumption--namely, that the federal funds rate remains at the current level of 4 percent. Based on that assumption and our analysis of prospective pressures in credit markets, we project that long-term interest rates will fall--with the yield on 30- year Treasuries, for example, moving down to around 7 percent over the next year or so. We also expect that the restraints on economic activity associated with the credit crunch will ease somewhat by 1993, although we certainly don't anticipate a return to the liberal credit supply conditions that prevailed a few years ago. As you know, our baseline Greenbook forecast is founded on the assumption that there will be no significant fiscal stimulus. As we see it, the change in withholding schedules ordered by the President, which we have incorporated, is likely to have only a minor effect. In fact, our tentative assessment is that enactment of the entire Administration budget plan probably would provide substantially less stimulus than the package simulated in the Greenbook, though the nature of a number of the proposals makes analysis difficult. In foreign exchange markets, we anticipate that the dollar will not change appreciably in value. And, finally, we have assumed that things will remain fairly calm in the international oil market, with a modest firming in crude prices over the next few months followed by stability in the area of $18 per barrel for imports. With that brief introduction, I shall turn the floor over to Tom Simpson, who will flesh out some of the financial backdrop of our economic projection. ﻿ 	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
199202	78	SIMPSON	 Over the past year, financial markets generally have responded favorably as the System has eased policy. Despite the recent backup in long-term rates, the rate on the ten-year Treasury note, shown in the top panel of chart 3, is down about a full percentage point since the middle of last year, while the funds rate has fallen 1-3/4 points. And since most rates peaked in March of 1989. the ten-year rate is down about 2-1/4 percentage points. Declines at the shorter end of the coupon sector have been characteristically larger. This can be seen in the panel at the lower left, which shows the ratio of declines in Treasury coupon rates of three, ten, and thirty-year maturities to the change in the three month bill rate during cyclical declines in the bill rate. The dark bar on the left shows the average response over seven previous periods of easing, the green bar the response over the period starting when rates began to decline in March of 1989 to July of last year, and the red bar the response over the period since last July. Over all the maturities shown, the response of long rates over the period since the spring of 1989 has been on a par with or bigger than what is typical, even at the long end. And, since last summer, the response has been uniformly greater. Equity values, as seen in the lower right panel, have risen sharply of late after several months of modest gains. As a result, a good bit of the gap relative to previous periods of economic recovery has been closed. Current share prices stand at historically high levels in relation to both earnings and dividends. The rally in bond and stock markets has prompted a surge in offerings. As shown in the top left panel of your next chart, gross public issuance of corporate bonds jumped to $115 billion last year, a near-record volume, as firms saw conditions ripe for calling high coupon bonds and paying down bank loans and commercial paper. The bulk of volume has remained concentrated in the lower rungs of investment-grade issuers, although the market has again become receptive, on a selective basis, to junk bond issuers. Gross equity offerings, the right panel, soared to a new record last year, and issuance, net of retirements, turned positive for the first time since 1983. Of particular note, shown in the inset, have been the offerings by firms with below investment-grade credit ratings seeking to strengthen balance sheets and improve access to credit markets or lower interest rates by pursuing reverse LBO and other deleveraging strategies. Households, too, have gotten into the act. As shown in the lower left panel, applications for refinancing existing mortgages have skyrocketed in recent months. Those for purchasing homes, the right panel, recently have jumped higher to a pace in line with early last year, consistent with anecdotal reports of a revival of buying interest. Declines in interest rates and brisk activity in capital markets have been showing through to the financial condition of households and businesses. As shown in the top panel of your next chart, nonfinancial corporations have begun to show progress in repairing their balance sheets. The book value of debt to equity has been on a gradual downtrend since 1989. We envision that firms will want to make further progress over the forecast period as the renewed appeal of equity finance encourages more share offerings and limits growth in debt. Meanwhile, mainly owing to the decline in interest rates, the claim of interest payments on corporate cash flow has been in retreat for several quarters and is projected to completely retrace the sharp rise of the late 1980s over this year and next. Moreover, the decline in interest rates has been feeding through to the corporate bottom line. Indeed, as shown in the side panel, lower interest rates are estimated to have reduced net interest payments $12 billion last year, an amount that is expected to accumulate by another $25 billion this year and $9 billion next year. No doubt, thinking along these lines has been built into the outlook of investors and has contributed to the stock market rally. Credit markets, also, have taken a more favorable view of firms' financial condition. As shown in the bottom chart, yield spreads on investment-grade debt, represented by A-rated industrials, have been drifting down for about a year to levels that are quite thin by historical standards, despite heavy supply. Moreover, spreads on junk bonds have retraced all of the bulge of the second half of 1990. The rating agencies, too, seem to be taking a more sanguine view of bond issuers as the number of upgrades edged higher near the end of last year while downgrades fell over the second half, as seen in the box on the right. A shift in financial restructurings, away from LBOs and toward reverse LBOs and other recapitalizations, has been cited by the rating agencies as an important contributor to this development. In contrast, firms lacking access to public credit markets, principally medium-sized and smaller firms, have been facing more stringent credit supply. Firms in this category tend to be quite dependent on banks for credit and, as shown in the upper left panel of your next chart, banks reported that they had progressively tightened underwriting standards for loans to businesses of all sizes over all of 1990 and into the first part of last year. Although it would appear that tightening has largely come to an end, banks' standards at this point would appear to be pretty restrictive. Also over this period, loan terms, shown in the right panel by spreads of business loan rates over the federal funds rate, have tightened appreciably. Moreover, the degree of that tightening probably is understated by the chart, given that many less creditworthy customers have been weeded out and thus the larger spreads that they typically would be paying is not factored into more recent averages. Additionally, banks have reported considerable firming of other terms over this period, such as the cost and size of credit lines. Recent surveys, though, suggest that these terms, too, by and large have stabilized. It is hard to say how much restraints on credit have affected borrowing, and ultimately spending, by smaller and mid-sized firms. However, the unusual and protracted decline in business loans at smaller banks, shown in the center panel on the left, suggests the possibility of a nontrivial impact. This is consistent with information available for manufacturing firms, in the right panel, which indicates that for small and mid-sized firms, loans from banks rose a little in 1990 before turning down last year. Bank loans also fell at larger manufacturing firms in 1991, but at a time when many were funding short-term debt with the proceeds of bond offerings. Other evidence, shown in the bottom panels, is somewhat mixed. Small businesses surveyed by the NFIB in January reported lessened difficulties in getting credit. Through much of last year, this survey had been showing that credit was harder to get, especially by firms in New England, although the overall level of the index never reached the highs in the early 1980s. As shown in the right panel, in the third quarter of last year life insurance companies, an important source of longer-term financing for many below investment-grade firms, reduced further the share of their private placements going to below investment-grade firms. Turning to households, this sector, too, has been making some progress in relieving debt burdens. In the 1980s, as shown in the top panel of your next chart, household sector borrowing surged. By the end of the decade, debt had climbed to more than 90 percent of disposable income, up from two-thirds several years earlier. Over this same period, households built up large amounts of financial assets. In the past two years, growth in both mortgage and consumer debt has weakened considerably, and we envision continued subdued growth this year, before a small pickup next year. Accompanying the rapid rise in household debt in the 1980s was a large increase in the claim of debt service on income, the center panel. As interest rates have been coming down, the debt servicing burden has begun to ease. In part, this owes to scheduled reductions in payments on adjustable-rate mortgages and the acceleration in mortgage refinancing. Of course, interest earnings from financial assets also have been declining, and because the household sector is a net creditor, interest received minus interest paid has been falling. Adverse effects of interest rate declines likely are being felt mainly by those with larger net worth positions, those thought to have lower propensities to spend out of income and to have offsetting gains from asset appreciation. Indeed, using household survey data for 1989, shown in the side panel, a decline in rates actually boosts net interest receipts of the lower wealth group and leaves essentially unchanged the interest income of those with net worth of from $10,000 to $100,000. With mortgage payments coming down further owing to strong refinancing activity and with additional declines in ARM payments in train, we foresee further sizable reductions in debt servicing burdens this year, leaving many households in a more comfortable financial position. In these circumstances, willingness to borrow, or to tap assets, to finance spending should move up from recent lows, shown in the bottom panel. Some factors bearing on credit supply of banks and life insurance companies are presented in chart 8. The upper panel illustrates that the market's assessment of the outlook for banks has improved markedly since late last year, as shares of both money center and regional banks generally have outperformed broader market indexes. Meanwhile, spreads on bank debt, the center-left panel, have narrowed. Banks have begun to respond by issuing more equity and refinancing debt. Better access to capital and funding markets is providing banks with more scope to expand balance sheets. At the same time, investor demand for asset-backed securities and mortgages remains fairly strong, as suggested by the spreads shown in the right panel, continuing to provide banks with the flexibility to retain or sell off such loan originations. In these circumstances, it seems hard to believe that credit supplies will tighten further at banks, and it seems plausible that some loosening of restraints on supplies to businesses could emerge as banks pursue more profitable lending opportunities. Life insurance companies, though, are more likely to display heightened caution. Shares of life insurance companies, the lower panel, have not registered gains of late comparable to those of banks, as there appears to be more uncertainty about potential further losses from commercial real estate exposure. Moreover, their bond portfolios have come under greater regulatory and public scrutiny in the past couple of years. In these circumstances, below investment-grade, and even some marginal investment-grade, firms are likely to continue to encounter difficulties in obtaining longer-term financing from this source. In sum, restraints on credit supply are not seen as impinging on the spending plans of investment-grade firms, as access to open market sources has been and should remain quite ample. Elsewhere, restraints on credit supply are expected to persist, although these should ease gradually as deleveraging proceeds and as banks, feeling a little more comfortable, become more willing lenders. One of the important considerations in our assessment of the very near-term outlook for the economy is the inventory situation. If you pull out your magnifying glass and look at the top panel of chart 9, you'll see that the economy appeared last summer to be following the traditional recovery pattern in which output moves up relative to final sales, as businesses attempt to ensure that they have adequate stocks on hand to meet rising customer demand. Unfortunately, the thrust of final sales proved anemic, and inventory imbalances began to reemerge by the fall. As may be seen in the bottom panels, manufacturers, as a group, succeeded in keeping their stocks lean, but inventory-sales ratios backed up a bit in wholesale and retail trade. Our expectation, indicated by the bar-chart inset in the top panel, is that the current quarter will be one in which nonfarm business inventories will be liquidated at a moderate pace; the resultant swing in inventory investment is sufficient to chop a percentage point off of GDP growth. As that liquidation abates in the second quarter, and accumulation begins in the third quarter, inventory investment makes a small positive contribution to output growth. But what about final demand? The failure of final demand to gather momentum last year was a major element in the shortfall of activity relative to our forecast. I'm almost tempted to preface my ensuing remarks with the admonition that you should stop me if you've heard this one before, because our story is much the same as we told last year. But even if it is, that doesn't mean that it is wrong this time--indeed, we think it has more going for it now, partly because of the financial adjustments that Tom just documented. Chart 10 summarizes the picture in the residential construction sector, which has provided impetus to expansion over the past year and is projected to continue doing so, given our expectations regarding interest rates. As you can see in the top panel, we anticipate that virtually all of the improvement in homebuilding activity will come in the single family sector. The key force initially is the improvement in affordability, gauged in the middle left panel by the ratio of the monthly payment on a new fixed rate mortgage relative to disposable income. Obviously, home purchase decisions also are affected by the perceived attractiveness of a house as an investment, and the signs recently of firmer prices should work to bolster demand from that viewpoint. At the same time, though, we expect that the rise in prices over the next couple of years will be moderate enough not to damage affordability. In any event, the indications are that home sales are picking up nicely from the already improved pace in the fourth quarter evidenced in the data charted at the right. And--as may be seen at the lower left--even at the relatively modest sales pace recorded on average in the fourth quarter, the overhang of unsold new homes looks less burdensome. If sales are up anywhere near as much recently as some anecdotal reports suggest, we may be able to tell by the middle of the year whether there is much to the industry complaint that single family homebuilding is being constrained by a shortage of credit for land acquisition and development. We believe that this is only a minor problem--and one that is likely to diminish as demand strengthens and gives lenders greater confidence. We don't see that confidence materializing any time soon with regard to the multifamily sector, where--as the righthand panel indicates--the overhang of vacant rental units remains exceptionally high. I should perhaps take brief note of the proposed tax credit for first-time homebuyers. Our assessment is that it would boost housing production only moderately this year, with some negative effect on 1993 activity. We believe that the quarter-million augmentation of 1992 starts predicted by the Homebuilders' association is probably vastly overblown; indeed, if their claims about credit and other supply constraints are justified, much of the incremental demand could show up in prices rather than in added building. With or without the tax credit, the continuing recovery in homebuilding and greater housing turnover will help to bolster consumer spending in coming months through the direct employment and income effects and through the associated demand for furnishings and other goods. But, as last year's experience showed, that alone may not be enough to get the ball rolling with any force. As you can see in the top panels of chart 11, we are projecting a gradual acceleration in real consumer outlays over the course of this year. Services are part of the story, but the more dynamic element is expenditures on goods, which we expect to level out this quarter and then post a moderate gain in the second quarter. This pattern is not dissimilar to that observed over the same period last year, but it certainly hasn't been signalled as it was a year ago by a surge in consumer confidence. I would have to say that the current stunningly low level of consumer sentiment is a worry. It is precisely because sentiment appears to be so out of line with major macroeconomic variables that it may be providing some extra information. But it is very short-run information--perhaps no better than contemporaneous with spending. In that context, the tentative signs last month that the indexes may be leveling off are a little encouraging, but I'd certainly feel a lot better about the outlook if there were to be some improvement in sentiment before too long. Setting aside the sentiment indicators, several considerations appear to argue for a step-up in spending in the months ahead. As Tom noted, many households are bearing reduced debt-service burdens now, and the stock market rise has enhanced wealth. Expenditures have been low for some time now not just for motor vehicles and other durable goods, but also for clothing and semi-durable home furnishings; some backlog of desired purchases probably is developing. As the middle panel shows, our forecast for the next two years has consumer spending rising roughly in line with disposable income. Obviously, these two variables can be expected to be highly correlated over time. But it is of interest to note that increases in consumption often have surpassed those in income in the first couple of years of business expansions. This is most easily seen in the bottom panel, which plots the personal saving rate. Notably, our current forecast does not anticipate a downward movement in the saving rate of the sort that occurred in these prior cycles. This might suggest an upside risk to our projection, but that possibility must be weighed against the uncertainty about the degree to which still high debt burdens and the greater sense of insecurity about employment might prompt many consumers to spend very cautiously. Moreover, the saving rate already is low by historical standards. Our expectation is that spending by households for consumer goods and housing will, along with the anticipated inventory swing--and export growth, which Ted will discuss-- provide sufficient momentum to demand to cause businessmen to increase their spending on new equipment. As indicated in the top panels of chart 12, we project a modest increase in equipment spending in the current quarter to be more than offset by a further substantial drop in nonresidential construction. Over coming quarters, equipment spending should gather steam and the drag from the structures side should begin to subside. Overall, the increase in expenditure this year looks very modest relative to the plans reported in the Commerce Department's plant and equipment spending survey--and certainly not at odds with what we learned from the recent canvas by the Reserve Banks. One would like to be able to nail down the near-term outlook statistically by looking at the orders data, but unfortunately those data--plotted in the middle panels--don't provide a clear signal. We interpret the drop in computer orders in December as confirming our view that the fourth quarter surge in spending was in large part related to the delivery of IBM's new mainframe, and the first quarter is likely to be a relatively lackluster one for real investment in computing and office equipment. The recent improvement in orders for other nondefense capital goods (excluding aircraft) shown in the right panel, however, points to a moderate upturn in spending on industrial equipment. As we look beyond the current quarter, our story is one of the classical accelerator effect taking hold as overall output growth is sustained, with capital outlays being concentrated in equipment as opposed to new buildings. As the bottom panel suggests, the trend for nonresidential construction is still decidedly negative; while we believe that the decline will moderate in the next year or so, we don't foresee an upturn before 1994. This probably puts us toward the pessimistic end of the spectrum of forecasters-- and there are some hints of a bottoming out in contracts in recent months. But the magnitude of the upside risk from this sector probably is not large, especially in terms of GDP impact. On the other hand, the upside risk associated with our baseline projection for the federal sector is quite obvious. The top panels of chart 13 lay out our forecast for federal purchases of goods and services. I think this is a fairly solid picture, with an ongoing decline in defense spending outweighing the effects of an ongoing rise in nondefense purchases. Any legislative initiatives enacted are unlikely to alter greatly the path of federal purchases over the next two years. The larger risks with respect to the federal budget probably reside in the tax and transfer programs. As the black bars in the middle panel indicate, the norm in the first year and a half of recent cyclical upturns has been for there to be some discretionary fiscal stimulus. In contrast, in the current cycle the 1990 budget agreement put into place a small amount of restraint, as measured by the staff's measure of fiscal impetus. On our assumption of no change in fiscal policy, that slight restraint would continue through 1993. The President's proposals are so modest in the aggregate that, as best we can judge at this point, their passage would not reverse the situation. But one cannot completely rule out something more substantial, which is why we included the simulation in the Greenbook. One thing is certain: no matter what happens, the budget deficit will remain huge, even on the NIPA basis shown at the right, which removes the distortion from the deposit insurance program. Budget deficits appear likely also to continue afflicting states and localities. The box at the bottom right shows that, despite further tax increases and expenditure restraint, we don't expect the aggregate position of the state and local sector, excluding retirement funds, to reach balance until late next year. As shown at the left, we project that real purchases will fall further this year and then turn up in 1993-- but even that growth will be modest by past standards. Chart 14 addresses the outlook for labor markets. There has been a lot of talk recently about restructuring and fundamental changes in productivity trends, especially in the service producing industries. There clearly is something happening, but I would sound a note of caution. I think that what we have been seeing has more than a little in common with the sort of capitulation on the part of firms that reputedly has marked the ends of business slumps in the past, when the continuing pressures on profits and the failure of sales yet to pick up have prompted firms to throw in the towel and make the painful adjustments they've hoped to avoid. Once the process gets going, the fact that others are doing it undoubtedly provides psychological reinforcement. The burst in write-offs at the end of last year surely reflected a desire on the parts of many firms to get all the bad news behind them, given that 1991 already was a disaster. Moreover, it has been overlooked in many recent accounts that white collar workers have not been totally immune from cost-cutting efforts in the past, and, besides, a lot of the employment cuts announced in recent months have involved assembly line workers in manufacturing firms. The bottom line is that we think it is reasonable to assume that a better underlying trend in productivity performance will be forthcoming--but just a little better, at this point. The 1992-93 pickup in productivity shown in the top panels thus largely reflects the normal cyclical pattern. By the same token, the relatively subdued upturn in employment this year, shown in the middle panels, is more a product of weak aggregate demand growth than it is of a radical change in operations. The lackluster pace of hiring this year explains the further rise projected for the unemployment rate in the near term. As in the past couple of years, that rise is damped by weakness in the labor force participation rate. We think that a mixture of forces has been at work in the atypically large decline in the participation rate since 1989--some of them perhaps of a secular nature. But much of what we've seen probably reflects the normal responses to cyclical variations in labor demand, and once employment opportunities begin to multiply, participation should turn upward, producing a moderate increase in the labor force--indicated in the table at the right. With the balance of changes in labor demand and labor supply holding the unemployment rate high through 1993, we expect that firms will be able to achieve substantial reductions in the pace of their wage and benefit increases--as indicated at the top of chart 15. Controlling medical insurance costs is likely to continue to be difficult, but employers will undoubtedly become increasingly aggressive in their efforts, and they will strive to make employees pick up some of the tab indirectly through smaller wage hikes. Clearly, our forecast implies some pressure on the norms that have conditioned decisions on nominal compensation increases in recent years: increments in wages of less than 3 percent and of well under 4 percent in total compensation sound low by the standards of the past quarter century. This may be why so many other forecasters are less optimistic about the prospects for lower inflation next year. However, we view the forecasted wage pattern as a natural part of the overall disinflation process that experience suggests ought to be sustained through 1993 at the projected levels of economic slack. The middle panel shows that our forecast fits nicely into the pattern of movements in core inflation that have occurred during periods when the unemployment rate has exceeded the so-called NAIRU, as estimated in econometric relations. Finally, our overall inflation forecast anticipates that there will be no shocks arising from the volatile food and energy sectors. Food prices, the lower left panel, are expected to rise moderately, essentially in line with prices elsewhere in the economy. I should note that the risks in this forecast probably are skewed to the upside, however, given the extraordinarily low stocks of grains--especially wheat--at present. A swing in energy prices is the main reason that the overall CPI is projected to rise faster this year than last. Our oil price forecast implies that, after declining substantially on net in 1991, retail energy prices will be rising moderately this year and next. There are always risks of surprises in this sphere--with volatile Middle East politics a continuing wildcard. Our assumption about crude prices is based on the belief that OPEC--that is, Saudi Arabia--will adjust production fairly smoothly in response to rising Kuwaiti output and a resumption of Iraqi exports, and possibly to appreciable shortfalls output in the former Soviet Union. With those international allusions. I should turn the proceedings over to Ted for a look at the external aspects of our projection. ﻿ 	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
199202	79	TRUMAN	 My presentation on the external sector focuses primarily on three aspects of our forecast: the foreign exchange value of the dollar, growth prospects abroad, and cyclical influences on United States external accounts. Chart 16 addresses the first of these issues: the dollar. As is shown by the red line in the top panel, the foreign exchange value of the dollar in terms of other G-10 currencies on a real, or price-adjusted, basis is trading near its lows of recent years, after its ups and downs over the past year. As can be seen by comparing the black line, the dollar's rise and fall over the past year appears to have been loosely associated with changes in the differential between United States and foreign real long-term interest rates. The dollar's movements in nominal terms against the other G-10 currencies on the weighted-average basis tend to be dominated by movements against the DM, since all except two of the ten currencies in our index are now tied directly or indirectly to the DM through actual or shadow participation in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. As is shown in the box on the left of the middle panel, the dollar has depreciated against the DM by 10 percent since last June, and its depreciation against the pound sterling has been almost as large. The box at the right presents recent information on three-month and long-term interest rates in Germany, Japan and the United States, while the charts in the lower panel provide a somewhat longer perspective on the downtrend in interest rates here and, on average, abroad. Our outlook for interest rates abroad is that short rates and, to a much lesser extent, long rates will gradually drift lower as inflation pressures ease in Germany, and slow growth persists in Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan. As Mike has indicated, we are projecting that, over the forecast period, the dollar will remain essentially unchanged on balance in nominal terms at around its recent level, and the same overall stability should prevail in real terms as well. This point forecast is almost certainly wrong, but we feel that the risks are reasonably well balanced. Turning to economic conditions in the major foreign industrial economies, the top panels of the next chart display trends in industrial production on a year-over-year basis. In general, growth in industrial production has been declining or negative. For western Germany, the right panel, we believe that the recent data are broadly consistent with no growth in real GNP in the fourth quarter of last year. By contrast, France is a relative bright spot with a recent modest pick up in industrial production. Inflation has been on a downward trend recently in most of the major industrial countries, with the general slowing of economic activity, declining oil prices, the appreciation of most currencies against the dollar, and the passing of certain temporary factors. As is shown in the middle panels, this has been the case for Canada, Japan and France. However, Germany is an important exception to this pattern; boosted by increases in excise taxes at mid-year, German inflation has moved above the French rate. The recent G-7 meeting articulated a shared consensus that actual and prospective growth in the G-7 countries has slowed. The issue is whether this diagnosis is likely to lead to significant changes in policies in the months to come. On the whole, our judgment is that it will not. To provide some perspective on this issue, the box in the lower panel presents, for the foreign G-7 countries, staff estimates of output gaps, as of the fourth quarter of last year, along with estimates of potential GDP growth rates going forward, and our projections of growth this year. As is shown in the first two lines in the box, we estimate that in Japan and western Germany output at the end of last year was at or above potential. We are projecting that Japanese GDP growth this year will be below potential and below the official Japanese forecast; this will probably lead to further stimulative policy actions in that country as the year progresses. The West German economy is producing at about its potential, and under current policies, growth this year is projected to keep it there. Moreover, Germany's budget deficit remains enlarged, wage pressures are a major concern, money growth has increased, and inflation is relatively high. Consequently, we see little scope for stimulative policy actions in Germany aside from some easing of short-term interest rates when and if inflation pressures subside. This situation for Germany limits the scope for monetary or fiscal stimulus by its major EMS partners, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. With the possible exception of the United Kingdom, where the March pre-election budget is expected to be mildly expansionary, we do not anticipate any significant stimulative policy actions in these countries despite the negative output gaps shown in the chart, and our projection that GDP growth rates this year will be less than potential. In Canada, the estimated output gap is very large, but we do not expect a significant boost from macro-economic policies. Short-term interest rates are likely to continue to decline as long as the Bank of Canada is confident that it can hit its 3-percent inflation target for the year, which we think is likely. The scope for easier fiscal policy in Canada is constrained by continuing large deficits at the federal and provincial level. Indeed, last week the federal government froze hiring and discretionary spending for the balance of the fiscal year ending in March. Chart 18 summarizes our outlook for growth and inflation abroad. As shown by the red bars in the top left panel, we are projecting a moderate acceleration of economic activity for all foreign countries on average over the two halves of 1992 and into 1993. The right panel shows that growth slowed in the G-6 countries in the second half of last year and is projected to pick up as 1992 progresses. Aside from the major industrial countries, growth held up quite well last year as lower oil prices helped some countries and conditions improved somewhat in Latin America, especially Mexico. For these other countries as a group, growth should be sustained this year and rise in 1993, stimulated in part by exports to the industrial countries. The middle panel depicts our outlook for GDP growth in selected G-6 countries. The general pattern is quite similar across countries: following slowing or negative growth last year, we are projecting a moderate pick-up in the first half of this year, followed by somewhat faster growth in the second half and in 1993. The bottom panel presents our forecast for consumer prices in the major industrial countries. Consistent with persistent or emerging output gaps in most G-7 countries, inflation is projected to remain subdued in the near term and drift lower over the forecast period. United States inflation is expected to be roughly in line with the average in the other G-7 countries. One risk to the outlook for economic activity abroad that has received increased attention in recent months, and one that we have tried to take account of in our projection, is the possibility that an overhang of debt, or balance-sheet problems more generally, in some or all of the major foreign industrial economies will lead to a retrenchment, and retard the recovery or expansion of economic activity. The next chart tries to provide some perspective on this possibility. It presents data on ratios of gross debt to GDP for non-financial firms and households in the United States and five other countries. The ratios are indexed to the average for each country from 1970 to 1980. Thus, the chart highlights the level of debt relative to that particular norm in 1985 as well as changes through 1990 -- when the slowdown in economic activity began and available, comprehensive data leave off. Recognizing that these ratios can be affected by institutional changes as well as by changes in the stance of overall macro-economic policies, our cautious interpretation of them is that problems associated with an overhang of debt are likely to be present in Japan and the United Kingdom, the top panels. This is not surprising: The debt problems in the United Kingdom are well known, probably have retarded recovery in that country, but have begun to recede. In Japan, such problems have been long recognized as the other shoe that is yet to drop, following the substantial decline in the stock market. What may be surprising, and also encouraging, is that in Canada, Germany and France these measures suggest a relative absence of problems, at least judging by the data for these three countries -- middle right and bottom panels -- compared with those for the United States -- the middle left panel. As Tom Simpson's detailed dissection of United States balance sheets has amply demonstrated, no single set of data on debt and financial problems is likely to be definitive. On balance, however, our judgment at this point is that problems associated with an overhang of debt and inflated asset values represent only a limited risk to our overall projection of economic activity abroad and to the demand for United States exports. The top left panel of chart 20 presents our outlook for real nonagricultural exports. With a relatively low dollar, only small increases in prices of United States exports, and a pick-up of economic activity abroad, we are projecting that United States nonagricultural exports will expand at an average annual rate of 8 to 9 percent over the next two years. One to two percentage points of that growth is expected to be due to computer exports. A larger contribution is expected to come from the capital goods sector as a whole, reflecting a recovery in investment demand as economic activity picks up abroad. The growth rate of real non-oil imports -- the right panel -- is projected to be considerably slower -- averaging in the 5 to 6 percent range -- largely because of relatively low United States growth and our improved price competitiveness. The bottom panel summarizes our outlook for the United States external accounts. The first line shows that, on an annual basis, our underlying current account balance (that is, abstracting from the influence of Desert Shield and Storm) was cut in half last year, is projected to record a further improvement this year, and less of an improvement next year. Trade in goods -- line 2 -- contributed importantly to the current account improvement last year, but helps little on balance this year and next. On the other hand, trade in services (line 3) continues to make a growing positive contribution to the current account balance. With lower dollar interest rates and a recovery of profits on investments abroad as well as in the United States, investment income -- line 4 -- is expected to improve this year and next. The last line shows that real GDP net exports of goods and services are projected not to change much over the forecast period, and therefore to provide little net contribution to the expansion of real GDP in 1992 and 1993. Although the projected increase in nonagricultural exports is larger than that in nonoil imports, the expected rise in oil imports largely offsets the difference. Oil imports increase as the growth of consumption picks up and domestic production declines. Nevertheless, exports provide an important boost to domestic income and production, and it is encouraging that the continuation of their rapid growth is sufficient to keep our overall external accounts headed in a positive direction. The final international chart provides a longer-term perspective on the evolution of our external balance and the influence of cyclical factors on it. The top panel shows how, on a full-employment basis, the United States external balance moved with the federal budget deficit from 1981 to 1987. Over the past four years, the budget deficit (the black line) has stabilized at about three percent of GDP. Over the same period, the external balance (the red line) has narrowed, and with it our net access to foreign savings. I would submit that, on the margin, these developments have contributed to upward pressure on United States long-term interest rates. Moreover, as shown in the chart, this trend is projected to continue. The middle panel presents staff estimates of the evolution of the gap between actual and potential output since 1981 and over the projection period for the United States (the red line) and a U.S.-export-weighted average of the foreign G-7 countries (the black line). At the end of last year, the shortfall of U. S. output relative to potential was a bit larger than for the foreign G-7 countries, but the United States output gap is projected to narrow somewhat more rapidly over the forecast period. The bottom panel compares the actual and projected external balance (the black line) with an estimate of the cyclically adjusted balance (the red line). The latter measure assumes output is at potential abroad as well as in the United States. By 1993, on this hypothetical, cyclically adjusted basis, the external deficit would be essentially eliminated. On that, perhaps, surprising note, Mr. Chairman, I'll pass the baton back to Mike. As a reward for your patient attention to our lengthy presentation, I shall conclude briefly. Chart 22 provides a summary of the forecasts you submitted for use in the Humphrey- Hawkins report. I must apologize for failing to incorporate a revision: The range for the unemployment rate should read 6- 3/4 to 7-1/4 percent, not 6-1/2 to 7-1/4. The central tendency ranges I've defined encompass the Administration's numbers--at least for their forecast that incorporates the President's budget proposals. The Budget document also presents a socalled ìbusiness as usualî projection built on the assumption that those proposals are not adopted, and it shows real GDP growth of only 1.6 percent this year--around the low end of your full range of forecasts and below the staff's forecast, which, as I've noted, doesn't include a fiscal stimulus. Obviously, one question that may arise about the projections that are included in the Board's report to the Congress will be what fiscal assumptions are embedded in your numbers. ﻿ 	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
199202	80	GREENSPAN	 That report was pretty impressive, gentlemen. Questions for any of them? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199202	81	PARRY	 One of the characteristics of the forecast is that the interest sensitivity of real spending is different than I think traditional elasticities are. Could you indicate how much of a difference there is and whether you assume that the historical difference between those elasticities has disappeared over the period? It seems to be a big factor in the forecast, for example in components such as commercial office space. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
199202	82	PRELL	 Well, that very clearly is a deviation from past norms of cyclical behavior, and I think it does reflect an unusually low degree of interest sensitivity. Basically, we think that process has been short-circuited by the buildup of so huge a stock of unoccupied buildings. Traditionally there has been a modest but significant contribution from nonresidential construction in the first couple of years of business upturns. Outside of that area, there are indications--and we've tried to gauge this econometrically--that housing may be less interest sensitive than it once was. It's a little hard to disentangle historically because of the disintermediation or reintermediation with segmented mortgage markets that produced a credit rationing effect that outweighed whatever interest rates effects there were. So, one has to disentangle that. There is also more reliance than in the past on adjustable rate mortgages, which scarcely existed earlier; and that conceivably may affect interest sensitivity. So, we may not have as great an interest sensitivity in the housing sector as one might expect. But, indeed, our models have been surprised at the weakness of residential construction. And that may be partly a matter of gauging the perceived real cost of home buying. It is quite conceivable that in the past year or so people have perceived the prospect of capital loss as being much greater than any trend in prices over recent years , which is the normal effect that the models capture. I think those are the major areas. It's possible, too, that inventories don't have a greater interest sensitivity than we have built into this. And in the consumer durables area, we're torn between a couple of considerations: (1) the interest sensitivity probably isn't all that high to begin with; and (2) the movements of consumer loan rates haven't been enormous, but on an after tax basis they have moved somewhat perversely in recent years. On the other hand, somebody looking at the option of whether to invest in a consumer durable with the expectation of a return of flow of services versus the 3 or 4 percent rate earned on a deposit might feel that isn't a bad deal and might be stimulated to spend a little more than otherwise. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199202	83	PARRY	 On the issue of elasticities, my recollection is that the growth of imports is a little slower than one normally would expect, particularly in 1993. Is that correct that the income elasticities have been lower? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
199202	84	TRUMAN	 Yes, the models will give you a higher income elasticity. However, a statistical test in which we essentially re- estimated the elasticities suggested that those elasticities have come down over time pretty much like the [actual behavior] and are closer to an elasticity of one on both the export and import sides. Therefore, we have in the forecast a relatively modest pickup in the real [import] component. ﻿ 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199202	85	PARRY	 That's an interesting development. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
199202	86	TRUMAN	 In general imports have been performing throughout the last several years at a lower level than we had anticipated. And those two things together plus the other factor, which [has been] important for a number of years, led us to put in a small adjustment [unintelligible] . 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199202	87	PARRY	 Thank you. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
199202	88	KEEHN	 Mike, a curiosity question on productivity as depicted in Chart 14: Am I right that overall productivity includes manufacturing and services? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	35.0
199202	89	PRELL	 Yes. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199202	90	KEEHN	 The question relates to my impression that on the manufacturing side productivity seems to have been pretty good over the [past] few years and, therefore, in an inflationary sense it has been a constructive thing. Am I right about that? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	35.0
199202	91	PRELL	 Yes. indeed. In the 1980s there was a distinct improvement in productivity performance in manufacturing. The residual has not shown that kind of improvement, and basically our expectation is that we will continue to see manufacturing do well in terms of gains in output per hour and that probably we will see the remainder of the economy improve its performance somewhat. I would caution, however, that it's not so clear that the developments we've been seeing recently--the restructuring-- constitute a vastly different kind of event than we have seen in other cycles. So at this point I think one should be cautious in anticipating a really radical shift in productivity gains. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199202	92	SYRON	 A question for Tom Simpson: In your discussion, you talked about the balance sheet restructurings of both households and corporations. This is not a well-defined question, but do we have some notion even in a generalized sense of how much more desire there might be to do that? I'm trying to get to how much intermediated versus nonintermediated funds are going to the open market in this area with some vague presumption of conditions in the market remaining about as they are now. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	51.0
199202	93	SIMPSON	" Well, it's really hard to pinpoint. In dealing with the corporate sector, we certainly hear a lot of stories about firms wanting to strengthen their balance sheets. And the announcements of reverse LBOs and so forth suggest that there still is more room to go in that area. What is going to constitute the new norm once all this adjustment occurs is an open question. Personally, I'm not so sure they will go back to the leveraging ratios of the late ""70s or early '80s. The household sector is even a little more difficult to evaluate. We do hear a lot of stories about individuals straining under the weight of their debt burdens and holding the line and restraining themselves. But there again, I'm just not sure-- "	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199202	94	KOHN	 In terms of intermediation and [unintelligible] depositories, which is part of what I thought you were getting at, we have this securitization process for mortgages, which has been underway for a while but has certainly gotten going on consumer debts. ﻿ So, the relative contribution of depository institutions to the whole credit flow has been depressed by their own choice through this securitization process. Other intermediaries are taking it. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199202	95	SYRON	 I was also trying to get at some of the cyclical aspects of it in the short and intermediate run, which I think Tom has answered as well, so-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	51.0
199202	96	PRELL	 Mr. Chairman, we've just received auto sales data. For those of you who want to be brought up to the very minute, there was some improvement in the last 10 days of January. On our seasonal adjustment factors auto sales were 6-1/4 million at an annual rate with almost 4 million in sales of light trucks. So we ended the month at 5.9 million autos sold and 3.6 million trucks sold; that's a little better picture than we saw in the first 20 days of January. The cars were close to the December rate; trucks were off a bit; you will recall that the year-end incentives distorted it. So, I think we're on a steady-as-you-go [course] in the motor vehicle market. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199202	97	HOENIG	 Mike, I want to ask something relating to the single-family residential area because it's an important part of the projections as we come into 1992. Given the comments on restructuring of debt that have been made and some of the demographics, can you explain to me again why we're going to have such a strong residential recovery even without the fiscal stimulus which, if I understand it, was not part of this projection? [Your forecast] seems very optimistic to me. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	56.0
199202	98	PRELL	 Well, it's very difficult to get a precise fix on underlying longer-run trends. We know something about the demographic situation. It's certainly clear that the relevant population is growing more slowly than it was several years ago. It's also clear that if past patterns hold, that would favor single-family relative to multifamily construction because people are passing into years where home ownership rates typically rise very markedly. We think we have been below the longer-run trend recently and that we're going to move up relative to that trend--conceivably to around trend or a bit above it--in response to what is much enhanced affordability. We've had a very distinct improvement for people who want to buy houses, and the signs are that there is some response already in train here. We've raised our forecast since the last meeting despite no change, really, in our mortgage rate assumptions. It just appeared to us that people have been responding more than we had anticipated previously and that with perhaps a small degree of optimism we could carry that through the forecast period. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199202	99	GREENSPAN	 Tom. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199202	100	MELZER	 Ted, I don't know quite what to make of this, but it seems as if your projection of consumer prices in the G-7 countries represents an extraordinary convergence of inflation rates and even of real output. Am I right in making that observation? And if so, what do you think the implications of that are for exchange rates and so forth? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	42.0
199202	101	TRUMAN	" Well, I think you're right in making that inference; there probably is some degree to which we have a natural convergence of these things at least on the inflation side. After we ﻿ put all this together, we noticed that several of the 1992 numbers on that chart are at 3.0 percent. I think that reflected a reluctance to put ""2"" [as the first] number. On the growth side, it seems to me that there is a convergence, but the movement is from different directions. Germany and Japan essentially are moving down and the weaker economies are moving up [in their respective growth rates] . In some sense that reflects the fact that a period in which we've had quite a lot of divergence in the experience and the needs of the different G-7 countries is coming to an end, though we end up with a forecast in which certainly for the United Kingdom and Canada growth still remains pretty weak relative to potential. As far as the exchange rates are concerned, to the extent that we do have both this convergence on the inflation side and less divergence in terms of certain short-run macroeconomic policy needs, it would seem to me that we're likely to have less shocks, if you want to put it that way, coming from abrupt shifts in policy over this period. I suppose the one set of question marks associated with this is that we're in a period, taking the two-year period as a whole, in which we have not only here but abroad--in Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Japan--a lot of elections. If you put that all together, we could have some political shocks. In the case of the United Kingdom, I don't think we will see a fundamentally different policy even if the Tories should lose because Labor is as committed to staying in the ERM as the conservatives are and that is going to constrain monetary policy. Plus they think things are so bad that they would undertake once and for all to make exchange rate adjustments. It's uncertain what that may mean in terms of macro policy. And on the fiscal side they may move from a situation in which they have quite a lot of room to maneuver to one in which they really don't have that much anymore; but they're pretty much boxed in, even if there is a change in governments. "	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199202	102	GREENSPAN	 Further questions? If not, let me mention Mike Prell's insistence that any changes in your forecasts arrive by the end of this week. Who would like to start the tour de table? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199202	103	PARRY	 I'd be happy to, Mr. Chairman. Economic weakness persists in the Twelfth District economy, unfortunately led by a worsening California economy. California continues to report declining employment in nearly all sectors. Weakness is most pronounced in construction and also in manufacturing. In 1991 construction employment fell in excess of 7 percent, and we actually had accelerating declines in the fourth quarter. Manufacturing showed a similar pattern, with employment declines of about 4.4 percent in 1991. I also have to point out that additional defense cuts are expected in 1992. Retail trade activity is also off sharply. Searching for a positive sign in the California economy, I was able to come up with one, and that is in real estate activity, at least residential, where median house prices actually have not fallen and resale activity has risen in several major markets. Even in Los Angeles, looking at year-over-year comparisons for single-family houses, the prices seem to be very similar to what they were a year ago. Throughout the rest of the District conditions are clearly mixed. Two of the largest of the remaining states, Arizona and Washington, are showing weakness. The state of Washington, which has had quite a few years of uninterrupted prosperity, actually showed a loss of employment in 1991 . And Arizona has shown considerable ﻿ weakness in the last four months. Other states --Alaska, Hawaii, and Oregon--are relatively sluggish. The only two states in our District that have shown strong growth are Idaho and Utah; of course, both of them are quite small in terms of the number of residents. Turning to the national outlook, we expect the economy to expand only slightly in the current quarter, which would mean we might see some further declines in the near term. In the quarters to follow, growth is expected to rise at around a 3 percent rate. Our major sources of strength come from inventories in the interest- sensitive sectors of the economy, although we would certainly subscribe to the Greenbook's expectations with regard to reduced interest sensitivity in most sectors. I do feel, however, that there is a rather large band of uncertainty encompassing both sides of this forecast. Nevertheless, the outlook for inflation continues to be encouraging. And consistent with a downward trend in underlying inflation, we expect to see a reduction in most major inflation measures this year compared to 1991. Thank you. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
199202	104	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199202	105	KEEHN	" Mr. Chairman, our forecast is quite close to the staff forecast for 1992. Indeed, we probably are closer now than we have been in a while. Our outlook for both inflation and unemployment is just a little lower, but the differences aren't really worth talking about. With regard to the District, in the period since the last meeting of the Committee, I think the District economy really has weakened. This seemed particularly true as we approached and then went through the year-end period. In some respects, I think the District just caught up with the conditions that were prevalent around the country. The employment situation is perhaps the most evident indicator of that. Total payroll employment in the District declined in December, and the District unemployment rate went up to 7-1/2 percent; that's the highest level we've had since May of 1986. Illinois really did stand out in that; its unemployment rate went up to 9.3 percent and that got a lot of attention. There are some special factors behind that; nonetheless, it was a very, very significant increase in the level of unemployment in Illinois. And that puts us, I believe, at the top of the industrial states. Announcements of employment reductions, closings, early retirement programs, and the like, are continuing at what seems to me to be a very disturbing rate. Since the year-end, I've been trying to look around pretty hard for better news and I have to admit it is a bit scarce. I will say that there are some categories in which there are signs, if not of improvement, at least of stabilization. The steel business is perhaps in that category. One large manufacturer in our area is clearly operating at a 72 to 73 percent rate, but its current order rate is a little higher, coming in at about 75 percent. So, that should mean their total production will go up a bit. And the forecast for shipments this year is a little higher than was the case last year. In the steel industry, though, the pricing is stable, which from their point of view means that it is just terrible. Their prices currently are generally at about the level that they were in 1980-81 on a nominal basis. On an inflation-adjusted basis that means they're about 30 percent under that level. The outlook for heavy trucks also is just a bit better; sales are expected to be some 5 to 6 ﻿ percent higher this year compared to last year. But I will say that that improvement is very much a forecast for the second half of the year; there's an awful lot of focus in the District on the second half versus the first half. Machine tool orders increased in December; that was particularly true for metal cutting tools, which should mean that those industries will be producing at higher levels. Also, I think there's something of a brighter note on the retail front. One specialty retailer I talked to said that in the early part of January their sales around the country were up some 14 to 18 percent. Another very major retailer in the area said they had a good January; their sales for the full month were 17 percent over last year. On a cautionary note, though, last January sales were very badly affected, of course, by the so-called CNN factor. And all the retailers say that discounting continues to be just very, very tough. In the automotive business, though, as Mike has said, the last 10 days were a little better. Still, for January as a whole those sales came in a bit lower than the earlier forecast. I think that means that the first-quarter production schedules are at further risk. But one manufacturer that I talked to said that they had seen some improvement in the order rate from dealers, which is something I've been looking at pretty carefully. And, indeed, last week they had a very significant increase in the order rate from their dealers. They're not quite sure why. If that is maintained, then their production schedules in the first quarter might be okay. In the agricultural sector, the equipment business has hit a rough spot. One major manufacturer has had a decline in sales of major implements of some 24 percent over the last couple of months. There's a comparison issue there, but they still are down very significantly; the reason is supposedly that the farmers are looking at the ITC and are going to hold off until that gets clarified. I do think that for many of the businesses in our District, this ITC uncertainty is going to be something of wild card. In an overall context, while I can't find people whose attitudes are particularly positive, nonetheless some of the very heavy depression that was rather pervasive when we last met has passed, and I do think our policy change in December had an important effect on that. On the pricing front, the outlook continues to be positive. The competitive conditions speak for themselves: Price increases just don't stick; and wage increases, particularly in manufacturing, are modest and can be dealt with through productivity improvements. Therefore, I think the staff forecast on inflation is very realistic. Also, I think the restraint on credit extensions by banks is beginning to stabilize. As nonperforming loan problems begin to unwind here and capital ratios continue to improve, lending attitudes are getting just a bit more expansive. It hasn't shown up in the numbers yet, but my sense is that the lending officers are being encouraged to go out and find good loans, and I certainly would want to emphasize the ""good"" in that comment. Net, I think the risks continue to be on the down side in terms of overall economic activity, but I do think, though it's hard to give you statistical evidence of it, that there has been at least a mini-improvement on balance from the last meeting.

199202	108	KEEHN	 It has not; it has gotten worse. Caterpillar, of course, built up very large inventories going into the strike.

199202	114	FORRESTAL	 Mr. Chairman, activity in the Atlanta District has softened since the last time we met, but I'm happy to say that there seems to have been quite a turnaround in expectations. Most of the contacts we've talked to expect an upturn, although a modest one, in the spring. On the manufacturing side, even though activity slowed in the last few months of 1991, a large number of firms that we surveyed recently indicated that they expect an increase in production and shipments as well as in orders over the next six months. We've had informal contacts with retailers, and they're suggesting a similar outlook. Retail sales were somewhat better in January; that [improvement] was concentrated in nondurables. Retailers continue to be very cautious about their inventory levels. One bright spot in the District that was picked up for the nation in Mike Prell's report is the sale of single-family homes. This has been true across the District generally and is concentrated in the lower to the mid-price range. And that obviously has implications for durable sales, which I mentioned. Another positive factor in the Atlanta District has been a rise in convention bookings as well as in the number of visitors and tourism. Foreign tourism in particular is expected to benefit from the weak dollar. The agricultural sector is generally favorable, but the situation is really quite different for the energy sector. In December, for example, Louisiana operated 40 percent fewer rigs than a year earlier. The number for the country as a whole is 30 percent less. This i.s giving rise to continuing layoffs in the District in that industry. Banking contacts are reporting very weak loan demand, as was suggested a few minutes ago. Loan officers are out there looking for good credits; the problem is that they're not finding very many good credits. The banks also are reporting that they're not changing their underwriting standards at all, and some of them are ﻿ reporting that there has been really no change in the regulatory pressure that they had seen earlier on. So, in general, while things have softened, the attitudinal situation is considerably better than it was six or eight weeks ago. With respect to the national outlook, we're reasonably close to the Greenbook in terms of the GDP forecast. Although we see a little more strength in the first half of '92 and somewhat less growth as time goes on, the GDP forecasts pretty much converge. Our outlook for inflation is somewhat less optimistic. We may indeed get the good results that the staff is forecasting in the Greenbook, but I think the risk on inflation is on the up side. My hunch is, although our forecast and the staff forecast are based on no fiscal change, that we're going to get fiscal stimulus probably above what the President has suggested. And that suggests to me that the GDP forecasts are probably on the low side; if we get that fiscal stimulus, the economy will probably do better. Having said that, I do think our decision today should be based on our assessment of what the situation is going to be ex fiscal policy. Thank you. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	39.0
199202	115	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199202	116	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, I don't have much to add to this very excellent presentation the staff gave us and the fine coverage in the Greenbook. Our projections really are not significantly different. We do expect a little more real growth and a little greater slowing in the rate of inflation. But the broad profile is pretty much the same, with some pickup in the rate of increase of the recovery in the second quarter--but only to a very moderate rate in comparison with what has happened in past recoveries --and continued deceleration in core inflation, even though we are projecting that the overall CPI will come in a tad higher this year than it did last year. Insofar as the risks of error are concerned, I guess a carefully reasoned analysis would say that they are about equal on both sides. Certainly, there are some downside risks: the heavy overhang of commercial real estate; the corporate restructuring; the balance sheet adjustments that are taking place; the restraint on credit. Also, all these temporary dislocations that have taken place as a result of declining rates of inflation could produce another year of lower-than- expected growth. But on the other side of that, I think the substantial further easing in monetary policy we engineered in November-December could easily produce a more rapid recovery than we are expecting here, particularly if a fiscal package is enacted early in the year or relatively early in the year. For what it's worth, my instinct is that the upside risk is probably a little greater than the downside risk mainly because of the actions that we took in the fourth quarter. We engineered a very significant easing in policy; it has not at this point had a very positive effect upon the economy; the stock market really seems to think [it will] over the next several quarters. Moreover, we're seeing a decided change in the comments that we hear from our contacts around the District. There is not much hard evidence yet that things really have improved, but the outlook for the next six months or so is decidedly better than it has been over the several times we've made contacts; it's quite a shift away from what we heard [unintelligible]. It always seems to me that the pessimism is the greatest right at the bottom of a recession. So, since it ﻿ looks a little better now than it did a while back, I hope that means that we're beginning to come out of this a little faster than most people seem to think. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
199202	117	GREENSPAN	 It could also mean we're not at the bottom of the recession! 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199202	118	BLACK	 I hope it doesn't get any worse than it is now. It would really be bad. It's the worst I've ever seen since the '30s and I don't know very much about that. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
199202	119	GREENSPAN	 First Vice President Hendricks. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199202	120	HENDRICKS	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. At a January 24 meeting of the Fourth District round table, economists agreed that the economy will be flat again this quarter but will improve throughout the remainder of 1992. Similar to the staff forecast, the group of economists expects 6 percent growth in nominal GDP over the next four quarters, and that's about evenly divided between output and prices. They pointed out that structural changes in the economy, such as corrections in overcapacity in retail and banking and long-term adjustments in the automobile and computer industries, are restraining the recovery. With respect to our projections, they are very close to those included in the Greenbook. Currently, activity in the District is mixed and has perhaps lost a little ground in terms of the momentum it enjoyed in recent months. Nonfarm payroll employment fell in January after three successive monthly increases. Our unemployment rate rose 1 point to 6.6 percent but is still, of course, below the national average. Construction contracts, retail sales, and manufacturing production all outperformed the nation through late 1991. Auto production remains weaker than expected, although the auto economists who participated in the round table still believe that production this year will be at least 10 percent higher than last year. [They base that assessment] on the strength of sales and inventories that they feel are a little better than they originally had expected. Auto suppliers note that orders softened late last year, but Goodyear has just announced a recall of 300 workers because of good demand for replacement tires. Steel operating rates at nearly 80 percent of capacity are expected to ease a little this quarter in the view of those economists because of the recent let-up in orders. The signals from capital goods producers are also mixed. Those sensitive to auto and truck production note easing in orders, but the industrial machinery and equipment producers report that orders are either flat or, in the case of machine tools, rising. The capital spending outlook for 1992 is also mixed. More durable goods producers plan either the same or higher levels of spending than those who plan cutbacks, but petroleum producers, retailers, and real estate developers will cut spending. Although the commercial real estate markets in the Fourth District are not as soft as in some other areas of the country, developers of shopping centers and office buildings are concerned about too much capacity. Inadequate financing and cash flow have put several projects on hold in Ohio, New York, and California. It appears to us that we are perhaps at the threshold of an expanding economy. Of course, we thought that was the case last summer. We are encouraged by the absence of price pressures and by ﻿ the modest 2 percent increase in the price deflator again last quarter. And we expect continued moderate inflation in the months ahead. That concludes my report. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	55.0
199202	121	GREENSPAN	 Thank you. President Syron. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199202	122	SYRON	" Thank you. Mr. Chairman. In the First District we had thought that the economy was on the verge of rebounding but now it seems perhaps to be stalling a little again. The sector where that's coming from is the manufacturing sector. A significant amount of that has to do with defense, and it's probably a long-term structural adjustment. Defense is an extraordinarily important industry in Connecticut; on a per capita basis it dwarfs even California. So, everyone wants peace to break out as it affects someone else's factory; but we know we're going to have a lot of cuts there and it's causing a fair amount of uncertainty for the District. Also, the people who produce the capital spending more generally are finding that their customers are concerned. With respect to manufacturing in softer goods, several discount retailers have told us they've had calls from producers saying: ""Can you take things from us now because we're starting to be concerned about cash pressures and our inventories are building a little more than we'd like?"" For the retail sector, the post - Christmas period has been a little better than expected, as was the Christmas period. So, that is relatively good news. In the banking sector, loan demand for ""acceptable"" loans is still weak. Several banks have indicated that they are going to be more cautious as a result of the recent legislation in terms of prompt progressive intervention and capital standards. We are seeing the beginning of some improvement in nonperforming loans; the level of nonperforming loans has actually dropped slightly at the margin. And that is consistent with what has been talked about in other Districts. We have seen some pickup in residential construction in single-family homes even in New England; I'm not quite sure who is going to buy them, but I'm told that they are all contracted for before the [shovel] goes in the ground. Again, I'm not sure what the reason is, but the mood is generally improved somewhat as well. I think part of it has to do with our December cut [in rates]; it is being seen as a watershed event to some extent. But people are saying: ""Well, it has to get better, and we expect it will get better in the spring."" As far as the nation goes, our own forecast would be quite similar to the Greenbook forecast, though I must confess not necessarily on the same policy assumption that's embedded in the Greenbook. I don't mean that as a criticism of the Greenbook; I realize the institutional constraints. But I think we do have to take into consideration that a forecast based on the ""no change"" approach to policy, which has become more of a standard assumption in the Greenbook, may have been biased toward optimism as we've gone through these periods. I realize looking immediately ahead that we do have this unknown in fiscal policy out there. I was very interested in Mike's comments that even the things that have been talked about now-- the presumption that this [fiscal package] doesn't get ""Christmas- treed"" too badly--would not have a dramatic effect. At any rate, that's something that we can't anticipate very well at this point. The one place where our forecast does differ is with respect to the unemployment rate. For any given level of GDP, we would have a slightly higher unemployment rate forecast than what is reflected in the chart. I think that goes back to our own little model [at the ﻿ Bank] where we have the labor force increasing slightly more than is anticipated in the Greenbook forecast. We think that could add as much as a couple of tenths in some of the intermediate periods and, consistent with that, we'd be somewhat more optimistic on inflation. To sum up, on balance we think that the risks still are on the down side. One reason has to do with the consumer and the necessity of forecasting that we're going to see a snapback in consumption to some extent. If that doesn't happen, I have a fear about what that would mean for inventory behavior and what that [implies in turn] . We've obviously made an enormous amount of progress on inflation and we don't want to give that up. But consistent with that, we've also seen this restructuring phenomenon that is going on, which will be very beneficial for productivity in the longer run. And it seems to me that the proper role of policy, as others have said, is to ""facilitate"" that restructuring phenomenon. I do have a concern that were we to see a significant further slowing in the economy, we'd see demands for all kinds of protectionism, not just in the international trade sense but in a slowing down of the restructuring process in many industries. That may be because I come from a District where a lot of people have been restructured out and I'm very sensitive to it. Thank you. "	13	13	1.0	1.0	51.0
199202	123	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199202	124	MELZER	 In terms of the outlook, our view is similar to the Board staff's. We're somewhat more positive on real growth and right in the middle of the central tendency as far as inflation, as measured by the CPI, goes. But what I want to comment on are the assumptions. It's interesting how two people can look at the same thing in different ways. Dick was worried about an unchanged interest rate [assumption] and I'm worried about what I think is another policy assumption implicit in there! [Laughter] When we do our forecast further out--this would have very little impact on '92--our presumption is that at some point, not in the reasonably near future but in the course of this year, we'd get back to Ml growth of 4 to 5 percent. We don't run our projection solely on that; there's a lot of judgment implied. But implicit in the policy assumptions in the Greenbook and the Bluebook is an 11 percent plus growth rate in Ml for all of 1992. Now, I guess my view is that an unchanged interest rate is not necessarily an unchanged monetary policy. If we're pegging an interest rate and we have an economy that is picking up and there is greater demand for credit and associated with that transaction balances are created, we have to supply the reserves. So, my view is --though some things could occur in the short run to disturb this-- that over longer periods of time if we're fostering growth in reserves and narrow money at double-digit rates, that's going to come back to roost in terms of higher inflation. So, in terms of underlying assumptions looking further out, there are considerable differences. The other thing in this context that troubles me in general is that this can go on with an apparently benign policy as far as M2 is concerned because only 25 percent of M2 is comprised of the Ml component; 75 percent is in the non-Mi components. And special factors will hold the growth of those non-Mi components probably to zero in 1992. So, we can sit there with 10 percent Ml growth and have M2 growing at 2-1/2 percent. Enough about that now, but I think we had the same sort of problem between the middle of '88 and the middle of '89 in reverse in essence, where M2 looked as if it was growing ﻿ fast enough at a rate of about 4 percent. We were comfortable with that, but in fact what we were doing to maintain our pegged funds rate--which arguably was perhaps too high--at those levels was that we were pulling out reserves. Ml declined and we pulled out reserves over that one-year period at an annual rate of 3.2 percent. So, I think those are important considerations as we look ahead to tomorrow. In terms of the District, I didn't go first today--that didn't do any good last time--but the numbers still look pretty good. Non-agricultural payrolls in the most recent period for which we have numbers were growing at 1.3 percent compared to 0.3 percent nationally, and we're seeing that growth both in [services and goods- producing industries], with particular strength in food and kindred products and in textiles. I continue to hear this anecdotal story about textile mills running flat out [in our District]; it's partly a delivery problem as I understand it. Inventories have been run down to the point where wholesalers and retailers can't wait for foreign deliveries so domestic mills are benefiting in the short run. As far as construction goes, residential construction has been particularly strong over the last year. Contracts have been growing at twice the national rate over that period. Nonresidential construction is off over the year and most recently, but it's off I would say modestly-- about 4 percent over the course of the year--and there are no signs of further declines at least at the moment. I picked up the same thing Bob Black did on the anecdotal side. Over the last two or three weeks for the first time in many months, I have started to hear some positive comments from people in the housing area, from a couple of bankers talking about a pickup in loan demand both in the consumer and commercial areas, and also from the retailing side. A major national retailer based in St. Louis saw activity pick up in the week or two before Christmas and that pickup has been sustained throughout January. At the same time they point out that this is a very promotional period in terms of prices and that, as Si mentioned, last year is really a bad benchmark. But they're doing better than their plan. Anyway, District-wise, the story is really about the same as I laid out last time. At the moment things look pretty good. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	42.0
199202	125	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199202	126	BOEHNE	 My assessment of the District economy is that it's just bumping along the bottom. I don't think there are any firm trends, up or down. But I, too, have picked up in recent weeks perhaps just a tad of improvement in sentiment. Some is from retailing, some from banking, and some from the housing area. If you didn't want to see it, I don't think you'd see it; it's not a big deal, just a little here and there. You would have to put your finger on the pulse; it's just a sense, and I think that's a positive sign. As far as the nation goes, I think the Greenbook is about right. That forecast is the most likely outcome and I think it's well reasoned. Nonetheless, it could be wrong and we could relive what we went through last year. I just put my finger in the air and came up with my own assessment, which is that there's probably about a 60-65 percent chance that we will get an expansion along the lines the Greenbook sees. But I think there's maybe a 25 or 30 percent chance that we won't and that we could see a repeat of last year, with the balance [of risks] being that we could get a stronger expansion. So, ﻿ it's a profile that has the odds favoring an upswing but enough of a chance of a downturn that one can't dismiss it. I do think this is a time when we need some patience; we need to be very pragmatic about applying patience. We ought to wait a reasonable period and look for some indicators that the economy is picking up. If we don't see those signs after some reasonable period, we have to keep an open mind about how to proceed. But at this point I'd be willing to play the odds of a pickup. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	33.0
199202	127	GREENSPAN	 President Hoenig. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199202	128	HOENIG	 We think our District is growing somewhat more slowly; it might be described as flat at best. In the agricultural area, because of the subsidized grain shipments, the wheat price that we've talked about has gone up and that, of course, has been positive. But livestock prices, which had fallen sharply, have only come back slightly. And we're still projecting a slowdown in agricultural income, which has [adverse] effects on suppliers to that industry. Also, with natural gas prices being so weak, the energy industry, which is a very important resource in our District, is suffering. As someone said, the rig count for us is about the same as for the nation--about 33 percent less than it was a year ago--but very weak; and employment in that sector is very weak as well. In manufacturing, we are involved in the auto industry. Shifts have been eliminated and cutbacks in production schedules have caused unemployment to increase in that industry; layoffs of about 1,000 people in Kansas City were just announced recently. General aviation has also seen some modest falloff, but for us that is important. The construction industry has been positive, particularly in the residential area. Some significant gains have occurred there, and that has been the most positive note out of the District. On the national economy, our projections are less robust than those in the Greenbook, partly because we have seen such a poor fourth quarter for the economy and we look at what impact that would have going forward. We see a slower increase in the first quarter, or perhaps no increase at all, and a pickup after that, putting our projections below the central tendency [unless] we assume that there will be some modest fiscal package, which would bring us back up toward the central tendency. With that we see unemployment in the same range as the staff projection and inflation without the fiscal stimulus probably being within the same range or lower. So, that is how we see the national economy as well as the District economy. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	56.0
199202	129	GREENSPAN	 President McTeer. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199202	130	MCTEER	" The Eleventh District economy can be classified as flat to down slightly. As Tom [Hoenig] indicated, we're also suffering from the low natural gas prices and not too high oil prices. A lot of drilling activity is being shifted overseas. Also, in our major metropolitan areas, defense-related industries at least prospectively are losing employment, and that's getting a lot of attention. We continue to hear a lot about the potential loss of a major GM plant in our metropolitan area. The leading indicators that our staff looks at for Texas and the District, though, have been offering some promise recently. There has been improvement in some of the labor market indicators. The average workweek is up and initial claims for [un]employment are down locally. There is good news along ﻿ the border areas: The smaller towns are benefiting from a stronger Mexican economy than the United States economy. Our contacts, Beigebook and otherwise, have been mentioning being squeezed by their inability to pass on a lot of their rising costs. For the first time in a long time, we've heard complaints about higher minimum wages and the higher mandated benefits in health costs and so forth. I've been in Dallas a year now--this is my first anniversary--and in my [staff's] briefing yesterday I couldn't help but notice that we were at about the same place this year relative to the recession and hope for a recovery as we were a year ago. The main difference was that the staff seemed more pessimistic this time than they did a year ago. In the area of hope and better sentiment, the people I talked to reacted very favorably to our easing move in December. That seemed to give some hope. They're very skeptical about any benefits coming out of the fiscal side. They don't know what [the fiscal initiatives] will be, but they know they won't do any good and may do harm. I was at Texas A&M last week and I heard about an Aggie doctor who illustrated this fiscal package very well. He amputated a patient's leg, came in the next morning and said: ""Well, I have some good news and some bad news. The bad news is I took the wrong leg; the good news is the other one is getting better."" [Laughter] "	13	13	1.0	1.0	53.0
199202	131	GREENSPAN	 President Stern, can you improve on this? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199202	132	STERN	 I won't even try! For a long time, I've been reporting that the District economy is relatively steady, plodding ahead at a slow pace. That continues to be a reasonable description of the situation. Obviously, some sectors are doing better than others and some regions of the District are doing better, but none is really doing awfully. So, in that sense, we seem to be doing okay. On the positive side, as several people have already commented, recently almost wherever one goes, residential construction seems to be improving; that is underway. And as other people have commented, attitudes clearly have improved in the sense that while they always seem to me to be worse than justified by circumstances some of the intensity of the gloom seems to have lifted, if I can put it that way. So, slightly better attitudes at least seem to be emerging. On the negative side, some manufacturers have commented--and I think this is implicit in the charts that Mike presented--that inventories are excessive upstream and that has started to affect them in the sense that orders have slowed and so forth. Although we're not a big textile district, our textile manufacturers are running pretty well full out, as Tom [Melzer also] commented. So, there is something going on at least in that area. With regard to the national economy. I do think the stage is set for something like the Greenbook forecast. I don't have a very different view as to how things will turn out. I would reemphasize the point that has been made that it is by most comparisons a very conservative forecast, and it wouldn't be altogether shocking to me if the economy did somewhat better than that. The one thing that does trouble me a bit, looking at the national circumstances at the moment, is the state of the long-term bond market where clearly nothing favorable has been happening in recent weeks. Indeed, rates are at the levels they were before the discount rate cut back in December. ﻿ 	13	13	1.0	1.0	41.0
199202	133	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199202	134	KELLEY	" Mr. Chairman, I have very little substantively to try to offer today, but I would like to put out one notion. I am struck by the very strong consensus that I read in the press--and indeed it seems to be here as well--that the economy is likely to be ""flattish"" in the first quarter, that it will be a little better or that a recovery of some magnitude will occur in the second quarter, and that the economy then will move on up from there. I share that view. What worries me is that I have a bit of the contrarian in me, and I ask myself: If we have this very strong consensus, it's probably wrong, but in what direction and how? Is it too strong or too weak? Again, I'm part of the consensus, but my suspicion is that we could very well see events prove to be on the stronger side. If we were going to have a collapse, it seems to me that it would likely have been evident in the fourth quarter and would be underway now, and I don't sense that it is going on now. And the longer that doesn't appear, it seems to me the less likely that it will. It's probably too soon to rule it out, but [more strength than is projected] would seem to me to be the way things are liable to go. We have some things going for us already that should help, maybe more than we know. The short-term rates and the monetary stimulus that's in the pipeline should help. The refinancing of homes is putting more spendable income into the pockets of people every day. And I wouldn't be a bit surprised if this little uptick in long rates doesn't accelerate that [development]; and it might accelerate home sales as well. I'd also bet that the white collar layoffs have seen their peak. I think most CEOs who felt the need to lay off workers probably wanted to be able to report it in their year-end statements and got it done in the fourth quarter. If there's anything to that, layoffs are going to decline and that should help confidence. The credit crunch may be beginning to ease and the bank crisis may be beginning to ease. We're hearing here today and we read that banks are looking for good loans. My suspicion is that if they look, they're going to find them along the way. Fourth-quarter earnings of banks were better; their stock prices are up; and the loan officers' survey says that nobody is tightening anymore. So, maybe we will begin to get some relief there, although I don't think it's going to be very dramatic very quickly. On balance, I'm with the consensus but if the consensus does prove to be wrong, I think it's going to be on the up side. "	13	13	1.0	1.0	48.0
199202	135	GREENSPAN	 Governor LaWare. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199202	136	LAWARE	 Mr. Chairman, I want to discuss for a minute this confidence issue. If the consumer is truly the key to this economy and if a lack of confidence is what is driving his behavior at the moment, I ask myself: What are the things that are going to change that? Now, my previous suggestion that we hire a behavioral psychologist was rejected by this Committee last time, so I was looking around for other solutions! 	13	13	1.0	1.0	50.0
199202	137	GREENSPAN	 Couldn't afford it! 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199202	138	LAWARE	 We couldn't afford it; well, the Administrative governor put a veto on that! 	13	13	1.0	1.0	50.0
199202	139	KELLEY	 You already voted for the budget; it's too late! ﻿ 	13	13	1.0	1.0	48.0
199202	140	LAWARE	" We've been told since November that the President's speech would lay down a program for the country that would inspire confidence. It was a letdown; it certainly didn't draw any ""hazzahs"" from the assembled throng and it certainly did not create a consensus that we are now on a high road. The corporate restructurings and the layoffs, which Governor Kelley referred to, have continued, and they increasingly involve Blue Chip companies that were considered above the storm. And I think that has further alarmed not only blue collar workers, the traditional layoff victims, but white collar workers as well. Congress is certainly mushing around without much show of confidence-building leadership. The fiscal solutions involving massive cuts in defense spending seem to me to instill panic in the hearts not only of employees of defense industries but also their shareholders. And modest tax cuts don't sound to the recipients as if nirvana has arrived. Having said that, it is hard for me to believe that further monetary ease in the absence of some statesmanlike political leadership can really restore the economy to vigor. At the same time, it seems to me that previous monetary policy moves and the accumulated demand that has to be there in the economy should make something close to the staff Greenbook projections for GDP a realizable target without further monetary stimulus. In the pursuit of price stability, I don't think the modest growth rate outlined in the Greenbook is an undesirable outcome, although I must confess that the staff outlook for inflation is somewhat disappointing in the context of that slower growth rate. Mr. Chairman, that's all I have to say on the confidence issue today. "	13	13	1.0	1.0	50.0
199202	141	GREENSPAN	 Governor Mullins. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199202	142	MULLINS	" I don't have much to add. I like the Greenbook. I liked it last February as well. And I hope I never see it [repeated] again--not next February at least! I think the economy remains in a state of lethargy, although perhaps the intensity of the gloom is burning off. I think it's worthwhile to ask where we stand. We're in pretty good shape in the sense that we do have a lot of stimulus in the pipeline and we can see that working visibly and forcefully in financial markets--all the things we've mentioned in terms of the refinancings. Of course, we've been making this argument for some time now and someone is going to ask: When does this stimulus start to trickle out the other end of the pipeline? We have cut the fed funds rate 175 basis points in the last six months; 125 basis points of that has come in the last four months; our last move was six weeks ago. Sooner or later people are going to say: ""Where's the beef here?"" What real economic data do we have, even the forward- looking data like orders, that would suggest that we have found the appropriate monetary stance consistent with recovery? The housing market continues its modest rebound and we have exports as well. Of course, it's still pretty early in the lagged response cycle. However, so far we have relatively little to show for our actions. Those actions were certainly received as a credible move to realign short-term rates with lower inflation expectations but they have yet to produce much in the way of real economic stimulus. It's good that M2 is growing a bit more but it's still in the lower half of its range. When I look at the outlook for persistent slack in the economy, capacity utilization and labor, and the continued slow growth in M2 and credit, with significant sectors of the economy clearly sitting on the bench out of the recovery game--I mean by that state and local governments, commercial real estate, and consumers in the ﻿ sense that they lack the debt capacity for explosive spending--it's still difficult for me to conjure up much fear that an overly robust recovery will ignite inflation. I guess there is some fear on the fiscal side, although I think that will tend to lead to chaos rather than effective stimulus. Nonetheless, we have had growth in Ml and reserves that has gone from high to very high. We also have a high long-term bond rate. Given the way the long bond has been reacting to statements on the screen, the evidence tends to suggest that the long bond rate would fall if we eased again. That's no reason to ease, necessarily. Despite that, the fact that the long bond rate hasn't come down more is clearly a concern. I think underlying that concern is primarily the fiscal situation. Despite a rigorously binding budget agreement, the deficit has continued to balloon even before one considers the fiscal package. And now we're moving to a fiscal bidding war where the first bid is a deficit of $400 billion. If I were a long bond investor, certainly I could understand why I would be a little concerned. There is the supply side of that and also the artificial supply in the sense that dealers have been heavily shorting government securities as part of the process of issuing this record volume of corporate debt. And I suppose there may be the expectations of recovery as well. So, I think the long bond rate has to give one pause. It is consistent with the expectation of a cessation of progress on inflation once the recovery starts. It's interesting to note that many private forecasters as well as OMB and the Administration project a flattening out of the inflation rate once the recovery gets underway--a flattening out in the 3 plus percent range rather than the continued progress that the Greenbook shows. And this is despite very extended periods of slow growth in M2 and the persistence of slack in the economy. So, I think there's ample reason for caution. I, for one, don't want to see us go so far that a major tightening is inevitable once the recovery gets underway. And I'm certainly sobered by the realization that some on the Committee would suggest that we may have gone that far already. So, I would agree with Ed Boehne that it's a time for patience. We're at a critical period here in the sense that we have a few weeks of relative quiet before the fiscal or political battle intensifies. I fear that will be even more unsettling for the markets and may tend to immobilize us. While it is a time for patience, I think it's also a time for vigilance. We should start to see some of this stimulus dribble out of the pipeline soon and we ought to start being concerned if we don't get some movement soon or if we should start to get some convincing negative news or significant signs of deterioration.

199202	144	CORRIGAN	" Speaking near the end, there's not much left to say in terms of the national economy. It's very hard to take serious exception to Mike's forecast at least for 1992; 1993 is obviously another question. I would agree, as many of you have said in one fashion or another, that attitudes at least have stopped getting worse. Whether they are better, it's hard to say; but one can [at least] say they are no worse. Even some of the most bearish major corporate CEOs now associate themselves with that. I also think one can make a pretty darn good argument that the stabilization of ﻿ attitudes, even if that's all it is, is fairly directly related to the change in monetary policy that was made at the end of December. Now, in terms of the shaping of the future, I have managed to convince myself that we probably are a bit further along in this correction of the debt overhang [problem] that Tom Simpson was talking about than maybe is fully recognized. I also think we can now begin to make a case that the banking sector--and perhaps the financial sector more generally--looks a little better even if there still is a long way to go. And I do agree with several people who made the comment that banks are more [receptive to borrowers]. Just in terms of advertising space in the New York Times, we see a lot of full page ads now about loans, not deposits. If those two points are accurate even at the margin, I'd stipulate that one of the key assumptions of the chart show, to the effect that the credit crunch will ease ""somewhat""--I think that was the word--in 1993, might be a bit pessimistic. I might be able to envision that [easing] at least in ""somewhat"" terms some time in 1992. But having said that, I agree also with John LaWare that the confidence factor is the wild card. Even if there are some straws in the wind that smell a little better and look a little better, the economy does remain vulnerable to shock. That's one of the reasons why I blow a little hot and cold about the level of the stock market. But I also think, as a number of people have said, that the source of particular uncertainty is political with a capital ""P,"" bipartisan. I can't top Bob McTeer but I agree that the great [risk] on the fiscal side is that [the stimulus] will get overdone or that the process will get ugly, or both. If it gets ugly in a process sense, that certainly is not going to help confidence. If it gets ugly in a substantive sense, financial markets aren't going to like it. And that is a major risk. Perhaps a bit longer term, I must also say that I take this Japan/U.S. thing as a symptom of what I perceive as a real rise in protectionism and some elements of neo-isolationism. This is a real concern even though it may not seem as imminent as the fiscal [actions]. And while it's even less imminent, the point that Bill McDonough made in his remarks at the opening of the meeting about this tension among the Europeans --with a quite different economic profile in Germany on the one hand than in most of the other countries, with its implications for exchange rates and interest rates and some other symptoms of a political stress point--can have important economic implications, though maybe not immediately. So, there's no shortage of things to worry about out there. But the risks as I see them are much better balanced today than I viewed them over much of the fourth quarter. I think we always run the risk of instant replay but for that reason I feel more comfortable with the kind of profile in Mike's forecast right now than I have for the last few months.

199202	146	ANGELL	 It seems to me that the bond market continues to be a check in regard to our ability even to re-inflate. I have some question as to whether we can cause the growth path to be much more robust than is forecast. Probably we would have to demonstrate that we're re-inflating before we can alter some of these conditions that exist in people's confidence level. I don't think I've ever seen so much ill regard for our government among people. And even though we think that inflation is a monetary phenomenon, people out there have a ﻿ lack of confidence in government and what spills over from that somehow or other is that things won't be dealt with in a proper manner. Maybe that is what causes long bond prices to be at the same place they were 2-1/4 years ago. That's a rather sad commentary. Now, clearly, the housing market has been helped because the seven- year Treasury rate has come down quite substantially over the last 2-1/4 years even though the long rate has not. I sense, as many of you do, that there is some perking up, particularly in the housing market. Houses are selling; old houses are selling. And that does involve new activities. Certainly, a lot of refinancing is going on. As to whether the refinancing is being done in such a manner as to reduce the payments, the best sources that I have indicate that 70 percent of the refinancings are going to reducing the length of the maturity and keeping the payment [amounts] about the same. Clearly, M2 looks a little better than it did a month ago. I agree that in the commercial banking system the capital positions of many of the banks are improving; and the stock market seems to be a plus. But I can't find any robust sector. I can't find any area, in any industry or any geographic region, that really is alive. I know, Tom, that you have those textile mills running at capacity; but as far as robust and entrepreneurial spirits being charged up, that doesn't seem to me to be really there. I think some additional mischief could occur on the international scene. Europe could be a little softer than the staff has [projected] in the Greenbook. I see very little prospects for the GATT round getting anywhere by April, as everyone is saying. And if that doesn't occur, I tend to share the feelings that have been expressed about how protectionism might slow us down. So, we have what I think is a recovery out there, but I certainly don't think it is a very robust one. If it is, I'll be mistaken. I'm somewhat more optimistic on the GDP deflator for this year, but only marginally so. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0
199202	147	GREENSPAN	 Governor Lindsey. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199202	148	LINDSEY	 I think that we're back to the problem of the law of averages. Listening to the comments around the table, on average, the Greenbook is correct. But with all respect to our staff, when I did a count I counted five who are more optimistic, five who are more pessimistic, and two who think you're about right. It means that on average you're right. I think about Mike Kelley's comment to the effect that the consensus is wrong; our dilemma is that we don't know in which direction it is wrong. One of the reasons that's true is that we have begun in the legislative and executive arenas to adopt pro-cyclical policies instead of the usual anti-cyclical policies. Now, if you'll excuse a witticism: In the current environment, pro- cyclical policies mean that when things are bad, act aggressively to make them worse. If you look at the particular legislation that has passed, I think the pro-cyclical nature is clear. Beginning with the banking legislation: Through regulatory fiat and through legislative policy we've adopted banking provisions that, when things start to deteriorate because they feed through into the capital environment, rapidly shrink loans. When things begin to turn around and we have rapidly rising capital, either through market values or through the ability of the banks to raise equity we will hopefully, sometime, have a rapidly rising ability for banks to make loans, but right now we're on the down side. ﻿ 	13	13	1.0	1.0	54.0

199202	152	LINDSEY	" Yes, that's right; we were fighting you guys back then! [Laughter] In labor markets we also have adopted pro- cyclical policies. They were well intentioned, but they have the problem of being pro-cyclical. In particular, I point to plant closing legislation which requires substantial advance notice. I can understand the humanitarian reasons for doing so, but when the economy starts to turn down, or when we're in a down cycle, a company is forced to announce more plant closings, which has an adverse feed into psychology [and] the confidence factor. And if you look at what is happening on Capitol Hill, the other two potentially bad things that will happen if things continue to get worse--and they've already been mentioned--are a gross fiscal stimulus, which will push up long-term bond rates, and a revival of protectionism. We have to think about how to interrupt this pro-cyclical policy. The keys have already been mentioned. The first is that the public knows that the political apparatus is not working well. One can see that in that the purpose of the politicians is to engender confidence. The President certainly billed his speech as one to engender confidence and the opposition appropriately called it ""warmed over"" and said that there was no confidence there. Further, if you think about why our December policy was apparently as successful as it was in building confidence--just about everyone commented on that--I think it was because it was decisive. With all that as background, I think that on average the staff forecast is right. I don't know which way it is wrong, but I do know that it is wrong. I do know that the risks are high on both the up side and on the down side. And the proper policy call is that we should be as flexible as possible and should be prepared to take on the risks whether it turns out that we're wrong up or wrong down. In addition to being flexible, we should also learn the lesson of December and we should act decisively when we act. But in which direction that action should be, I share the Vice Chairman's view: I don't know. Thank you. "	13	13	1.0	1.0	54.0
199202	153	GREENSPAN	 Governor Phillips. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199202	154	PHILLIPS	 Thank you. Coming toward the end of this discussion, there's really not as much to say. Based on the Greenbook analysis and the comments that have been put forward describing what is going on in each of your Districts, it still seems to me that at best we can say the recovery is sluggish. We've been saying that for quite a while and I agree with Governor Angell in that I can't see where that source of light is that will lead us out of this. Some of the disappointing news that we're continuing to hear really confirms the hypothesis that we're seeing some structural changes. This is not just a cyclical move. The problem with that is that it may take us longer to come out of the recession than might have been the case in the past. I will say, on the positive side, that the positive signs we are seeing are very good for the long run. The balance sheet ﻿ restructuring certainly is good for the long term, as is the strengthening of the banking sector; and the fact that inflation does not seem to be as much of a concern in a broad variety of sectors is good for the long term. We're seeing some change in people's viewpoint toward savings. We've been saying for a long time that we need to have savings policies in this country, and I think we're starting to see some improvement there. And the easing that occurred in late December was about as positively received as we might have hoped. So, that was very helpful. I do think that a lot of the easing that has occurred over the last year and a half probably has been soaked up in the balance sheet restructuring. So, a lot of the easing that we may have thought was in the pipeline may be used up. I do agree that we're not yet seeing in the real economy the easing that occurred in late December. We certainly saw [mostly positive reactions], with the exception of the long bond situation. Certainly the stock market reacted very favorably. I'm concerned, as is Larry, about what might be happening on Capitol Hill to fix the situation. In view of the fact that I don't think the easing is fully reflected in the real economy, I don't feel quite the same pressure to ease that I was feeling in December. But like the Vice Chairman, I think we have to be quite vigilant over the next perhaps couple of weeks. In the next couple of weeks there may be a window before Congress starts doing all kinds of things. If there is a desire generally to ease, from a political perspective--though I hate to say it--it may be better to do it sooner than later. On the one hand, it's not expected before Congress gets going, and it may well strengthen the hand of those who wish to try to address the deficit situation. So, if we're thinking in terms of ease, I'd be inclined to urge that it be sooner rather than later. Nevertheless, having said that, I'm not feeling quite the same strong pressure that I was in late December. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	57.0

199202	159	ANGELL	" I decided last night that the reason it was confusing was because I wasn't really willing to put the proper labels on what I think are our current circumstances. I don't think we can do the right job of selecting policy unless we understand more precisely the nature of the circumstances that we're in. Those circumstances are, I believe, that we are [involved] in a long-cycle event. And it's a long-cycle event about which we must understand the cause because we can't do the cure if we don't understand the cause. I think the cause of this long-cycle event was the very expansionist monetary polices of the 1970s that created double-digit inflation. That double-digit inflation began a debt cycle in the private sector, which in a sense was not sustainable unless the rate of inflation was to be increased continually. I believe it was not possible for the world's reserve currency to be subject to a continuation of that inflation. So, it was entirely proper that under the Volcker Federal Reserve that was headed off and brought back down. But, ultimately, no more inflation means that the private sector--either corporations or households --does not wish to hold the debt as a ratio to their income that they did before. Now, during a long-cycle event it seems to me that the proper policy is one of price-level stability in order to get real stability to the event. As we've found during this period, to keep disinflation from turning into deflation we've had to provide reserves at a rate much [higher] than we ordinarily would think necessary, and we still have had a hard time keeping M2 and M3 growth where we wanted it. If it's the case that households and corporations are trying to reduce debt as a percentage of their cash flow and their income, then it seems to me that we have to admit something that central bankers never want to admit, and that is that the government has to become the debtor of last resort in such a circumstance. Because if we're going to force the growth of credit at a 3 percent rate or whatever even anemic rate may seem desirable, then someone has to be the owner on the other side because credit can't grow faster than debt grows. I think it's entirely responsible and important for the continuation of the creation of the private sector that those debt ratios be brought down. And under those circumstances I do not know how government debt can keep from going up. That raises the question for me as to what we say about this borrowing because it's the borrowing that causes the people out there to be so unhappy. The people are unhappy with their government because they don't understand how during this critical time we can have what they call ""irresponsible borrowing."" ﻿ Now, if that's the case, then I am somewhat admitting that Keynesian economics is really depression economics and I don't want to sound Keynesian; it's terrible for me to sound Keynesian, but I think we ought to be wise in regard to what the government does as it increases its debt. As defense spending comes down and as we have layoffs of highly skilled workers in the defense sector, it seems to me that it will be important for us to have [other] capital investment. It's not good to replace defense spending without employment compensation. That's a very bad tradeoff in regard to our getting done what we need to get done. So, I would much prefer to recognize the desirability of public sector spending on the infrastructure, that is, building highways and bridges and doing public sector spending that has the best multiplier in regard to the private sector. In other words, what I was trying to say yesterday and sounded so confused about is that I don't think monetary policy can in and of itself resolve this problem. I don't think monetary policy can do it [now] any more than it did in the Great Depression. So, Mr. Chairman, I wanted to revise and extend my remarks to recognize that this event is different. By that I do not mean that it has to be more severe; I do not mean that the outlook is necessarily worse than Mr. Prell has it. But I do believe there's a downside risk to the outcome that Mr. Prell has outlined. That is, if the debt contraction in households and in the business sector is to go on and if households ex ante wish to increase their savings all at the same time, then the paradox of thrift leads us to somewhat slower consumer sector spending than we have projected in front of us. And under those circumstances our job ought to be viewed somewhat differently and that is not that we can fix it but that we can keep it from getting worse. That would lead me to a stability orientation. Thank you for indulging me in that. "	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0
199202	160	GREENSPAN	 Thank you, governor. Let's now move on to Don Kohn. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	161	KOHN	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The choice of money and credit ranges for this year, with associated implications for intermediate-term strategy for policy, is complicated by a number of factors, including the shortfall from expectations in 1991 in both money and income, and uncertainties about the relationship between various measures of money and credit and the final objectives of the Committee for inflation rates or nominal income growth. With regard to the latter, the table on page 13 of the bluebook gives the staff forecast for growth in money and credit thought consistent with the greenbook forecast. The 5 percent greenbook nominal GDP projection is given in the table, but obviously, we believe those money and credit growth rates also will set the stage for the faster GDP growth rates forecast for 1993. A notable feature of the projections, then, is the sizable increases they embody for velocities of the broad money aggregates. For M2, this would contrast to the outcome for 1991, when M2 and nominal GDP grew about the same rates, and weak money proved to be an early indicator that the economy was falling short of expectations. In 1991, there were two roughly offsetting forces affecting M2 velocity. On the one hand, a downward shift in the demand for money relative to income and market interest rates resulted from a host of unusual forces working on the financial system that induced potential money holders to shift into other assets, or to use savings to pay down or avoid going into debt rather than accumulating money balances. On the other hand, market interest rates and opportunity costs measured in the standard way against alternative short-term investments fell sharply, and this helped to buoy demands for M2 assets, even if not by as much as might have been expected. In 1992, we anticipate that only one of these forces will be affecting M2 velocity--a further downward shift in money demand relative to market interest rates and income. Short-term interest rates themselves are not expected to change under the greenbook forecast. In normal times, we would anticipate that a period of flat market interest rates following a sharp decline would see some widening of opportunity costs as depositories reduced offering rates to catch up with the lower level of market rates. With loan demand at depositories expected to continue weak this year, the drop in deposit rates could be especially steep, resulting in a marked rise in opportunity costs--relative to returns in capital markets and the cost of debt, as well as to short-term money substitutes. This increase in opportunity cost then, would give a boost to M2 velocity. Velocity also would be boosted by the disruption resulting from the RTC, which we project to be at least as active in 1992 as in 1991, and from continuing portfolio restructuring as higher yielding small time deposits mature and as households generally hold down debt. In effect, the staff outlook for money and GDP embodies a fairly conventional pattern, in which reductions in interest rates have their initial effect on money, and only with a greater lag on spending. Thus the drop in interest rates last year boosted M2 primarily in 1991 and the economy in 1992. The story is complicated, however, by layering on top of it the restructuring of financial flows away from depositories, which depresses money relative to income both years. One difference between last year and this is that last year, the downward shift in money demand seemed to presage a downward shift in the demand for goods and services, hence the need for lower interest rates to rekindle growth. In part, the connection ran through the credit markets, with restraint on both supply and demand affecting money before it affected spending. The forecast for 1992 sees similar disruptions in the demand for money, but without comparable implications for the demand for goods and services. Most recent reports from banks suggest that credit supply conditions have stabilized, at a high level of stringency to be sure. And, lower interest rates and balance sheet restructuring already undertaken by households and businesses should relieve some of the pressure on them to draw back further by reducing spending relative to income and wealth. The halt to the tightening of credit availability and the improvement in balance sheets, combined with the lower level of interest and exchange rates prevailing now than at mid-1991, are expected to be sufficient to produce a stronger economic performance than we saw last year. At the same time, it seems unlikely that the restructuring of financial balance sheets has come to an end. The steep yield curve, relatively high cost of debt, activities of the RTC, and tendency for the recovery to be financed outside the banking system all should exert continuing downward pressure on money demand, even if not on spending. These forces are expected to be affecting M3 and credit as well. Total depository credit is projected to be about unchanged in 1992 after declining sharply in 1991, and M3 should increase a bit faster than last year, but still only 2 percent, implying an even larger increase in its velocity this year than last. Although debt velocity is expected to be little changed in 1992, virtually all of the pickup in debt growth from 1991 is in the federal component. Equity issuance, strengthening cash flow at businesses, and general avoidance of debt finance all contribute to holding down the expansion of private sector debt to about the pace of 1991. Ml, by contrast, is expected to accelerate from its robust rate of growth last year and its velocity to drop substantially further. This behavior reflects the very marked interest sensitivity of this aggregate. Despite reductions in NOW account rates, M1 is boosted this year primarily by the lagged effects of the huge declines in interest rates on market instruments and on small time deposits late in 1991 and early 1992. I should emphasize--though you probably know it already--the high degree of uncertainty associated with our M2 projection. Previously reliable relationships have broken down, leaving us without benchmarks for our projections. My sense is that the risks to the staff forecast of velocity are probably tilted a bit toward the downside; that is, velocity might not increase as much, so that the GDP and interest rates of the greenbook might well be associated with more money growth than we have built in. But, the staff outlook has growth in targeted money and credit variables well down in their provisional ranges selected last July. Thus, those ranges, listed as alternative I on page 13, would allow for considerably greater growth in money should money demand relative to income not shift down further as much as the staff anticipates, or should the Committee wish to accommodate stronger GDP than in the staff forecast. The Committee's expectations for nominal GDP growth, which are stronger than those of the staff, likely would be associated with money growth around the middle of the provisional range. A combination of a smaller shift in M2 demand and higher GDP therefore would imply money growth in the upper portion of the provisional range. If the Committee wished to retain this range, it might indicate that growth in the upper half would be acceptable if there were evidence of a return to more normal velocity relationships. Given the staff economic and monetary forecast, the provisional ranges could be thought of as biased toward ease. That is, with growth expected in the lower half of the range, chances for it falling to the lower end and triggering easing actions are greater than the odds that money would expand near the top of the range and suggest tightening reserve conditions. This bias might be considered appropriate in light of the results of last year and emphasis at this juncture on ensuring a solid economic upturn. However, if the Committee wished a more balanced approach to its medium-term strategy, it could consider reducing the ranges by half a point, as in alternative II. This alternative would emphasize the desire to consolidate and extend gains in reducing inflation; even alternative II implies midpoint M2 growth, at 4 percent, appreciably above the trend likely consistent with price stability, which probably would be closer to 3 percent. A strong surge in money growth, after all, could suggest a considerably stronger economy than anticipated, rather than a rebound in the money demand function. In that circumstance, tightening triggered by the reduced upper bound of alternative II might be needed to avoid creating monetary conditions that in time could lead to short circuiting the downward tilt to inflation rates now in prospect. If, on the other hand, the concern were more on the side of emphasizing a willingness to take further actions to foster a reasonably robust recovery, the Committee could increase the ranges, say by the half point suggested in alternative III. Such a range would signal that the Federal Reserve found the monetary growth, and by implication the economic performance, of 1991 unacceptable, and would take strong action to counter monetary growth at 3 percent or below if it persisted. The higher upper end of this alternative might even be needed if the money demand shift began to reverse in 1992, especially if the Committee wished to foster something stronger than the 5 and 6 percent nominal GDP growth forecast by the staff for 1992 and 1993. If there were no velocity shift coming in 1992, M2 growth around 5 percent might be needed to achieve GDP of 5 or 5-1/2 percent this year and 6 percent in the early part of 1993. Growth of this sort in 1992 would still leave nominal GDP below the level projected by the Committee at its meeting last July. If the Committee wished more explicitly to make up for lost money and GDP growth, an alternative targeting procedure, such as the ìtunnel optionî discussed in the bluebook might be considered. This technique ties a particular year's ranges to the ranges of the previous year, implying that some portion of a major shortfall or overshoot relative to the midpoint of such ranges one year would be recouped in the next year. As noted in the bluebook, this suggestion is usually linked to a multiyear approach to targeting money. Such an approach ties down the level of the money supply over time, and if there is a reliable relationship between that level and the price level, it will tie down the price level as well. It does require confidence in that relationship, not only over periods of several years but to a degree on a year-to-year basis as well, since shortfalls and overshoots would not be allowed to cumulate. The current procedure implies making fresh judgments each year about why money came out where it did, where the Committee would like to see nominal GDP or inflation over coming years, and what money is needed to achieve these objectives. This process is most appropriate when lasting swings in market rates have altered the level of velocity, or when money demand shifts may be more than transient. In the current situation, unless money demand is in the process of snapping back to a more normal relationship to spending and opportunity costs, use of the tunnels is likely to imply a need for easing actions early this year. Governor Lindsey will have additional comments on this option. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199202	162	LINDSEY	" Thank you. I'm going to be distributing a picture of what President Black and I will be proposing. Mr. Chairman, while that picture is going around the table, I'd like to begin with an apology. It had been my intent this morning to wear the Thomas Jefferson tie that Alan Murray made famous following the last FOMC meeting. But I got dressed in the dark because I didn't want to wake my wife, and it turned out that I pulled out my Adam Smith tie instead of my Thomas Jefferson tie. I was embarrassed, but Bob Black has reassured me that had Smith lived on this side of the Atlantic he no doubt would have chosen Virginia. And he also no doubt would have preferred the ""Tunnel Option."" With that aside-- "	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	54.0

199202	166	LINDSEY	 Thank you Mr. Chairman. Before you is a chart of what Bob Black and I have come to call the Virginia Plan. -Now Bob has lived forty some years in Virginia, and as Terry Sanford will tell you I've only lived there six. So the plan is thirty parts Bob's, only about six parts mine. Further, all of the experience and wisdom behind the plan are his. All I contributed was the picture. Still, he asked me to go first. In my confirmation hearings I said that we face two challenges in setting monetary policy today. In the short run, we must assure that the system has enough liquidity to assure a resumption of sustained economic growth. In the long run, we must move toward eventually achieving price stability. What I find particularly attractive about the Virginia Plan is that it meets both policy objectives simultaneously. But this plan not only meets the pragmatic demands of policy, it also makes good intellectual sense. We all differ on the extent to which money matters. But if it does matter, the way in which it matters is best described by the Virginia Plan. Let us try an old Socratic test. Suppose we agreed that money matters and that the right amount of money growth was 4 percent per year. Now, I ask the question: How much more money should we have two years from now than we have today? There are two possible answers. Answer A is 8 percent, or as close to that as is practicable. Answer B is a bit more complicated: it is between 2 and 6 percent more than however much money we end up with 12 months from now. Now, you could say that I'm being unfair. It's more complicated than that, and it is. But the way it is more complicated has to do with the practical necessities of policy implementation, and not with theoretical elegance. While the Virginia Plan is not Milton Friedman's famed computer, the one which would put us all on the unemployment line, it does at least capture the essence of Friedman's idea: that in the long run, a stable rate of growth of the money supply is the best policy. Specifically, we suggest that the FOMC set a 4 percent money growth target for 1992. The target range for 1992 would start at the upper and lower ends of the 1991 target range. The central tendency within the target range presumes that monetary policy eventually is successful in meeting the stated objective of this Committee in late 1991: to move money growth back toward the midpoint of the 1991 target range. We do not necessarily believe that we must move back to that midpoint in a single year. But it does recognize, as the Bluebook makes clear, that last year's undershoot was not deliberate but inadvertent. From a policy perspective, this meets both our short-run objective of assuring adequate liquidity to sustain an economic expansion and our long-run objective of slowing money growth so as to achieve price stability. Meeting these twin objectives is probably impossible under the ìconeî approach. But, the most important reason for adopting the Virginia plan is not a short-run need for adequate money growth or our ability to send a long-term signal. It goes to the root of macroeconomic policy. Last night, after listening to the comments from the different districts, I concluded that we were uncertain about the forecast because so much of our economic policy is now becoming pro-cyclical. The normal correction mechanisms of the market which cause the business cycle to move from contraction to expansion are being exacerbated by procyclical policies. In the fiscal arena, according to the staff estimates, we are witnessing a fiscal contraction in the first year of a recovery for the first time in memory. Our recently enacted banking laws cause a contraction of loans in the midst of asset price declines, and will, on the up side, cause an equal expansion of loan capacity in the midst of asset price increases. The best reason to adopt the Virginia Plan is that it is deliberately stabilizing, not destabilizing. Furthermore, it makes the stabilizing intent of this Board plain for all to see. In an era in which the public is concerned about the wisdom of those who control our fiscal policy, a stated intention by this Board that we will impose the discipline on ourselves to be countercyclical can only help to improve confidence. So, aside from the theoretical niceties of the system, I think there are sound practical reasons to adopt the Virginia Plan. We can set short-term money growth targets this year which are consistent with sustained growth. We can send a signal to the markets that we care about our long-term goal of price stability by cutting our money growth target. And, we can announce that this Board intends to be a force for stable policy. At least in Virginia, killing three birds with one stone ainít bad. I now turn to my fellow Virginian to articulate far better than I have here, why we should adopt this approach. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	54.0

I had put this on the back burner; I had thought about it many times earlier. He surfaced the plan and sent it to me and asked for my suggestions and I made one or two suggestions, which he very graciously adopted. Then he sent me another version and I made one minor suggestion on that. So, the thought of giving me the credit for it is really misplaced. Since he has entitled it ""The Virginia Plan,"" I wish very much that I could have Patrick Henry do the defense! There's little doubt that he and Thomas Jefferson and George Washington and George Mason would certainly have a favorite rate of growth of the money supply with the use of ""tunnels,"" if anybody had ever brought that up. I do know that they would be a bit worried if they knew the ""Virginia Plan"" was being defended by somebody who was born in Kentucky. My only defense there would be that Kentucky was once a part of Virginia. "	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	7.0

199202	171	KELLEY	 That's right. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	48.0
199202	172	BLACK	" Yes, it was then, that's right. I wish we could go back in time and I could speak at that time; but while I'm a Kentuckian by birth I'm a Virginian by choice--maybe that will give me a certain amount of credibility--and I also have two children who are native Virginians and I married a native Virginian. You kind of absorb some of this as you go along. I think Governor Lindsey has already stated quite well the reasons for adopting the multi-year tunnel approach instead of the annual cones and basing this on the level of M2 at the end of 1990 originally. Now. we set the data on 1991, but it comes out to the same thing. Let me make three additional comments on this, mostly by way of elaboration. First, the upside insurance this would give us at this particular moment is really a compelling reason. The [beauty] of this tunnel is that it pretty much guarantees that we would get price stability over the long run--which I think should be the objective of monetary policy to the exclusion of all others--as long as we were willing to reduce the rate of growth in the money supply until we got it down to the rate at which the potential output of the economy could increase [over time]. Now, everything we know about monetary history tells us that we can stabilize price levels if we get [money supply growth] down over time to somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 percent or so. People differ on what the potential growth of the economy is, but I don't think there's any doubt that it would be greater if we had price stability than if we didn't. And this is essentially the message of the P* model, which is one of the finest pieces of work I think we've done in the System. I wish I'd had a hand in that, but I certainly applaud the others of you who did. ﻿ I think a continuous unbroken tunnel would be a much more appropriate and powerful device for controlling the long-run rate of growth in M2 than the current cones because it would eliminate base drift. And base drift has really been the bane of our existence. Whatever base drift has brought us in the way of short-term flexibility in some years, in practice I think it has made it virtually impossible for us to control the long-run rate of trend growth of M2, with the result that we have [not] known and nobody else has known what the price level would be several years down the road . Consequently, I've concluded that no matter how strong our intentions are to reduce inflation--and for the last several years this group has had a stronger inclination in that direction than virtually at any time in the history of the System and I don't think that intention has ever been stronger than it is right now--I don't think we will achieve that goal. Despite our feelings on that and our best efforts, I don't think we will ever achieve that goal unless we do something about moving away from our present targeting procedures. And I think the tunnel would address this. Moreover, and I can't emphasize this point too much: I think this move to a tunnel would greatly increase the credibility of the System. We have said repeatedly that our intention over time is to bring down the rate of growth in the money supply to noninflationary levels. This would spell that out in a great deal more detail and yet it would be clear that we would have the necessary leeway in the short run to do what needs to be done. And if this did increase our credibility, it would greatly reduce the transitional cost of moving to price stability. Second--and all of this is relevant to the comments that Don put in the Bluebook under the ""tunnel option""--it' s certainly true as the Bluebook suggests that we wouldn't want to adopt the tunnel option when the relationships between M2 and income and prices are going to fluctuate in the future. All we really have to guide us is past experience and, historically, we know that there have been variations in the short run extending sometimes more than a year but that in the long run there has been stability in that relationship. V2, by the best statistical measures that we have, has been constant and predictable over the long run. Consequently, this tunnel approach makes a great deal of sense to me. But the tunnel needs to be wide enough to accommodate a fair amount of these variations in V2 that we normally have over periods as long as one to several years. Maybe a 4-point spread, as Governor Lindsey suggested, would be the proper amount, but it's possible that the width should be greater than that. It's important to note in this regard that even a very wide tunnel would still constrain the trend growth of M2 over a long period of time sufficiently to ensure price stability. And finally, the Bluebook may be right in suggesting that a substantial further easing of policy might be needed to get M2 up to the midpoint of Governor Lindsey's tunnel. But if we had a tunnel that extended our long-run trend objectives to 1993, I wouldn't feel compelled to move M2 up too rapidly from its present position near the bottom of the tunnel to the midpoint by the end of this year if it were clear that the recovery had resumed. In other words, this is not a ploy for ease. What I'm trying to do here is to suggest a long-run strategy that would give us the necessary flexibility in the short run. So, with regard to the width of the tunnel, it might be that it would be better for us to have a 5-percentage point tunnel if we wanted to make sure right now that we accommodate what is probably a ﻿ good projection on the part of the staff, which is that 3-1/2 percent M2 growth in 1992 would be consistent with a resumption of the recovery. But, again, even a fairly wide tunnel like that would be concerned with the course and control of M2 over a long period of time. And that to me is the beauty of the tunnel approach. So, Mr. Chairman, like Governor Lindsey, I hope the Committee will give the ""Virginia Plan"" favorable consideration. I did not admit this to you, Larry, but as you were labeling this ""The Virginia Plan"" I thought to myself it really sounds more Hamiltonian than Jeffersonian. And then I thought with your background from New York you could send a ""New York Plan."" But in my case, although I spent right much time in New York, the first time I went to New York I crossed on the Staten Island Ferry prior to shipping overseas at the end of World War II and I didn't even see the Statue of Liberty. I was the only one who went out without seeing it and that was the main thing I was interested in seeing. So, I didn't think I could defend a New York Plan, but I do think this may be a little more Hamiltonian than Jeffersonian. And I hope the Committee will honor these distinguished forebears of ours who, other than an occasional glass of whiskey, probably would have liked nothing better than a slow, steady rate of growth in the money supply! "	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	7.0
199202	173	GREENSPAN	" Well done, gentlemen. Let me raise a few issues on the other side of this. I don't think there's any question that we all hold the basic view that we wish to move toward price stability as a necessary condition for maximum long-term real growth. Also, I think that the monetary policies we set around this table, and the mechanisms we employ to achieve them, don't rest all that much on simplistic cones, tunnels, or whatever. Hopefully, we're looking at the issues in somewhat greater detail to understand the relationship between money and GDP. Having said that, I have been in and out of a position in favor of the ""Tunnel Approach"" over the years, and this is the original version of money supply growth notions. I think the key question we have to ask ourselves is: To what extent do we actually use the cones to operate policy? We're obviously acutely aware of what other people see with respect to these data. And to the extent that the particular cones that we use--or even if we were to use tunnels-- reflect our basic view of what we wish to be done, then indeed we would follow them. But the cone is a simplified version of P*. Everything that's in the cone is obviously in P* in a somewhat more detailed way. And we do use P* as a guide and indeed have been using it, obviously, for the last several years as we try to move our way toward price stability. Indeed, it's that sort of process that suggests to us what the path of money supply should be. So, I think we have to ask ourselves several questions about this. Would our switching from cones to tunnels affect what we actually do here? Or are we trying to alter the perception of the market and other people? I submit it is the latter, not the former, that is crucial to this. And if that is in fact the case, then I think we are confronted with a very difficult problem here, which is that even though we may perceive the tunnel as being an endeavor to simplify P* as the long-term goal, as a practical matter we are signaling a very sharp and immediate reduction in the funds rate to move M2 growth up [in the cone]. Were we to start something like this when we are at the midpoint of a range, it would be very easy to do. I don't think one can readily argue strenuously--with the exception of ﻿ a few minor issues I would raise--between the desirability of a cone and a tunnel. I think every person around this table has been on both sides of this in their monetary policy discussions. I'm most concerned that if we were to do this at this stage, it would look as though we were merely trying to hide the fact that we really want to move the money supply up sharply by dropping the funds rate. And in the context of what is happening on the fiscal side, I must tell you that I would be quite nervous about that perception being conveyed even if somebody as formidable as Bob Black, who certainly has no reputation as an inflationist in this country, were to come forward and defend this particular plan. My basic impression at this stage is that were we to move from what we define as the bottom of the range and put the tunnel into position, we essentially would be saying that we are going to make a major push on the money supply and presumably on interest rates. Now, that clearly is not the basic view of either Governor Lindsey or President Black. My concern is that there's a degree of skepticism out there, which I find frankly to be very deep-seated. And while I personally would not mind discussing this in some detail--I might even vote for it if we were starting from the midpoint of the tunnel because most of the arguments you make are valid arguments and I think they make a great deal of sense--my concern is where we are at this particular point. The difficulty that we have mechanically is that we have chosen, for better or worse, to rebase on the grounds that there are structural problems in the relationship between M2 and gross domestic product that [cause that relationship to] veer off from time to time for several years. And that shows up in the P* data; it would show up in the tunnel data. What our cones enable us to do is to reset all the past imbalances to square one. As I said to some of my colleagues, it's like pushing the odometer on the dashboard back to zero so you start from scratch. Now, in today's environment, we know there's base drift; we know that money growth is under where we probably would want it to be. And even though we start from square one, what we do as a consequence is to adjust to that fact [on the basis of] our judgments as to where we want it to be. I was also concerned that if we were to move the range up to, say, 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent or something like that instead of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent to reflect the base drift or even more, that would create the same problem that starting at the bottom of the cone suggests. The general [suggestion] that the other ""Kohn"" raised with respect to this issue is, namely, to stay where we are but to recognize fully that we have had base drift. And if indeed the depressing forces on M2 which we presume to be temporary start to ease and M2 starts to move into the upper [portion] of the cone, I don't think we should feel pressed to tighten policy to bring it back in; [rather we would] make an ad hoc adjustment in our procedures to recognize that this is not a bad level of M2 at which to be. So, I would conclude that I don't see any difference in philosophy between my view of money and that which Governor Lindsey and President Black expounded. In fact, were we in a particular range at this stage and changed to a [tunnel], it would not create the question of ""What kind of game are they trying to pull?"" I'm concerned about doing that at this time. I think the benefits that we would get from the tunnel, as Governor Lindsey outlined it, we could achieve just as readily if we are willing to operate in the upper [portion] of the cone, without creating for ourselves what I would consider to be a rather difficult ﻿ public relations problem. As much as we may think that we are doing things like this as a strictly analytical monetary policy position, I'm fearful that the rest of the world with its [high] degree of cynicism would not give us the benefit of the doubt. Would anyone else like to speak? "	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0

199202	176	BLACK	 I don't hear anything you say that makes anything but sense, but my policy position now and I guess for the short run is that I'm going to argue that we not change the federal funds rate. I don't see any reason for doing that at this point. If we're concerned that [adopting the tunnel approach] would look like a tightening, then I think we could widen this tunnel, make it 5 percentage points, which would ensure that we would come within our targets. And on your last point, in a sense I think you're saying that it wouldn't be so bad to disregard the cone if the money supply were to go over it; and I certainly would want to do that myself if [that began to happen]. But I think that would be a bit more damaging to our credibility than if we had a tunnel [because with a tunnel] we would not be seen as disregarding our targets. People think that we don't pay a lot of attention to the targets. That's the only reason, really, why I want [a procedure] that we could live with and have the flexibility we need and not [unintelligible]. And I think with those two changes we could do it okay.

199202	178	ANGELL	 Mr. Chairman, I really appreciated this discussion. It is exactly the right presentation. I side with you that the most critical question for us at this point in time is conveying what we are going to do in the short run. So, I agree with your position. I would, however, like to keep on tap this notion of the tunnel as possible for the long run as well as the short run. That is, we sometimes have [viewed] a yearly [target] as if it were the long run and then our FOMC meeting [decision] as the short run. It does seem to me that once we find ourselves at the middle of the desired tunnel, it might be good in terms of a track record for us to have [the tunnels] out there as we [draw] our cones to see whether or not we have cumulative base drift. Bob, I was a little surprised that you were willing to accept a 4 percent growth path in your tunnel. I would have thought that you would have insisted on a growth path in the tunnel of either 2 percent or 3 percent, which is consistent with price level stability. Now, I find this tunnel arrangement puts us in an expansionist mode; I think it does exactly what you suggested, Mr. Chairman. If we had said we should have fostered growth of the money stock at 4 percent last year, not 4-1/2 percent, and if the tunnel from that should have been 3 not 4 percent, then we would have a long-run tracking guide that I think gives P* its force but yet maintains a business as usual [approach] in regard to this year's cone. ﻿ 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	43.0
199202	179	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, could I just say one thing in response to that, because I think Governor Angell has hit upon a very important point? When this was first done, Larry had it at 4-1/2 percent and I suggested that we cut it to 4 percent. That was done and he carried the 4 percent rate on out into 1993. I would not want 4 percent in 1993; I would want to bend it down to 3-1/2 percent or something of that sort. There's a sentence in the letter that he sent me in which it appeared, if someone read it carelessly, that he might be committing himself to 4 percent forever; I don't think that was his intention. So, I suggested that we make it appear that we want to bend it down. What surprised you is not the way I had suggested. So, I'm really where you thought I would be; it's just that we didn't end up changing that particular thing. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	7.0
199202	180	GREENSPAN	 Could I just ask you a quick question? If we were to adopt this and the money supply were way out of these ranges by the end of this year for reasons that are fully technical, would you feel that we would be required to push back into that tunnel over a particular period of time or [would we] stay outside for a year, or what? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	181	BLACK	 I would say if [the reason for such growth] is purely technical, it would be permissible to go outside. I have not been as disturbed about the low rate of growth in money we've had recently as I would have been had I not felt that there were explanations for it. If we have good reasons for why it's growing unusually fast, I think we should state those to the public and use them as justification for staying outside [the tunnel] but say, that if we get into a more normal pattern of money growth, we will definitely get [money growth] back into the [tunnel].

199202	183	LINDSEY	 Mr. Chairman, I understand very much your sentiments. Let me say that, looking at the picture, I forgot the old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words. Regrettably, the picture that I have in front of you, which from my point of view is for presentation purposes, is in error. It was based upon preadjusted M2. Am I correct in saying that we had 3.1 percent growth last year? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	54.0
199202	184	KOHN	 That's correct. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199202	185	LINDSEY	 Actually, therefore, this box should be substantially closer to the middle of the target range, i.e., 0.6 percentage point closer. Further, if we adopt President Black's suggestion, with which I agree completely, the tunnel would be widened to 2-1/2 percentage points on either side and we would be a full 1.1 percentage point above the bottom end of the target range. That wouldn't be close by any measure. So, the picture as presented --which by the way is not even to scale but is illustrative--actually should show our starting point as somewhere very close to the middle of the bottom half of the target range. That's the only correction I have in that presentation. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	54.0
199202	186	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	187	PARRY	 I have a question of clarification. It seems to me that the initial starting point is an important issue and that it ﻿ ought to be based upon some concept of a steady state velocity. Did you choose the fourth quarter of '90 with the thought in mind that we were in effect in a period when we were at a steady state velocity? Is that why you chose it? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	45.0
199202	188	LINDSEY	 Probably, and I would be happy to be corrected by President Black on this. We were in the middle of this period of uncertainty. If I were to select a period of more stable velocity, I probably would have to go back further; and if I were to go back further, I'd be incorporating more base drift in there. I would be incorporating so much base drift that the picture wouldn't look very sensible. So, I will admit to arbitrariness in the selection. I was basing it, really, on the statement of this Committee last quarter which said it was our [objective] to move back toward the middle of our 1991 target range. So, five months ago we were willing to say that we should be where that middle line is. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	54.0
199202	189	PARRY	 I'm not sure how to accomplish this, but it would seem to me that if one does see value in P*. which of course uses steady state velocity as an important component, one would want to figure some way to get a greater symmetry between the two procedures. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	45.0
199202	190	CORRIGAN	 Dick Syron. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	31.0
199202	191	SYRON	 I think it's very difficult because it's very hard to deny the intellectual consistency of this approach; in fact, it is completely intellectually consistent with what we say we're doing, which inevitably in discussing it leads one back to pragmatism. My concern is that it may be a little more consistent than the consistency of velocity allows us to be over time. I admit in making that argument a continuing analogy: Hancock and Revere were considered sort of rogues and not the intellectuals that Jefferson and Hamilton were, so I'm not going to make their argument. My concern is that I just don't have confidence in the stability of these relationships in a multi-year process. That would lead us to having to have the tunnel be quite wide if we wanted to have any confidence that we were going to stick with it over time. And if the tunnel has to be that wide and also if we need to have the possibility of bending the tunnel, one comes back to the issue that the Chairman raised of either a very wide tunnel or a bent tunnel. Bent tunnels are almost cones in a sense, and that leads us back to this problem of saying that people could misinterpret what we're trying to do. Obviously some will make a fairly mechanical calculation and see that we really would have to drop interest rates--as is implied on page 15 in the Bluebook by extension--very, very dramatically if we wanted to come back to the midpoint without bending the tunnels. So, my own view is that this [approach] ultimately is tied to the issue of how flexible we want to be in the intermediate period. That's what we're talking about; all these are subsets of that. Given the concerns that we have about velocity's erratic behavior and given the many structural changes that people have been talking about, I don't know that this is the time to make a change. I prefer for the longer term to focus on P*. which I think is another way of doing it and avoids some of these problems. But having said all that, I can't deny that intellectually this is completely consistent and in that sense would seem to be the way to proceed. I just am afraid that practicalities both in perception and measurement preclude it, in my own view, at this time. ﻿ 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	51.0

199202	193	CORRIGAN	" In the past 13 years or so I've been around this track more than once, too. I can't deny the neatness [of this tunnel idea], but I have to ask myself the question: Are we dealing here with form or substance? And if we're dealing with substance, it has to follow that the adoption of the tunnels would, in fact, mean that policy in some sense would be different. If we're dealing with form, we're saying that policy would be the same but somehow or other the form would make a difference in terms of perceptions about policy --the so-called credibility effect. I have to say that, despite the neatness, I think it's much more form than it is substance. For example--and I can't allow for compounding, so Don Kohn can correct me if I'm wrong--I think it's about correct to say that had the Committee at the end of 1986 adopted a policy of a five-year cone from then to the end of 1991, policy wouldn't have been any different than it has been in one sense. I think we would have been within the cone each and every year. If we put ourselves back to that position--if we had had the cone and we were in it every year and M2 growth for the five- year period averaged 4 percent --would we have felt back then that we would have achieved price stability or have been much closer to it than we are right now? I think a lot of people would have said ""yes"" to both of those questions; but I don't think the outcome would have been any different either in terms of the execution of policy. I am very skeptical--I always have been--of this so-called credibility argument. The people out there setting wages and prices in the trenches wouldn't know a cone or a tunnel if they were in it. What they react to is demand and supply in the marketplace. And what we are ultimately trying to influence are those considerations. So, while I do think [the tunnel concept] is neat, I don't think there is a great deal of substance, defined the way I did define it--meaning that the actual execution of policy would have been different than otherwise. I have a lot of sympathy with the argument that Dick Syron just made that at this juncture, not only for the reasons the Chairman cited but for the other one that Dick hinted at, this could end up as somewhat of a bear trap. Right now, I'm not even sure I know what the algebraic sign of the interest elasticity of demand for M2 is. In other words, I could make a pretty decent argument that if we want to accelerate M2 growth, we better raise interest rates. Now, you may laugh, but I don't think you can just reject that out of hand. And if we're not even sure what the algebraic sign is, why do we want to get ourselves trapped into a more mechanistic approach? In addition, there's the concern that the Chairman raised about what it might imply regardless of how we fine-tune the beginning point. So, like others, I have been around this debate more times than I'd like to count. I can't deny the neatness, but I would be reluctant to bet the ranch on the tunnel option at this juncture.

199202	195	MULLINS	" I agree with the Chairman that the best time to switch is some year in which we end up at the midpoint and then we could click right into a tunnel approach. One difficultly is that we haven't hit the midpoint or been close to the midpoint in five years; we've been consistently under the midpoint and we're projected to be under again this year. Philosophically, I like this approach, and I ﻿ agree that a lot of it turns on this issue of credibility. I agree with Jerry that for UAW and Caterpillar the cone versus the tunnel will not be a major issue in their negotiations. I do think the credibility issue is more important in the capital markets, where I believe bond market participants and the like might look at it. One thing that bothers me about continuing with the current approach, even though I can understand the arguments for it, is the sense in the Bluebook that we're setting a policy based upon our projection of what we expect to happen--of what is pretty much achievable based upon our rigorously accurate forecasting abilities in these areas. We see what is going to happen and we say: Well, we should set the target there. Whereas I like the idea of forcing us to think about a long-term objective and then achieving it. Of course, in part this is a little different perspective. Despite the imperfections in M2, as I read it M2 grew a little over 3 percent last year as did nominal GDP. And I tend to think that M2 will come back this year because a lot of these factors will open up. As Jerry said yesterday, the banking system and some of the credit crunch issues are opening up and I think the RTC is near the end of the road; many of those institutions have already been squeezed. I think one would expect the bulk of the yield curve effect to come relatively early when the yield curve switches. So, I wouldn't be surprised to see a catch-up. The way the Bluebook puts it is, on page 18: ""The tunnel approach in 1992 would be appropriate if last year's shortfall in M2 was seen as associated with an undesirable shortfall of income""--and I would define a recession as an undesirable shortfall of income--""or transitory shifts in the demand for money."" I have a feeling that we're going to get some catch-up on that. I do agree with the general sentiment that there are advantages to flexibility. Those in decision-making positions always will prefer flexibility to being bound. And I do think there is a problem in how people would interpret this at the current time. But more generally I would agree philosophically with the notion, especially once we get out of this period in which I think we have some temporary problems with M2, of trying to put us under a bit more pressure and committing to some longer-term ranges.

199202	198	KOHN	 I was hoping you had forgotten me! 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199202	199	PARRY	 Don, the Bluebook indicates that the growth of M2 would be 3-1/2 percent, assuming that there is a downward shift in the demand for money of similar magnitude to that experienced in 1991. If there were not such a downward shift and we had a continuation of the experience of 1991, what would be the model's forecast of M2 growth? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	45.0
199202	200	KOHN	 Well, the standard model would have it something close to 6 percent with a 5 percent GDP; that's because it would still be getting some push from interest rates early in the year. Our yield curve model, however, has been doing a bit better these past few years, although it has been missing; it would have [M2] growth more on the order of 4 percent. So, I would tend to split the difference in the models and tell you something like 5 percent on M2 to get 5 percent GDP. ﻿ 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199202	201	PARRY	 Now. the tough question: At the beginning of 1991 you had some feelings about the probabilities of these forces continuing in 1991. You obviously in this Bluebook have some convictions about that as well. How strong are they this time? Governor Mullins indicated he thought that these effects may not be as strong as you think they are. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	45.0
199202	202	KOHN	 Well, as I indicated in my briefing, I think 3-1/2 percent growth is our best shot. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199202	203	PARRY	 Right. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	45.0
199202	204	KOHN	 But if there were a risk to this, I think it might be that we could get a little more M2 growth or something like the FOMC [members' forecasts of] GDP, which is higher than the Greenbook GDP. And it would be because of the fact, as Governor Mullins mentioned, that [the effects of] some of the initial shifts in the yield curve may be wearing out and so forth. I guess to some extent we're perhaps a little gun-shy on this because those are arguments we've been using for the last six months about why banks in response would have higher-- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199202	205	GREENSPAN	 Not necessarily. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	206	KOHN	 It's true that velocity was unchanged in 1991. But it took an incredible decline in short-term interest rates to keep it unchanged. And all our past relationships in models and charts and whatnot would suggest that that would give you a huge decline in velocity--a lot of M for a little bit of GDP--and we didn't get that. Now, some of that may unwind a bit this year, but our best guess is that the credit for the expansion in the staff forecast, which I think is an entirely credible one, would basically come from outside depository institutions. Most of it is going to come through the capital markets. So, I don't see loan demand picking up at banks or thrifts; they're still on the securitization route. Certainly, marginal banks and thrifts under the new banking law are under tremendous pressure--even more pressure than they were before--to downsize to get their capital up. So, I don't see those credit conditions deteriorating; I also don't see them snapping back a lot. And I think there are still a lot of portfolio shifts coming that we haven't seen yet. A lot of small time deposits [that depository institutions] put on a couple of years ago are just maturing. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199202	207	PARRY	 This 3-1/2 percent certainly would be something that one could use to support a recommendation of alternative II, if one had considerable certainty.

199202	208	GREENSPAN	" One of the problems that the current period is creating with respect to the money supply is that we are going through this extraordinary turmoil with the virtual dissolution of a big chunk of the savings and loan industry. We have all sorts of abnormal aspects with respect to holdings of liquidity. It strikes me that our major focus at this stage has to be to understand the very short run of where we want to be on money supply, largely because we know so little about what is going on. The ""Virginia Plan"" and all ﻿ the [other] tunnel-type plans presuppose precisely the opposite: That we are feeling sufficiently comfortable with respect to these relationships that we can project further out and make available to the public a plan to which we intend to adhere. I wish we were under those conditions. Were we in that position, I would feel quite comfortable about locking in longer-term commitments in a sense to bind us so that we don't get off a particular track. My difficulty, knowing all of the technical problems that are associated with the relationships between money on the one hand--and liquidity for which it is a proxy--and gross domestic product, is that our state of knowledge in that sequence at this stage has not been so poor in many years. Also, I would be very hesitant to lock into a tunnel because I'm fearful that we might find that all of a sudden [relationships have gotten] back to some form of normal [at a time when] we are outside the tunnel. It would then take us an awfully long time to work our way back unless we took the whole tunnel and changed it up or down, which would be the worst of all possibilities. I don't know how we could find our way back, whereas the procedures we have at the moment at least enable us to start from scratch in early February. Despite all of our intellectual, analytical problems, which may have been totally unresolvable with respect to policy in the previous year and created a base drift, at least in a sense we can always start from scratch and struggle from where we are rather than try at that stage to work our way back and absorb mistakes that we made analytically two years earlier or something. It creates major problems if we are wrong. Obviously, if we are not and we can stay within the tunnel, it is very effective. But I ask myself the question: What do we do if we're wrong? And I say if we're wrong and we have cones, we can adjust far more readily than we can if we have a tunnel. I would be very hesitant to go to a tunnel unless we felt confident that [money] were not going to veer substantially outside the ranges of a tunnel. And at this stage I frankly can't feel secure in that respect, knowing our terrible difficulties in trying to forecast M2 on the basis of all our previous models. "	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	209	PARRY	 The trouble is that when we're wrong we are sometimes reluctant to make the change in that new year to compensate for that wrong. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	45.0
199202	210	GREENSPAN	 That is a problem and that's the advantage of this [tunnel concept]. But I should certainly think in the context of what Jerry Corrigan was saying--namely form versus substance--that if we have enough understanding to know the difference, we would make certain our policy is formulated on the basis of substance and not on the position of where a dot is on some particular chart that we built.

199202	211	PARRY	 We came in with less [growth] in nominal terms than was expected.

199202	216	GREENSPAN	 Yes. That's my view. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	217	MULLINS	 My view on that is that there's a strong intellectual case for moving the cone up. However, I wouldn't support that case because it would send the wrong signal. So, I think the way to handle it is to do what the Chairman suggests, which is to recognize an intention to be at the upper end of the cone next year. But this is the difficulty; it gives us flexibility but it's more [in the nature of] hypothetical flexibility. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	52.0
199202	218	PARRY	 In the Bluebook the implications were that we had to reduce interest rates by a fair amount--did you say 3/4 of a percentage point?--to achieve that. So, that is the issue [unintelligible] discussion that [unintelligible] relying on what happened last year. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	45.0

199202	226	BLACK	 Well, that's the really difficult issue and the reason I wish we could develop some other control mechanism, but I'll be darned if I know what else we can do. Most of M2 is not reservable and, given the market's proclivity for designing new instruments that would avoid any reserve requirements we put on existing instruments - - if indeed we did--unless we paid interest rates on the reserves, which is a political problem....

199202	229	GREENSPAN	 Yes. ﻿ 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	230	MELZER	 Don, what M2 growth would you consider consistent with price stability based on what we think longer-term relationships are? Is it the 3-1/4 percent in strategy II? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	42.0
199202	231	KOHN	 Right. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199202	232	MELZER	 In the out years is that-- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	42.0
199202	233	KOHN	 That largely reflects some remaining-- questionable in Jerry's terms--interest rate elasticity. That is, nominal interest rates are coming down so that you'd have to get a little extra [money growth]. If you believe the P* model and the assumption of a constant P* and the economy is growing at 2-1/4 percent--our current estimate of what the capacity of the economy is--presumably M2 over a long period of time would have to grow something on that order as well. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199202	234	MELZER	 Well, what if [unintelligible] will not accept zero measured inflation? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	42.0
199202	235	KOHN	 That would give you more like 3 or 3-1/4 percent, if you thought 1 percent measured inflation were equivalent to price stability. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199202	236	MELZER	 I have this view that, if we adjust our cones over the years, I don't want to get into a position where we need to move them back up if we can avoid it. Ideally, in a perfect world we'd like to ratchet those things down gradually, getting to a cone that's consistent in the long run with price stability. If we missed our cone, we'd explain why; but I don't envision a world in which we're juggling these things around. And I was trying to get some feel for how much further we have to go; probably we'd have to ratchet it down another percentage point, maybe a little more. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	42.0
199202	237	KOHN	 Yes, I think you're right about the price level and the measurement problems. So, I would say a range of about 1 to 5 percent would probably do it for you. We used to worry about what would happen as we approached price stability and nominal interest rates fell and we'd have this surge into M2 [assets] so that in order to keep the economy from plummeting at that point we'd have to pump in some more liquidity to meet that demand. But we've had our decline in nominal interest rates without a surge in M2, so perhaps this reentry problem isn't so bad unless long-term rates come down and we end up with 4 or 5 percent long-term rates with this thing. Then, all of a sudden those bond funds won't look so attractive relative to a 2 percent OCD or NOW account rate and we could get a surge of funds back into M2. So, there might be complications as we approach price stability, but I think your sense of around 3 percent in a steady state is probably [right]. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199202	238	MULLINS	 Do we have studies on the drift problem, the measurement problem, with zero inflation? You mentioned 1 percent. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	52.0
199202	239	KOHN	 There have been studies. I heard Bob Gordon give a paper at the Tokyo Conference--Dick Syron and Ed Boehne were there-- and his view was that something between 3/4 and 1-1/4 percent, given his sense of distortions, was about right. ﻿ 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199202	240	MULLINS	 At some time it might be useful to explore that issue in more detail because we are getting within shouting distance. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	52.0
199202	241	PRELL	 Governor Mullins, as you know, we distributed to all of the FOMC members a paper by Dave Stockton and colleagues which included a discussion of that issue, and there's further work being done. But we do have something that has gone out to the Committee. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199202	242	CORRIGAN	 [Unintelligible] very imperfect. The technical data are interesting both in the context of Dave Mullins's question and Tom Melzer's last question. If you look at the actual targets for M2 going all the way back to '83, once we got out of the recession, they have come down from 6 to 9 percent to 4 to 8 percent, to 3 to 7 percent, and to 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent. But if you look at the actual growth rates, in the first part of the period we had a base drift on the high side and in the second part a base drift on the low side. I think for that period as a whole we probably end up about having washed it all out. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	31.0

199202	246	FORRESTAL	 I would start on the tunnel, Mr. Chairman, by confessing to Mr. Lindsey and Mr. Black that I have spent very little time in Virginia. I only pass through occasionally, so I had no bias one way or the other. But I think the Chairman's points were well taken. The other thing I would add, Mr. Chairman, is something you didn't mention. It seems to me that to introduce this tunnel proposal at the time of the Humphrey-Hawkins report would raise an awful lot of pressure and would be counterproductive in the present environment. On the targets themselves, I would be very much in favor of keeping the targets that we established last July. To change them in either direction would send the wrong signal. To bring them down, which has obvious implications for price stability, is desirable in a theoretical sense but would seem to me to lead to the interpretation among market participants that we intend to moderate growth. And in this environment that would not be very appropriate. On the other hand, of course, raising them would give rise to the interpretation that we've given up on our fight against inflation or at least are moderating that attack. And that, too, would be the wrong signal to send. I think stability in the targets is what is called for now, so I would like to keep both M2 and M3 where they were. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	39.0

199202	248	PARRY	 Basically, I agree with what Bob Forrestal said. If you just took the staff forecast of M2 and M3, you could make an analytic case for reducing the ranges, particularly for M3. But I don't think that would be a very wise development at this time. So, my preference would be to leave the money and debt ranges at the tentative levels that we set in July. I must admit that I would be ﻿ interested in talking about this subject of the tunnels again in July, particularly after we've had an opportunity to look at some of the more technical issues like the base, etc. But at present I prefer to stick with the cone.

199202	252	HOENIG	 Given the circumstances that we have today, I would not be in favor of the tunnels. I think what we have now does give us the flexibility we need to move toward price stability, and that's what should be our focus. As for the alternatives here, I am in favor of alternative I for the reasons that have been given. That gives us the flexibility we need to continue to move toward price stability, and to adopt either of the other alternatives I think would give an incorrect signal at this time.

199202	256	MELZER	 I prefer alternative I; I could accept alternative II. First of all, I think alternative I is consistent with strategy II, which I believe in and I guess [other] people around the table also do. I just wanted to make one other point in connection with this. I think M2 is probably the best indicator we have of concurrent economic activity. It gives us some sense of how we're doing with respect to our goals. I have some problem calling it a target. I don't want to get into a semantic debate and I wouldn't suggest we change how we describe it, but in my view a good target is not only something that relates to our goals but is also directly controllable by our actions. As I mentioned yesterday, the component [of M2] we do control is only 25 percent of the total and our ability to indirectly influence [M2] through our influence on interest rates is questionable; I think the evidence that we've seen here recently calls that into question. This isn't a proposal but I urge people not to lose sight of things like reserves, the base, and narrow money that we do directly influence because I think they give us some indication of the thrust of monetary policy actions, which I don't think M2 really gives us. In that connection, I get somewhat troubled when I hear suggestions that we ought set as our longer-term goal somehow getting M2 into the upper end of the range that we're setting because if that happens under circumstances where we're getting no growth in non-Mi components of M2, we're talking about 25 to 30 percent Ml growth. One can scoff at Ml. but I feel very strongly that if we put that kind of stimulus into the system over a period of 6 to 12 months, ﻿ we will have big problems. Now, if we get into the upper end under different circumstances where Ml is much more controlled and some of those other components are growing, that's a different story. Anyway, I would urge that we not lose sight of those [measures]; I think we need to pay attention to them. I wouldn't advocate a target but we may even be at a point in time when we would want to monitor consciously or explicitly the behavior of a narrower [measure] that reflects the thrust of our objectives.

199202	263	HENDRICKS	" Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We continue to advocate a policy to achieve price stability, and the recent slowdown in inflation suggests that we're on track. To continue a gradual approach to that objective we would expect some downward shift in the M2 band in 1992. But we really don't know how long it will take or how big it will be. Ideally, in the year ahead we would prefer an M2 target range of 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent because that range corresponds more or less to our desired M2 growth by year-end, if conditions warrant. The ranges are wide enough to accommodate some makeup from last year's shortfall. As a practical matter, we could live with the ranges expressed in alternative II. We'd inch down the ranges and remind markets of our [intent] to achieve price stability over a reasonable period of time. Recognizing our recent progress in reducing the M2 growth trend, lowering the target range to center on a 4 percent midpoint would in our opinion enhance the credibility of our commitment to our long-term objective of reducing inflation. With respect to the tunnel approach, we were prepared to comment on it. As a matter of fact, we prepared an ""Ohio Plan"" handout. But as I listened to the discussion, I found that all the questions were answered and all the comments were made, so our plan wouldn't add much to the discussion. But we are interested in seeing a different approach at least kept on the table. "	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	55.0

199202	265	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	266	CORRIGAN	 I favor the alternative I tentative ranges from last year. I would certainly tolerate growth in the upper half ﻿ of the range if it could materialize in a context of developments in inflation and economic activity that are otherwise satisfactory. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
199202	267	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	268	ANGELL	 On a long-run basis, alternative II is clearly my preference. Real GDP between 1991 and 1996 grows at a 2.6 percent percent average annual rate under alternative II, which is just 0.2 percentage point lower than the 2.8 percent path under alternative I. Now, I know we don't have clear insight that these are accurate paths. I guess Don Kohn doesn't claim clear insight that these are accurate out [that far], but I do think this expresses exactly what we know to be the long-run relationship between monetary policy and economic growth. So, if I could end up in 1996 with zero inflation. . . . While we have 3/4 of a percent in the Bluebook table, clearly that falls within my notion of what zero inflation would be; I would guess that 3/4 to 1-1/2 percent would probably be real zero inflation if we measured properly. So, I have a clear preference for alternative II. I would admit, Mr. Chairman, that politically I think February 1992 is not a good time for you in your Humphrey-Hawkins report to announce this. Even though it would be a wonderful economic presentation and education, I think it would not be desirable for you to do that. And I can't imagine your wanting to do that. So, I will accommodate myself to one more year of begrudgingly voting for and accepting alternative I. But I do want us to be [where alternative II takes us]. And I do agree with Bill Hendricks and Tom Melzer that we must keep our vision on price level stability. Indeed, in the circumstances that we're in, that clear commitment to price level stability in the Humphrey-Hawkins report will do more to keep long- term rates down and I believe will give us a better growth path than we would get if we appear to be willing to re-inflate.

199202	270	MULLINS	 On the narrow issue, I would favor alternative I, and I would also favor and support the Vice Chairman's comments on being willing to tolerate growth in the upper end of the ranges under satisfactory economic and inflation circumstances. More generally, I think we're moving into new territory where considering these issues will be different than it was when we had ranges of 6 to 9 percent. We're nearing the end of a long and successful journey of ratcheting down these ranges and we're approaching a steady state. And I think we need to revisit the issue of how we operate in a steady state and what it is. But I support alternative I for next year. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	52.0
199202	271	GREENSPAN	 Let me just ask President Hoenig something. You indicated a preference for alternative I. Would you associate that with these remarks about tolerating the upper end of the range for that? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	272	HOENIG	 Yes. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	56.0

199202	274	GREENSPAN	 That's clear and I did not ask you! [Laughter] President Syron. ﻿ 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	275	SYRON	" Mr. Chairman, I also would be in favor of alternative I because, like everyone else, I have no confidence in what is going to happen in the future to return M2 growth to its ""normal path."" Since you asked specifically, I would be much more willing to be close to the edge at the upper side than the low side. In fact, I think that may be necessary and be consistent with what we have in the economy. So, given my own guess on what is going to happen to velocity, I would hope that we're at or toward the upper part of the range. It is essential that all this be taken in the context of continued progress toward price stability. As an add-on comment, I don't agree with Tom Melzer's enthusiasm for Ml and in that regard I would be enthusiastic about doing something to impose reserve requirements more broadly across the components of M2.

199202	276	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	277	STERN	 I, too, favor alternative I. On the question of where M2 ought to be within the range, I'm a little more conservative than some. M2 growth over the last 5 years has averaged a little over 4 percent, if I read those revised data [correctly]. If that's right, it seems to me that we ought to be careful about letting it veer very far from that on the up side lest we risk compromising what we have already put in place in terms of progress [toward] price stability. I don't think that's going to dissipate very quickly, but I believe we need to be sensitive to that. Clearly, there are some circumstances under which I would find more rapid M2 growth acceptable, but I'm urging a bit of caution at this point. Just to state the obvious, we always, so far as I know, accept a wide range of incoming information before deciding those kinds of questions. And as long as we continue to follow that policy, I guess I won't be troubled. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	41.0
199202	278	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	279	KEEHN	 Mr. Chairman, I would be in favor of alternative I. For the reasons we've articulated today and in any number of other meetings it seems to me that the [historical] relationships have broken down. As a consequence, to make a change would imply a greater degree of confidence in the aggregates than we currently have, at least in an operative sense. Moreover, if we were to make a change, either up or down, it would convey a policy message that I think at this particular point would be very inappropriate. So, I would be in favor of alternative I. As to where we might end up in the range, it's awfully early in the year to try to determine that. It does seem to me that in an operative sense we are really driving policy off a different measurement anyway. And I'd like to see how the economy seems to be developing as we get further into the year before trying to determine just where in the range M2 might properly be. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	35.0

199202	281	LINDSEY	 Mr. Chairman, I share President Black's good grace, and I concur with the obvious consensus for alternative I. With regard to where we end up in that range, I'd like to avoid a normative statement and make a positive statement. If we do not get the velocity shock, if the staff forecast of inflation is correct, and if in fact the economy has resumed growth as we think it might have ﻿ because of the money in the pipeline, then two meetings from now with 2.8 percent real economic growth we will not only be in the upper half of the target range, we will be at the very top of the target range. And I would be very interested in what the Committee decides in May should that come to pass. Thank you. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	54.0
199202	282	CORRIGAN	 Governor LaWare. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
199202	283	LAWARE	 Well, Mr. Chairman, I have a strong personal preference for alternative II. I think we have a precious opportunity here to press the attack on inflation, and the inflationary trend under alternative II is much more appealing to me than the rather slow progress under alternative I. I understand the pain in the growth rate [of the economy] and the unemployment figures that are consistent with that. And I understand the institutional risks that are probably inherent in making a change of that kind at this point in time. I believe that alternative II gives us enough range and enough flexibility to pursue an intelligent monetary policy that would not overly inhibit the growth of the economy. I'm just afraid that if we don't press the attack now, [inflation] may get away from us in the final analysis. Having said all of that, in order to clear my conscience, I am prepared to vote for alternative I. But, like Governor Angell, I would be very unhappy if the actual growth in M2 were anywhere near the top of the cone. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	50.0
199202	284	GREENSPAN	 President McTeer. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	285	MCTEER	" I basically agree with Governor LaWare. My real preference would be for alternative II but, for reasons that Governor Angell mentioned and those that Governor LaWare called ""institutional risks,"" as a practical matter I would opt for alternative I right now. But I, too, would like us to try to stay as close to the middle of the target range as we can. I think any inflection point in the growth of money supply is a shock to the system, and I don't see any point in going above or below [the midpoint] right now. I think we should always be moving asymptotically, if that is the word, toward the middle of the range. "	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	53.0

199202	288	MCTEER	 On the tunnel, I don't know what Sam Houston would think of the tunnel, but I have more sympathy for it than most of the people [who have spoken], especially if it were bent down at the end of next year to 3-1/2 percent. It would give us a tunnel that's very much like the tunnel that connects these two buildings, which works very well. It would eliminate base drift, and I don't believe it would be received badly by the financial markets. I think it would do two things that would be favored: One, it would indicate our willingness to speed up the rate of growth of money in the short run, which I think is needed; and, two, it would cap the rate of growth in the long run. which I think is needed. So, I hope we will revisit this issue soon. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	53.0
199202	289	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. ﻿ 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	290	KELLEY	 Mr. Chairman, I think this discussion has bracketed the situation very well. The higher ranges are simply a non-starter. The lower ranges are where we want to go but probably are not desirable now, which leaves us with the same ranges, those of alternative I. And that's certainly what I would support. As far as going into the upper part of the ranges, without enthusiasm I could support that for what I hope would be a fairly brief period of time. But I'm not enthusiastic about it or lusting after that. As for the tunnel versus the cone approach, I have a lot of sympathy with the tunnel idea. But I concur with your suggestion that this probably is not a good time to adopt it. I'd like to see it stay on the table; I'd like to see us watch it closely and look at some different ways to do it and have it be a continuing part of the dialogue. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	48.0

199202	293	GREENSPAN	 These two carpetbaggers! 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	294	PHILLIPS	 Right, these carpetbaggers. I do have sympathy for the tunnel plan, and I'd like to see it continue to be discussed and kept on the table because I think it is better for the long run. As a person who has not spent as much time on monetary policy matters as on other policy matters, I've noticed a tendency that whenever the time is inappropriate to make a change that's when it's on the table and is brought forward. If we were at the midpoint of the range, it probably would not be as much of an issue. I think it's very difficult to make policy changes when you're at the middle; there's just not an incentive to do it. I do understand the politics of the situation, so, like several others who have spoken, I'd like to see the tunnel plan remain on the table for discussion, particularly for looking at the long-range policy implications. I could support alternative I. Maybe I'm not even as optimistic as some; I'd like to see us get to the middle of the cone but I certainly could tolerate going to the upper parts of the ranges. If growth does get to the upper part of the range, I'd be willing to bet that there will be a discussion then for tightening. So, it will be interesting to follow this discussion as we move into the year. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	57.0

199202	296	CORRIGAN	 Mr. Chairman, I wonder if it might be a good idea for Governor LaWare to repeat briefly what he said when you were out of the room. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
199202	297	GREENSPAN	 Sure. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	298	MULLINS	 I took notes. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	52.0
199202	299	GREENSPAN	 He said he preferred alternative II, but- - ﻿ 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	300	LAWARE	 I said I personally preferred alternative II because I thought we had a precious opportunity right now to pursue the attack on inflation. And the [Bluebook] trend line under alternative II in winning that fight against inflation sooner rather than later was very appealing to me. I was afraid that if we stuck with alternative I, the inflation objective might escape us. I'm well aware of the pain involved with regard to the [economic] growth rate and the unemployment numbers. But it seems to me that the long-term public policy interest might better be served by pursuing alternative II. At the same time, I think there are significant institutional risks in making that kind of change at this time, even though the ranges [of alternative II] probably give us enough flexibility to do whatever we want to do with monetary policy. So, I would vote for alternative I, but like Governor Angell, I would prefer to stay toward the lower part of the range described rather than allow a drift up to the top. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	50.0
199202	301	GREENSPAN	 Well, let me make the following proposal. First of all. there is obviously sufficient interest in pursuing the tunnel proposal to keep it on the table and keep it on the agenda. We will look at it. That would essentially [address] Governor Phillips' concern, on which I think she is quite right: namely, that when things are easy and normal and you don't think there's a problem, then you don't spend any time on it. But let's make sure that we do and do that readily by putting it on the agenda the next time this issue comes up, and keep it there until we lose interest in it or decide to use it. Let's keep it in a context where it can be an alternative. Secondly, it's clear that we have a large majority of the voting members in favor of alternative I, with a majority willing to accept-- should it occur as a result of market forces-- growth in the upper end of the range. But in our official statements relative to this, I think it's important that we insert in our [explanation] that we do not wish to lose the gains that we have achieved with respect to price stability and that our actions with respect to monetary policy over the long run will be very sensitive to that particular [issue]. What that implies in actual action is that we might accept [growth in] the upper portion of the cone, but with some reluctance, and certainly not as a permanent phenomenon. So, what I would like to put on the table for a vote at this point is alternative I with language in the Humphrey-Hawkins report somewhat similar to the way Jerry put it, but including immediately thereafter a comment that the gains in price stability have been extremely valuable to this economy and that it's certainly our strong desire--or some [wording] even much more formidable than that--to make certain that those gains not be dissipated. I won't give you exact language but in rough form would ask if that is acceptable to the Committee to vote on. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	302	ANGELL	 I have a question, Mr. Chairman. Isn't there some danger in that? I agree that the majority of the voting members would accept the upper part of the range. But if we said that in the Humphrey-Hawkins report, doesn't that then put us in the position of appearing to have [that as the] actual desired range? Suppose money growth is weaker than we anticipate. Even though we might end up, let's say, cutting the fed funds rate one or two times, we might still have weak growth. Would that not then cause our critics in Congress ﻿ to say to us: You really acted as if you wanted to be in the upper end and then you didn't [even] get to the middle. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
199202	303	GREENSPAN	 Well, I think we would be subject to that [criticism] no matter what we did. But the language that Don or the Vice Chairman used I don't think puts us into that position. We're not saying we're going to force [money growth] into the upper part of the range; but if market forces were to do that, we would not be acting strenuously to push it down. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	304	MELZER	 There would be no reason for people to presume that we would be anyway if growth were in the range. Isn't that right? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	42.0
199202	305	GREENSPAN	 Well, I would hope so, but one doesn't know. There's another alternative. We can leave it out of the official text and I could use that in the questions and answers-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	306	ANGELL	 I would prefer that. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0

199202	309	GREENSPAN	 Okay. Why don't we leave it out then and I will, if the issue surfaces, find appropriate language in the Q&A portion of the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to put that on the table. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199202	310	PARRY	 In your statement about the ultimate objective of price stability or something close to it, would it be well to underline the fact that in subsequent years this would most likely require further declines in our targets? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	45.0
199202	311	GREENSPAN	 If that comes up in the Q&A, I would answer in the affirmative; I have in the past. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0

199202	313	GREENSPAN	 Yes, I suspect it has been true of all of us when that issue has come up.

Since the vote and during the recess, I've been thinking about the presentational difficulties that you might have and that, from your view, unanimity on the 1992 targets is the desirable thing.

LR2	LR2	2.0	1.0	47.0
199202	324	KOHN	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. There has been a great deal of discussion about how much ease might be ìin the pipelineî, with a critical bearing on your decision about the stance of policy in the period immediately ahead. Some of what is meant by this is difficult to quantify, since it refers to progress that has been made in redressing financial imbalances and building up capital by both borrowers and lenders. Other measures--especially those involving rates or prices in financial markets are easier to quantify--though perhaps not to interpret. The latter are given in the financial indicators package, along with measures of money growth. It is instructive to look at these indicators to see what they suggest about how much easing of monetary policy the Committee has done in recent months. Two base periods suggest themselves for comparison as times when, in retrospect, policy was probably tighter than was consistent with the kind of economic performance the Committee seems to be looking for in 1992 and 1993. One is the first half of 1990, before the Gulf War, when it appears that the economy could well have been in the process of weakening in any case. The other is the spring or summer of 1991, when policy last thought it was positioned to support an expansion. The results of this comparison are somewhat mixed. One important channel for monetary policy is the exchange rate. The weighted average value of the dollar is appreciably lower than it was in the first half of 1990 or last spring and early summer. It has fallen relative to those base periods in both nominal and real terms--the latter by about 10 percent. The other policy variable giving unambiguous signals for a boost to economic activity is short-term real interest rates. It is clear that the Federal Reserve's easings have significantly outpaced the drop in inflation expectations. Short-term real rates may be 3 to 4 percentage points below their levels in the first half of 1990, and a significant portion of that has occurred in the last few months. Participants in capital markets apparently see these developments as favoring a strong rebound. Stock prices and price-earnings ratios are at all-time highs. Although bond rates are down from a few months ago, the yield curve is remarkably steep. Concerns about potential fiscal stimulus as well as about looming supply, from the federal government and private borrowers, probably are contributing to this configuration, but it seems unlikely that such a steep yield curve could persist in the face of real pessimism about the economic outlook, or optimism about the prospects for price stability. However, the still-high long-term rates that contribute to the pitch of the yield curve also are one indicator that, perhaps in contradiction to market expectations, less may be in the pipeline than is suggested by short-term rates or the exchange rate. Measurement of long-term real rates is probably even more tenuous than for short-term real rates. What measures we have, however, show some reduction since the first half of 1990 or summer of 1991, but still a moderately high level when compared to averages over a longer span. Both theory and empirical work indicate that real long-term rates are a better measure of what influences spending than are real short-term rates. Perhaps reflecting the modest drop in real long-term rates, commodity price indexes remain relatively flat, below their levels in the two base periods. The other indicator raising questions about the degree of ease is the growth of M2. Both in the first half of 1990 and in spring 1991 this aggregate was growing faster than it seems to be now. M2 has picked up in the second half of January, and we see 4-3/4 percent growth for February, elevated partly by the absence of year-end distortions that held down the January monthly average. But this would leave M2 only 3-3/4 percent above its fourth quarter 1991 base, and staff is projecting a slowing in M2 growth in March. Part of that slowing reflects our view that aggressive lowering of offering rates will cause a further redirection of savings away from assets in this aggregate. In addition, the pace of RTC activity is expected to pick up substantially in February and even were so in March, as that agency attempts to utilize funding authorized only through March. To be sure, as was discussed in connection with the long-run ranges, we would view this weakness as primarily a shift in demand, fully consistent with the pickup in spending forecast in the greenbook. But sluggish expansion of M2, especially if it were to drop appreciably below a 3-1/2 percent growth track from the fourth quarter, might also raise questions about whether policy was positioned to promote solid economic expansion, should it come to pass, also could not be seen as very bullish for the economy, even with the special explanations. Thus, as I noted, the picture of how much might be ìin the pipelineî is mixed: real short-term rates and exchange rates are down, but real long-term rates and M2 as well as other measures of financial flows are somewhat ambiguous. Given the state of the economy and associated downward pressure on inflation, this configuration might be seen from one perspective as arguing for additional ease to better assure recovery. Nominal bond yields likely would fall in response, since any increase in inflation expectations in the current circumstances probably would be muted, and easier monetary policy should have an unambiguous, albeit small, effect on real long-term rates. Money growth should also respond, though perhaps not by much, since the yield curve would steepen and depositors might accelerate shifts into capital market instruments. On the other hand, the possibility that earlier monetary actions could exert considerable expansionary force on the economy, with a lag, might argue for more ìwatchful waitingî, at least for a short time. Additional ease might be indicated if money begins to drop below its 3 percent December-to-March path, or if incoming data suggest a weaker underlying situation in the economy than previously expected, or a lack of even early glimmerings of a response to previous easing actions. If the risks were seen as skewed to the downside, or the costs of a shortfall greater than those of a bit stronger growth than anticipated, the directive could be made asymmetrical on the easing side, implying a fairly prompt response to indicators that further reduction in money market rate was appropriate. 	21	21	2.0	0.0	999.0
199202	325	GREENSPAN	 Thank you. Questions for Don? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
199202	326	ANGELL	 Don, I guess this is a question for Ted Truman as well as for you. When we look at the real exchange value of the dollar, I presume we do not make any attempts to adjust for differences in the measurement of inflation in the United States versus that in the other G-7 countries. If most of us tend to believe that we might be as much as 1 percentage point off on our measurement ﻿ of inflation, over a period a time that 1 percentage point compounded could give us quite a distortion in terms of the real exchange value of the dollar. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
199202	327	TRUMAN	 Well, I think there are two factors. One is the question as to relative distortion that you want to focus on. I guess a priori my view would be that in some sense the relative distortion would be larger in the major industrial countries abroad than it is here. We probably spend more time purifying our CPI than do some of the other industrial countries, which biases [their estimates] in the other direction. Moreover, just in the short run, we have a phenomenon because what we use here are consumer price indexes. There are cases for using other price indexes. It's like everything else: There's nothing perfect. It depends on what you are trying to prove. Certainly, in the short run, we have had a situation where there have been a number of shocks to the consumer price level abroad. These are the result in the last couple of years of excise tax increases and things like that: for example, [goods and services] tax in Canada, the [value added] tax in the United Kingdom, etc. So, the foreign price level, in a truly competitive sense, is probably somewhat inflated relative to the CPI measures. And that goes back for the last couple of years. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
199202	328	ANGELL	 It seems to me that in places like Japan, by using rents as the equivalent to owner-occupied homes and then having rent control, they understate their rate of inflation. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
199202	329	TRUMAN	 I think that's a possibility. We looked at it a couple of months ago [and] we were not convinced that it was as understated as you suspect it may be. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
199202	330	ANGELL	 All right. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
199202	331	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
199202	332	PARRY	 Mr. Chairman, I wanted to ask you a question. Do you think that there is in the market and the Congress a tradeoff between what we do and their enthusiasm for fiscal policy? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	45.0
199202	333	GREENSPAN	 I think there's some. There's a view in the market that if it is perceived that the Fed is shut down and won't be doing anything more, that will induce increased fiscal activity, so to speak, on the Hill. I don't know whether it's true; it's hard to judge. It's probably true in part. How important it is, I really don't know. A number of people believe that in the market; I think that is a fact. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
199202	334	PARRY	 If rates were cut 50 basis points, would it alter the dialogue, the momentum, etc? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	45.0
199202	335	GREENSPAN	 I'm not sure. I think there's something to it, but I would not want to move policy on the presumption that it might create a more balanced fiscal policy. I frankly doubt it. Any further questions for Don? Well, why don't I get started. I think the issue of the extent of monetary policy [easing still] in the pipeline can be looked at in a somewhat different way. And it, too, suggests some effects ﻿ but it is by no means complete. If we judge that the major problem confronting us is the balance sheet strain created by the rise in debt and, in certain instances, by a fall on the asset side of both household and business balance sheets, the business balance sheets obviously would have to fall in value in substantial part because of [declines in] real estate. Any decline in values on the asset side of the household sector is rather [questionable]. Obviously, there's a belief that residential real estate values have fallen, but that's very hard to prove. I think it is the case that equities have declined some as debt has eaten into the value of real estate, but it's not by any means obvious that it's on the asset side. What I think is essentially the case here is that the debt overhang is creating a diversion of disposable personal income on the one hand and corporate cash flows on the other more toward repairing balance sheet relationships rather than consumption and investment expenditures. And this may be showing up in some increase in the saving rate, but that remains to be seen. Obviously, in the month of December the [published] saving rate at 5.8 percent is a very weak statistic, and the range of error is considerable. Nonetheless, it is consistent with the employment of disposable income for the reduction of debt and, therefore, an increase in the net equity of households-- meaning saving rather than consumption expenditures. This implies, as we've discussed before, that [households and businesses] need to repair these balance sheets as a necessary condition to initiate expansion. The evidence clearly suggests that that is underway. We are looking at a very significant amount of corporate equity de-leveraging in a number of corporate balance sheets. We are looking at a very high level of corporate debt issuance, in part to refinance high interest debt but also presumably to pay off short-term liabilities and improve the liquidity position of the corporate balance sheets. Now, clearly, the decline in interest rates is showing up in the various [ratios of] interest costs to cash flow both in the business and in the household sectors. And in that sense the debt burden is moving down. So, one can clearly see the impact of the combination of Federal Reserve policy on the short end and decreasing inflation expectations on the long end beginning to repair balance sheets in precisely the way one would presume that markets trying to repair themselves would function. The question is: How far has this gone? I think the answer is that we don't really know; it has gone part way, but there's no evidence that we're anywhere near the point where a significant easing in [strains on] balance sheets has occurred enough to restore the normal recovery forces in the economy. At this point, all the evidence suggests that output is essentially flat. The weekly data that we have on industrial production suggest that there was a decline in January but probably no further follow-through in February. Indeed, it's possible that February may be moving back. What one can say in general is that while the balance sheets apparently are being repaired, the economy is on hold; and there is no real evidence to suggest that that's about to change quickly. I think the inflationary forces continue to recede, and I would be not surprised to find that actual price data come in under the Greenbook [forecast]. I hope that is, in fact, the case. I suspect that if we have any surprises in that area, that's probably where they are going to come out. ﻿ This leads me basically to the obvious question of some evidence of improvement in confidence, which a number of you mentioned yesterday. And that strikes me as probably a reflection of previous Federal Reserve actions, because we're not picking it up in any of the general surveys. We're getting it largely from more sophisticated people who would be responding to the type of things we might be doing. We are seeing evidence--at the moment mainly anecdotal but to some extent real--in residential housing: in housing sales and in starts and permits. And that appears to be creating some positive elements. But for the moment we are reaching if in fact we are stipulating that the economy has turned up. There is no evidence of which I am aware that supports that view. Nonetheless, it's my personal view that we probably have done enough to put the economy on track eventually. But I'm willing to acknowledge that we may not have. Since I think the probability that we would want to move interest rates higher or tighten in the intermeeting period approaches zero and that there is at least a non- negative probability that we might want to ease during the period, I would conclude--if that's the view of the Committee--that something like alternative B, with normal asymmetric language toward ease is appropriate, without specifying a presumption that any action is contemplated during the period other than what one would assume under the normal procedures with asymmetric language. I put that on the table for your reactions and would be curious to get the judgments of other members. President Syron. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199202	336	SYRON	" Mr. Chairman, I guess my longer-term objective here is to have to vote for tighter policy as soon as possible. And that has something to do with how we behave in the interim period. I'm inclined to agree that we have put a lot of stimulus in the pipeline and that it's more likely that we're going to see an upturn than a further slide. But I am concerned about [specifying] an asymmetry of risks or costs [and] being wrong on one side or the other. We [are not sure] about the forecast, anyone's forecast. That raises, of course, the issue of risks and insurance and how long one waits. I think we're going to have to wait a while to see data that are really conclusive in one direction or the other. I do think, and Governor Phillips raised this point yesterday, that we may be in a situation--I don't want to use the term ""window""--where it's easier for us to make a change now than it may be later as we come closer to a season that may be seen as more political and also as we get into the midst of all this fiscal policy business. Those things would argue for ease because I think we are in the midst of this long cycle that we've talked about, and our role is to facilitate lending. The best thing we can do to facilitate the long cycle adjustment is to have a stronger economy. Where all this leaves me at the end of the day is that I would favor easing sooner rather than later. But I am aware of the time in which we operate and I think we are in a period in which there's a great deal of concern about confidence in the government as a whole. That point is very well taken. And in that environment, it's nice to see one organization that has some element of stability. So, to tell you the truth, while I would prefer to ease now, short of that, which we won't get [consensus on], I prefer strong asymmetry. In this business of nuances, I'd find acceptable what you suggest but would prefer the other side. ﻿ "	23	23	2.0	1.0	51.0
199202	337	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199202	338	PARRY	 Mr. Chairman, given the prospect of a moderate upturn at least incorporated in most of our expectations, I would prefer alternative B. I do think, though, that the uncertainties are as you indicated, and that would lead me to be very supportive of asymmetry to provide for significant further ease. Two points with regard to that: It would be my view that if we were to ease, it probably should be of some significance because public visibility for the event would probably be desirable; secondly, my own feeling is that it probably would be desirable for that ease to come sooner rather than later. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
199202	339	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199202	340	FORRESTAL	 Mr. Chairman, I think the appropriate course for monetary policy at the moment is to stay where we are. As has been indicated several times around this table over the past day or two, there is a good deal of stimulus in the pipeline. And as we look back at our history, we certainly have made the mistake of overdoing it on either side of the equation over time, and I hope we won't repeat that mistake. I think what we need at this time, as other people have said, is some patience to let our policy feed its way through to the economy. So, I would support your recommendation of no change at the moment and, therefore, I would support alternative B. I must say that before the meeting I was more inclined toward a symmetric directive but, having reflected on it overnight, I think the uncertainties in the forecast are such that we ought to be in a position--you ought to be in a position--to move rapidly in the event that incoming data indicate that that's the appropriate course of action. So, I, too, would support an asymmetric directive. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	39.0
199202	341	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199202	342	BOEHNE	 I think this is a time for patience and watchful waiting. On the question of symmetry or asymmetry, if I were voting, I could accept either. I agree with your logic that the chances of tightening are essentially nil and that there is some chance for easing. So, there is something to be said for asymmetry and I would support it. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
199202	343	GREENSPAN	 President Hoenig. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199202	344	HOENIG	" I, too, am inclined to follow your recommendation. First of all, I'd start by saying that there is a lot [of stimulus] in the pipeline and we should be patient. However, as I mentioned yesterday, our projections are that the real economy might actually grow more slowly than what is in the Greenbook forecast, and that gives me some pause. I also am concerned about the growth of M2, which I think has been erratic and too slow. So, I am inclined to go with ""B"" asymmetric toward ease, but I would wait until we have some more information on the real economy and on M2 before I would charge forward. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	56.0
199202	345	GREENSPAN	 First Vice President Hendricks. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199202	346	HENDRICKS	 We've had several years of moderate growth and our view is that the inflation trend appears to be a decline to 3 ﻿ percent and that it may be getting down even beyond that. We see the basic thrust of policy as being consistent with that outlook: that is, 3 percent inflation in '92 and 2 percent, perhaps, in '93. Therefore, we feel that the FOMC does have some room for further easing if the policy action that was adopted in December does not stimulate growth in money and credit. M2 seems to have been particularly erratic over the past month or so, making it difficult to judge just what sort of growth track we're really on. For the year we'd like growth in M2 of 3-1/2 percent or so and we would not like to see any significant shortfall from that path this quarter. Consequently, we would like to see further easing in policy should the incoming data suggest that M2 is weakening from current levels. Our position for now, however, is in line with the Greenbook projection and your suggestion, Mr. Chairman. We would support alternative B with asymmetry toward ease. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	55.0
199202	347	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199202	348	MELZER	" I would prefer ""B"" symmetric, but I have absolutely no problem with what you recommended. If there were a presumption of another easing step in the asymmetry, I'd have a lot of trouble with that. I agree with you that I don't think we can do anything with our policy that is going to affect what we get in fiscal policy. The politicians are going to have to be seen to be doing something, and they can't just stipulate that the Fed has taken care of it and they don't have to do anything. So, I agree with your analysis on that. The only other thing I would suggest--perhaps this is partly tongue in cheek but not totally--is that we ought to get an alternative C back in the Bluebook. We have recognized all along that we were probably going to overshoot on the way down here. There's a statement in the Bluebook that was music to my ears about unsustainably low real short-term interest rates. Now, they can become sustainable, I know, through two courses. But. at any rate, I think we ought to get used to looking at an alternative C because there could be circumstances where we're going to get some rope back, and it might be better to move on that sooner in small steps rather than later and not let too much build up. I have no problem with alternative C not being in there for this meeting. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
199202	349	GREENSPAN	 Governor LaWare. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199202	350	LAWARE	" Mr. Chairman, my personal preference would have been to have symmetric language with ""B"" for two reasons. First of all, I have strong reservations about whether further ease in monetary policy is going to affect the outcome significantly. And secondly, symmetric language would tend to enforce a posture of patience on us more rigidly. On the other hand, I accept the argument that we need a safety valve of some kind here that can be used in the event that circumstances change dramatically from what they are now. Consequently, I can support your recommendation of ""B,"" asymmetric. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	50.0
199202	351	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199202	352	KEEHN	 Mr. Chairman, to state the obvious, this is a very difficult period to try to assess both the current as well as the ﻿ prospective environment. There may have been at least a mini- improvement in the balance from the last meeting but, as I said yesterday, I still think the risks are very much on the down side at this point. And the policy directive should reflect that risk. I think it's perhaps too soon to ease again; moreover, we don't have a credible basis on which we could make that kind of change. But if the incoming data begin to show further deterioration, I'd move and I'd move quickly. Therefore, I'd be in favor of your recommendation for alternative B with asymmetric language toward ease. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	35.0
199202	353	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0

199202	356	BLACK	 I agree with you, Mr. Chairman. I might point out that Friday we will get the unemployment report and if we get a surprise on that on the down side you could, of course, schedule a conference call to decide what to do and where to go from there. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0

199202	359	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199202	360	ANGELL	 Mr. Chairman, I can certainly support your recommendation. But I would like to indicate my strong preference, if easing does appear to be appropriate, that we time it with more forward-looking indicators and avoid creating the impression that monetary policy is tied to the real economy. If that [latter] impression is developed, then the bond market will anticipate, rightly or wrongly, that a rebound in growth means we're going to tighten. Whereas if the monetary aggregates--and I might even mention commodity prices--were to indicate the desirability of having a lower fed funds rate, it would be clear that any easing that we do would really not be easing in the sense that money growth was below target and we were trying to keep monetary policy neutral by not pegging the fed funds rate high. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0

And given that the uncertainties are high, we [ought] to go to the normal kind of analysis, which is a loss function. I think the loss function is much greater on the down side than on the up side. Secondly, [we need to ask]: ""How easily can we correct policy?"" Again, it's much easier to correct policy if we are surprised on the up side than if we're surprised on the down side. So, I think you selected exactly the right course of action. ﻿ "	23	23	2.0	1.0	54.0

And I will support asymmetry as well because if there's a move in this period, very clearly it's going to be on the easing side rather than on the tightening side.
