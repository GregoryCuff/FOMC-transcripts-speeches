198902	8	CROSS	 The dollar has risen more or less continuously for the  past two months, nearly offsetting the decline of the previous  two months. The dollar's rise has come as robust growth in the  United States economy has led to expectations of higher dollar interest  rates, and as confidence has grown that the Bush administration  will offer constructive and effective solutions to the nation's  well known economic and financial problems.  At times during this period upward pressure on the  dollar became intense. The Desk intervened on behalf of the United States  authorities on various occasions in operations that were in  general closely coordinated with foreign central banks. In all,  since the December FOMC meeting the Desk has sold more than  $2 billion dollars (all of it against marks) while foreign  central banks have sold more than $3 1/2 billion in coordinated  operations. At present levels, the dollar is just below its  period highs, and is roughly 7 1/2 percent higher against the  mark and 5 1/2 percent higher against the yen than it was at the  time of your last meeting.  During December, many market observers were attributing  the dollar's rise to year-end technical factors. Market dynamics  seemed to propel the dollar higher, as both dealers and  corporations reduce the short dollar positions built up during  the dollar's steep decline in November.  As the year end approached, however, it became apparent  that other factors were also contributing to improved sentiment  toward the dollar:  Successive signs of strong United States economic growth  encouraged market participants to expect that United States  interest rates would continue to move higher.    Market attitudes toward the Bush administration turned  more positive as observers noted that key positions  were being filled with experienced, pragmatic  individuals.  Conciliatory statements from the President-elect and  Congressional leaders left the market with the  impression that serious and good faith efforts would be  undertaken by both sides to reduce the budget deficit.  When trading resumed after the holidays, the factors  that had supported the dollar in late December continued to  encourage dollar buying in the new year. As investors began to  reassess the situation in the new year against the background of  the dollar's rise in December, and its relatively good  performance throughout 1988, there were widespread reports of  Japanese and European interest in dollar-denominated assets.  There were also reports of dehedging by investors, as the dollar  looked less likely to fall, and as the costs of hedging rose with  the declining United States yield curve. And, as a safe haven currency,  the dollar on occasion also benefited from tensions, actual and  rumored, in Libya and the Middle East.  During early January the dollar's rise gained  considerable momentum as further evidence appeared that United States  economic activity was still growing strongly. During these  episodes of upward pressure, coordinated central bank  intervention helped to restrain the dollar's rise. But the  underlying attitude toward the dollar remained bullish. The  dollar moved higher even after Germany and several other European  countries announced increases in official interest rates in mid-  December and again in late January, and despite a modest decline  in long-term interest rate differentials favoring the dollar.  The dollar's buoyancy has been particularly notable  against the German mark. From another point of view, it can be  said that the central banks have been undertaking a substantial  mark support operation. They have bought nearly $11 billion  equivalent of marks during the inter-meeting period, not counting  the Bundesbank's rechanelling of troop dollars and other  receipts. The $11 billion of mark purchases includes almost  $5 1/2 billion worth from sales of dollars by the United States  authorities, the Bundesbank, and other central banks, plus $5 1/2  billion worth of marks purchased by European and other central  banks against their own currencies.  The market seems to hold a relatively pessimistic view  of the prospects for DM investments. Since the last EMS  realignment two years ago, European countries have shown  themselves more willing to use monetary policy to avoid a buildup  of pressures in the exchange market. Without the prospect of a  near-term realignment, investors have moved funds into higher-  yielding currencies, and also to countries in Europe that seem  especially well poised to reap the benefits of 1992 for example,  Spain. These factors have contributed to a relatively weak mark,  and indeed German capital outflows have exceeded the current  account surpluses throughout 1988.  The market's present view is that the dollar will  likely trade with a firm undertone at least for the time being.  But there are developments which could change the picture.  Although the market shrugged off last month's very disappointing  report of the latest United States trade figures, another set of bad trade  numbers on February 17 could cause a reassessment. Also the  dollar could become vulnerable to selling pressures if the  optimistic expectations of the Administrations effectiveness  prove unfounded, and much attention is now focused on the  President's budget presentation tomorrow.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to seek approval of the  operations conducted during the period. Since the day you last  met, the Desk sold a total of $1,115 billion for the Federal  Reserve and an equal amount for the Treasury, all against German  marks. In other operations, the Desk purchased a total of  $37 million equivalent of Japanese yen on behalf of the United States  Treasury to augment reserves. The central bank of Argentina  repaid $46.9 million of its swap drawing from the United States Treasury.  I would also like to inform you that all of the Federal Reserve  swap arrangements with other central banks have been renewed for  one year, as authorized by the Committee last November. 	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0

198902	13	STERNLIGHT	 Since the last Committee meeting, in mid-December, the  Domestic Desk implemented the two-stage firming of reserve conditions  agreed on at that meeting. The planned borrowing allowance was raised  by $100 million to $500 million following the December meeting, and  then to $600 million on January 5. Day-to-day funds rates rose  somewhat more than was expected in association with the higher  borrowing levels, partly reflecting year-end pressures, exacerbated at  times by reserve shortfalls and market anticipations of further policy  firming.  In the December 28 reserve period, funds averaged 8-7/8  percent, compared to the roughly 8-1/2 percent level preceding the  last meeting and the 8-5/8 - 3/4 percent that the Desk initially  anticipated with $500 million of borrowing. In the next reserve  period, which included year-end, funds averaged 9.15 percent; while  the rate receded to 9.08 percent in the second week of that period  this was still a touch to the firm side of the expected 9 percent area  after adopting the $600 million borrowing allowance. Funds averaged a  continued firm 9.09 percent in the January 25 period while the first  week of the current period saw a further firming to 9.16 percent as  Treasury balances at the Fed climbed above expectations. In the first  couple of days of February, with reserves more abundant as Treasury  balances ebbed, the rate slipped back to the anticipated 9 percent  area, only to push higher again last Friday in the wake of the strong  employment report for January and anticipations of imminent further  policy firming. Today it's back around 9 percent.  For the period as a whole, actual borrowing levels averaged  fairly close to path levels--roughly $50 million below the $560  million average path level. Funds averaged a shade over 9 percent for  the whole period. But the averaging conceals significant divergences  on either side. The more predominant and persistent tendency was for  borrowing to fall well short of path allowances, even while funds  rates pressed to the high side of anticipated ranges. This tendency  was partly offset by a few instances of heavier borrowing, most  notably over the long New Year weekend, which lifted average borrowing  in the January 11 reserve period to $840 million.  The variability of borrowing and, for the most part, its  tendency to run light, has left current estimates of the borrowing-  funds rate relationship on particularly shaky ground, calling time and  again for an exercise of flexibility in regarding path levels of  borrowing, in order to avoid generating misleading signals in the  implementation of policy. From the perspective of market  participants, who appear to be about equally uncertain as ourselves  about these relationships, the recent period saw a firming in planned  borrowing from about $400 million to $500 or $600 million; meantime  expected funds rates, in their view, moved from around 8-1/2 percent  in mid-December to 9 - 9-1/8 percent by early February, with a further rise now in train to perhaps 9-1/4 - 3/8 or even 9-1/4 - 1/2 percent  in the wake of the recent employment surge.  The execution of operations during the period was complicated  by a number of factors besides the uncertain borrowing-funds rate  relationship. These included hard-to-predict Treasury balances, other  reserve factor vagaries, and typical year-end uncertainties about  demand for excess reserves. The Desk faced sizable reserve needs in  the first two maintenance periods, covering the latter half of  December and part way through January. Outright purchases in this  period were confined to a moderate $680 million of bills and notes  bought from foreign accounts while the bulk of the reserve need was  met through repurchase agreements. This permitted the Desk to phase  in reserves carefully, allowing the desired modest firming to show  through, while also avoiding an excessive build-up in the seasonal  need to drain reserves early in the new year. In fact, the seasonal  need to drain did not emerge clearly until just about the end of  January, having been delayed by unusually high Treasury balances after  the mid-January tax date. This meant that temporary reserve  injections were still employed in the latter half of January, while at  the same time a start was made in lightening outright holdings through  bill run-offs and sales of bills and notes to foreign accounts. By  the start of February, with reserves becoming over-abundant, the Desk  sold about $3 billion of bills in the market, a record amount for such  sales and the first market sale in two years. Bill redemptions in the  latter part of the period totaled $1.8 billion (including some run off  in yesterday's auction to be redeemed this Thursday). Sales to  foreign accounts came to about $380 million while about $240 million  of agency issues matured without replacement. Net for the full  period, outright holdings were reduced by $4.8 billion on a commitment  basis. Reserve absorption has been augmented in recent days through  sizable matched sale/purchase transactions in the market, while a  moderate matched sale/purchase was also undertaken on January 20 when  it appeared that reserves were in over-supply.  Interest rates showed mixed changes over the recent period,  as short-term Treasury issues rose in yield in response to a firmer  policy while longer maturities were steady to slightly lower in  yield--responding to the stronger dollar and to a sense that  inflationary forces will be contained, if necessary by still greater  policy firming. In the background, a feeling--not too clearly  defined--that the new Administration would be able to deal effectively  with the budget deficit and other economic problems also imparted some  sense of confidence to longer-term markets.  At the short end, rates on Treasury bills rose about 20 to 60  basis points, with the largest increases in the 3-month area, roughly  matching the rise in the funds rate. In the latest bill auctions, 3-  and 6-month issues were sold yesterday at 8.57 and 8.53 percent,  respectively, up from 7.98 and 8.21 percent just before the last  meeting. The coupon-equivalent yields on these bills closely  surrounded 9 percent, while the comparable market yield on one-year  bills exceeded that level by 15 basis points at the period's end. The  Treasury paid down about $8 billion in the bill area as the redemption  of $11 billion of cash management bills after the December tax date  more than offset modest net issuance of regular bills.  Short-and intermediate-term Treasury coupon issues, up to  about 5 years, also rose in yield over the period--by about 20 basis  points in the 1- to 2-year area and smaller margins with increased  maturity. Earlier this afternoon, the Treasury sold new 3-year notes  at an average rate of about 9.18 percent. That's about the high point  of the current yield curve. Beyond about 5 years, there were net  yield declines over the period, very slight for intermediate terms but  up to 10 or 12 basis points at 30 years, reducing the 30-year yield to  about 8.85 percent. Increased confidence in the dollar was a  persistent favorable factor for longer Treasury issues, and in turn  the stronger dollar was partly attributable to the market's sense that  monetary policy had firmed a bit more and could be counted on to move  further if necessary to deal with inflation. Business news was  regarded as consistent with moderate to somewhat vigorous expansion,  flirting with what the monetary authorities might regard as a maximum  tolerable rate of speed. Price developments suggested that  inflationary pressures, while probably lurking in the background, were  not breaking out. Confidence was such that even a bad trade number,  published in mid-January, was brushed off. Counting the ongoing  quarterly financing, the Treasury will have raised about $17 billion,  net, in the coupon area since mid-December. These supplies are being  fairly readily absorbed, especially in the long end where foreign  buying continues, and domestic funds managers continue to stretch out  maturities to match investment duration with long-term commitments.  Rates on private short-term instruments showed little net  change over the period despite the rise in funds and bill rates, and  in fact rates on one-month paper such as CDs and commercial paper were  somewhat lower, probably reflecting the passage of year-end. More  generally, the relative stability of these rates for 3- to 12-month  maturities may have reflected an unwinding of the pressures that had  pushed these rates up more than comparable Treasury rates before year-  end.  On the other hand, longer-term corporates did not show the  same price gains as long Treasury issues over the period. Issuance of  high-grade bonds was light but risk of down-gradings continued to  weigh on the market. In the high-yield sector, attention focused on  the bonds and notes to finance the $25 billion RJR-Nabisco buyout,  which appear to be getting placed handily. This deal is expected to  be settled in the next day or two. Incidentally, the Drexel firm  appears to have performed a major role in this financing despite a  continuing stream of publicity about its acquiescence to fines and  guilty pleas related to past activities.  The situation of the thrift industry and potential related  bond sales to support bail-outs generated discussion during the period  but seemed to have had little visible market price impact, including  reaction this morning to the plans outlined by the Administration late  yesterday. Spreads paid by the Home Loan Banks for their regular  issues remain moderate. Spreads on FICO issues have retained the  narrower range that developed in the wake of recent auctions for these  issues, with the new supply largely being sold in stripped form.  Two firms withdrew from the ranks of primary dealers in  recent weeks,  County NatWest, a subsidiary of National Westminster Bank,  had been added to our primary dealer list only last September and the  firm had not yet moved up to a trading relationship with the Desk.  L.F. Rothschild had been on the list for a little over two years, but  we did not have a trading relationship with them either, as major  structural and management changes, including their acquisition by  Frankling Savings Association last year, had left us with questions we  were still evaluating. Some other firms, no doubt, are going through  searching reviews of their commitment to the government securities  market, and the possibility of other defections cannot be ruled out--  though there are also firms seeking to enter. 	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0

198902	17	PRELL	" Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You should all have a packet of charts here with a red title on it. The first chart summarizes the key assumptions underlying the  Greenbook forecast. Starting at the top of the list, we have assumed that  the Federal Reserve will be seeking, in the next two years, to restore a  gradual downward trend in the rate of inflation. We've assumed, as well,  that fiscal policy will be moving in a restrictive direction. We have  assumed that Mother Nature is more cooperative this year and that we have  normal crop yields; with more acres being planted, this would produce a  substantial increase in agricultural output. And finally, we have assumed  that oil market developments will cause only a small increase in domestic  energy prices.  On that foundation, we have built a forecast that has the  following financial features: first, interest rates rise appreciably  further by early 1990 and then ease off a bit; second, the response of  monetary velocity to this interest rate pattern implies that M2 may grow  only around 3-1/2 percent this year and then pick up to roughly 5 percent  in 1990; and third, the dollar depreciates moderately over the projection  period.  Returning to the question of fiscal policy, the top panel of  Chart 2 indicates the character of the budget assumptions we've made. We  have assumed a $27 billion deficit-reduction package, comprising primarily  an assortment of spending cuts but also including some revenue enhancing  user fees and enforcement efforts. As the middle panel indicates, this  still leaves us with a projected fiscal 1990 total deficit of $127  billion, well above the Gramm-Rudman sequester trigger of $110 billion.  But this estimate is conditioned on our own economic projections and  technical assessments. What will matter for legislative purposes is the  projection made by OMB next summer; it should be possible to produce a  rosy enough scenario to meet the Gramm-Rudman requirement   if there is  indeed a desire to avoid sequestration.  The bottom panel shows the Board staff s index of the impetus to  economic activity coming from fiscal policy. As you can see, there is a  notable movement toward restraint in 1989 and 1990.  In our forecast, the combination of monetary and fiscal restraint  produces a substantial slowing in output growth. The top panel of Chart 3  shows the pattern for real GNP, with and without adjustments for the  effects of last year's drought. The information received since the  Greenbook went to press   most notably the January employment report    suggests that we may have understated the likely growth of GNP in the  first part of this year, but if we were to redo the forecast, its basic  contours would not change greatly. Essentially we have projected a growth  recession in 1990, with policy damping activity enough to push the  unemployment rate above 6 percent by the end of the period. Once some  slack has opened up in resource markets next year, inflation begins to  abate, but as the bottom panel shows, prices still increase more in 1990  than in 1989.  Chart 4 provides a summary of your forecasts for 1989. The  central tendency ranges indicated here cover the great majority of the  Committee, and they also encompass the staff projection. However, there  is a contrast with the view of the Reagan Administration, which was more  optimistic on both output and prices. For the Humphrey-Hawkins Report,  the forecast of the Bush Administration presumably would be the more  relevant comparison, and we may see some closing of these gaps when OMB  puts out new figures later this week.  Let me now turn to a discussion of some of the details of the  staff's forecast. Chart 5 addresses the outlook for household spending.  As the top panel shows, we are projecting a rather broad and sizable  deceleration in consumer spending. The weakening of outlays for autos and  other durables is especially marked, but spending on nondurables and  services also slows to well below the pace of recent years. The major  restraint on consumer spending is the expected slackening in the growth of  employment and income; as you can see at the right, real disposable income  rises only about 1 percent in 1990.  This slowing in consumption expenditure does not seem likely to  emerge in the next few months. A rising stock market has helped push the  ratio of household net worth to income back almost to the 1987 high, as  you can see in the middle left panel. And recent strong gains in income  and employment also have helped to bolster consumer sentiment; the right  panel shows the high levels of both the Michigan and Conference Board  indexes last month. We are assuming that rising interest rates eventually  will put a damper on consumer spending, however   directly, by eroding  asset values and raising credit costs, and indirectly, by reducing other  types of expenditures and the associated job creation.  Among the other expenditure categories, housing is the most  interest-sensitive   although some question does exist about just how  great that sensitivity is in today's world of ARMs, convertible fixed-rate  loans, etc. We are projecting an appreciable decline in housing starts,  which, as indicated in the bottom panel, encompasses both the single- and  multi-family segments of the market.  Although business capital outlays seem to respond less in the  short run to changes in interest rates than does homebuilding, the  combination of rising rates and generally slower growth in activity is  projected to retard investment over the next two years. As indicated in  the top panel of Chart 6, 1988 saw some major gyrations in spending, and,  frankly, these make it rather difficult to read the underlying trends. We  are looking for some recovery in equipment purchases in the near term and  a gradual deceleration thereafter, while outlays for structures appear  likely to continue declining.  The middle panels depict some advance indicators of investment.  At the left, you can see that new orders for nondefense capital goods  excluding aircraft weakened considerably in the closing months of 1988,  after a surge in the summer. A good part of this weakness occurred in the  computer industry, where some of our contacts suggest bookings have been  depressed temporarily by uncertainties about new products. In any event,  some rebound in total equipment outlays in the next few months seems to be  indicated by the high backlogs shown in the chart, by the results of  surveys of capital spending plans, and by the anecdotal evidence gathered  in part by the Reserve Bank staffs.  As for structures, trends in contracts certainly aren't signaling  any resurgence. And the anticipated rise in interest rates, on top of the  still large amount of vacant office space in some locales, is likely to  more than offset any expansion of industrial plant construction that may  now be in train.  In total, the projected slowing in real business fixed investment  is somewhat less marked than an econometric model might predict on the  basis of the slowing in GNP and declining cash flows; however, we think  this forecast is reasonable for at least a couple of reasons: one is that  businesses, especially in manufacturing, appear to have been careful to  avoid a cyclical over-expansion of capacity, and the other is that there  is a broadly perceived need to modernize and enhance efficiency in order  to maintain competitiveness over the long haul.  Apart from the mildness of the deceleration of fixed investment,  another factor in the avoidance of greater cyclicality in this forecast is  the smooth adjustment of inventory investment. At this juncture,  inventories in manufacturing (the black line in the bottom left panel)  appear to be very lean relative to shipments, and while the pattern  appears somewhat less favorable for trade outside of autos, most reports  suggest that these levels are comfortable for the time being. With the  projected slowing in the growth of final sales over the coming quarters,  inventory investment will have to tail off from recent rates if serious  overhangs are to be avoided. The slowing in inventory accumulation shown  at the right is great enough to prevent anything more than a slight  updrift in the aggregate inventory-sales ratio.  Turning now from the private to the public sector, Chart 7 shows  that we do not expect much contribution to GNP growth this year or next  from the government. As regards federal purchases of goods and services,  in the top panel, weak defense spending likely will drag down the total  this year and next. At the state and local level, discussions of needed  investment in public facilities raise the possibility of some strength in  spending. Construction outlays rose a great deal in the earlier part of  this decade, and we have built into our forecast some small further  increases in 1989 and 1990. All broad categories of expenditure are  likely to be constrained, however, by the deterioration in the financial  position of the state and local sector, which is reflected in the budget  deficit depicted in the bottom panel. We are anticipating that spending  cutbacks will be fairly common, and we are anticipating some tax increases    including general sales and other indirect taxes that tend to show up  in inflation measures.  Which brings me to the wage and price outlook. Chart 8 focuses  on the labor market picture. The top left panel updates a very simple  econometric result I presented last year, relating changes in the  unemployment rate to changes in real GNP   the so-called Okun's Law  relation. Basically, the chart tells us that when real GNP has grown  faster than 2-1/2 percent per annum, the unemployment rate has tended to  fall. As the red dots indicate, our projections of the jobless rate this  year and next are in line with this pattern.  The outlook for labor productivity is depicted at the right. The  underlying trend of productivity improvement in this decade has been  around 1-1/4 percent per year, and is indicated by the red line. As you  can see, we're forecasting below-trend increases in output per hour over  the next two years. To some extent, this simply reflects the lag in  adjustment of hiring to an emerging slowdown in economic activity; given  that businesses have been very cautious about building their permanent  payrolls, this drag on productivity may well be more moderate than has  been the case at times in the past. However, the deterioration in  productivity performance also reflects our sense that the pool of new  workers available to employers is now of lower quality than was true  earlier in this upswing.  The data for the past year also suggest that companies are having  to pay more in wages and benefits in order to hire and retain workers. We  believe that the pressures on labor supplies will be great enough over the  next year or so to produce a further gradual rise in rate of compensation  increase   the black line in the bottom panel. That rise will be  enlarged in January 1990 by a jump in social security tax rates, which  will add 1/4 percent to compensation inflation for the year as a whole.  As I have remarked before, the acceleration in compensation that we have  forecast is less than many econometric models would predict. We think  this projection is reasonable, given what we can discern of labor and  management attitudes, but the upside risks to wages seem to be at least as  great as those on the downside.  Given our forecast of pay and productivity, the trend of unit  labor costs   the red line   will deteriorate from what it has been,  putting pressures on profit margins and prices. Chart 9 points up some  other factors in the price outlook. The first of these is industrial  capacity utilization. The slowing of GNP growth in the forecast, in  combination with expected increases in capacity, implies that there will  be a considerable easing in utilization rates on average. Pressures on  capacity undoubtedly were a factor contributing to the recent acceleration  of producers' prices illustrated at the right, and we are projecting a  deceleration in those prices over the next two years   especially at the  earlier stages of processing, represented by the intermediate goods index.  The middle panels cover two volatile areas that I touched upon in  my comments about the basic assumptions in this forecast. As indicated at  the left, we're anticipating that better crops this year will offset some  of the price pressure coming from declining red meat supplies. Overall,  consumer food prices are projected to rise a little less than 4 percent in  1989 and 1990.  As for energy, Ted will be speaking in a moment on the oil  market. Suffice it to say that, while we are not expecting a large  increase in consumer energy prices after the next few months, the  projected pattern nonetheless is less favorable to the overall inflation  picture than was last year's.  Which brings me to the bottom panel and the projection for  consumer prices excluding food and energy. 1988 saw some acceleration in  this component of the CPI   a half percentage point on a December to  December basis and a quarter-point on the Q4 to Q4 basis shown here. The  deterioration in labor costs that we are expecting leads us to think that  a further pickup is ahead. Underlying these Q4-Q4 totals is a distinct  acceleration in prices over the next year, and then a leveling off in  consumer inflation as markets soften in 1990.  One element in the price outlook that I have not discussed is the  prospects for the dollar on exchange markets, and so I should turn things  over to Ted now.Your last chart presents the results of two more model  simulations. The baseline here is the same as Ted described. The first  alternative assumes that the System allows M2 to grow as rapidly as needed  to prevent the rise in short-term interest rates that is anticipated in  the Greenbook baseline. As you can see, that requires an appreciable  cumulative addition of monetary growth: at the end of 1991, the level of  M2 is almost 7 percent higher than in the baseline. At the lower interest  rates, real GNP growth is considerably more rapid, but so is inflation by  1991. Moreover, there is still a lot of price increase in train for later  years. The lower interest rates and more rapid growth of income have a  powerful effect on the federal budget deficit as indicated in the bottom  tier. The deficit is $70 billion lower in 1991 than in the baseline case.  The second alternative assumes that the deficit-reduction package  in the Greenbook is expanded to $50 billion by raising income tax rates.  M2 is assumed to stay on the baseline path. The model result is that real  output is depressed slightly in the short run, but recovers fully by 1991  as the economy responds to initially lower interest rates and an  associated lower exchange value of the dollar. You can see that there are  substantial benefits in terms of deficit reduction   which grow over time  as the tax base expands.  One may wish to take these simulations with a grain or two of  salt. As we always warn, the econometric results inevitably are  influenced by the analytical priors of the modelers, and besides that,  events could be shaped importantly by special expectational effects. One  could, for example, envision that the more expansionary path in the ""More  Money"" scenario would substantially alter perceptions of Fed policy  intentions and lead to greater inflation expectations and a much sharper  dollar depreciation than is embodied in these results.  Similarly, quite different results might flow from the fiscal  action if it radically lowered expectations of out-year federal deficits.  If bond yields plunged, rather than falling gradually as the model's term-  structure equation suggests, then the short-run output losses might be  reduced or eliminated. On the other hand, if exchange market participants  showed their approval of United States policy by bidding up the dollar, it might  exacerbate the short-run contractionary effects of the deficit reduction.  Such analytical uncertainties afflict any forecast, but I suspect that  they are magnified when one hypothesizes changes in policy that are  appreciable departures from recent patterns.

198902	18	TRUMAN	" The top panel of the first chart on international developments  presents an overview of our major external balances. Real net exports of  goods and services   the red line   declined through 1986, but they  increased significantly in 1987 and 1988, as the influence of the  improvement in United States international price competitiveness began to be seen  in rapidly rising exports and slower growth of imports. Meanwhile, the  current account balance   the black line   continued to deteriorate  through 1987, but that balance improved substantially last year.  The iirprovement in the current account balance from almost $175  billion in the last half of 1987 to $125 billion in the last half of 1988  was considerably larger than the improvement in real net exports because  of the favorable movement in our terms of trade. Prices of agricultural  exports rose, prices of oil imports declined, and the dollar appreciated  on balance over the year against the currencies of other industrial  countries.  For 1989, we are projecting a small improvement in real net  exports under the influence of slower growth here than abroad and a  moderate depreciation of the dollar. The effects of the recent strength  of the dollar combine with the expected rise in the price of imported oil  to prevent much improvement in the current account deficit this year,  but a gradual improvement is expected to resume in 1990.  The bottom panel shows that our current account deficit as a  percent of GNP has been reduced from about 3-3/4 percent in late 1986 to  about 2-1/2 percent"" last year. After essentially stabilizing at that  level this year, we expect the ratio to decline to less than 2 percent by  the second half of 1990.  Exchange rates have had an important influence on our external  accounts in recent years. The top panel of the next chart shows that  from the recent low point in December of 1987, the weighted average  foreign exchange value of the dollar in terms of the currencies of the  other G-10 countries   the red line   has increased about 7 percent.  Adjusted for the more rapid increase in the United States consumer price index  over this period, the dollar's real appreciation, shown by the black  line, has been about 8-1/2 percent.  The dollar has fluctuated somesdiat over the past year, and the  movement of bilateral exchange rates has not been uniform, as is  illustrated in the box at the right. [Since Decembe r of 1987, the dollar  has appreciated significantly against the Deutschemark, has remained  essentially unchanged, on balance, against the yen, while it has  depreciated against the pound sterling and, more substantially, against  the Canadian dollar. In terms of the currencies of non-G-10 countries,  such as the South Korean won and the Taiwan dollar, the United States dollar  continued to depreciate last year.]  In our forecast, we are projecting a resumption of the dollar's  depreciation in terms of the other G-10 currencies. Specifically, our  forecast incorporates a depreciation of 13 percent in nominal terms, and  10 percent in price-adjusted terms, from the fourth quarter of last year  to the fourth quarter of 1990. This projection is based upon our view  that further improvement in our external accounts will be necessary at  some point and that such improvement will have to be assisted at least in  part by additional improvement in our international price competitiveness  brought about through changes in exchange rates. However, it is  certainly possible, especially over the next two years, that the dollar  will not depreciate further and that our current account deficits can be  sustained, at least over that period, with a net inflow of capital from  abroad at unchanged exchange rates on average. I will consider the  implications of such an alternative scenario in a few minutes.  The lower panel presents a perspective on recent trends in one  estimate of real long-term interest rates. Through much of the 1980s,  the dollar's foreign exchange value roughly tracked movements in the  differential between United States and foreign rates. However, over the past 18  months, the level of, and movements in, United States rates have not differed  substantially from those of foreign rates on average, while the dollar  has fluctuated quite sharply.  As can be seen from the box at the right, United States overnight and  long-term interest rates have risen about as much as German rates since  their lows in February of last year. However, Japanese rates have risen  somewhat less than United States rates. Over the forecast period, we expect  interest rates abroad to move in the same direction as United States rates, though  with a somewhat smaller amplitude.  Turning to economic developments abroad, the upper left panel of  Chart 12 illustrates the recovery of industrial production in the major  foreign industrial countries in 1987 and 1988. The expansion in 1988 was  associated with lower oil prices and generally high levels of private  investment spending. Toward the end of the year, economic activity  slowed somewhat after monetary policies tightened.  One reason for the tightening of monetary policies abroad was  the upward creep in year-over-year consumer price inflation shown in the  upper right panel. Although most of the increase shown in the chart  reflects the more rapid pace of inflation in the United Kingdom, concern  about rising inflation has been emerging in other countries as well.  Capacity utilization rates in manufacturing have been rising in each of  the major industrial countries, and in most of these countries they are  near or above the peak rates recorded in the late 1970s. As shown in the  middle panel, commodity prices in foreign currencies, as well as in  dollars, have been rising since early 1987.  Our forecast for economic activity in the major foreign  industrial countries is based on the assumption that economic policy  abroad, as outlined in the bottom panel, will be guided by increased  concern about inflation and capacity pressures. This concern is expected  to be manifested primarily in a further tightening of monetary policy in  1989. We expect that fiscal policy will be generally neutral; the  exception is Germany where a package of increases in excise taxes and the  imposition of a withholding tax on interest have gone into effect.  The top left panel of the next chart presents cur outlook for  real GNP in the major foreign industrial countries   the red bars   in  comparison with our outlook for United States real GNP (drought adjusted)   the  black bars. Compared with 1988, we are projecting slower growth in real  GNP in each of the six countries in 1989, under the influence of tighter  monetary policies and rising oil prices. In most countries, investment  spending slows, and, in some countries, consumption spending slows also. The slowdown is particularly noticeable for the United Kingdom and  Canada, countries where inflation pressures have been of particular  concern to the authorities. The slowdown in average growth abroad in  1989 is less than that projected for the United States, and the growth  gap widens in 1990, as growth abroad picks up somewhat while United States growth  slows further.  As can be seen from the box at the upper right, the projected  slowdown in domestic spending abroad is greater than that for GNP, as  progress in external adjustment is expected to be less visible. Indeed, one risk to our forecast is that the external adjustment process will  stall in the short run with a stronger dollar and more rapid expansion of  foreign production. Under those circumstances, monetary authorities  abroad may respond with tighter policies that contribute to less growth  in the medium term.  The pattern of economic activity in all foreign countries as a  group (developing countries as well as industrial countries), depicted in  the middle panel, is projected to follow that for the major industrial  countries alone, with a considerable slowing in 1989 followed by a mild  recovery in 1990. However, for the non-OPEC developing countries, growth  this year is projected to be slightly greater than last year, as a pickup  in growth in the Western Hemisphere outweighs an expected slowdown in the  Asian countries.  The lower panels present our outlook for consumer price  inflation in the major foreign industrial countries. The pickup in  projected inflation shown in the red line in the left panel primarily reflects the influence of high oil prices and tax changes in Germany and  Japan. The moderation in 1990 is associated with a wearing off of these  special factors, less pressure on overall capacity, and a marked slowing  of inflation in the United Kingdom as tighter monetary policy bites in  that country. As can be seen in the box at the right, by the end of 1990 United States inflation is about 2 percent more than in other industrial countries,  on average.  Against the background of slower growth abroad, the dollar's  relative stability over the past year, and relatively high inflation in the United States, it is not surprising that the outlook for United States  exports, shown in Chart 14, is for a somewhat less rapid pace of  expansion than we have seen over the past two years. In the case of  computers, the top panel, a slight moderation in the pace of shipments  combines with the resumption of a more rapid pace of price decline,  following the easing of chip shortages that affected prices in 1988. The  result is a marked slowing in the growth of the value of these exports.  In the case of other non-agricultural exports, shown in the  middle panel, the reduced rate of expansion in value is entirely due to  less rapid expansion in real quantities exported. This outlook is  consistent with recent reports from Reserve Banks; while export orders  remain strong, they are not pouring in at the same rate that they did in  late 1987 and early 1988. Indeed, my impression from some of those  reports is that increases in export orders are not being as actively  solicited as they were a couple of years ago.  Agricultural exports   the bottcm panel   are expected to be  an exception to the general pattern of less buoyant exports. The drought  of last year had minor effects on the quantity of our exports, as stocks  were drawn down. We are projecting a pickup in 1989 especially in  exports of wheat and soybeans. Meanwhile, prices are projected to  increase moderately. As a result, as can been seen in the box at the  right, we are projecting a substantial increase in the value of our  agricultural exports this year.  Turning to non-oil imports, the next chart, the prices of these  imports, shown in the upper left panel, increased over the four quarters  of 1988, on average, at roughly the same pace as during 1987. Meanwhile,  increases in the quantities of these imports   the right panel    generally were smaller than in 1987.  As is shown in the middle panel, we are projecting sligthly  lower rates of increase of imports of computers in 1989 and 1990 than  last year. The more rapid decline in prices referred to earlier also  should help to hold down the recorded increase in the value of these  imports.  The quantity of other non-oil imports   the red line in the  bottom panel   is projected to show a moderate increase this year in  response to the fading influence of our improved price competitiveness  and fairly steady growth during the first half of the year. Next year,  however, with the resumption of the dollar's depreciation, and  significantly slower growth in United States aggregate demand, the quantity of  such imports is expected to decline.  Our outlook for the market for petroleum and products is shown  in Chart 16. As usual, a considerable band of uncertainty surrounds our  assumption about the United States import price shown as the black line in the top  panel. We are assuming that under the influence of the recent OPEC production accord the price will recover rather quickly, and may already  have done so, from an average of $12.70 per barrel in the fourth quarter  of last year, to $15 per barrel by the middle of this year. But we are assuming it will not rise beyond that level. Cur view is that excess  production capacity in the Persian Gulf is large and is likely to  increase further in 1989 and 1990, as the rate of increase in world  demand declines. Our assumption is that Gulf producers will choose to  absorb rising demand in the second half of 1989 and in 1990 in increased  production rather than in higher prices.  In the short run, we have seen upward pressure on spot market  prices, represented by the price of West Texas Intermediate (the red  line) over the past two months. This pressure has been associated with  several factors illustrated in the middle panels. First, as is shown in  the left panel, estimated free world consumption has been rising and  estimated stocks are lower. Second, shown at the right, production in  other industrial countries in late 1988 and the first quarter of 1989 has  been declining as a result of accidents affecting U.K. production in the  North Sea and new Norwegian production coming on-stream more slowly than  had been projected earlier. Meanwhile, United States production continues to  drift lower by about 200,000 barrels per day each year.  The bottom panel presents our outlook for United States imports of  petroleum and products. Although the increase in the quantity of such  imports is projected to be moderate this year and next, as stocks are  drawn down and the economy slows, higher prices are projected to push up  their value over the forecast period by about $8 billion from the low  estimated for the fourth quarter of last year. Most of the rise comes in  the first half of this year.  The next chart provides an overview of United States current and capital  account transactions. In 1988, total current account receipts increased  more than total payments. As a result, our trade and current account  deficits narrowed by $35 to $40 billion. In 1989, we expect no further  improvement; a small decline in the trade deficit is projected to be  offset by rising income payments as dollar interest rates rise and our  liabilities continue to expand. In 1990, with the lower dollar and  reduced United States growth, the trade balance is projected to shrink to less  than $100 billion, while our current account narrows to around $110  billion.  With respect to capital account transactions, net capital  inflows in 1988 were substantially reduced from those in 1987. Net  private capital inflows (line 1) declined; the decline was more than  accounted for by reduced net inflows through banks (line 2); banks had  less need to turn to the Euromarkets, and official deposits in those  markets were reduced. At the same time, foreign private purchases of  United States Treasury securities increased substantially last year, and the  increase was only partly offset by lower purchases of United States stocks,  producing a rise in total net inflows on securities transactions  (line 3) from $28 billion in 1987 to $39 billion in 1988.  Net official inflows also declined in 1988. The United States  acquired foreign assets on balance (line 7) producing a $6 billion net  capital outflow, while transactions by other G-10 countries (line 8)  produced an inflow. Combined, the net inflow was $11 billion dollars,  but this was substantially larger than the $2 billion in net intervention  purchases of dollars, shown in line 10. The major reason for the  discrepancy was a shift of official Japanese deposits from the Euromarket  to the United States.  This year, with the current account deficit expected to be  roughly unchanged, total net capital inflows must also be unchanged.  However, with our projection of further downward pressure on the dollar  later this year, we would expect an increase in net official inflows that  would offset a further decline in net private inflows through securities  transactions.  The last international chart presents an alternative forecast  for the United States economy and for our external accounts. In the baseline, we  have extended the Greenbook forecast into 1991 with the assumption of no  new action to reduce the budget deficit and a slight easing of short-term  interest rates. The dollar continues to depreciate in 1991 at about the  same rate as in the Greenbook forecast. On the assumption that the  Federal Reserve will still be seeking a slowing of inflation, M2 is  projected to grow 6 percent over 1991. The growth of real GNP in the  baseline is higher in 1991 than in 1990, but it remains below our  estimate of the growth of potential and the unemployment rate rises  further.  For the alternative forecast, based en the staff's econometric  models, we assumed that the dollar remains unchanged from its current  level because of a stronger demand for dollar assets than is implicit in  our Greenbook forecast. We also assumed that monetary policy adjusts to  hold real GNP on its baseline path, as is shown in the first two lines of  the table. To achieve this result, slightly faster growth of M2 is  required in each year, as is shown in the next two lines. The Federal  funds rate averages about 1/4 percent lower this year compared with the  rate underlying the Greenbook forecast, 3/4 percent lower in 1990, and  almost 1-1/2 percent lower in 1991. In one sense, these lower interest  rates are a measure of the extra monetary restraint that is needed in our  baseline forecast to bring about a shift of resources to the external  sector if the dollar depreciates.  With the foreign exchange value of the dollar unchanged from its  current level, and the path of real GNP unaffected, the direct pressure  on the price level from the dollar's depreciation is substantially  reduced. Consequently, compared with the baseline, the increase in GNP  prices is slightly less in 1990 and about 1/2 percent lower in 1991.  The stronger dollar also has a favorable impact on real GNP  abroad, raising the projected growth rate by about 3/4 percent in 1990  and 1991 compared with the baseline.  The final two lines on the table illustrate that with an  unchanged dollar and somewhat easier United States monetary policy our current  account deficit in the fourth quarter of this year would be about the  same as in the Greenbook forecast   $130 billion. Because of the  slowing in United States growth projected for 1990, the current account deficit  would narrow by about $10 billion that year even with the dollar  unchanged; this improvement would be helped along by the faster growth  abroad and lower United States interest rates. However, the net improvement is  almost $20 billion less than in the baseline forecast. By 1991, this  differential increases to more than $30 billion. In the baseline  forecast, with growth of United States real GNP below potential and a continued  moderate depreciation of the dollar, the current account deficit narrows  to $80 billion. With an unchanged dollar and the same growth of United States  real GNP, but faster growth abroad, the current account deficit would  remain above $110 billion.  Mike will now complete our presentation with some additional  alternative forecasts. "	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	19	GREENSPAN	 Thank you, gentlemen. Governor Johnson.  	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	20	JOHNSON	 Just one question: On this first alternative forecast, what happens in a case where you don't have compensating money growth to try and stay on the base line real GNP forecast and you have an unchanged dollar? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198902	21	TRUMAN	 Well, in that case, of course, you would get more current account improvement, a better performance of prices, and a little less--about 1/4 percent per year less--GNP growth. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	22	JOHNSON	 What's the improvement on the price side? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198902	23	TRUMAN	 Oh, the difference I think is about 0.2 percent a year for both years, 1989 [and 1990]. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	24	GREENSPAN	 Governor Heller. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	25	HELLER	 I have a couple of questions. First, you are showing compensation going up rather rapidly in 1990--plus 6 percent-- but then you are showing personal consumption expenditures going up only 0.9 percent. What's happening there--the saving rate? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198902	26	PRELL	 Well, job growth is much slower; thus, you're not generating the nominal income fast enough to offset the more rapid increases in consumer prices. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	27	HELLER	 The 6 percent? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198902	28	PRELL	 I'm not sure what the nominal personal income increase is. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	29	HELLER	 No, no. From the charts it looks like compensation is going up 5.7 or 5.8 percent--whatever it is, I don't know. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198902	30	PRELL	 But we have very slow employment growth. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	31	SPEAKER	 You get zero. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	32	STOCKTON	 You get about 5 percent consumer price inflation as well as what's pushing down the overall growth in real disposable income. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	33	HELLER	 The second question was: Foreign prices are falling rather rapidly in the forecast in 1990, and in view of the fact that foreign monetary growth right now is a lot higher than it is in the United States in virtually all countries except Switzerland what's their magic? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198902	34	TRUMAN	 I think their magic is that with this slightly higher money growth they have had a lower level of [inflation] on average to begin with more recently--with a few important exceptions like the United Kingdom--and we are projecting a tightening of monetary policy in those countries. Also, for this two-year period, not including 1990, they get some benefit from the depreciation of the dollar that we're assuming in the forecast relative to their present underlying level of inflation. In addition, thes<2 are year-over-year comparisons, and they would be coming off these ?rtificial factors  that in 1989 tend to boost the price level up in Germany and Japan. Therefore, the year-over-year comparison exaggerates the decline. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	35	PRELL	 Governor Heller, just to clarify: those figures were compensation for hourly wages. We have total nominal disposable income rising just over 6 percent. If you take off just over 5 percent consumer inflation you're down to about 1 percent income growth in real terms. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	36	HELLER	 Okay. The last question: On chart 18, the next to the last chart, you have a lot faster growth abroad under the unchanged dollar forecast. Presumably that would mean higher United States exports, yet the current account gets a lot worse? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198902	37	TRUMAN	 Right, because it [unintelligible] it more than exports. There's no doubt about that: [faster] growth abroad does boost the growth of exports in this period. I might add-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	38	HELLER	 But the two United States growth paths are exactly the same. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198902	39	PRELL	 That's right. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	40	TRUMAN	 That's right, but that's by assumption. To the extent that you get more exports, the easing of monetary policy required to keep the United States growth path on the same line is less; so that's part of this compensated-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	41	HELLER	 No. I'm sorry, I don't get it. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198902	42	TRUMAN	 To the extent that's correct--that without the dollar's decline there is more growth abroad--that by itself has a partial effect in that it generates more exports. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	43	HELLER	 More exports? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198902	44	TRUMAN	 Growth [abroad] itself does generate more exports. To the extent that that produces more demand for United States goods, the experiment offsets that by having less monetary expansion in the United States to compensate for the exports that would otherwise be there. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	45	HELLER	 So imports-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198902	46	SPEAKER	 Net exports are falling a lot faster than the current account [unintelligible] United States GNP is held on track by offsetting [unintelligible] export increase with the exception of investments due to lower interest rates. But the real [unintelligible] decline of exports [unintelligible] increase of foreign real exports, but raise the GNP level. They measure this from-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	47	TRUMAN	 Well, in fact, it puts the two factors together, Governor Heller. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	48	HELLER	 I'm ready to give up.  	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198902	49	TRUMAN	 The growth of exports is lower in this forecast even though income abroad is higher because they gain more on the price side than they lose on the income side. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	50	HELLER	 It all goes on the price effects? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198902	51	TRUMAN	 Yes. Prices are actually washed out. In fact, probably a better way of thinking of it is that the level of real exports is lower in the alternative than in the base line because that improved price competitiveness has a greater effect on exports than the gain in faster growth abroad. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	52	HELLER	 Sorry. I thought I heard you say initially that exports were up. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198902	53	TRUMAN	 No. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	54	HELLER	 Now you're saying exports are [not] up-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198902	55	TRUMAN	 A partial effect of higher income is to put exports up. A partial effect of a stronger dollar is to put exports down., The net effect is negative for exports. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	56	HELLER	 Okay. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198902	57	TRUMAN	 Sorry for the confusion. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	58	HELLER	 I find it hard to see, but-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198902	59	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	60	ANGELL	 Bob, I think the reason you have trouble with that is the same reason that I have trouble--because there is a basic inconsistency in the whole process, which makes all the results backwards to me. And that is, the faster money growth that you have there should be associated with a higher value of the dollar rather than the opposite. In other words, what we have here is the use of a construct that says in order to keep things the same you grow M2 at a faster rate. And by strange reasoning if you grow M2 at a faster rate you'll have a lower value dollar. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	43.0
198902	61	PRELL	 If you looked at the exchange rate implications, as I suggested earlier, of that faster money alternative that I have, that showed-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	62	SPEAKER	 If interest rates are fixed. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	63	PRELL	 You have that dollar depreciation. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	64	JOHNSON	 That's why I asked that first question. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198902	65	ANGELL	 So, that makes everything backwards for those of us who had seen that relationship as the [unintelligible] one. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	43.0
198902	66	JOHNSON	 That's why I asked my first question about the result if we didn't compensate on the money side.  	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198902	67	PRELL	 This is compounding degrees of uncertainty, let's say. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	68	SPEAKER	 Yes. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	69	HELLER	 Well, it certainly succeeded. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198902	70	BLACK	 You know, it certainly would help to have this [analysis] sent out a little ahead of time so that we could reflect on it a bit. That's a lot to digest in that short a period of time. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	7.0
198902	71	GREENSPAN	 Bob. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	72	PARRY	 On a somewhat narrower topic: I agree, Mike, that the nondefense capital goods orders are really good indicators as far as capital spending is concerned. But would it be better perhaps to try to take some of the lumpiness out of aircraft and parts as opposed to excluding it? Because it is an important factor with regard to capital spending. I know it's very lumpy but maybe if you averaged a couple of months you'd get a better picture. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198902	73	PRELL	 I don't think so, President Parry, because I think the value of this indicator is relatively short run. The lags that one measures in the relation of orders to shipments tend to be a matter of several months. And in the case of aircraft, with the current situation being what it is, the lead times are so long that the placing of orders has no meaningful-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	74	PARRY	 So it's not a lumpiness. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198902	75	PRELL	 That's apart from the fact that there are lots of intermediate goods in there--parts [for example]--and a lot of that goes to exports. It's an even bigger problem there than it is for translating the other orders to business fixed investment. So, there's a great deal of slack for that. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	76	MELZER	 Mike, is the main difference in terms of your deficit assumptions--I forget what chart that was on-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	42.0
198902	77	PRELL	 Second chart. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	78	MELZER	 Second chart. Is that based on the difference in interest rates--primarily that 6.3 percent or whatever the former Administration had been using versus what we are projecting? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	42.0
198902	79	PRELL	 That is a good deal of the story. In 1990 that is worth roughly $25 billion of the difference, all other things equal, between the Administration and Greenbook budget assumptions. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	80	MELZER	 One thing that strikes me in looking at this-- and to some extent I agree with Bob Black that it's hard to absorb all the implications of these alternative forecasts--but you get the feeling that maybe our economic policy mix is really not what it ought to be. And that sort of puts you in a fog. I think this is a rhetorical question but, is there a way of positioning what we're doing that puts us in a better posture in that regard? Because there are a lot of things that come through in this that we could get blamed  for: the [unintelligble] deficits, stalling out of the trade adjustment, you name it. And the politics become very tricky. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	42.0
198902	81	GREENSPAN	 Greatly. Governor Seger. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	82	SEGER	 Maybe I'm missing something, but as you go through the alternatives is there one that would be comparable to, say, just freezing in place today's policy stance? I don't mean-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198902	83	PRELL	" If you mean by that the federal funds rate, that is the ""more money"" alternative. "	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	84	SEGER	" Yes. But I guess that wasn't quite what I was thinking of. And maybe I have the wrong view of what holding today's reserve pressures would do. I sense that that might put a little more upward pressure on rates. But maybe your ""more money"" alternative is going to be the status quo. "	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198902	85	PRELL	 It was intended to answer the question: What if short-term interest rates don't rise? 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	86	SEGER	 Okay, thanks. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198902	87	GREENSPAN	 That's all right. I didn't know whether you were finished or not. President Keehn. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	88	KEEHN	 Mike, a question on chart 5 on the consumer durables: Is the decline in the red line solely attributable to a decline in car sales from, say, 10.6 to 10.2 million units, or in fact does the slump of that line also imply some pickup in [unintelligible] of consumer durables? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	35.0
198902	89	PRELL	 We have non-motor vehicle durable goods increasing 3 percent in 1989 and then flat in 1990. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	90	KEEHN	 What comprises the end of 1989 number? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	35.0
198902	91	PRELL	 Within the durables? We have not done a greater level of disaggregation on this. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	92	KEEHN	 I guess the question is: With home starts down, does that fit in it? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	35.0
198902	93	PRELL	 It fits in to some degree. There is some relationship there, though if you just look historically to the simple econometric relation you find it's pretty loose. In 1988 we had 6 percent growth of durables other than motor vehicles. So that [1989 rate] is a significant slowing. This level of housing activity is still enough to generate some reasonable demand and then there is all the replacement demand for appliances and furnishings and so on. So it wouldn't fall entirely in that type of-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	94	JOHNSON	 One last question: How much of the base line forecast for real growth is accounted for by net exports? Do you know?  	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198902	95	PRELL	 In 1989 it's a very small part; in dollar terms net exports improve $22 billion and GNP is improving $122 billion-- that's roughly 1/2 percent on GNP. In 1990 net exports are accounting for roughly 3/4 of that 1 percent growth. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	96	TRUMAN	 The actual increase is not as much as implied for- - 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	97	JOHNSON	 I've forgotten: what's the implied dollar depreciation? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198902	98	TRUMAN	 Over the entire 8 quarters it's 13 percent in nominal terms, 10 percent in real terms. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	99	PARRY	 Most of it in the second [year]? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198902	100	TRUMAN	 Well, a little more in the second year because the first quarter is gone. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	101	SYRON	 Mike, given what Ted has said in here and what was said about oil prices in the Greenbook that we got earlier, one always makes point estimates but what's your view of the symmetry of the risks on the inflation side? Particularly, I'm referring to the staff inflation projection and the forecast for compensation in the first and second halves of 1989 given what was [happening] in the last half of 1988. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	51.0
198902	102	PRELL	 I must say that in terms of absolute levels these movements in the compensation numbers over 1988 give us some real problems in judging where the takeoff point is. There was an extraordinarily low increase in compensation per hour in the first quarter of the year; whether the fairly sizable numbers in the second half were just offsetting a seasonal adjustment problem we can't say. In essence, we are discounting the level at the end of the year, and we have a very mild acceleration, as we perceive it, in compensation per hour over the forecast period. As I said, we think this is a reasonable forecast. I guess I would see the tail of the distribution being longer on the up side than on the down side at this point. It's hard for us in this kind of economic environment to see a sizable shortfall from this compensation forecast. But one can see a larger range of risks, I think, on the up side. As a best estimate, this is our shot. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	103	STERN	 Mike, with regard to the slowing in auto sales that you have in here: Is that due principally to a squeeze on income or is it the effects of the age of the stock of vehicles on the road? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	41.0
198902	104	PRELL	 Well, a lot of cars have been bought in recent years but that hasn't brought the average age of the stock down to low levels by any means. I'm not sure we totally understand the scrappage rates that we're seeing--whether there really has been an improvement in the quality of automobiles and they last longer or what. I think we have a fairly sizable decline. The automobiles are declining more than light trucks and vans, which we have not yet incorporated in our tables and are now almost half as large as the car sales. So that's something worth recalling. The main factors are the slower income and employment growth. One couldn't point to the interest rate increases we have here as having a tremendous effect on automobile sales. It's  more the general atmosphere of confidence and the growth in purchasing power that is behind this decline. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	105	FORRESTAL	 Mike, one of the assumptions you made was that the weather will cooperate and that crop yields will be normal. In the event that didn't happen and we have a drought situation similar to the one we had this year, would 1990's GNP drought adjustment likely be negative? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	39.0
198902	106	PRELL	 1990's or 1989's? 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	107	FORRESTAL	 Well, 1989. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	39.0
198902	108	PRELL	 If you had a crop year like 1988 in [1989 or] 1990, all other things equal, it would subtract 0.7 of a percent or so from output and would get you very close to zero. I think the bigger concern--one that we just don't know how to cope with in terms of inserting something in this forecast--is that in many areas, although it's spotty, there seems to be a shortage of soil moisture. The reports about winter wheat are not particularly encouraging. And with inventories of many of these grains and soybeans and so on as low as they are, we can't afford to have anything like the 1988 crop if we're going to stay anywhere near this inflation path. It's likely that we will see much more sizable food price increases than we saw in 1988. So I think it's something that's hard to cope with in monetary policy terms and economic forecasts here. But it is something that one could be concerned about. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	109	GREENSPAN	 Well, we can supply liquidity! 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	110	PRELL	 That observation seems to have closed down all the discussion. I want to express my appreciation! 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	111	SPEAKER	 You want a second or what? 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	112	GREENSPAN	 I no more believe that than you do. I think maybe I-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	113	ANGELL	 Mike, I guess I'm a little surprised at the food inflation in '89 and '90, given normal crops and normal weather, because with the decrease in set-asides ordinarily food price inflation in the year after the drought should be lower than in the year before the drought. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	43.0
198902	114	PRELL	 The rate of increase? 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	115	ANGELL	 I would have thought that somewhere there should be a downward move in food prices--offsetting the '88 upward move--in order for that historical relationship to hold true. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	43.0
198902	116	PRELL	 Well, as you know, we have about a 3-3/4 percent increase in food prices this year and next. And we're looking at, for example,- - 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	117	ANGELL	 I'm sorry, I thought it was 4 percent but maybe I'm wrong.  	12	12	1.0	1.0	43.0
198902	118	PRELL	 I'm splitting it more thinly; it's a little below 4 percent. We're talking about consumer prices, excluding energy, rising 5 percent or more. That is a considerable differential and not out of line with that historical pattern to which you referred of the relative movement in these inflation rates. Beside the drought effects there was already in train some tendency toward reduction in cattle herds; and we're likely to see some considerable pressure on meat prices that offsets the relatively small benefits you can get from additional grain supplies, given the very large labor component in most of those food prices. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	119	ANGELL	 Well, because of this discussion, I now hope that the rainfall is normal so we can find out who's right. But that's my only reason for wanting normal weather. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	43.0
198902	120	GREENSPAN	 Let me put forth the other side of the question. New crop [unintelligible] positions in feed grains and in food grains are well above normal. And built into the price structure at this stage is still subnormal soil moisture. What happens to the forecast, including the cattle cycle effect, if in fact from here on in we get above normal moisture and it brings the forward prices down? Does that make much of a dent in the consumer price structure or is the cattle shortfall already enough to make that a likely occurrence? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	121	PRELL	 I think that's largely there and that it would really take some tremendous moves in crop prices to move these overall food price measures around. I think that's evident in what happened last year. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	122	GREENSPAN	 In other words, what we're really looking at is more the unit labor costs in the distribution channels than the feed grains that filter into the cattle-meat cycle. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	123	PRELL	 That's a very large ingredient. I think that's the case. We have an authority here on the subject. John Rosine, do you have anything you want to add? 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	124	ROSINE	 Well, it certainly would not be enough to drive food price changes down into negative territory. If we had a very good crop year I think we could possibly have a drop in all grain prices but a CPI food price increase, say, on the order of 1 or 2 percent, give or take a little--not enough to affect the overall price outlook very significantly. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	125	GREENSPAN	 So, at most, on your total index it's a couple of tenths? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	126	PRELL	 A couple of tenths. And that's essentially what we got in 1988. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	127	GREENSPAN	 I don't want to force the conversation, but has everybody completed their questions? If so, we can move on to Don Kohn--if you're prepared, Don. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	128	SPEAKERS	 We are [unintelligible]--  	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	129	GREENSPAN	 My schedule reads differently from what I think the Secretary's schedule shows. [We should] go to our discussions on the economy. I thought that came [before] you. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	130	KOHN	 Well, I'll be happy to get [my report] over with. 	13	13	1.0	0.0	999.0
198902	131	GREENSPAN	 No, that would probably confuse us. Who would like to start off? Bob. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	132	PARRY	 Mr. Chairman, the Twelfth District economy remains strong. For example, the District's unemployment rate is below the national average. However, Arizona is slumping because of the construction downturn, which is likely to extend at least through this year. In addition, there are signs of slowing during 1989. For example, labor shortages are slowing [output in] a few industries; I guess the most extreme example of that would be in aircraft manufacturing. Concern about the lack of rainfall is mounting in our District, especially in California. Another year of drought would really seriously hurt the District's agriculture. I think we have a little different situation working in our District. Last year we benefitted from the drought because we had almost all of our agriculture handled through irrigation. But we have had two years of drought and a third would be quite serious because the reservoir levels are so low at the present time--and we're already halfway through our rain year--that it actually could result in reductions of water availability of 25 to 40 percent. So, we're looking rather closely at the water situation, at least in the state of California. The national economy, it seems to me, continues at a level of activity above its sustainable potential. I believe that the recent employment reports indicate upward pressures on wages and that the underlying inflation rate seems likely to continue to build. Moreover, if there is a depreciation of the dollar this year and next, as is incorporated in the Greenbook forecast, that will add to inflationary pressures as well. Our outlook for growth for the two- year period is very similar to that of the Greenbook, although we may have somewhat of a difference in the yearly pattern. In any case, this growth and what I would say is a worsening inflation prospect argue strongly, in my view, for continuing our recent strategy of steadily tightening policy. Thank you. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
198902	133	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	134	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, our projections for 1990 pretty closely parallel those of the Greenbook. We do expect slightly more growth, but not quite enough to put us in the outlier column as has sometimes happened in the past. And we expect a tad more in the way of an increase in the consumer price index. As Mike Prell suggested very well a while ago, more important than the specifics of the forecast are some of the things that underlie it. And as we read the economy the pressure on United States productive resources looks very, very strong to us. This is evident, I think, in most recent statistical data: real personal consumption expenditures ex-automobiles, for example, were very strong; the nonagricultural employment figures for January were very strong; and the theme report that we got on business capital expenditures, which I found extremely helpful this time, seemed to indicate strength. We're getting the same sort of  grassroots information from our contacts around the District. To us, one particularly interesting thing this time was a comment of who has been in the department store business says that business is really booming. so it came as something of a surprise to us. Now, if we have this strong demand, as is apparent to us, that naturally is going to put some upward pressure on real interest rates. And any attempt on our part to resist that pressure through monetary policy is going to risk getting inflationary pressures. So we've assumed, like the staff, that our monetary policy will not resist these things; rather we predicated our forecast on the assumption that there will be a significant further increase in short- term interest rates, and specifically some increase in the relatively near future. Now, if we do allow that increase to occur then we think the risks are about equal on both sides. If we don't let that increase occur then we think the risks are on the up side of more inflation than the staff has projected. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198902	135	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	136	MELZER	 Our forecast this time falls within the parameters of the central tendency, which is a little unusual, I think, for us in recent years. We're at the low end on real GNP at 2- 1/2 percent and at the high end on the CPI at 5 percent. But we're modestly higher in terms of unemployment at the end of the year. Looking out into 1990, our forecast would be quite similar to what we've seen from the Board's staff with maybe somewhat stronger real growth--at about 1-1/2 percent--and the CPI continuing to be somewhere around 5 percent. So, no declines. Looking out beyond that, even though we didn't do projections, I think we'd expect the CPI to begin coming down. The big difference, however, between our forecast and the Board staff's forecast is that we've assumed Ml growth of somewhere in the 3 to 5 percent area to produce these essentially similar results, whereas the Board staff's forecast I think has Ml growth of zero in 1989 and I'm not sure about 1990. Based on that, I think I'd have to say that we view the risk in the Board staff's forecast to be on the down side in terms of real growth. Using our methodology, if we drove that kind of assumption through [our model] we would definitely have weaker growth--in fact, a recession. In terms of what's going on in the District itself, we have seen some growth in nonag employment for the most recent three-month period and for the year. For a long time I was reporting that our employment was actually declining, so there has been some pickup. But [our growth rate] is still sluggish--about 1-1/2 percent versus 3 to 3-1/2 percent nationally. Manufacturing employment has picked up a little more strongly but it's still slower than the national [average]. Residential construction has shown some strength recently, as has nonresidential construction, particularly in St. Louis commercial office building construction. But on a year-to-year basis that's down quite significantly. Reports on the retailing side indicate, as expected, when we plot [them versus] a year ago that nominal gains were about 6 to 7 percent. I guess that's really all I have to say. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	42.0
198902	137	GREENSPAN	 President Boykin.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	138	BOYKIN	 Well, Mr. Chairman, in the Eleventh District I think you have to look at the Louisiana portion by itself because it does seem that Louisiana is continuing to deteriorate, with the unemployment rate there rising to about 10.4 percent in December. If you shift over to Texas and our part of New Mexico you continue to see some improvement; it's modest and slower than the rest of the nation, but at least it's going in the right direction. On a sectoral basis the split is equally pronounced, with the energy and construction industries still pretty weak and manufacturing and services continuing to improve. The energy industry is performing as though the expected price of oil is in the $15 to $16 range rather than the $17 to $19 trading range that we've seen over the last 8 weeks or so. The downturn in our construction activity now seems to be centered on the nonresidential construction. As for agriculture, there is some mention of concern about drought. I guess we did not suffer quite as much last year but we are beginning to have a little concern. Our winter wheat is already hurt and we're hearing fairly pessimistic reports from out in the farm areas. Overall, manufacturing continues to improve. In the first three quarters of last year, most of the gains were centered on the more trade sensitive industries; we've now seen that the less trade sensitive product lines are improving. Retail sales have been improving in both autos and other goods. Overall, we're looking for some strengthening of the regional economy in 1989 relative to 1988. So, that does make us feel a little better. On the national scene, about the only place we really have any difference with what Mike was saying is on inflation. We feel there certainly is a little more inflationary pressure now and in prospect than the staff is seeing. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	34.0
198902	139	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	140	KEEHN	 Mr. Chairman, with regard to the District, things are very much unchanged since my report at the previous meeting and that in itself may be significant. The outlook certainly continues to be positive. No one that we talk to in any way thinks that we're likely to have a recession this year. There are some early comments about the possibility of a recession in 1990 but those are the same kinds of comments that we heard last year about 1989. Alternatively, the general attitude is that we will not experience any particularly rapid acceleration in growth either. I think the inflationary picture continues to be very difficult to assess. The common wisdom is that we are going to see some escalation, particularly on the wage side; yet the reports I get from companies are not necessarily consistent with that common wisdom. The labor market continues to tighten. We are continuing to hear comments about shortages of skilled labor. But despite that, I'm surprised by how favorable the contract settlements continue to be-- [increases in] wages and fringe benefits of 3 to 4 percent on an annual basis. And though labor attitudes certainly are hardening, they have at least not yet begun to evidence themselves in significantly higher settlements. The price side of the picture, I suppose as always, is quite uneven. Steel prices have now begun to moderate. At this point many companies report that steel prices are only now back to the prices that they were paying in 1980 and 1981. So, though we've had a big escalation over the last two years, we're now getting back to those levels that we experienced earlier in the 1980s. But nonferrous prices are now beginning to accelerate again, particularly copper, nickel, and to a somewhat lesser extent,  aluminum. Chemical prices are moderating following the big increases that we had over the last year or two, but pulp prices are beginning to escalate pretty rapidly. I don't sense any consistent pattern in these materials prices. At one company that I talked to--it isn't a very large company but it tracks these things very carefully--their material price increases for 1988 came in about 2 percent higher than 1987. For 1989 they had been forecasting an increase of .4 percent. They very recently increased that from .4 to 1.3 percent, and that increase is entirely in the nonferrous area. But despite the increase, it is still lower than what they had in 1988. Virtually everybody continues to report very competitive conditions in the marketplace. For finished products there are competitive pressures that really make it difficult to pass price increases along, so there seems to be some continuing pressure there. With regard to the national outlook, our forecast is a bit more modest than the Board staff's but pretty consistent with the central tendency. I think our difference with the Board staff's forecast is partially timing, but a bit of it is also in this nonauto durables area that I asked Mike about. I continue to think that the risks at this point are on the inflation side--continued upward pressure on prices and, I do expect at some point, on wages. As a consequence, as we get into the policy deliberation we're going to continue to need to exert more pressure to deal with that. But having said that, I also have the feeling that, given what we have done so far, we are not necessarily behind the curve in dealing with the inflation problem. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	35.0
198902	141	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	142	FORRESTAL	 Mr. Chairman, the Sixth District's economic activity is not very much changed from the last time I reported. We are still showing strength in industrial production, as we have for some time, but in addition we now have some strength in the retail sector. The construction area remains pretty subdued and is weak. The chemical, aluminum, and paper producers are operating at very high rates of utilization, in many cases due to strong export orders. We're expecting a new aluminum plant to open in Georgia and that's rather an exception because most of the other producers we're looking at seem reluctant to add very significantly to capacity. And in some cases, such as in chemicals, they are actually looking for imports to meet strong domestic demands. Paper producers are fairly substantial purchasers of modernizing equipment but are not adding significantly to plant size. While we've seen some price increases announced, particularly for chemicals, paper, and aluminum, it's not clear that they are going to stick because there has been some customer reluctance to accept them. So, we may see a rollback of some of those price increases. On the retail side, sales appear to have remained very strong in January after what turned out to be a surprisingly good Christmas season. Price discounting in the District was less prevalent than last year, particularly in the post-holiday period. And inventories are now quite lean. While retail demand is good and was good during the holiday season, we did have over-expansion in this area and that has led three chains in the Atlanta market to close during the last few months. Office vacancy rates in the District seem to be a little lower than elsewhere in the nation but on the housing side we are  seeing weakness both in starts and in sales. That's evident in several cities around the Southeast but especially in Atlanta. Migration has proceeded at a lower pace than earlier in the expansion due to strong labor markets elsewhere in the country; and builders who had been planning for stronger population growth are now having some difficulty. The weakness in demand for lumber resulting from the housing weakness has been offset by stronger export sales that have helped to sustain activity in the lumber industry. We're hearing reports that wage gains are expected to be in the 4 to 6 percent area, and there are going to be some important labor contracts up for renewal this year. And we hear, as most other people do, that the sharp increase in the cost of benefits is putting quite a bit of pressure on costs generally. On the agricultural side, we too are getting very nervous about the water situation. We've had a drought in the Southeast basically for the last four or five years. And, we have not had winter rains as we should have had and that is making farmers and others extremely nervous. This is anecdotal, but I've also heard reports recently about increases in export prices by manufacturers who seem anxious to take advantage of the profit situation rather than to seek to expand market share. I think that's somewhat disturbing and [would concern me] if that were to become a national trend. On the national scene we have very few differences with the Greenbook forecast. We might have some divergence in 1990 but not very much. We continue to think that there is momentum in the economy, that we are operating above our potential, and that the vulnerability is on the inflation side. So, while our inflation forecast for 1989 is roughly the same as the one shown in the Greenbook, my own personal view is that the economy is vulnerable to higher prices rather than to lower. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	39.0

198902	144	STERN	 With regard to the District economy, the expansion in the District remains very solid at this point in time. The fourth quarter probably turned out better than many people had expected. Retail sales--these are [reports] from a major retailer-- were distinctly stronger in December and in January than we might have expected. And there is, by the way, a major expansion in the paper industry underway in the District in a variety of locations. Looking at the national economy, if I compare our model's forecast to the Greenbook I would have to say that our model's forecast is more favorable in the sense that it has somewhat more rapid economic growth with basically stable rates of inflation--at recent levels--and stable interest rates. Having said that, I think there is a message there that's similar to the Greenbook message: that is, that if you want to get the rate of inflation down it's going to take more than prevailing interest rates to accomplish that--or at least there is a relatively high probability that that's the case. If I look at the data as the Greenbook does on compensation, producer prices, consumer prices, and so on for the last year I think there clearly was a deterioration in the cost and price picture. My concern is that that might well continue. I would admit that to date we have had less inflation than I would have expected, given the growth in the economy and pressures as I perceive them on capacity. But having said that, we still have more inflation than I would like to see.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	41.0

198902	146	BOEHNE	 The middle Atlantic states continue to be characterized by a high level of economic activity. Labor markets are getting tighter. Even in Pennsylvania the rate of unemployment is well under the national rate for the first time in a long, long time; New Jersey and Delaware have been there now for several years. Wage increases tend to be higher than in the nation as a whole, particularly I think at the lower end. The most noticeable area of softening is in the real estate area. As far as the nation is concerned, I think the economy is growing too rapidly. It has more of a head of steam than I thought a couple of months ago and perhaps hoped a couple of months ago. As a result, the vulnerabilities to inflation seem higher to me now than they did just a meeting or so ago. I think this kind of a situation does require a response from us, but that's the topic of tomorrow. As for our forecast, we're within the central tendency although at the upper side of that. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	33.0
198902	147	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	148	ANGELL	 It seems to me that the most noteworthy development in the United States economy has been the slow growth of the money stock--no matter what measure you use--over the last two year's time. Having watched those figures for many, many years it seems rather unusual to have--if you take the staff's forecast through February, for example--the growth rate [of M2] over a two-year period at an annual rate of about 4.3 percent. The growth rate over the last full year was about 4.3 percent and the growth rate over the last half year was about 3 percent. I just have never seen such stable money growth of M2 in years of observing it. I recall that in 1986 there was considerable talk about whether or not the fast money growth was actually going to offset the deflationary experience that we had. I think there were quite a few of us who believed that it would. Maybe it took a while to do it but when it did, it did it with a clear impact upon both exchange rates and commodity prices. This time around it seems to me that the flow of money growth is being reflected in exchange rates much more rapidly, of course, than it is being reflected in commodity prices. It has been a very puzzling experience. As Don and Ted very well know, my own view is that if we continue with growth of the money stock as we are forecasting, the problem we may have in that environment--with regard to exchange rates--is too strong a dollar. But I would think that that dollar strength, in terms of overall economic developments, might provide the slack needed; that might very well be the antidote that is needed. Even though the drought maybe added not so much to the grain prices but somewhat more to the vegetable and fruit prices, it seems to me that the impact of the drought on commodity prices has delayed any turning point signal by commodity prices. It looks to me as if we're now getting a leading signal in commodity prices in that we're finally getting a declining rate of change. I don't mean by that that I think monetary policy ought to be adjusted because, indeed, unless commodity prices come down from the level where they now are I think we're quite likely to build in a much higher rate of inflation in the wage patterns that prevail. The only way to escape that is probably by having some decline in commodity prices. But I guess I'm somewhat encouraged by the trend of substitutes, such as ownership of other  currencies or ownership of gold. Frankly, I would feel still better if the price of gold reaches $350 an ounce. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0
198902	149	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	150	HOSKINS	 The fourth quarter in the Fourth District really was no surprise at all; it was similar to the rest of the year. It has been a very consistent story throughout the year; our economy didn't slow much during the summer and it didn't slow early in the year. Much like the situation in the unemployment rate there are [unintelligible] for all of them for the first time in a long time. That means service jobs but some on the manufacturing side. In discussions with manufacturers in the District we hear that they are operating at very high levels but are very reluctant to add new capacity. They are willing to run with higher inventories because they are operating at levels that are going to result in more breakdowns. But they are not ready to make the investments yet. The only weakness in the District is in Cincinnati and that was the football team! 	13	13	1.0	1.0	49.0

198902	154	HOSKINS	 We don't have much to say regarding the Greenbook forecast, which is very similar to ours, particularly for 1989. In 1990 we have a somewhat lower inflation rate than the Greenbook because we think a change in compensation practices as well as a continuous clearly announced policy with respect to inflation [unintelligible]. As we look at it now, we think that will have some favorable impacts in 1990 and going forward [if we] can do what the Greenbook implies when dealing with interest rates. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	49.0
198902	155	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	156	CORRIGAN	 My general view of the economy, Mr. Chairman, hasn't changed at all from what it has been at recent meetings in that I still think the risks are distinctly asymmetric on the side of too much growth and too much inflation. I still don't see any compelling evidence--as a matter of fact I don't see much evidence at all, at least at this moment--of the much needed moderation in the rate of growth in the domestic economy in particular. In terms of the outlook for 1989, our forecast is very similar to the Greenbook forecast, even in most of the details, insofar as real GNP growth is concerned. Our inflation rate is higher and indeed is a tad outside the central tendency as listed in the charts. [Our forecast for] 1990 is a very different story, which I'll come back to in a minute. But leaving aside 1990, when I look at the situation right now I guess my anxiety level is up a bit. It is up a bit really for two reasons, and they both relate to things that one could say about the economy and so on in public and other forums. For example, I got very used to saying, when asked--and I thought I could say it without my nose growing--that the underlying inflation rate was in the 4 to 4-1/2 percent range. I don't think I can say that anymore without my nose growing. When I look at all of the wage and price data, especially  from the fourth quarter, I think we now have to say that the inflation rate is, at best, in the 4-1/2 percent range. But certainly you'd have to drop that 4 to 4-1/2 percent out of that statement to have any credibility, much less--at least by my standards--intellectual honesty with yourself. Indeed, I think the range of the conpensation-type statistics, again with some emphasis on the fourth quarter, are particularly [alarming] in that regard. The other thing that I think we all parroted with some frequency in the recent past is a sense of comfort with respect to the external adjustment process, both in terms of what has happened and what lies out there in the future. And this is where 1990 is looming very large in my thinking. I don't consider that there's any such thing as a true forecast for 1990, with all due respect, Mike. I think we can all go through some arithmetic; and I think of it more as arithmetic than a forecast. But if you look at the arithmetic that was done in New York versus the arithmetic that was done here for 1990 you get a very, very dramatic difference. While we have an economy that's growing at a somewhat stronger rate than the Greenbook, we have the trade account and the current account adjustment process not only stopping but reversing: the trade deficit actually increases and the current account deficit actually increases. Now, in an approximate sense, the arithmetic reasons for that--I emphasize the arithmetic as opposed to the forecasting-- are fundamentally due to two things. Our foreign growth assumptions are almost identical. We do have a relatively small difference in the exchange rate: we have the real exchange rate unchanged whereas Ted, I think, has something like an 8 percent real depreciation. But that's not what really drives the thing. The big difference is that in Ted's and Mike's numbers for 1990 they have a very significant slowdown in the United States economy. When you look at their numbers versus our numbers, it's not the exchange rate and it's not the foreign growth that really makes the decisive difference in terms of whether that external adjustment process can continue with at least the right algebraic sign in 1990. That to me raises an even larger question, which Tom Melzer touched on a bit when he made reference to policy. And the question is: With anything roughly resembling the kind of exchange rates that are in either of those sets of arithmetic, can you get material progress over the next several years on an external adjustment process without a significant slowing in the rate of growth of the domestic economy? And if you can't, what does that imply in terms of the risks of a significant accident of one kind or another developing over that time frame? I really think that the horns of that dilemma are getting sharper and sharper, because if you think of it in terms of the exchange rate it's quite clear what it seems to imply. But the implications of that implication can be pretty nasty in their own right in terms of domestic interest rates and domestic financial market conditions. You can put it in the context of financing requirements; even with Mike's and Ted's combined 1989-90 current account deficits of $240 billion, we end up 1990 with net external liabilities in balance sheet terms of something like 13 percent of GNP. Those numbers are getting very, very large. So, Mr. Chairman, I don't know the way out of this box but when I think out beyond 1989 in the context of the kinds of issues that I just raised I must say that I'm not as optimistic as others about the inflation outlook. As I said, my anxiety level is getting pretty high. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198902	157	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	158	GUFFEY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On the District level, the District economy has continued to improve but at a slow pace-- slower, certainly, than the national average. The recoveries in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors continue and the higher oil prices that have fallen out of the late 1988 OPEC agreement have provided some stability to the energy sector. In agriculture we are concerned about another year of drought; a more immediate concern is this cold weather. For those livestock producers that rely upon farm ponds, for example--since they were not replenished during the past year and with the very cold weather those freeze solid--that means there is no water. As a result, some livestock will be sent to market under those conditions, which will accelerate this drawdown on the red meat supplies in the future and push up prices perhaps. With regard to the energy sector, while prices have firmed somewhat, the uncertainty surrounding whether or not OPEC will be able to fulfill the agreement still scares people away from investing substantial sums and putting down new wells or exploring for new reserves. In the manufacturing sector there are two really notable developments. One is in the automobile manufacturing assembly area where all of the plants--and Missouri, for example, would be the second biggest assembly area in the [country] after Michigan--are operating at a full two-shift operation. And there appears to be no slowdown in demand. On the other hand, general aviation concluded 1988 with significant increases in their billings, generally as a result of export demand for general aviation products. The interesting report on construction in the District is that the value of nonresidential construction in the District rose rather sharply in December and was about 33 percent above the year-earlier level. On the other hand, residential construction has fallen slightly and is somewhat below the year-earlier level. By and large the financial economic activity within the District is rather good with the exception of those areas such as Oklahoma that have been depressed; they are still sort of on the bottom with respect not only to employment but also to overhang on nonresidential construction-- commercial building, for example. But by and large the District is in pretty good shape and continues to improve. With respect to the outlook for the national economy, adopting the interest rate projections that are used by the staff, we come out virtually identically, with some minor differences. We have consumption a little higher and inventories a bit lower during 1989. But by and large we would be in the middle of the projections for the Committee members as a whole. There is a concern, at least on my part, with respect to prices--that is, inflation in the period coming up. In the services sector, for example, the benefits tacked on to otherwise projected wage increases give a strong indication that the risk is for higher prices rather than lower prices. I'd rather be ahead of the curve than behind the curve. And the increase in interest rates that is incorporated in our outlook as well as in the Board staff's outlook seems to be quite reasonable to me. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	20.0
198902	159	GREENSPAN	 Governor Heller. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	160	HELLER	 Thank you. I think we should probably look a little at the longer horizon because we have to set up long-run targets. In the outlook projected in the Greenbook, about a year from now you see a very, very [pronounced] weakening of the economy in  virtually every single sector except exports, which are still holding up. Growth slows down to the less than 1 percent range, close to a zero rate. The simulations that we've run also show that that holds true as a pattern even if you hold current policy very much constant. I agree with the comments made earlier that we are not behind the curve as far as the financial markets are concerned. We have a very strong dollar; we have some significant commodity prices actually dropping; we have a yield curve that points to low inflationary expectations. So that, combined with the very low monetary growth, which Governor Angell already talked about at great length, makes me think that we're actually looking at a significant slowdown a year from now, or for the horizon that we can still influence--the next quarter or two being in the bag. I have one other observation and that relates to foreign concerns, especially in Europe. There's a lot of concern about our tightening probably too much and the dollar becoming too strong over the immediate period ahead, thereby impairing the external adjustment process that is important for that. Thanks. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	46.0
198902	161	GREENSPAN	 Governor Johnson. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	162	JOHNSON	 I have a perspective similar to Governor Heller's. I'm just looking at a lot of different things here. First, on the unit labor cost side, I realize we've had some acceleration this year; but looking at the charts on the handout we're not at the rate that existed at the end of 1986. And then there was a deceleration in 1987 with some fairly strong growth in the rate of unit labor costs. So I don't think there's anything given about an acceleration in unit labor costs. If you look at the pattern, it has been fairly sawtoothed since 1984 on this chart; it doesn't show any sign of any particular direction. Compensation is up because of non- wage compensation but I don't know whether that will continue. Wages are still in pretty good shape, so I don't think there's any accelerating trend on the wage front if non-wage compensation doesn't continue to accelerate. On the employment side, we've had some strong employment numbers. But I went back and looked at some of the previous periods and turning points. The obvious one is in 1984 when growth was very strong in the first half and then the economy slipped down to 2-1/2 percent and then below 2 percent in the second half of the year. We had payroll employment growth averaging over 300,000 all the way through November, even after we hit the turning point; so I'm not sure we're going to get any leading signals out of the employment numbers. And there is something else interesting: over the two-year period in which we averaged about 2-1/2 percent real growth average payroll employment was about 240,000 per month. Now, that doesn't say a whole lot for productivity growth, I admit; but still, I'm not sure what we can read out of the employment growth numbers. There are some other signs of slowing that I see even looking at the charts. We have a much slower pattern of new orders, looking at the charts in the nondefense capital goods area; I know that excludes aircraft, but that's a volatile element we're assuming aside. Vender performance has been improving. Export growth has slowed, thank heaven; it has slowed from a rapid pace, but it certainly has slowed. Surveys of plant and equipment spending for 1989 are lower and that's showing in the numbers; from purchasing managers' reports it certainly looks like things are slowing. And surveys of other  outside forecasts that have been made indicate that they're similar to the Greenbook's, with some even a little weaker. But the important thing is that most of them assume lower interest rate patterns even from here. They certainly don't assume the interest rate path that we have built into the Greenbook. The Bluechip forecast, which is sort of a consensus forecast, has a similar pattern of growth in inflation but that forecast actually has the funds rate declining later this year. So, you get a similar path with a totally different set of interest rate assumptions than ours. Other people have pointed out the financial indicators. Real M2 growth and nominal M2 growth are both very modest; real M2 growth is even negative. The yield curve is inverted. Long bonds are quite well behaved; long-bond rates are well below the funds rate, especially on a coupon basis. There are certainly no signs of accelerating inflationary expectations in the financial markets in commodity prices, bonds, or the dollar. One thing that worries me a good bit, too, is the fact that a critical part of the Greenbook forecast is the dollar forecast. That depreciation in the dollar, as I said, [accounts] for three quarters of a percent of the growth rate in 1990 and that's assuming about a 10 or 13 percent dollar depreciation. And that is assumed in spite of the fact that we're assuming about a 1-1/2 percentage point appreciation in short-term interest rates from current levels. Not only that, but the interest rate appreciation we assume is not matched by foreign interest rates. So I see no way, with relative interest rate appreciation in the United States compared to other countries, that you can possibly have a dollar depreciation with that kind of pattern of interest rates. I think if you turn that dollar path around you get a totally different picture out of the Greenbook forecast. It was pointed out in some of the alternatives--if you look at the one that assumes no change in the dollar, and I wouldn't even bet on that with the kind of interest rate path we have built into the Greenbook--that if you don't accelerate money growth to offset the impact on the real sector you get substantially weaker growth and moderation in the inflation rate from these levels. That's a scenario that looks more plausible to me than the one we have built in there. So I would say, trying to take into account those lags and being conscious of some of these other possibilities, that we ought to be very cautious about them. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	44.0
198902	163	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	164	KELLEY	 Mr. Chairman, I have some concern about becoming too much of a Johnny one-note in this Committee when I speak but I would like to reiterate my point that we [should] look at monetary policy in a very broad context of the overall picture of the United States--its social and political and indeed international course and the economic mix. I think there are some very major problems in the United States, and indeed in the world, that could be severely exacerbated if we are too aggressive, too fast: S&Ls, LDCs, the budget deficit and what could happen to it under several different kinds of scenarios. And I think that our anti-inflationary efforts, to which we all subscribe, deserve to be considered in that larger context. In the meantime, for now it seems to me that as far as inflation fighting goes there are some pretty good things going on. The dollar is behaving very well; the aggregates continue to be very slow, which is good; everybody, I believe, is pleasantly surprised at the sluggishness of inflation relative to what they might have expected  given what they saw going on a few months ago. I'm not necessarily convinced that it's baked in the cake that we won't continue to be pleasantly surprised. In short, I think we very well may need to do more as time goes on and, of course, we should watch that very carefully. But for the moment it seems to me that things are going as well as they could and we should be quite careful not to create more problems than are already out there in the world, perhaps influenced by this body but not directly under the aegis of this body. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	48.0
198902	165	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	166	SEGER	 I just want to add a couple of points to those made by Governors Heller and Johnson along the lines that some of the forecasts of people on the outside seem to be somewhat different from ours. The purchasing managers' survey and the Bluechip forecast were mentioned before. This morning I had breakfast with some business economists representing a wide range of companies-- forest products company, a large energy company, two chemical companies, these kinds of outfits--and to a person they don't see the capacity shortages that we all wring our hands over. They also certainly are pleased that their businesses are doing well but they don't sense a [boom] taking place. They are expecting prices of the raw materials that they will purchase this year to increase but at a mere fraction of the increase of last year. And they also are expecting some slowing down. One fellow who couldn't attend, the chief economist of sent me a fax. I mention this because we often mention as an example of a rust belt outfit that shaped up and is now doing well. I'm certainly not going to read the whole fax but let me just read selections. He said business has slowed down and is declining in housing-related construction, with about one-third of models on allocation compared to well over one-half early last year. The allocated models are large machines associated with a worldwide mining boom. Industry is never tooled for these peaks; it would leave too much idle capacity in softer times. It's customary to stretch delivery. Then he says that sales outside the United States are up 33 percent over the last year but that business is beginning to slow down in Europe. Then he talks about materials prices being up less than the PPI and he expects that to continue; suppliers are asking for bigger increases but their target is less than national inflation. Also, I got something from the National Association of Home Builders. They have a forecast of housing starts of 800,000--a figure 800,000 below ours for 1989--and a proportional decline in multifamily versus single-family starts. And they are only assuming an additional 1/2 percentage point increase in long rates, specifically mortgage rates. The third thing that I haven't heard people mention is the impact of the restructuring. It seems to me that I read that General Motors is going to be closing a plant near Boston, so maybe that will help the labor shortage there; that's going to throw about 3,000 people in [the labor pool]. And it takes 6 hamburger flippers to be equivalent [in pay] to one of the jobs of those laid off. Xerox will be laying off 2,000 in Rochester; that ought to help Jerry's area. Also, I haven't heard anybody allude to the thrift mess and the impact that might have on the overall economy. I can't prove it, but I sense that if it isn't handled promptly and smoothly there could be a negative impact. Furthermore, as Mike Kelley suggested, if we tighten too much--if interest rates move still higher--we could also make the mess worse than it now is, taking some of the modestly solvent and  profitable thrifts and throwing them over on the other pile. Also, to reiterate, the monetary growth numbers are good; at least as I read them, they are about the best since I've been here. I haven't been able to quantify the impact of higher interest rates on monthly installment loan payments as more and more variable rate loans are used, but I just cannot imagine that it's not going to take place. We now have had enough of a rise in the short rates to which many of these instruments are tied that I would think [the rate adjustments] would start kicking into effect and would produce higher monthly payments. Maybe everyone who signed on to one of these instruments had their monthly incomes advance as fast; if that's the case, they're lucky. But for those who didn't, they aren't represented by in their negotiations. Perhaps they will have to cover their higher payments on these loans by cutting back on something else. So, I guess I'm just not convinced that the forecast in here is in the bag. Thank you. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
198902	167	GREENSPAN	 Governor LaWare. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	168	LAWARE	 I agree with large parts of what several people have said here. I share the skepticism with regard to how the dollar can depreciate to the extent that it is forecasted to do, given the kind of interest rate scenario that we've adopted. And in that context then one begins to get worried about whether we can continue to make the favorable progress in external adjustments without that trend from the dollar. I agree with most of what Governor Johnson said, but I'm a little more worried in that I think there has been some lag with regard to prices and wages that we're beginning to see bubble up. And I get worried that we may not be staying ahead of the curve anymore in that connection--that we may see some real inflationary pressures emerging from wages and prices that are now beginning to come up as a result of things that have happened before. So, that would argue for the constraint that is argued for here. On the other hand, I'm very concerned about the fact that there are some significant signs of a turndown in parts of this operation. I think that the energy price forecast --and Ted and I have talked about this several times--is a little dicey. That could be higher. I'm concerned about the things that Mike [Kelley] talked about; he and I have sounded kind of like a broken record in the discussions between us over the last several meetings of this group on those issues. The thrifts are not only going to get hit with this interest rate increase but on top of that they are also going to get an increase in their assessment under their insurance operations. So I'm very concerned that in our zeal to try to reverse inflation that we don't unconsciously create stagflation with a very low growth rate or maybe even a negative rate, while at the same time we have these other factors catching up with us and we see some real upward pressure on prices and wages. So I'm with Governor Johnson; I think we ought to be very cautious about what we do at this particular moment in time. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	50.0
198902	169	GREENSPAN	 President Syron. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	170	SYRON	 Let me start out with the thrift issue. First of all, I think the point is well taken in terms of the effect of rates in the short run on thrifts. Figures I looked at for the savings and loan industry as a whole show about a negative 17 percent gap. So a  50 basis point increase in rates roughly costs them about $1 billion of their capital. One could assume, under current circumstances, that that translates roughly to what has to be done in terms of giving assistance. But I think that there is a difference between the short term and the long term in the sense that it doesn't obviate our need to take steps that prevent inflation from getting further out of hand as time goes on because--and I'm sure the staff has done some work on this--you have the linear function of what it costs the thrifts as rates rise. Also, many of the largest thrift institutions have hedges that are humped in the sense that they may be feeling well protected going out 150 - 200 basis points even when they get into residuals going back, say, for 100 basis points. But these hedges fall off a cliff if one gets into a situation where you get very dramatic increases, or decreases for that matter, in rates. So I think that's something that has to be factored into the equation when you're looking at the thrifts. What I have to say about our view of the real economy is probably quite redundant to what many other people have said. We have very little difference with the Greenbook forecast. We do come out somewhat higher on the inflation side; we come out actually slightly out of the central tendency area on that. That has to do with the impact we expect the rate of growth will have on the unemployment rate. But to be honest, that's probably related in part to our own experience in the region. We do feel that the risks are quite asymmetric--that's the New England pronunciation for asymmetric, I guess--but they're doubly asymmetric in the sense that we may get more inflation and then we think the difficulties of dealing with these issues may be harder if we get into an inflationary situation. But this is to be discussed tomorrow. As far as the region goes, we are seeing some softness, relatively, in New England. Not to contradict what I said before, but I think the reason that we're seeing some softness is because we really had a boom for a long period of time. If you look at Massachusetts for example--and Massachusetts is half of New England-- per capita income in the state now is 123 percent of the national average whereas in 1975 it was 103 percent. If you were to adjust for relative costs it really would have been below that. Consistent with that, wages have been rising quite rapidly. When Bob [Boykin] talked about Louisiana [I was reminded of] some work we had done looking at manufacturing cross sectional data on hourly earnings versus the unemployment rate in manufacturing. States that are the highest are all the New England states. Louisiana has to be one of the states that was lowest, consistent with what he was saying. And the local price level, if one wants to assign any real weight to that given the smallness of the sample, shows that prices are rising at about a 6.3 percent overall rate in the greater Boston area. Now, I think it's interesting that southern New England is doing much more poorly--or it's starting to do more poorly--than northern New England, which experienced some of this relative prosperity later on. The only industry that we have right now in southern New England that is doing better than nationally is the construction industry, which happens to come fairly late in the regional business cycle. And we do have a quite soft real estate market. But the lessons--if there are any-- that I draw from this for the national economy are that the problems that we have in the region are the result of having grown very, very strongly for a period of time at a pace that was not sustainable. And  maybe that influences our view of the approach one should take to policy nationally. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	51.0

198902	173	GREENSPAN	 Let me just add a few things relevant to the meetings of the G-7, which I think relate in part to some of the questions with respect to the international adjustment process. The thing I found rather surprising in the talk among the central bankers, especially the ministers, is what I would call a relatively laid-back attitude on the issue of the international adjustment process slowing down. When the issue of reversal surfaced they clearly thought that that would be a problem but few of them really were concerned about a reversal and none about a slowing down, from which I conclude that there is a fairly considerable willingness on the part of these countries both in their private and public sectors to absorb liabilities against the United States. And I think, as Ted mentioned, that they are sort of delighted with the surpluses and the effect of the claims, especially the buildup of the claims, in an almost mercantilistic power sense. I suspect, however, that a goodly part of that reflects the fact that the dollar instead of going straight down and creating large capital losses has been kicking around over the last year and has essentially been flat. It's a two-way street. And hence, the negative attitude toward holding dollar-denominated obligations I think has faded very dramatically. I think the two upticks in the dollar in the summer and again here have created a really clear change in the fears relative to the adjustment process. It's very obvious that it can't go on indefinitely, but I think it is an important short-term event which suggests to me that the type of crisis that Jerry is worried about is not [likely] in the short term. It's an intermediate problem and one which I think could lull us for a while; but I do think we have to be a little careful about it. Secondly, as Bob Heller mentioned, there is some concern about the impact of the level of interest rates in the world--or more exactly the level of United States interest rates and, therefore, the strength of the dollar--because there is a vague laid-backness about the stalling of the adjustment process. But there is a latent fear that it could begin to reverse and I think that would accumulate into a fairly significant set of concerns amongst finance ministers, and to a much lesser extent central bank governors, who have been largely supportive of general strengthening. The process I think is particularly pronounced amongst the I certainly don't get it --clearly they have been foursquare about moving interest rates up very sharply--nor do I get it very much obviously in a number of the central banks. But there's a vague mild division that's beginning to emerge--leaving --between the finance ministers on the one side and the central bank governors on the other with respect to the issue of international monetary tightening. The central bank governors, I think pretty much uniformly, have been very supportive of us; whereas finance ministers, for reasons I don't have to get into, are less enthusiastic about interest rates. But at the moment the issue is really very mild; there are no strong reactions. The only strong reaction I saw in the G-7 meeting was when  But the rest of the session was relatively pleasant. So at the moment I would say that one finds a remarkable degree of tranquility in the international outlook as perceived amongst the industrial countries. And I do not get the impression from the governors that they are in an aggressively tightening mode--in other words, after the Germans moved on the Lombard and discount rates. One gets the impression that the sequence that occurred as a consequence of that has slowed down somewhat, at least if you listen to the oral remarks. I don't know how long that is going to last and what it's saying, but one does not get the sense of a continuous process moving. It's getting close to break time and I think we're pretty much on schedule, so I guess there's no reason why we cannot meet as scheduled at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow morning. So, unless anybody has a problem-- [Meeting recessed]  February 8, 1989--Morning Session 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	174	GREENSPAN	 Let me start off by requesting that each individual President and Governor try to get a final revised forecast for the Humphrey-Hawkins series to us prior to 3 p.m. on Friday, February 10 if that's at all possible. If there is any difficulty--if there is some slippage, as I suspect is probable--let's try to get them in as quickly as we can. That will save a lot of trouble and work in the process. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198902	175	BOYKIN	 Mr. Chairman, has the date of the testimony been set yet? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	34.0
198902	176	GREENSPAN	 Yes it has. It's the 21st and 22nd. We are now to a point where Mr. Kohn will discuss the longer-run ranges for the aggregates. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	177	KOHN	" Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thought it might be useful to put today's decision about 1989  ranges in the context of the longer-term strategy for policy and how that  relates to the FOMC's ultimate objectives. The presumption is that, in  accord with both economic theory and a long history of statements by FOMC  members, the primary objective of the central bank is to promote price  stability. In fact ""reasonable price stability"" is a goal in the  Humphrey-Hawkins Act, though it is subordinated there to achieving very  low levels of unemployment. Emphasis on price stability as a policy  objective has a number of beneficial effects. It provides a clear  rationale for the conduct of policy, and a standard against which policy  actions can be measured. When the rationale is backed by action, as in  1988, the result is enhanced credibility for the central bank, which may  itself further the achievement of the objective. While the results of  this credibility have been most transparent in prices of long-term credit  and foreign exchange, it seems reasonable to think that reduced inflation  expectations may also be affecting the pricing of output and labor at the  margin.  It is tempting in this context to consider setting and announcing  specific time tables for reducing inflation and achieving price stability  as various Presidents and Governors have suggested. Two difficulties come  to mind, however. One is that the Federal Reserve could not realistically  be held accountable for a specific result on a year-by-year basis, given  the multiplicity of imperfectly predictable factors outside its control  that affect near-term price movements. Divergences of results from targets could have adverse consequences for confidence. Moreover, the very  long lags between central bank actions and effects on prices, together  with the diverse nature of the other influences on prices make it impossible to establish in advance a simple, understandable guide to Federal  Reserve reactions to misses from specific price objectives. If the public  developed expectations of particular reactions, and they were not met,  the credibility-generating benefits of the explicit target might be  further eroded.  In the context of a general objective to restore price stability,  the staff forecast, as Mike noted, assumed that the FOMC would act to put  in place conditions that would lead to some reductions in inflation over  time. In the staff's judgment, that requires additional restraint and  higher real and nominal interest rates. Real rates have risen appreciably  at the short end of the yield curve over much of the past year, as nominal  rates increased while near-term inflation expectations showed little net  change. And despite declines in nominal bond rates, real long-term rates  may also have risen, judging from some survey evidence of reduced longer-  term inflation expectations and perhaps also from the upward pressure on  the dollar. But, given the evidence of underlying strength in demands on  the economy and of greater wage and price pressures at current levels of  resource utilization, these rates are seen as needing to rise further to  foster even slow progress toward the ultimate objective.  The policy restraint assumed in the staff forecast implies the  need for damped money growth in 1989 especially for M2, which is projected to grow 3-1/2 percent under this forecast. The slow growth in M2  is a result of the short-run interest sensitivity of this aggregate, which  has been heightened of late by the especially sluggish movement of M2  offering rates. Even if deposit rates were not unusually slow to adjust,  money growth would be quite depressed relative to income for several  quarters in 1989, just from the effects of the tightening that has already  occurred. With the slow deposit rate adjustment and the additional  restraint under the staff forecast in 1989, a velocity increase in the  order of 3-1/2 percent is expected this year, with both M2 and velocity  essentially continuing on the paths established in the second half of  1988.  The effects of rising interest rates are considerably greater for  M2 than M3, but growth of the latter is also expected to be quite damped,  at 4-3/4 percent this year under the staff forecast. In part this is a  feed-through of slow M2 growth and the tendency to replace a portion of  the shortfall in retail deposits with managed liabilities outside M3. In  addition, we have made some allowance for a less active thrift industry.  In the case of M2, the thrift crisis and its resolution are expected to  have only indirect effects, working through restraint on offering rates  and higher opportunity costs, partly as a result of throttling back more  aggressive thrifts. The underlying assumption is that any M2 deposits  lost by thrifts because of uncertainties and lack of confidence would end  up in banks. The impact on M3 is likely to be larger and more direct as  insolvent thrifts are placed under closer control or closed, and tight  growth restraints are placed on under-capitalized institutions. The  mortgage credit these institutions would have extended is more likely to  be channelled to a variety of lenders through secondary markets, in effect  reducing overall intermediation through depository institutions.  Despite the relatively slow money growth in the staff forecast  for 1989, the effects on inflation are delayed and muted, even when the  basic approach is extended to 1990 and 1991, as in strategy I in the blue-  book, page 6, which is the baseline forecast used by Mike and Ted,  Strategy II, which is keyed off one percent slower money growth, begins to  make some progress in reducing inflation this year and leads to a full  percentage point reduction by 1991. Nominal interest rates would rise by  even more than under the staff forecast in the near-term, but would return  to close to the strategy I path in 1990, given the resulting slowing of  income and inflation and depressing effects on money demand. Real rates,  however, would be higher over the forecast horizon to damp demand and  relieve price pressures.  As Mike noted, these kinds of simulations shouldn't be taken too  literally. The results, however, are suggestive of some aspects of the  current situation, at least as embodied in the staff baseline and model  structure. In particular, moderate monetary restraint as in the staff  forecast or in strategy II, doesn't buy much in the way of lower inflation  over the near term. Partly this is a function of the way in which policy  works affecting first the real economy and through that prices, given the  stickiness of the wage and price setting process. In addition, the  response of inflation to relatively small deviations of output from  potential normally isn't very large. But, in the current situation the  effect in terms of reducing inflation is delayed because of the starting  point that is, an economy that already may be running above levels of  resource utilization that seem to be consistent with holding, much less  damping, inflation. In this circumstance, some restraint may be needed to  stop inflation from accelerating even before it can be brought down, resulting in a interim period of slow growth, but still fairly high inflation. On the other side, there are no credibility bonuses built into the  simulation. If still lower inflation expectations induced by policy  tightening interact with greater price and wage flexibility than assumed  in the exercise, perhaps in response to international competitive pressures, a more pronounced near-term disinflationary effect could occur.  Another aspect of the money paths in the strategies may have a  bearing on the choice of ranges for 1989 that is the tendency for money  to accelerate in 1990 and 1991. This results from a leveling out of  nominal interest rates once the economy slows, and with that velocity, so  that a pick up in money growth is not inconsistent with some continuing  restraint on spending.  For 1989, two possible sets of ranges for the money and debt  aggregates are given on page 9 of the bluebook. Both encompass the  staff's expectations for these measures this year. Alternative I includes  the ranges adopted in July on a tentative basis. They are a full percentage point lower for M2 than those for 1988, and 1/2 point lower for M3 and  debt. Even so, staff expectations are for money growth well down in the  lower halves of the ranges, especially for M2. As noted above, this is  not just an artifact of the additional rate increases assumed in the staff  forecast. Even if nominal GNP growth like that in the staff forecast were  to occur while interest rate levels remained at current levels, M2 still  would be likely to grow in the lower half of its range. This leaves  limited scope at the lower end of the range for a tighter policy than in  the staff forecast, should inflation pressures be more intense or prompter  progress on this front be desired. And at its upper end, 7 percent M2  growth this year implies room for, and possible tolerance of, a substantial pick up from 1987 and 1988 at a time when an important concern would  seem to be constraining nominal expansion to limit price pressures.  In these circumstances, lower growth ranges., like those in alternative II might be considered. The principal drawback would seem to be  found in consideration of how ranges should be formulated over a series  of years. As noted in the various strategies, a pick up in money growth  in coming years may be appropriate as inflation levels out or moderates.  In that case, if the ranges are reduced rapidly at this time they might  have to be raised later or exceeded. More limited reductions now will  make future decreases, for example in 1990, a more reasonable prospect in  a long-term process of reducing the ranges toward levels consistent with  price stability. If alternative I ranges are reaffirmed, the Committee  might want to consider whether to inform Congress that money growth might  be in the lower halves of the ranges; that might be explained as an aspect  of ""erring on the side of restraint"", both as it already occurred in 1988  given the lagged effect on money growth, and prospectively in 1989.  Both alternatives include ranges that continue the 4 percentage  point width now in use. The rationale for this wider range was never very  clear with respect to M3 and credit. Even for M2, many of the questions  last February about appropriate growth in 1988 had to do with particular  uncertainties in the wake of the stock market collapse. Unusual uncertainties as we begin in 1989 seem more centered on the financial sector in  the form of thrift difficulties and of the course of leveraged corporate  restructuring activity, which would affect mainly M3 and debt; doubts  about which way the economy and interest rates will go seem no more imponderable than usual, though M2 demand may be especially interest sensitive  if deposit rate adjustments remain sluggish. If there were some interest  in narrowing the ranges, while at the same time reinforcing the message of  determination to lean against inflation, shaving an additional 1/2 percentage point off of the upper ends of the ranges might be considered.  Finally, in the draft directive, language has been retained to  say that again no range has been established for Ml. Some modifications  also are suggested should the Committee wish to indicate that movements in  all the aggregates not just Ml will be evaluated in light of other indicators of the effect of policy on the economy. In many respects this  would be consistent with the Chairman's last two Humphrey-Hawkins testimonies, and also with the operational paragraph of the directive. On  the other hand, there is a better case to be made for the aggregates as  long-run policy guides than as constraints on intermeeting reserve adjustments. "	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	178	GREENSPAN	 Any questions for Mr. Kohn? Lee. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	179	HOSKINS	 Don, in your discussion about the multi-year problem, which I think you laid out nicely in terms of whether we stick with 3 to 7 percent or go to something else, obviously there are advantages on both sides. One is that we can march down the aggregates--at least the top end--consistently over time to demonstrate to people that we're serious about our policy. But that doesn't fit very well with the interest-sensitivity of M2 these days. You might want to argue that if we get [unintelligible] centering the 1989 target on 2-1/2 percent and going from 1 to 4 percent or on 3-1/2 percent with 1 to 5 percent and then next year having to say that it's going to go back to 3 to 7 percent or something like that--we have to explain that. In that context, if we were to choose to go that way, did the staff consider going to multi-year targeting now instead of in July? We will do 1990, I think, in July. So, if we were to go that route, it might make some sense to put out two sets of targets. If we were going to go to one, would we adjust M2 to reflect the interest- sensitivity? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	49.0
198902	180	KOHN	 We did not consider that, President Hoskins. I think there is something to be said for looking out over longer horizons. On the other hand, I remember the Committee discussion of last July in which there was some resistance to setting ranges for the next year because of the uncertainties involved in specifying those ranges even 6 months ahead of time. So I think it cuts both ways. It's really hard to know where you're going to be at the end of 1989 in terms of setting ranges that might be appropriate for 1990, although we've taken our best guess in this forecast.

198902	182	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, Don did such an excellent job of outlining various alternatives and he answered most any question I might have. But I do have one little simple question that I'd like to ask. Do you personally, Don, have more respect for the price projections made by your big model or by your single-equation model that stems from that very excellent memo we got back in November of  last year? I guess that tells you which one I have the most respect for. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	7.0
198902	183	KOHN	 I have to see what's happening at my back here with Mr. Prell. But I actually-- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	184	BLACK	 When you're winning something-- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	7.0
198902	185	PRELL	 I know where he lives. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	186	KOHN	 I think in terms of the short run--over the next year or two--I would have more confidence in the staff's projections for inflation on the grounds that they take account of certain factors that are important. I think the reason that the P star [P*] model, as we call it, came in with lower inflation rates for the same money growth is that it didn't take account of factors that are important in the year-to-year rates of inflation. In this case I'm thinking of the energy price impact on the early part of 1989 and particularly the assumed dollar depreciation effect on prices in the latter part of 1989 and 1990. Those things clearly aren't taken account of in that P* model in which prices depend solely on money, adjusted for trend velocity and output. So, I would have some confidence in that model as giving some sense of where those money supplies might be taking us over extended periods of time. But if you asked me which inflation forecast I would have most confidence in for 1989 or 1990 I think I would say the staff forecast, given the additional information they bring to that forecasting process. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	187	BLACK	 I wouldn't want to-- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	7.0
198902	188	PRELL	 I would like to underscore that the comparison you were making was not totally accurate in that the base line, or what was presented in the Bluebook, is the staff's judgmental forecast. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	189	KOHN	 Right. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	190	PRELL	 We use the large models, in fact a combination of several models, to create all the alternatives from that base line. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	191	BLACK	 Yes, I realize that. I didn't mean to oversimplify. I would have equal confidence for 1989 since they project the same inflation figures that I did; there was very little difference. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	7.0
198902	192	KOHN	 The lesson I took from the P* model was that if we had M2 growth like we were talking about--in the 3-1/2 to 5 or 6 percent range or something lower--we would be putting some downward pressure on the inflation rate over time more with strategy II than strategy I. But even the staff's strategy, which doesn't give you much of a payoff in the short run, is putting into place conditions that will provide at least some payoff over the long run. So when we ran that model, even though the results weren't the same, I took a little comfort in that, in my view, it didn't contradict the underlying thrust of the staff forecast.

198902	195	ANGELL	 Don, I noticed and was pleased that your long- run strategies really were based on M2, with hardly any discussion of M3 or nonfinancial debt. Have you and your staff given specific thought to dropping the M3 targeting? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	43.0
198902	196	KOHN	 We have not. I think in the past the Committee has found it useful to have more than one target given the different kinds of information embodied in the different aggregates. Obviously, [we would] if the Committee were to instruct us that it was their choice to go to one aggregate. But it seems to me that you would lose a little information that you get from the growth of a broader aggregate or credit or debt. I would hesitate to focus so narrowly on any particular aggregate in terms of announcing targets to the public, even though we have keyed our forecasting exercises off either interest rates or the exchange rate or M2 as a target variable.

198902	201	GREENSPAN	 Well, I think that may have been to a large extent Senator Proxmire. I'll find out in a couple of weeks. On the other hand, acquiescing to that would develop into a very tough request. Rather than even suggesting that we thought they were interested or even that we might try to meet that request, I would just as soon go up there making believe I didn't hear anything and then wait and see what happens.

198902	205	KOHN	 No, no, not at all. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	206	SEGER	 Okay. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	40.0
198902	207	KOHN	 In fact, I was trying to use that to reinforce the notion that that's an appropriate long-run objective for the central bank. The Humphrey-Hawkins [language] includes reasonable price stability as one of the objectives of that Act.  	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0

198902	209	KOHN	 Unfortunately, I guess, from that perspective it says that one shouldn't necessarily hit that if it interferes with 3 percent unemployment. But it does list it in any number of places. The whole sentence-- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	210	SEGER	 Oh yes, I understand that. But it sounded as though we were departing from what they had in mind, but maybe it's just too early in the morning. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	40.0
198902	211	ANGELL	 But that would be nice. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	43.0

198902	219	KOHN	 That would require faster money growth than even the strategy III. For example, I think Mike said 7 percentage points more M2 growth by the end of 1991, whereas this has only 3 percentage points more M2 growth by the end of 1991. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	220	PRELL	 The number we have here is 3/4 of a percentage point faster in 1989 and 2-1/2 points in 1990 and then another 3-1/2 points in the next year. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	221	JOHNSON	 What velocity assumptions go with that? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	44.0
198902	222	PRELL	 No velocity assumptions go with it, but one could calculate velocities roughly from these real GNP and price numbers that we have here. Doing it rapidly in my head it looks like a drift toward declining velocity. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	223	KOHN	 My guess is that velocities would decline over the next year or so as offering rates caught up to the flat market rates, reducing opportunity costs and enhancing the demand for M2. Once that equilibrium was reached then M2 velocity would essentially be unchanged. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	224	JOHNSON	 Right. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	44.0
198902	225	KOHN	 But it would decline over the--  	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	226	PRELL	 Yes. I guess there would-actually be a small velocity increase in 1990-91. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	227	KOHN	 It's probably a function of the way the model cycles the offering rates and the market-- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	228	JOHNSON	 But a decline in the rate of change--in the growth rate of velocities--right? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	44.0
198902	229	PRELL	 Well, basically we've got stable short-term interest rates, so we don't get any meaningful velocity movement one way or the other. And as you look out over time--after you get through the lagged effects of past interest rate changes moving the velocity--as the stable rates are essentially reflected in the deposit rates, you wouldn't expect big movements in velocity. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	230	JOHNSON	 I was just thinking that I would expect the rate of growth maybe to settle down to the zero rate. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	44.0
198902	231	PRELL	 Right. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	232	KOHN	 Eventually it would end up there, yes. But first there probably would be an increase early this year, given the lagged effects. Then it probably would come off; I'm sure it would. It would have this humped shape as the offering rates caught up with the [market] rates. Possibly you'd find at some point a leveling off. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	233	SEGER	" I still sense, though, that there's an option missing here. You have number ""I,"" which is your base line, which is tightening, right? You have number ""II,"" which is additional tightening. "	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	40.0
198902	234	KOHN	 Right. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0

198902	237	SEGER	 Well, at least that's what you read. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	40.0
198902	238	KOHN	 Excuse me, more money growth. I didn't have a constant interest rate option in here in part because Mike had one in his briefing. I thought rather than replicating the options I would have one that was somewhere in between constant interest rates and the staff's rising interest rate forecast. And that was my option three. It's easier than the staff forecast but it does not keep nominal interest rates unchanged from current levels over the near term, although the movements in rates aren't very large. There still would be some upward movement in rates over the year, but not much. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0

198902	252	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	253	HOSKINS	 Don, I have a question about your earlier statement with respect to the credibility of Federal Reserve policy. You said it was important that we have credibility and that we pursue it; you said that we probably gained some credibility along the way as judged by the financial markets. I guess I have some concerns about not picking a specific objective over time. My concerns are as follows and I'd like you to respond to them. We are asking the markets and the public in general to trust us on two levels now: on the objective and on how we're going to implement it. We have an objective out there someplace called price stability that we may trade off against anything else at any point in time. I think we might be able to increase our credibility to some extent if we could at least pin down the objective and then just ask them to trust us on how we implement it, because we're having trouble with the aggregates or interest rates or commodity prices. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	49.0
198902	254	KOHN	 I think we--the Chairman in particular in recent testimonies--put out a very strong statement about our objective and backed it with reasons why price stability is our objective, without necessarily saying [we plan to achieve that] by the year 1993 or something like that. In my view, it's a debatable point. I raised the issue in part to stimulate the debate. There are dangers in putting out various specific objectives--2 percent or 1 percent or even zero, whatever zero is in reality, by 1992 or 1993 --because of the problems that arise when you miss it, and so forth. So I think we  can continue to make strong statements and back it up with actions. Ultimately, as someone was saying, credibility grows out of the barrel of an open market operation. It's what we do more than what we say-- read our actions rather than our lips--that sets scores on credibility. And as we act over time with that in mind I don't think there's a problem--or there's less of a problem. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	255	HOSKINS	 Just one other comment. I think what Martha was alluding to, if I'm correct, was that we are not paying sufficient attention perhaps to the other parts in the Humphrey-Hawkins Act. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	49.0
198902	256	SEGER	 No, I was just picking up on what I thought Don said was in the Humphrey-Hawkins Act. I didn't write Humphrey- Hawkins, but as it was written they put a higher priority on the employment side of things and mentioned price stability. I was just saying from Don's comment that it sounded to me as if we were establishing priorities that were divergent from what Humphrey-Hawkins had. That's all I was saying. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	40.0
198902	257	HOSKINS	 I would say we're consistent with it. If we pursue price stability then we will pursue maximum employment. I don't see any inconsistency there. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	49.0
198902	258	KOHN	 That's the way it happens. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	259	SEGER	 May I pick up on the credibility issue? It bothers me to hear over and over again that we somehow or other just have to satisfy the financial markets. I'm very respectful of the financial markets but it's a big country out there and there are a lot more Main Streets than there are Wall Streets. And I think the screaming meemees up there shouldn't be the ones who dictate to us. Establishing credibility is a much broader challenge. We have to convince all sorts of people above and beyond the financial market types even though they are the ones-- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	40.0
198902	260	HOSKINS	 That was the reason I mentioned financial markets and the public. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	49.0
198902	261	BLACK	 Right. You should have said the public and financial markets. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	7.0
198902	262	SEGER	 Right. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	40.0
198902	263	HOSKINS	 I'll say it now. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	49.0
198902	264	BLACK	 You learned your lesson. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	7.0
198902	265	ANGELL	 Martha, this is the first time I've ever heard anyone here act as if Mr. Greider in The Secrets of the Temple has the right notion. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	43.0
198902	266	SEGER	 I don't know; I'm not Mr. Greider. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	40.0
198902	267	GREENSPAN	 Are there any further questions of Don? If not, I would like to get the tour de table on people's views as to where we should come out. I just marginally prefer staying where we are, mainly, I must say because I'd like us to be able to go down again next year. I like the sequence of going down but I'm not sure  it makes all that much difference which of these two we choose. Would somebody like to start off? Governor Johnson. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	268	JOHNSON	 Yes. I'll start off by saying that I prefer that same option for a couple of reasons. One is that it's still a full percentage point reduction in the midpoint of the range from what we had last year, which I think is a stronger statement than we normally make. Going from a 4 to 8 percent range to a 3 to 7 percent range is a strong statement by historical standards. I realize that M2 growth, certainly if the interest rate scenario that we follow ends us being close to the Greenbook forecast, puts us closer to the bottom of that range. But that interest rate path assumption is an extreme case, in my opinion. And that's allowed for in the 3 to 7 percent range; it still leaves us 1/2 percentage point above the [bottom of the] range, based on our estimates of M2 growth. I think it's possible that we may hit a peak in interest rates at some point this year short of what the staff has forecast. If interest rates stabilize, or even fall because of some weakness in the economy or whatever else we run into, we could see more M2 growth. Certainly that would be offset by the velocity adjustments to that and we would want to be able to allow for that. It seems to me that a 3 to 7 percent range accommodates all those specific concerns. As Don pointed out, the one thing it doesn't seem to accommodate is an even tighter policy than may be allowed for in the Greenbook forecast. In that case, I think we'd see much slower M2 growth. But I think that outcome is very unlikely and 3 to 7 percent or something like that fits clearly into my point of view. I even think that's a pretty strong statement in and of itself: 3 to 7 percent. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198902	269	GREENSPAN	 Governor Heller. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	270	HELLER	" I agree with the Chairman. I think we should consistently, gradually, lower the targets. We shouldn't try to fine tune the long-term ranges. So I'd be in favor of the tentative targets, alternative ""I."" "	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	46.0
198902	271	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	272	PARRY	 I would support the 3 to 7 percent as well. What would concern me about going to the lower range is if we had to raise it next year. I think that could be confusing to the public and the Congress, especially since the Greenbook forecast-- and our forecast as well--is that inflation rates actually could be a bit higher in 1990. So it seems to me that we would maintain an extra degree of flexibility if we were to stay with the 3 to 7 percent range and try to explain after the fact why perhaps it does end up in the lower end of that range. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	45.0
198902	273	GREENSPAN	 Yes, that's a good point. Governor Angell. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	274	ANGELL	 I also favor the 3 to 7 percent, although I think one could make a case in the other direction. The reason that I would stay at 3 to 7 percent is that it seems to me there is some chance--I don't know whether the probability is 20 percent or what, but there is some chance--that we will encounter a commodity price deflation during 1989 or 1990. If that occurred we might very well have short-term rates of 9-1/2 percent and long-term rates of 8  percent. And I don't know how the monetary aggregates would respond in that environment. Don, do you know what would happen? We would get a slightly faster growth if we had that kind of twist, would we not? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
198902	275	KOHN	 Yes, I think so, right. In 1990 or some time? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	276	ANGELL	 Well, I don't know when and I don't know whether; I'm just suggesting that possibility. And it seems to me that it's very important that we not get in the position of having to increase those ranges. I do believe that long-run price stability does require us at some point in time to move down to 2 to 6 percent and maybe eventually to 1 to 5 percent. But I really believe we [should] get there by a slow and progressive, sound, patient stance-- not by one which in a sense tries to whipsaw the events. So, I believe there's a great deal of merit in our staying with the 3 to 7 percent. I would remark in regard to M3 that I believe that the 4 percentage point range that we now have provides ample room for the Committee to engage in its monetary policy actions. As far as I'm concerned, having multiple aggregates is simply a way of not being accountable. I can understand why the Federal Reserve at first did not want to be accountable in regard to having too narrow a focus. But I think it's misleading because I don't hear anyone who says that they believe M3 is all that superior to, say, Ml. I do believe that we watch and monitor Ml and I'd prefer just to monitor M3. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
198902	277	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	278	FORRESTAL	" Mr. Chairman, I come out somewhat differently on this issue. I'd like to go back to the credibility argument. It's apparent to me that our credibility is really very good, not only in the financial markets but with the public. I don't know how you measure the public en masse but certainly they are represented by those in the Congress and people in my District who really are giving us high marks for monetary policy. I think it's very important that that credibility be maintained and I think the Chairman's recent testimonies have certainly reinforced our credibility. It's very important that we continue to reaffirm our commitment to price stability over time and that suggests to me that we need to lower the ranges. Granted, we did lower them 1 percentage point with respect to M2 in July. But we have tightened policy since then. It seems to me, given the staff forecast for the growth of M2, that we could run the danger--if we have to tighten further--of being below a range of 3 to 7 percent. In order to have that flexibility my preference actually would be 2 to 6 percent, but that may be a bit extreme in the short run. Just as an aside, it seems to me that using the 1/2 points suggests a degree of precision that I'm not sure we have. So, 2 to 6 percent would be kind of an ultimate preference for me; but I'd be willing to accept what's described as alternative ""II"" in the Bluebook, 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent. I think that gives us two very important things: 1) flexibility on the down side given the projected growth of M2; and 2)reinforcement of our commitment to fighting inflation. That really backs up with action what the Chairman said earlier to the Congress. M3 I would leave at 3 to 7 percent, and I agree with Governor Angell that it probably doesn't make that much difference. "	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	39.0
198902	279	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer.  	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	280	MELZER	 I favor the 3 to 7 percent [range for M2]. I have one comment: Don, you pointed out the language in the directive and I just don't know whether it's appropriate for us to be qualifying all the aggregates in the context of the longer-term ranges. I agree with what you said in terms of intermeeting [developments] and how you interpret them. But to some extent, that sort of runs in the other direction. In other words we have put Ml on the bench; and if somebody looks at this cynically, in effect, this language begins to put some of the broader aggregates potentially on the bench. I think we already have the flexibility, should it become necessary, to miss the target ranges--and that would most likely be on the low end this year--and to explain it. So I don't know whether I would add that language there; that is the question I would raise. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	42.0
198902	281	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	282	STERN	" I think the case for alternative ""II"" is a strong one. Bob Forrestal made part of it: given the staff forecast of M2 and the GNP forecast and so forth, that does get us closer to the center of that particular range. That is, if M2 is going to grow something in the neighborhood of 3-1/2 percent, that range is just more appropriate in its own right. But beyond that, we've had modest growth in M2 in both 1987 and 1988. Against that background, it doesn't seem to me that an upper end of that range as high as 7 percent for 1989 is appropriate. I must say, finally, that as far as considering possible ranges for 1990 and what we might want to do next year, I don't know how that's all going to play out. But I think what we can say with some confidence is that if we're committed to price stability over time we're going to want to see modest growth in M2 again in 1990. I don't expect that we're going to run into difficulty. Therefore, if we move to 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 [unintelligible]. "	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	41.0
198902	283	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	284	BOEHNE	" Well, I think on substantive grounds it probably doesn't make a lot of difference whether it's alternative ""I"" or alternative ""II"" or something in between where we would lower the top end or narrow the range. However, for posturing purposes, I favor alternative ""I"" largely because I think it already has made a statement. Manley made that point and I also think alternative ""I"" makes a statement. It gives us room to move down next year, which I think is important for longer-term targeting. It just provides additional flexibility. On the issue of whether we ought to have fewer or more aggregates, we can have too many and have too few. I think we're better off not to limit ourselves to one. We've been doing this now for 13 or 14 years and over that period if we've found out anything it is that what looks good in one period doesn't look so good in another. As long as we can pick and choose internally it's easier, I think, to deal with that than to try to go out and explain why we add one or why we drop one. I think the last 13 or 14 years underscore the wisdom of having a bit of a buffet to choose from. "	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	33.0
198902	285	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	286	BLACK	" Mr. Chairman, I think you put your finger on it when you said the question was really whether we would have to raise the range the next time we look at it. So, I don't feel very strongly about either one of these alternatives. But I do have some preference  for alternative ""II"" because I see the basic function of setting these targets as being that of reassuring the public about our anti- inflationary resolve. If we assume we have to have a 4 percentage point spread or something like that in the ranges because of the sensitivity of M2 to declining interest rates or rising interest rates, that suggests to me that what we're really after eventually is a range of about 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent or something like that. And I think we're in a position now that we could take that additional step. The upper part of the alternative ""II"" range would be 6-1/2 percent; and if we could take these figures at face value on M2 that should give us sufficient flexibility, even with a declining rate of growth and a drop in short-term rates in 1990, to still hit this 5 percent rate with some room to spare--and to hit the 6 percent in 1991 with some room to spare. Like Gary Stern, I don't think we would really have to end up raising that but it's not a do or die issue with me. I could go with either one, but I do have that preference because I think we can take a good step now without much risk. "	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	7.0

198902	288	SYRON	 I favor 3 to 7 percent because of my personal weighing of the alternative risks. It seems to me, coming back to the credibility issue, that the damage to our credibility if we stay with 3 to 7 percent and come in below the range this year is far less--I shouldn't say far less--it is less than what the cost might be if we were to have to raise the range next year. In either case we would have to explain it. So, I would favor staying with 3 to 7 percent and if we felt that it was possible, given unknown changes of velocity and given what's going on in the financial markets, we might make a comment about the thrift situation in what's said [in the testimony].

Having reduced the preliminary ranges as much as we did last July, it seems to me that to reduce them further at this point has a signal effect that may contain more than we intend. And if, as seems likely, we end up in the lower part of the M2 range for the year it seems to me that's an issue you can very well cover in your testimony. "	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	35.0

I am troubled by breaking with tradition; I think tradition is important. We've done a good job in terms of marching the upper end of the M2 range down year after year; I think there's a lot of value to that. But in terms of the substance of policy, given where the staff forecast says we've got to go--and I concur with that forecast--then the range is skewed in the wrong direction. I would be comfortable, I guess, with ""III"" if we were clear in the testimony that we were going to come out at the bottom end of that range.

As I look at what we did in July in projecting for 1989-- that is, taking a full percentage point off of both the upper and lower limits--I'm not persuaded that hitting it again at this point another 1/2 percentage point or so as, say, is suggested in alternative ""II"" is either (1) necessary or (2) desirable, given the staff's projections in the Greenbook. Lastly, it seems to me that the opportunity to move down somewhat again next year, given what we hope will happen, is important. And if we take that extra cut now I think it limits somewhat our ability to go down next year given the projection for somewhat greater growth in M2 through 1990.

198902	296	BOYKIN	" Mr. Chairman, my preference would be for alternative ""II,"" primarily for the reason that we feel we would be at the lower part of the [alternative ""I""] range. If we really believe that, it seems to me we ought to establish a range that gets a little more centered. Also, my impression is that there has been less difficulty in explaining overruns than underruns. And, at least the way I look at the long-run strategies--if you look at what happens to inflation and if there is a relationship between money growth and inflation--then it seems to me we aren't really doing very much over the next three years or so where inflation is concerned. The comment was that the rhetoric has been good because [unintelligible] and look at what we do as opposed to what we say. It seems to me that if we also confirm what we say with what we actually do, then that enhances our credibility. Keeping inflation at the current levels, or even at projected levels as we're looking at it through 1991, seems to me almost to create the impression that we're accepting that as the norm. And I have problems with that. So my preference would be to go to alternative ""II."" "	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	34.0
198902	297	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	298	KELLEY	" Mr. Chairman, I favor alternative ""I."" I think that with the 4 percentage point bands we have plenty of room to conduct policy either with number ""I"" or number ""II."" For that reason I wouldn't be upset with ""II;"" but in the interest of longer-term flexibility in the out period, as you suggested early on, I think it makes sense to move this in a more gentle manner. I would also restate what Governor Johnson said early on: if we do alternative ""I"" here we are lowering it by 1 full percentage point, which I think has plenty of message effect for now and leaves us the flexibility we'll need to do more easily what may be necessary as time goes on. "	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	48.0
198902	299	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	300	SEGER	" Now that I know the actual results [for the economy] and also what happened to monetary growth in 1988, I'm willing to support the preliminary ranges, which would be alternative ""I."" For M2, of course, it does remove a full percentage point at both ends of the [1988] range, which in my judgment is a sufficient message to the doubting Thomases. Secondly, I would suggest that we're measuring from a point that is below the midpoint; the actual growth in 1988 came out below the midpoint of the range for last year.  And so it seems to me we're picking up a little there, simply in measuring from a lower base. On M3, again, taking a half point off from each end in conjunction with the full point off the M2 range should be sufficient to convince our followers. "	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	40.0
198902	301	GREENSPAN	 Governor LaWare. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	302	LAWARE	" I support alternative ""I"" for most of the reasons cited. But I can't refrain from making a comment on the credibility issue. I think we miss some of the environment here if we congratulate ourselves too much on the credibility that we presently enjoy and assume that that's because we are seen as fearless inflation fighters. We are seen and applauded for that only so long as nobody else gets hurt in the process of our fighting inflation. If we were to go out there and really beat inflation over the head and in the process increase the unemployment rate or dump the economy in some fashion I think that our credibility would disappear overnight. People would forget that we were inflation fighters and label us as the black knights who have ruined people's lives. So, I like the 3 to 7 percent range because I think it gives enough room for policy alternatives in managing all these different variables in a time when I'm still unconvinced, as I mentioned yesterday, about just what the tea leaves are really saying. "	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	50.0
198902	303	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	304	CORRIGAN	 I would support the original formulation that you put on the table, Mr. Chairman, with one caveat. In round numbers--and Don you can help me with this--the midpoint of the range for M2 implies an absolute growth of M2 of something like $140 billion. Is it something like that? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198902	305	KOHN	 It must be something like that. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	306	CORRIGAN	 The caveat gets to this thrift industry issue. The great bulk of money that was going to be disintermediated out of the thrifts as a result of the Bush plan was going to be brokered deposits. In fact, in the short run almost all of it would be brokered deposits. If those deposits are all in M2 because they're all under $100,000 but they all come from Wall Street, I think it's quite likely that a very significant fraction of the money that comes out of the thrifts due to the shrinkage of deposits will not find its way back into depositories, or perhaps even into M2 instruments. And I think that somehow or other, Don, we're going to have to try to figure out a way to keep track of that because it does seem to me possible that if you think in terms of the absolute growth of M2 of whatever it is, $140 billion-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198902	307	KOHN	 It's $160 billion or so. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	308	CORRIGAN	 Pardon me? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198902	309	SPEAKER	 $161 billion. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	310	CORRIGAN	 --$161 billion, whatever. It's quite possible, as I think about it, that that phenomenon could have a significant effect on the dollar change that's implied here. I don't  know quite what that means but if we saw $30 or $40 or $50 billion that's now in M2 through brokered deposits-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198902	311	GREENSPAN	 That could easily happen. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	312	CORRIGAN	 Yes. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198902	313	ANGELL	 Here comes M2a. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
198902	314	CORRIGAN	 I don't like to be difficult, Wayne, but I think we've got to do something. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198902	315	GREENSPAN	 I think what you're suggesting is that in the Humphrey-Hawkins report and in testimony we ought to have a few sentences on exactly that issue. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	316	CORRIGAN	 Yes. But, Don, I think we ought to try to figure out some way that we could try to keep track of that because it's conceivable to me that-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198902	317	KOHN	 Well, we'll look into this a bit. To the extent that it went into money funds, of course-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	318	CORRIGAN	 It's a big part of the implied M2 growth. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198902	319	GREENSPAN	 Well, a lot of that, I guess, would go into money funds. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	320	SEGER	 Yes, but commercial paper wouldn't be picked up in M2 or T-Bills wouldn't be picked up in M2. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	40.0
198902	321	GREENSPAN	 Oh no, no. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	322	CORRIGAN	 Some money deposits are and some aren't. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198902	323	GREENSPAN	 Yes. A good chunk is likely not to go back into depository institutions, there's no question. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	324	KOHN	 It's not clear what the preference was for. If they were looking for federally insured deposits then they would have to go back to a depository institution. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	325	CORRIGAN	 Yes, but it kind of-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198902	326	GREENSPAN	 Well, they are looking at federally insured deposits at a certain rate. It's the equivalent of getting-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	327	CORRIGAN	 That's why this brokered money facet of it, I think, is so important. I'm not sure that it's-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198902	328	GUFFEY	 What are the alternatives other than money funds? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	20.0
198902	329	SPEAKER	 Treasury securities. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	330	GUFFEY	 Government securities.  	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	20.0
198902	331	SEGER	 Commercial paper, T-Bills. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	40.0
198902	332	GREENSPAN	 Commercial paper. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	333	JOHNSON	 If it's the savings part of M2 it could just as easily go into T-Bills. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198902	334	BLACK	 Right. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	7.0
198902	335	JOHNSON	 It doesn't have to go into transaction accounts. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198902	336	KOHN	 We have made a small allowance for this, indirectly, by presuming that the average offering rates on M2 remain damped. And the average offering rates include, obviously, the brokered deposit offering rates and we factored that through. I doubt that we've captured the full impact, as Jerry has implied, but-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	337	CORRIGAN	 A lot of this stuff is not household money. It's broken up into $100,000 pieces, but it isn't household money; it's hot money. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198902	338	BLACK	 Well, I think it's amply true what Jerry was saying about those [depositors] who initially come out. But they spend that money buying something else; it moves into the hands of some other people. So you've got to go beyond that and ask: What are they going to do with that? And it might well come back into deposits in some form. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	7.0
198902	339	ANGELL	 But don't jump to the conclusion that all the $100,000 money is going to go, because with the present spread between $100,000 jumbo CDs and the others it is still lower cost money for institutions who really look at the brick and mortar costs of raising the other kind of CDs. So it's not all going to go in that-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
198902	340	CORRIGAN	 I didn't mean to discombobulate this discussion, Mr. Chairman. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198902	341	GREENSPAN	 Yes, but I think it's actually an important point. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	342	PARRY	 I think that an adjustment has been made. At least in the quantitative work we did we got a faster growth of M2 just using the model. I don't know the extent of it, but I think there has been an adjustment made to reflect the fact that these deposit rates, in terms of offering rates on M2 instruments, have been very sluggish. I don't know if you quantified the adjustments you made but I think it was in there when you had the 3, 3-1/2-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	45.0
198902	343	KOHN	 We ran a couple different types of simulations of how these offering rates would behave and they all shaved about 1/2 percentage point or a little more off of our model forecast. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	344	PARRY	 Right. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	45.0
198902	345	KOHN	 And that's the 3-1/2; it is about a half--  	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	346	GREENSPAN	 No, but Jerry's raising a different point. It's not an issue of what the forecast is; it's what the 3 to 7 percent means and how one interprets it. In fact, one of the elements involved in the forecast is that if we took M2 and grossed it up for the thrift thing it would be higher in the cone. And I think that we are interpreting the 3 to 7 percent to mean the grossing up-- making the adjustment for the loss of brokered deposits. In other words, the question is: What is our target? Well, our target is 3 to 7 percent after we add back, I presume, an estimate of brokered deposits. That's what it means. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	347	ANGELL	" Mr. Chairman, I would also like to be included among those who prefer a kind of strategy ""II"" with a 3 to 7 percent range. That is, it does seem to me that it's important for us to create expectations that--if conditions unveil as the staff has forecast--we do anticipate staying very close to the bottom of the range.

198902	348	GREENSPAN	 Well, before we vote, does anybody have any problem with the directive language on pages 20 and 21 in the Bluebook? Very specifically, what is the Committee's view of the alternative at the end of the middle paragraph on page 21? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0

198902	384	HOSKINS	 Point of clarification. In terms of your testimony, if we opt to put in this 3 to 7 percent is it with no caveats? Or is the testimony putting in the table and then [saying we expect to] come out at the bottom of the range? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	49.0
198902	385	JOHNSON	 I would prefer not to say that. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198902	386	GREENSPAN	 Say what? I'm just trying to--. I've forgotten what we've done in the past. Do we actually forecast? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	387	KOHN	 We've often said that we expect growth in the middle of the ranges. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	388	GREENSPAN	 We have said in the middle of the ranges or instead of-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	389	KOHN	 Well, in the past when we put ranges out we have-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	390	GREENSPAN	 Well, one of the problems in forecasting where we expect M2 to be in the range is that it enables somebody to work backwards to what our funds rate projections are. And I'm not sure we want to do that. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	391	JOHNSON	 Well, let's-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198902	392	PARRY	 Why don't you just spend a little time talking about the potential impact of developments: the savings and loan industry-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	45.0
198902	393	GREENSPAN	 Yes. I think that would be done in any event. But I think Lee is raising the question as to what we are forecasting in the ranges that we're adopting. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	394	PRELL	 Mr. Chairman, one could remark that we're low at this point in part because of the lagged effects of previous interest rate changes. So that might give you some leverage to get some of that-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	395	GREENSPAN	 Well, I think that in the testimony we will be discussing some of the aspects of where M2 is going. But I don't think we want to be all that specific about where it relates to our forecasts of policy from here forward. Now to the extent that there are lagged effects, Lee, I think that does suggest that we're in the lower end in the beginning no matter what. But I don't want to go much beyond that. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198902	396	JOHNSON	 You can always say that if it's necessary to take interest rates higher we will end up at the low end or if interest rates stabilize or go lower we'll end up in the upper part. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198902	397	SPEAKER	 Why say that? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198902	398	JOHNSON	 Well, we don't have to say it. But I'm just saying that we could say there's some basis for why we would end up in different places.  	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198902	399	KELLEY	 That explains why you have ranges in the first place. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	48.0

198902	423	KOHN	 The near-term operational question for committee consideration  at this time appears to be whether to tighten further, and if so by how  much at least this is what we presumed when we omitted alternative A  from the bluebook. As a number of members have already mentioned, the  recent behavior of several financial market indicators may have a bearing on this decision. These include the yield curve, the dollar, and  the money supply.  The yield curve has flattened further over the intermeeting  period, looking from the very short to the long end of the maturity  spectrum. Yet it does retain an upward slope out to 2 years or so   suggesting that some further rise in short-term rates still is expected.  As Peter noted yesterday, in the wake of the employment data and against  the background of the Chairman's recent testimony on seeking price stability, an immediate rise of the federal funds rate to the 9-1/4 to 9-3/8  area now is widely anticipated. The shape of the curve and the positive  response to the testimony in the long-term markets suggest that market  participants have increased confidence that the Federal Reserve has  taken and will continue to take the actions needed to keep inflation  from accelerating. They do not yet think that it will be reduced, however, judging from the level of the long-term rate, which at 8.80 percent would seem to have inflation expectations of 4 to 5 percent built  in.  Whether another tightening is needed is a separate question  from whether it is expected, though disappointing such expectations may  have some repercussions that themselves should be taken into account.  The staff forecast of course saw a need for a bias towards tightening  over the year, but that forecast was not dependent on specific actions  taken at this meeting. The rise in real interest rates that has already  occurred from our tightening actions should be damping demand to some  extent over coming quarters. This restraint probably is being felt in  long- as well as short-term rates, despite the drop in nominal bond  yields. Long-term inflation expectations have fallen, and the lack of  corporate bond issuance may reflect in part a sense that these rates are  high, at least relative to expected returns on capital. Real rates are  impossible to measure with any confidence, but using a variety of techniques it would appear that they are probably in the neighborhood of 4  percent. This is well above the levels prevailing in 1986 and 1987,  which contributed to the strong growth in 1987 and 1988, but it is below  those earlier in the expansion. Thus, real rates would seen to be in a  somewhat ambiguous zone with respect to whether they are high enough to  restrain incipient price pressures.  The rise in real rates and confidence in the Federal Reserve  has been mirrored in a stronger dollar. A rising dollar is uncomfortable for a country that views its external deficit as resulting more  from previous dollar overvaluation than from excess demand and price  pressures. There is a little irony in the circumstance in which a  dilemma for the monetary authority is created by its own enhanced credibility. In the absence of a more appropriate macro policy mix United States  authorities have attempted, together with our trading partners, in  effect to limit the external effects of our tighter monetary policy by  intervening in exchange markets. If successful for any length of time,  which is a proposition most of us doubt, such a combination of policies  would circumscribe an important channel through which policy can damp  activity and price pressures, but it would keep the impact of tighter  policy focussed more on United States domestic demand. Another firming at this  time would add to the difficulties of keeping the dollar down, but it  would not necessarily invalidate the basic strategy of using both policy  tools. Given the uncertain prospects for fiscal policy, monetary policy  alone may not be able to foster both internal and external balance in  the current circumstances. The policy decision probably should continue  to rest primarily on the evaluation of what stance is needed for  internal balance, but this decision must take account of the effect of  dollar strength on activity and prices in the United States  Finally, there is the very sluggish behavior of the money supply of late. This is largely a response to the previous tightening, and  to the extent that this tightening is seen as having been appropriate,  so also would be the slow money growth. Our money demand models suggest  that the accumulated effects of previous interest rate increases are  shaving as much as 4-1/2 percentage points from first quarter growth of  M2, which we are projecting at around a 3 percent annual rate on a  quarterly average basis. The actual effects of interest rate increases  are probably a little larger since the models don't take account of the  unusually slow adjustment of offering rates. The staff projects a small  strengthening in M2 growth under the constant interest rates of alternative B, to about 3 percent over February and March, and a continuation  of the average growth of December and January under alternative C I  might note that if money comes in at near these rates it would be near  the model forecast, given the greenbook spending projection for the  first quarter suggesting that such an outcome is not inconsistent with  fairly robust expansion of income.  Whatever course the Committee choses for policy, there is the  recurring problem of the borrowing/federal funds rate relationship. In  the bluebook we posit that $600 million of borrowing will be consistent  with federal funds around or a bit above 9 percent, but we freely admit  our uncertainty. As Peter noted, recent borrowing has been running well  below this level at prevailing funds rates. We think this may be due to  a seasonal low point for borrowing in January and early February, reflecting perhaps the usual trough of seasonal borrowing as well as the  after effects on adjustment borrowing of discount window maneuvering  around year-end. Our assessment of the borrowing/funds rate relations  under the two alternatives embodies a belief that borrowing will bounce  back seasonally, as it has for the past several years, lining up better  with the borrowing relation as it developed last fall. If we are wrong  and something more fundamental is occurring, lower borrowing will be  required to keep funds in the neighborhood of expected levels. In these  circumstances, continued flexibility in desk operations vis-a-vis borrowing objectives may be a sensible option. 	21	21	2.0	0.0	999.0
198902	424	GREENSPAN	 Okay. Thank you, Don. Let's break for coffee and then resume after a short break. [Coffee break] 	2	2	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	425	GREENSPAN	 I'd like to start off with-- 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	426	MELZER	 Could we ask questions of Don? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	42.0
198902	427	GREENSPAN	 Oh, I'm sorry! Certainly. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	428	MELZER	 I didn't mean to cut you off. I just wanted-- 	22	22	2.0	1.0	42.0
198902	429	GREENSPAN	 It was unintentional. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	430	SPEAKER	 Carry on. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198902	431	SPEAKER	 Forget your question? 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198902	432	MELZER	 Maybe I should! 	22	22	2.0	1.0	42.0
198902	433	SPEAKER	 I hope this is a good one. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198902	434	MELZER	 Don, you talked about the instability of the borrowing function. You mentioned that normally there's about a $400 million difference per 100 basis point difference--in terms of what's transpiring now versus what historical relationships might have produced. My question is: What is the potential for somehow really getting a surprise? In other words, I think the Desk has dealt very effectively with the kind of instabilities we have had, but what is the prospect of something much more dramatic than that in terms of a change in the propensity to borrow? I wonder because the spread may get to the point where banks figure, what the heck, we haven't had a problem with discipline at the window. Do you worry about that at all?  	22	22	2.0	1.0	42.0
198902	435	KOHN	 Well, not in the last six months or so. The borrowing has been so low for wide spreads that for whatever reasons-- and we talked about this last time--it is particularly the small banks that are most surprising in the way they are staying out of the window. Whether it's their liquidity, whether they're concerned about the thrift crisis and do not want to be seen at the discount window given concerns about depository institutions, or what, I don't know. But I guess I don't have any expectations at all that that's going to reverse on us with a big rush or that if it began to reverse we wouldn't detect it pretty quickly and be able to take it into account. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198902	436	MELZER	 So you're not overly concerned about that prospect? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	42.0
198902	437	KOHN	 About a big rush of borrowing at the discount window? No. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198902	438	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	439	SEGER	 Would it be possible to make the case at this point, given this continued uncertainty about the relationship, that we should engage more directly in targeting fed funds rather than having the flexibility in operations of the Desk? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	40.0
198902	440	KOHN	 Well, I would say that that's a decision for the Committee. My proposal was that this flexible approach, which in effect is a blending of the two approaches, continue. The Desk has reacted, I think, when funds have gotten way out of line from Committee expectations. But it hasn't [zeroed] in very closely on a very narrow range for fed funds; it is also paying attention to the borrowing function. But it isn't captive to it if it looks like it's going to push the funds rate way out of whack with what the Committee expects. So, it's an approach that I think has enabled us to have more flexibility than the very narrow focus on the funds rate might allow but at the same time hasn't gotten us too far away for too long from what the Committee expects. Federal funds, as Peter said, have been running the last couple of maintenance periods a bit over 9 percent. I think the last Bluebook said 8-7/8 to 9 percent; we're talking about a difference of 10 or 15 basis points here, maybe. So I don't think that's too far out of line. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198902	441	GREENSPAN	 Any other questions? Well, why don't I start us off on the current policy recommendation problems. Having looked at the economy for many years, I frankly don't recall an economy that at least on the surface looks more balanced than the one that we have--in other words one which is characterized by very little evidence of excess inventory accumulation. We're not getting big bulges in capacity or construction which would tend [unintelligible]. Order backlogs are relatively high and there's a certain momentum in the economy that is very likely to carry us quite a good way. And I must say to you that it's relatively rare, I think, that the outlook is as favorable as it is at the current moment. One major worrisome issue is clearly the acceleration in wage and salary costs that emerged, really, in the fourth quarter and was partly confirmed in the average hourly earnings index in January. Considering the fact that the intermediate product gains in the wholesale price index, excluding food and fuels, were running .6 or .7 percent but were not passing through into the final goods prices--very largely because unit labor  costs as a major part of the markup between intermediate materials and final goods prices were suppressed, and the unit labor costs were suppressed largely because nominal wage and salary rates were soft--it is possible that the last several months' movements in wages are an aberration. But one obviously can't assume that in the context of the unemployment rate and the tightness of the labor market where it is. Nonetheless, we do find some interesting signals that are a little puzzling. I think the economy clearly accelerated through December; but in the last several weeks there were at least some signals that are not consistent with the follow-through that we're looking at. First of all the 408,000 employment increase, judging from the seasonal factors employed in both construction and retailing, is probably closer to about 250,000. If we make that adjustment we may find that perhaps the February or March employment figures will reverse and actually will [seem] weaker than, in fact, they really are. Nonetheless, 250,000 is not a bad increase. It's solid and I think consistent with all of the other elements. And we will be publishing an industrial production index with an increase of about 1/2 percent for January. So, looking on the employment data side the first quarter really looks, if anything, stronger than in the Greenbook. But if you look at the January GNP from the product side it clearly is a good deal weaker: we're not getting anything resembling the income side, which is consistent with the employment side. In other words, the income side in the GNP in the first quarter is much stronger than is confirmed on the product side. And it's not clear just how that is going to be resolved. I've been particularly puzzled by the National Association of Purchasing Managers [NAPM] January survey, which shows a relatively sharp decline in the rate of increase in [coming] quarters. As best I can judge, that is not being picked up in any material I see coming in from the various contacts of the Banks. Nonetheless, that survey has been very reliable in the past and has often been the first indication that we have had that the climate of the economy is changing. I think that's really just too little information to say very much about it. But it cannot be dismissed very readily. Similarly, the insured unemployment data are a little weaker. The figures that came out today showed a further increase-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	442	PRELL	 They didn't come out today, Mr. Chairman. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198902	443	GREENSPAN	 They didn't come out today? That's a forecast? They will come out when? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	444	PRELL	 Tomorrow. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198902	445	GREENSPAN	 Tomorrow, sorry. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	446	TRUMAN	 And they will be weaker. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198902	447	GREENSPAN	" The ones that are scheduled to come out tomorrow do at least turn around the extraordinary tightness that these data had suggested for much of 1988 through fairly recently. So, we're in a position at this particular stage, temporarily at least, where we're seeing no signs of general overheating in the sense that lead times on materials are actually shortening. And, aside from the wage pressures, which I indicated before are quite worrisome, we're not yet getting any evidence of inventory acceleration or  anything that suggests that we're getting close to the peak of an overheated economy that is about to tilt down. My own impression is that we still have a way to go in tightening. I think the evidence is much too premature to suggest-- leaving the forecast mechanisms aside and just looking at the current state of affairs--that this cycle of tightening that we've been through is over. But, as Don mentioned, we are running into an odd problem of limits to our policies--specifically, the fact that as our credibility builds up and there is a general expectation that inflation will not emerge despite some of its signs and what we are getting is a nominal long-term rate that hasn't moved, a real long- term rate that probably has moved up only very modestly, and a problem in that, in effect, we are restraining the economy very largely through higher real short-term interest rates. It's very clear that we are restraining inventory accumulation, which is a short-term decision. We obviously are restraining some elements in the capital goods markets. But I'm not sure how much we are restraining (1) the housing mortgage market or (2) the capital goods markets, because the real cost of capital has not gone up that much. In part, that is a reflection of an expectation both with respect to inflation premiums and instability premiums that we will in fact contain inflation. And that's in an odd way unfortunate in that to the extent the markets believe that what we're doing is right it is making it more difficult for us. We are also running into problems with respect to how rapidly we tighten because of the pattern of M2 growth with or without adjustment for the thrift problem. The slowness of M2 is corroborated by exchange rate pressures and the strength in the dollar which, by any measures that we are involved with, should be somewhat less. With the types of trade balances we are getting one would assume the dollar should not be exhibiting the type of strength that it is. What this all suggests is the crucial importance of getting the federal budget deficit down to assist in the process of economic policy--to suppress the effect of demand elements that are involved and to enhance the international adjustment process. This issue of getting the deficit down is becoming increasingly mandatory, as we begin to run into problems where it becomes clear that monetary policy cannot be the sole tool with which we are functioning. I conclude from all of this that the appropriate stance for the next short-term period would be to start off with alternative ""B,"" asymmetric, but with a recognition that, if the pressure on the dollar that is now there stabilizes or falls and if the current mixed signals such as the NAPM survey and the insured unemployment numbers do not indicate early deterioration--in other words, if those signals are reversed which is probably more likely than not--it would be wise for the Desk to be instructed to move [borrowing] up $100 million maybe in a couple of weeks or so. In any event, the period until the next meeting is seven weeks and I think this [outlook] is sufficiently uncertain that I would request that we schedule a telephone conference at the end of this month to review where we are. And it would be helpful, if events are changing in a manner that requires a conference earlier, perhaps not to wait as long as that to do this. But I think we are at a point where--just judging from the analyses that I heard here yesterday--there are enough differences within this Committee with respect to the issue of fact as to what's going on that in a  period such as this more frequent consultation is important. I think it is very important for the credibility of this Committee to try to find some consensus as best we can, because even though there's a large bimodal distribution out there I think we're not that far apart. And I think it would be very useful if we could find a means to accommodate each other in such a way that we can have a policy that we all can essentially go along with, though we all may not feel fully comfortable with it. So, I've said my piece, and I throw it out as a potential set of motions which I'd be curious to get reactions to. President Syron. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	448	SYRON	 Mr. Chairman, just a clarifying question if I might? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	51.0
198902	449	GREENSPAN	 Yes. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	450	SYRON	 In what you've essentially proposed--alternative B in the Bluebook--the Bluebook notes that under that alternative some of the recent rate increases might in fact slip back; we might see some decline in rates under alternative B. I take it that in the approach you're talking about that you would not want that, absent some signs of weakening in the real economy or some other events in the international markets-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	51.0
198902	451	GREENSPAN	 Exchange rates. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	452	SYRON	 So I can say that under your proposal you would not want to see a decline in rates in the short term? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	51.0
198902	453	GREENSPAN	 Do you mean the funds rate? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	454	SYRON	 Yes, the funds rate. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	51.0
198902	455	GREENSPAN	 No, I would not. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	456	SYRON	 Okay. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	51.0
198902	457	ANGELL	 But that's not a commitment to fed funds rate targeting is it? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198902	458	GREENSPAN	 No, no. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	459	BLACK	 He's just saying in the case of inconsistencies between the borrowing level and the funds rate resolve doubts on the side of borrowing. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198902	460	SYRON	 That's essentially correct. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	51.0
198902	461	GREENSPAN	 Yes. I think the markets would misread a signal of that particular kind. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	462	SYRON	 That's my concern. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	51.0
198902	463	MELZER	 The funds rate would be 9-1/4 percent roughly? What funds rate level would that be? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
198902	464	GREENSPAN	 I'm sorry. What?  	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	465	MELZER	 Slipping back from what level? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
198902	466	GREENSPAN	 Where we are right now. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	467	MELZER	 9-1/4 percent? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
198902	468	SPEAKER	 9-1/8 percent. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198902	469	JOHNSON	 9 to 9-1/8. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198902	470	GREENSPAN	 I would say probably 9-1/8 percent would be closer. But Governor Heller has the floor. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	471	HELLER	 No, let that discussion finish first. I have no question but-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198902	472	GREENSPAN	 Did we clarify that? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	473	MELZER	 Yes. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
198902	474	HELLER	 I just want to support the same position, basically. I think real rates are already very high. Money growth is slowing and we should be patient to see that through. The one area where I may disagree with you just a little, if I heard you right, is that you were expressing disappointment that investment wasn't slowing faster than it actually is. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198902	475	GREENSPAN	 Capital investment. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	476	HELLER	 Capital investment isn't slowing faster. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198902	477	GREENSPAN	 Well, you know-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	478	HELLER	 Actually, I like to see high capital investment because that fills the additional capacity that will hold down inflation in the future. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198902	479	GREENSPAN	 Well, there are two ways of looking at it. There's good GNP and bad GNP. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	480	HELLER	 I think that's good GNP and the more of it the better it is. Otherwise, I fully agree with what you said. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198902	481	BLACK	 Our special theme reports suggested that would be pretty strong, really, if I read that [right]. Is that the way you read it? I was very much encouraged by what that seemed to say. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198902	482	HELLER	 Yes. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198902	483	BLACK	 And that's good GNP. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198902	484	HELLER	 And that's good GNP. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198902	485	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	486	CORRIGAN	 Well, this is a tough one. I think part of this question of Federal Reserve credibility that has been talked about an awful lot here is related, at least as I see it, to  what I'd like to call institutional harmony. In the interest of institutional harmony I don't want to rock the boat unduly and I think I can support the spirit of what you've suggested. My druthers would be rather distinctly to firm policy right now. But as I said, for reasons of institutional harmony, I am prepared to try to support the spirit of what you've said. But, for purposes of my conscience if nothing else, let me just elaborate a bit further on my underlying position. As I've said in the past, I try to view the process of making policy here as a matter of balancing risks. That's the only way you can do it. Now, I think it is possible, for example, that the economy could slow down kind of on its own to a path that, even with current policy, would be broadly consistent with Mike's forecast. If it did that I think it would signify that we are lucky as well as good, because in my judgment it would take a clear stroke of luck to produce that result--in the sense that I think the risks are on the other side. The second point that I feel I must emphasize is the following: there has been a great deal of discussion around this table about price stability and moving toward price stability. But as we sit here the algebraic sign on the inflation rate is unambiguous--it's plus. It's not neutral, it's not minus, it's plus. The inflation rate is going up. And Mike's forecast, which is undoubtedly the most rigorous that is available to any of us, is saying that as best they can judge, with current policy the inflation rate is going to go up more. That's what the forecast says. We can all, and we do, have our differences of judgment about it. But that's what it says. Now, I have a bit of trouble reconciling the algebraic sign on the current inflation rate as being plus. Mike's forecast is on the side of rising inflation. I look at the financial variables and my problems get more severe. Take the exchange rate. It seems to me that if you either want or you have a strong dollar, given where we are right now, then something else has to give at some point, because in my judgment the external position that we have and that we have prospectively is unsustainable. If it's not the dollar something else has to give. Now what is that other thing going to be? It's going to be the economy. Indeed as I said yesterday, taking the long view, I have a real question in my mind as to whether we can make sustainable progress on the external adjustment side given any broadly acceptable pattern of exchange rates without a significant and sustained slowdown in the rate of growth in the economy. Now, we don't have to answer that question today; but I think it's out there and it's going to have to be dealt with sooner or later. So the exchange rate, at least as I see it, creates quite a conundrum for us right now. Then I turn to the yield curve. And I, like everybody else, take an enormous amount of comfort from the yield curve and for what it seems to imply about Fed credibility--both on Wall Street and Main Street, in my judgment, Martha. But the crucial question about the yield curve is: What does it tell us prospectively? What does it tell us about the future? And I'm just not sure of that. I've looked at yield curves over a period of time in the United States and in all the other industrial countries and I'm just not sure. But I think the crucial question that arises, whether it's based on experience in the United States or elsewhere, is: Are recessions typically inflation induced? In other words, does the responsive pattern of recession that we've seen here and in other countries presage the recession? Are they inflation induced in that it's the rise in the inflation rate  that gives rise to the tightening of monetary policy, etc.? And is that what ultimately trips the economy into recession? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198902	487	GREENSPAN	 Excuse me. There's a significant inventory acceleration accumulation component in it. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	488	CORRIGAN	 That is correct. But the crucial question in my judgment--if that is correct which I think it is--is does the yield curve in any reasonably satisfactory way tell us anything about future inflation? And I think the answer is no it doesn't. The yield curve either in the United States or elsewhere has not been a reliable indicator of future inflation. Indeed, the evidence seems to cut the other way. And if it has not been a reliable indicator of future inflation and most recessions are inflation-induced I am not prepared to bet the mortgage on the signals that the yield curve are giving off right now, even though obviously they are very welcomed, at least as we see them. So, I'm sure the yield curve is telling us a lot of important things. I'm sure we can and should both benefit from [unintelligible] but I don't think it's reliable enough historically or intellectually to give me, at least, enough confidence in terms of [extrapolating] from it to the inflation rate and to other variables. Now, the one variable on the financial side that I do have some confidence in is the money supply, however defined. It is intellectually not easy to look at the pattern of money growth that we have had for basically two years now--I guess it's more than two years--and say to yourself: Is that a pattern of money growth over a long period of time that is likely to be associated with some further dramatic escalation in the inflation rate? I think that is what is giving me some pause. But as I said, Mr. Chairman, overall I can support your position. But my assessment of the risks is that they are a bit asymmetric in that direction; that, I think, is clear. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198902	489	GREENSPAN	 Governor Johnson. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	490	JOHNSON	 Thanks. I also support what the Chairman said. I'm comfortable with maintaining current policy but in an asymmetric way. I still think the risks potentially are on the up side. I just think that with the existing information there isn't any basis at this time for further tightening. We may have to tighten further but I think we ought to leave that to some sort of discretion, some sort of judgment about how events unfold as time goes on. Based on today I certainly don't see that as necessary, for a lot of the reasons that I said yesterday which I won't go back over again. I do have a view, though, that on the long end of the yield curve--even though the nominal rate has come down--we have had a fairly significant appreciation in long-term real rates. Now, there are different ways to look at that and I don't want to suggest that any one way is better than the other. My general view, though, is that there has been a significant rise in long-term real rates. If you follow the Hoey survey, it suggests that the 10-year bond rate has gone up 2-1/2 percentage points in real terms since mid-1987. And I don't think that's insignificant. It depends on how much stock you put in the Hoey survey; it's just one particular measure. But I think Don made a good point in his briefing that the slowdown in corporate bond issuance is also a pretty good indicator that long-term real rates are not completely neutral in this whole process. People wouldn't be  cutting back on corporate bond issuance if they thought their internal rate of return was better than the existing long-term yields. So, I think that's a good point. I don't think there's anything sacred about the yield curve in terms of inflation expectations. I think basically all that says is that the markets are betting that short- term rates in the future are going to be lower than they are today. I think you really have to isolate more on the long bond itself to get some sort of notion of what they're thinking. It doesn't necessarily mean lower inflation expectations; it does mean that they think the short rates are going to be lower in the future for various reasons. Maybe it's just that they think they are not going to keep up with movements in the short rates. It's not the be-all/end-all of the evidence; there's no doubt about that. Putting it all together, I think you're absolutely right, Jerry, about the dollar. Something does eventually have to give if the dollar keeps appreciating. But I think the central point there is that if the dollar does keep appreciating what will ultimately give is the current account and the economy, to some extent. My point is that if the dollar is going to be appreciating I don't see the scenario that's in our Greenbook forecast. You would have a much weaker economic picture under that kind of a scenario than you would under one with dollar depreciation--and totally different implications for the domestic economy and inflation rate. And that certainly leaves you with a worsening current account in exports under those conditions. That's some risk. But that leads me to want to be very cautious at this time. And I think an asymmetric position is probably the best one. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198902	491	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	492	PARRY	 Mr. Chairman, I would agree that there are substantial uncertainties associated with economic prospects. But I think there is enough certainty to support alternative C. I believe that the level of economic activity is in excess of the full employment [level] at the present time. I think that a constant level of interest rates, even if it is for the next month or so, would assure that for an even longer period. It seems to me that in that kind of environment we know that inflationary pressures are building. As a result, I would say that we ought to get about our business promptly. It seems to me that it also would be much more difficult to characterize monetary policy as being ahead of the curve if we were to take no action now or, for that matter, over the next month. Thank you. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198902	493	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	494	KEEHN	" Mr. Chairman, you very well described what I think is a very complicated and difficult current and prospective situation; and in a broad context I'm in agreement with you. But having said that, at the margin I think I'd have a modest difference. I'm not saying that we are targeting fed funds. Nonetheless, if we have an objective currently of, say, 9 or 9-1/8 percent, I think I'm hearing from Peter and others that there is a market tendency to move higher--I would think 1/4 or 3/8 percentage points in that direction. If there is that kind of tendency in the market I think we ought to support it and move up as those pressures continue to move up. There is general agreement, certainly, that the risks here are on the side  of inflation. The magnitude of the risks is something we can argue about, but I think Jerry stated it very well: the risks are on the up side. The underlying rate of the economic expansion is strong, I think, and sustainable; therefore, I wouldn't necessarily do anything that would hurt here but I sure would move up to the extent that we can, consistent with what I think is an underlying tendency. Therefore, I'd probably come down someplace between ""B"" and ""C"" and would be inclined to move a little on the borrowing level now if that would basically support this upward tendency in the fed funds rate. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	35.0
198902	495	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	496	FORRESTAL	 Mr. Chairman, I think the point you made about a consensus of the Committee is very important. And for that reason I would entirely support your prescription for the economy over the short term, particularly the asymmetric part. Having said that, my preference would be to move at the present time. I happen to believe this forecast that the staff has come out with. And the inflation projections through 1989 and 1990, in my judgment, represent an unacceptable level of inflation. And achieving that level of inflation implicitly suggests some tightening. What I'm concerned about is that we're going to have to tighten down the road. And that tightening might be more than we would like to have happen to contain inflation. In other words, it seems to me the longer we have this run without taking more decisive action the more difficult our task is going to be in the future. But at the moment I am content to agree with your proposal. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	39.0
198902	497	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	498	SEGER	" Yes, I can support your recommendation, sir. I won't tick off all my reasons because most of them have already been stated by someone or another. I would just add one, and that is that if we were to tighten further I think there would be copycat actions coming from other countries. And I'm not sure that that would benefit all the economies in the world long term. Also, with the dollar so strong at the moment and our strenuous efforts to lead it down, it just doesn't seem sensible to be putting further upward pressure on interest rates at this moment. So I would back your alternative, which I believe is ""B."" "	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198902	499	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	500	HOSKINS	 I have to ask myself, as I think everyone else around the table does, where the risks are in this situation. What is it going to cost us two years from now if we make a mistake now? And is the cost greater for being overly easy now relative to being overly tight? I don't see one structural problem--in the Southwest or with the thrifts or internationally--that would be helped by having an inflation rate of 5.7 percent, which I think is the rate for the CPI, excluding energy, that Mike has in his forecast. It seems to me those problems will be made substantially worse. We'll have to move much more aggressively with much higher interest rates. In my view, it would be simply a repeat of policy mistakes that we have made in the past. It seems to me that we could undo the cost of being overly tight now relatively quickly if we needed to. We can't undo the other. It gets built in. It's serious and it's unacceptable--not just in the sense of the current inflation. What we're trying to do  is get the maximum output for this economy. There is not a trade-off between real growth and inflation. There isn't. It's [unintelligible] in the very short run. So it just seems to me that we ought to ask ourselves about those risks and then come out on the side, at least from my perspective, of moving away from the approach where the costs are enormous. I think now is the time to move. I'd be in favor of alternative C. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198902	501	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	502	BLACK	" Mr. Chairman, I'm very close to Jerry Corrigan and very close to Lee Hoskins. A while ago I appeared to be complimenting Don Kohn unduly at the expense of Mike Prell. But I'd like to say that I think that Mike's forecast for the economy--the need for increasing short-term rates--is probably absolutely accurate. And I favor sooner rather than later. But there's always this risk that we could do too much now. As far as this yield curve is concerned, one reason it's the way it is [relates to] an expectation on the part of knowledgeable observers that we probably will do some further tightening fairly soon. So, I clearly come out in favor of ""C."" But there is this matter of institutional harmony that Jerry mentioned a while ago. And given your commitment, Mr. Chairman, to move to this in a couple of weeks or so I can go along with that. I'd rather do it now but I can vote for that. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198902	503	HOSKINS	 I want to clarify that. Is it a commitment to move in a couple of weeks or to reconsider in a couple of weeks? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198902	504	SPEAKER	 No, it's not. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198902	505	BLACK	" Well, I meant to consider a move depending on what the data say. And if they point in the other direction I wouldn't want to move; I think it is very ""iffy"" right now. I'm less convinced than most of my colleagues in Richmond that this has gotten quite as far away from us as some people think. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198902	506	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	507	STERN	" Well, let me comment a little further about the risks as I see them. I don't see much risk at this point in time, with one caveat, to some further tightening. I personally wouldn't go all the way to ""C,"" but I would be inclined to go to $700 million [borrowing] immediately. The only risk that I can really see of doing that relates to external factors--the issue of external balance. And I think the solution to that ultimately lies with a change in fiscal policy rather than anything that we can do. Beyond that it does seem to me that something between ""B"" and ""C"" is appropriate here and now. As I say, I don't see much risk to the real domestic economy from such a move. While I personally feel that inflation is already excessive and probably will rise, we may be pleasantly surprised here; I'll acknowledge that. But I don't see that an additional small move at this point in time is going to [be harmful]; if anything, it's simply going to help [produce] a pleasant surprise if we're fortunate. And at best it will turn out to have been an appropriate action. I don't place a lot of weight on it but there apparently is some expectation in the market that some further tightening is imminent. And I don't think we want to see rates slide back from where they are now.  "	23	23	2.0	1.0	41.0
198902	508	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	509	MELZER	" Well, first of all, I'd like to make up for that rude question before. I'd like to reiterate the position I stated earlier: first of all, I think inflation is too high; and secondly, I think it's going higher. On the other hand, I don't think it's getting away from us or that it's going to get away from us if we stay on this course of monetary restraint that we've been on. In addition, I feel that the only shot we have at long-term price stability--and I would agree with Lee that that should be our goal in the long term--is if we can get there with a more or less stable real economic performance. In other words, I don't think we're in a situation now where it will be productive in terms of the long-run inflation fight to run too close to the line in terms of a recession. In formulating this view I think that, in a sense, it's all too easy to ignore the narrow monetary indicators; that's not something that gets a lot of discussion around the table. As a result, there's a great temptation for [unintelligible] most recent numbers we see and so forth. Obviously we should be looking at those. But I think at inflection points that can really result in procyclical policy, in easing too long or tightening too long. Having said that, if you look at the reserve base and Ml as well as M2, we've been looking at slow growth rates for two years with further slowing in the last six months or so--and particularly in recent months. In the fourth quarter we had reserve growth that was barely positive; I think the Bluebook showed that in the period from November through January we were actually looking at a negative growth rate of 5 percent. And the Board staff's forecast is assuming 0 percent reserve and Ml growth for all of 1989. Now, in my own view, that kind of policy is very restrictive and I think there's a reasonable likelihood that that will put the economy in a recession in late 1989 or 1990. As I say, the reason I'm concerned about that is that the response in the other direction is going to put us so far off of a sustained path of monetary restraint that it could take us years to get back to the position I think we're in right now. I want to be clear on this. I'm not afraid, in a sense, to take a recession if that's what we have to do. I don't think you ever like to do that, to make that judgment. But obviously if things have gotten out of control, in the end we have to be willing to run that risk for the very reasons Lee said. And it becomes difficult later. But, as I said, I don't think that's where we are. There has been a lot of discussion but it seems that important financial markets don't think that's where we are either. Otherwise, why would the dollar be doing what's it's doing, and gold doing what it's doing, and long Treasuries doing what they're doing? My final point, which is more or less an aside, is that I think the FOMC has done an excellent job in this period in terms of moving early. But I wouldn't necessarily say that we have led the markets. I simply want to point out that if dramatic additional tightening is undertaken at this time, we certainly don't have the fact that the markets are calling for it. The constituencies, if you will, that are represented there are supporting it. In a dramatic move here--and I know that's not really on the table--in effect, we would be really stepping out in front, which I don't think we've done. Obviously, in pursuing a path of tightening there always are going to be constituencies that are against that, as Governor LaWare referred to before. But in this case where investors feel inflation is getting  away I just think one is in a better position--if one is responding to pressures either in the foreign exchange markets, presumably backed up by our foreign trading partners, or behavior in long-term securities markets--to move against that background. Obviously, there's the chance of doing that too late and never catching up; I understand that. Anyway, that would lead me to a position where, really, I would support ""C"" as stated--not ""B"" as stated. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
198902	510	HELLER	 You woke us up. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198902	511	MELZER	 I figured I would. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
198902	512	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	513	CORRIGAN	 That was the apology. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198902	514	BOEHNE	 Well, the issue is clearly one of weighing the risks of too much versus too little tightening. Reasonable people can differ on that and that's what we're seeing around the table. I don't think any of us can be overly sure, whatever we do, that it is the right thing to do. Therefore, I think it is very relevant to ask the question: What are the implications of whatever we do today if we're wrong? It is possible that we could do the wrong thing today. And it comes down to this: Is it more costly to unwind too much tightening or is it more costly to make up for too little tightening? I think that this Committee has been in existence long enough and that there's a pretty clear historical record, even though this group is much wiser than our forefathers and mothers, that [the answer] is very, very clear. It is more costly to make up for too little tightening. It is relatively easy to lower interest rates. If you lower interest rates you don't cause a lot of unhappiness. Given the uncertainty, and on top of that my assessment of the risks, I would move toward alternative C fairly promptly. I think it's a mistake to let interest rates fall at this point. Temporizing makes sense for institutional harmony for now and I think that's worth something. But I must say that it makes me very uneasy about the future because I think temporizing can be quite costly. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
198902	515	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	516	KELLEY	 Mr. Chairman, I think this has been an excellent discussion; there is a great deal to be said on both sides of these issues. It's not surprising in the light of all the ambiguity out there; I think it's rather what one would expect. As I consider how to come down on this issue, I'd have a great deal of concern if we were doing nothing now--as everyone here would. But I don't think that's the case. For one thing, as I understood our expectations at the last meeting we were expecting the funds rate to settle basically on the shy side of 9 percent. In fact, it has been on the plus side of 9 percent. So, to some extent, you could say that we already may have gotten one extra tranche of tightening than we had expected to get at our last meeting. And I fully support that. I think it was entirely appropriate and was well done. Nevertheless, it has been there. The aggregates are growing very slowly and I think that's entirely appropriate; but I would be concerned if they went very much slower than they are. I think it makes some sense to try to hold them around where they are. The dollar has implications when it goes in both directions but I think the way it's going now it is on the strong  side and supports an anti-inflationary stance. Whatever the yield curve may be telling us, it is inverted enough that it is clearly on the anti-inflationary side. So, I think we are moving cautiously and appropriately and I am very comfortable supporting your proposal. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
198902	517	GREENSPAN	 President Syron. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	518	SYRON	" I think, as Ed Boehne said very well, that we are in a period of some substantial uncertainty and that one has to weigh the symmetry of the risks. I fully agree with his analysis that it is always easier to loosen later on than it is to tighten later on. The staff forecast, which seems to me as good a forecast as one is going to find any place, does have some worrisome implications in terms of inflation, excluding energy, as one gets out beyond the forecast period. So, in an unconstrained world I would tend to favor an approach somewhere between ""B"" and ""C."" But I do agree strongly that it is important to communicate institutional harmony at this point in time given the number of things that are going on. And I would be comfortable with your position, given that you suggested that there would be a consultation within a matter of a couple of weeks and that there would be no decline, effectively, in market rates in the interim period--that we wouldn't have sent a signal that we were going in the opposite direction when that might have to be reversed within that couple of weeks. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	51.0
198902	519	GREENSPAN	 That would be a bad mistake. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0

198902	521	GREENSPAN	 President Boykin. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	522	BOYKIN	" Well, Mr. Chairman, I find myself in the usual dilemma when it comes to this point, given where I live all the time except for a couple of days every seven or eight weeks here in Washington. It's hard for me to rationalize being a little more restrictive or a little tighter, given the risks of what that might do to the Southwest since it seems that most of the problems have been and are still pretty much centered down there. The arguments, I think, have been well stated on both sides of the issue. Intuitively, I would be in favor of moving toward ""C"" now. I'm not so confident of that, though, that a two or three weeks' delay to get us a little better reading on what's going on is that important. But I remain concerned, as I indicated earlier in the meeting, about the level of inflation and what appears to me to be a fairly timid approach to reducing that in a fairly significant way. I just think it's too high. But I would be supportive of the proposition that you put out. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	34.0
198902	523	GREENSPAN	 Well, we still have President Guffey. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	524	GUFFEY	" Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Coming into the meeting this morning I guess I was looking for something between ""B"" and ""C"" on the short run, with some immediate movement toward ""C"" following this meeting. In view of your plea for accommodation, although I'm not a voting member, I could almost interpret your proposal as being a ""B-C"" stance--taking a look at it again in a couple of weeks. And from that standpoint it would be very acceptable to me. I'd just like to lay on the table the way the tightening might take place in the period ahead. I understand that using the discount  rate probably doesn't meet with much favor among those who have to vote on it--that is, the Board members-- given the comments that have been made the last couple of days. But there is a time beyond which I think we will not be able to move the discount rate and close any gap, if that's a concern to anybody. When I talk about ""B-C,"" a bit of snugging now, I would like to consider that we could deal with a discount rate [increase of] 1/2 percent and not let it all show through--in other words, come to a funds rate level of something like 9-1/4 to 9-3/8 percent. The further you go, if indeed you believe the staff's forecast, you've neutered yourself on using the discount rate as an instrument, I think. And if we're ever going to do it, now would be the time to do it, given the projection that I think most of the people around the table believe. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	20.0
198902	525	GREENSPAN	 I'm still missing Governors Angell and LaWare. Would either one of you-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0

198902	530	LAWARE	 I support your recommendation, Mr. Chairman. I am skeptical about the possibility of unwinding some of these other rates simply because we keep the present level of pressure on. I suspect that in two or three weeks when we discuss this again we probably will want to cinch it up a little. But I think that the current suggested approach is a sound one. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	50.0
198902	531	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	532	ANGELL	 Yes. The staff's forecast, as I understand it, is for a funds rate 150 basis points higher in the fourth quarter of 1989 than in the fourth quarter of 1988. Is that about right? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198902	533	PRELL	 About 150 basis points by a year from now. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198902	534	ANGELL	" A year from now. If that does turn out to be the path that we end up on, it seems to me that it would be somewhat desirable somewhere in there to have a discount rate move. I would not share Roger's enthusiasm for a discount rate move not showing through. I tend to prefer to have discount rate moves really show through the full amount when we do them. So it seems to me that's an alternative that ought to be looked at. I do not favor that now, even though I favored that in November and December; to me it's a question of timing. And I just don't quite understand how matters of weeks are that significant in regard to the long-run impact on inflation. Most of what we know about inflation suggests that it takes quite a while for it to show through. Indeed, if our analysis of commodity prices is correct at all, we really can expect the CPI turning point some 7 to 9 months after we get a turning point in commodity prices. And any turning point in commodity prices at this point is somewhat tentative; it is not in the bag. So, I think we have a period ahead of us that's going to be a period of some travail. I don't know where I'm going to be at the end of the month. I would prefer, Jerry, to tighten when we  have some lack of super-strength in the dollar. It seems to me that it would be somewhat more desirable to get our economy, in a nominal GNP sense, to slow down by domestic [factors] rather than to get it done by a lack of improvement of the external [side]. So, I believe it's important that all of us keep something of an open mind as to where we are at the time of the telephone conference call. I know I'm going to. And if the conditions are such that we can make a move at that time--and we're getting closer to impacting the second quarter's money growth rather than the first quarter's money growth--and it would appear that we're not running the risk of driving M2 to zero, then that's the time to do it. I believe it's a long-term patience struggle. It is clear that I am more confident than some that the monetary restraint, if in place, is the real measure. I just do not know when interest rates are high or when they are low; I do feel very confident about our maintaining a 3 percent growth path for M2. And I'll be prepared under those conditions to vote restraint if it appears that is what's necessary to keep M2 growth at the bottom of the range. Thank you. So, my vote is yes for ""B."" "	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198902	535	GREENSPAN	 Why don't we vote on that proposal, but let's see if this language is correct. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	536	BERNARD	 It reads: In the implementation of policy for the immediate future the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from December through March at annual rates of about 2 and 3-1/2 percent, respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 7 to 11 percent. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198902	537	HOSKINS	 Can I clarify one thing? In the interest of institutional harmony, when we meet in two weeks will a vote be taken? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198902	538	ANGELL	 Two? I thought it was the end of the month. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198902	539	HOSKINS	 Well, end of the month. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198902	540	GREENSPAN	 The telephone conference will be toward the end of the month. The issue of a vote depends on whether we have to change the directive. If we don't have to change the directive then there isn't a vote. But that's the purpose of the conference call: to develop-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	541	BLACK	" If we say ""maintain"" would that preclude our letting the federal funds rate move up? "	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198902	542	GREENSPAN	 Not that I know of, it wouldn't. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	543	JOHNSON	" I assume that there's an implied management approach by the Desk that goes with ""B."" It's what Don reported on.  Now, I don't know what that means. It means being more sensitive to the funds rate but obviously there's some play in it. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198902	544	GREENSPAN	 There has to be some play in it. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	545	JOHNSON	 It doesn't mean any persistent upward pressure. But I think everybody agrees it doesn't mean a decline in rates from the current level. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198902	546	BLACK	" And ""maintain"" would permit us to raise the borrowing target $100 million? "	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198902	547	GREENSPAN	 The answer is yes; the instruction to the Desk does permit the Desk to raise the borrowing target to $500 million in that the asymmetric language allows that to occur. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	548	SEGER	 But not until it's discussed at the conference call, right? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198902	549	GREENSPAN	 No, the conference call is scheduled basically later than that, unless we need to consult earlier. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	550	ANGELL	 Look, I don't think we ought to be trying to pin [the Chairman down]. If something happens and the Chairman agrees we ought to have a conference call before the end of the month I think he ought to call one before the end of the month. It seems to me this is asymmetric language and asymmetric language should give the Chair some freedom between now and a conference call. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198902	551	JOHNSON	 That's what's in there. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198902	552	BLACK	" I wanted to make sure that we didn't preclude a decision to raise the borrowed reserve target if the data indicated, simply because we said ""maintain"" in here. And the answer is no. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198902	553	GREENSPAN	 No. This language provides for it. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	554	JOHNSON	 Asymmetric language always means that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198902	555	BLACK	 I just wanted to be sure on that one. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198902	556	GREENSPAN	 Call the roll. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198902	557	BERNARD	 Chairman Greenspan Yes Vice Chairman Corrigan Yes Governor Angell Yes President Black Yes President Forrestal Yes Governor Heller Yes President Hoskins No Governor Johnson Yes Governor Kelley Yes Governor LaWare Yes President Parry No Governor Seger Yes  	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198902	558	GREENSPAN	 The next regular meeting date is March 28th, but we'll be talking, obviously, before then. 	1	1	0.0	1.0	47.0
