201407	0	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	5	5
201407	1	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I would like to begin today’s meeting by giving the floor to President Fisher, who asked if he could take a minute to address the group.	5	5
201407	2	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	5	5
201407	3	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I wanted to apologize to the group for having an excerpted part of my speech in the Wall Street Journal on Monday during the blackout period.	5	5
201407	4	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I asked them not to publish it during the blackout.	5	5
201407	5	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Michelle has seen the string of e-mails.	5	5
201407	6	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	They sent me back what I actually said, which is always dangerous, on the 16th of July.	5	5
201407	7	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I did correct it because there were a lot of misstatements in there that they had created from the speech.	5	5
201407	8	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Having said that, I think all of us, especially me, need to be conscious of the fact that whatever we say can appear.	5	5
201407	9	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I did argue with them about publishing it.	5	5
201407	10	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	They were firm on it.	5	5
201407	11	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	But I think, Madam Chair, I am embarrassed because this is a sacred institution.	5	5
201407	12	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I am also embarrassed because they had one of the San Francisco Fed’s dollars in the picture.	5	5
201407	13	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	It had an “L” at the very end, rather than a “K.”	5	5
201407	14	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I don’t want to embarrass my colleague from San Francisco, and I just wanted to issue a public “I’m sorry.”	5	5
201407	15	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	5	5
201407	16	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	5	5
201407	17	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Next I want to mention that the subcommittee on communications is up and running under the leadership of Governor Fischer.	97	9
201407	18	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I thought I would just turn over the floor to him for a second to report on their activities.	97	9
201407	19	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks very much, Madam Chair.	97	9
201407	20	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We are waiting for the third “Fisher” to come follow me and say something.	97	9
201407	21	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	97	9
201407	22	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	The communications subcommittee consists now of Jay Powell, Loretta Mester, John Williams, and me.	97	9
201407	23	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We had our first, primarily agenda- setting, meeting this morning, and the first item on the agenda is going to be revising the statement on longer-term goals and monetary policy strategy that was agreed on in January by the Federal Open Market Committee.	97	9
201407	24	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We’ve had the idea of circulating some of the discussion that took place in this Committee when that was discussed, so that people can see what the issues are.	97	9
201407	25	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We are clearly going to have to find some way of relating to the financial-stability function, which is not defined as part of our dual mandate.	97	9
201407	26	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We have a hard time getting financial stability into the dual mandate, but we clearly are focusing more on it than we did in the past, and it will have to make an appearance of some sort.	97	9
201407	27	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	There are other issues that you discussed earlier, ones that possibly we could make another incremental step on, but we will see what those are, and we hope to have something ready to discuss at the December meeting.	97	9
201407	28	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	97	9
201407	29	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Great.	97	9
201407	30	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	97	9
201407	31	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Our first two items this morning will be considered in a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board.	97	9
201407	32	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I need a motion to close the Board meeting.	97	9
201407	33	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	97	9
201407	34	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	97	9
201407	35	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	97	9
201407	36	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Let me turn over the floor now to Simon for the Desk report.	61	6
201407	37	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201407	38	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period, domestic financial conditions eased as longer-term interest rates declined and equity prices increased.	61	6
201407	39	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-left panel of your first exhibit, markets responded to some better-than-expected labor market data and Federal Reserve communications that focused less on the recent uptick in inflation than some had anticipated.	61	6
201407	40	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Market participants paid particular attention to the discussion of policy normalization in the June FOMC meeting minutes, which reportedly put downward pressure on short-term interest rates.	61	6
201407	41	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Broad US financial markets were little affected, on net, by unfavorable geopolitical developments, though they led to declines in Treasury yields at times.	61	6
201407	42	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	In terms of broader themes, market participants continued to focus on the substantial decline in longer-dated forward rates across advanced economies and the low levels of volatility in financial markets since the beginning of the year.	61	6
201407	43	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	There is also growing attention on the relative stability of the expected federal funds path.	61	6
201407	44	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The top-right panel shows this path is little changed since December, despite better- than-expected labor market data and shifts higher in the SEP rate projections.	61	6
201407	45	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	At present, the market-implied path lies notably below the median of the June SEP paths.	61	6
201407	46	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The Desk’s surveys can be used to examine more directly whether aspects of market beliefs on the path of policy have changed more materially despite the relative stability of the market-implied path.	61	6
201407	47	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Since dealers’ and buy-side participants’ responses were not notably different from each other in the most recent surveys, I will focus on the dealer results, for which we have a longer history.	61	6
201407	48	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-left panel, since December the average probability dealers assign to liftoff occurring in 2015 has increased about 25 percentage points.	61	6
201407	49	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Further, the dealers are placing increasingly more weight on liftoff in the first half of 2015.	61	6
201407	50	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	However, views of the pace of tightening thereafter do not seem to have changed much.	61	6
201407	51	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The middle- right panel shows dealer average responses for the modal pace of tightening after liftoff since the start of 2013.	61	6
201407	52	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	On average, dealers expect the FOMC to tighten about 125 basis points per year for the first two years after liftoff, and there has been little change in this view.	61	6
201407	53	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The modal pace in the third year is lower, and has declined recently, consistent with the lower expectations for the longer-run neutral rate.	61	6
201407	54	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	One explanation for the recent stability in the modal pace of tightening in the first two years of rate normalization is that market participants’ broad economic outlook is not markedly changed.	61	6
201407	55	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Indeed, while unemployment rate forecasts from the Desk’s and other surveys have markedly declined since December, GDP growth and inflation forecasts for 2015 and 2016 are little changed.	61	6
201407	56	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	With regard to the growing difference between the market-implied path and the SEP  path, contacts have suggested this partly reflects the interpretation of the so-called dots.	61	6
201407	57	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Market participants generally believe that the futures market is priced near the perceived level of the Chair’s projections, which most believe is the 4th to 7th lowest dot.	61	6
201407	58	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	However, there are many market participants who suggest the market as a whole might be overly complacent in forming their expectations for monetary policy amid continued accommodation supported by forward guidance and low market volatility.	61	6
201407	59	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Direct evidence on this issue from market reaction to economic data releases is mixed:  The Tealbook, examining a sample going back to 1990, finds little convincing evidence of excessively low sensitivity to economic news.	61	6
201407	60	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	However, Desk analysis using a smaller sample finds, as does the Tealbook, that the responsiveness of longer-term interest rates to economic data surprises has been lower this year than it was in the prior three years.	61	6
201407	61	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Market prices that could register possible unease about the policy rate path show almost the opposite of concern.	61	6
201407	62	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Measures of fixed-income skew, while still positive, have declined since the start of the year, as shown in the bottom-left panel, suggesting investors in these markets now see less risk of a shift up in rates.	61	6
201407	63	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Additionally, as shown in the bottom-right panel, longer-term measures of inflation compensation are very stable, although shorter-dated measures have increased in recent months along with realized inflation.	61	6
201407	64	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	However, if there was excess complacency in financial markets about the level of longer-term interest rates promoted by the accommodative stance of advanced economy central banks, this complacency might also cause measures of interest rate skew and inflation compensation not to reflect the underlying risks.	61	6
201407	65	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	An alternative explanation for some of the patterns observed in financial markets given by some market participants—not related to complacency but perhaps even more concerning—is that the decline in long-forward rates is partly driven by the risk of a policy error, whereby the Committee will tighten policy before the economy can sustain higher rates, necessitating a subsequent easing of policy back toward the zero bound.	61	6
201407	66	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Your next exhibit reviews international developments over the period.	61	6
201407	67	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	In the UK, market attention focused on recent communications from the Bank of England.	61	6
201407	68	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	These included Governor Carney’s Mansion House speech, in which he stated that a rate hike could happen “sooner than markets currently expect.”	61	6
201407	69	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	This comment prompted an increase in front-end UK interest rates and a modest rise in shorter- dated interest rate implied volatility, as shown in your top-left panel.	61	6
201407	70	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	While these moves partially retraced, following evolving Bank of England commentary, both interest rates and implied volatility remain higher.	61	6
201407	71	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Longer-dated interest rates and equity prices in the UK declined following the speech and remained lower.	61	6
201407	72	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Global risk asset performance was mixed, with US equities outperforming those in Europe over the period, as shown in the top-right panel.	61	6
201407	73	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	European financial markets responded to concerns about the possible imposition of further criminal penalties on European banks, which increased in April following media reports on this topic.	61	6
201407	74	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Since then, the share prices of many of the largest euro-area and UK banks have declined due to increasing uncertainty regarding future litigation and associated penalties.	61	6
201407	75	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	US banks have been less affected by these concerns as market participants view them as more advanced in resolving outstanding litigation.	61	6
201407	76	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Separately, European banking sector concerns escalated further after corporate governance issues and liquidity stresses intensified at Banco Espírito Santo.	61	6
201407	77	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Its shares have fallen more than 50 percent over the intermeeting period, and have damped investor sentiment toward other peripheral banks.	61	6
201407	78	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	These banking concerns and, to a lesser extent, rising geopolitical tensions also contributed to a small widening in euro-area peripheral government bond spreads, as shown in your middle-left panel.	61	6
201407	79	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Similarly, US high-yield corporate spreads widened slightly over the period, in part because of a paring back of investor positions as spreads reached average levels from 2005 to 2007.	61	6
201407	80	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Emerging market asset prices continued to increase despite a marked decline in Russian financial markets, shown in your middle-right panel.	61	6
201407	81	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Prices of Russian assets fell because of a worsened growth outlook, partially as an effect of sanctions related to the Ukraine situation and to fears of further sanctions following the downing of a commercial airplane in Ukraine.	61	6
201407	82	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Spillover of these concerns to other emerging markets was limited as asset price increases likely reflected the ongoing reach for higher-yielding investments amidst low volatility, better-than-expected economic data in China, and continued highly accommodative monetary policy in advanced economies.	61	6
201407	83	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	With regard to the ECB, euro-area money market rates continued to trade at very low or negative levels in the wake of the rate cuts and liquidity measures announced at the June ECB meeting, including the new targeted LTROs, which will begin in September.	61	6
201407	84	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	These so-called TLTROs are intended to incentivize lending to euro-area nonfinancial corporates and households, with contacts estimating up to €850 billion in participation across all eight operations.	61	6
201407	85	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Such usage could result in further modest downward pressure on euro-area money market rates, including the already negative overnight repo rates for French and German collateral shown in the bottom-left panel.	61	6
201407	86	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The Desk’s management of the SOMA and ESF euro foreign currency reserve portfolio has been affected by these negative money market rates.	61	6
201407	87	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	To minimize the effect of negative rates, the Desk extended the term of some investments.	61	6
201407	88	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	This has caused the portfolio duration to rise very close to the Desk’s 12-month internal limit, as shown in the bottom-right panel.	61	6
201407	89	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	In the current environment, we will continue to face tradeoffs between accepting negative rates and extending duration by investing in longer-dated positive-yielding instruments.	61	6
201407	90	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Depending on the evolution of market rates, the Desk may seek the Committee’s approval to extend the public 18-month duration limit.	61	6
201407	91	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	In domestic operations, usage of the overnight RRP, shown in the top-left panel of your final exhibit, averaged about $130 billion per day over the intermeeting period, about $30 billion lower than in the previous period.	61	6
201407	92	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The decline was primarily due to decreased demand from money market funds, which had higher-yielding alternatives than last period, when decreases in the supply of Treasury bills put downward pressure on money market rates.	61	6
201407	93	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	However, over quarter-end, overnight RRP take-up reached $339 billion, with nearly $200 billion flowing into the operation on June 30 and exiting on July 1.	61	6
201407	94	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	This large one-day increase reflects the contraction in borrowing activity associated with banks’ and dealers’ behavior around financial reporting dates.	61	6
201407	95	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	As a result, short-term investors, including money funds, have fewer investment opportunities.	61	6
201407	96	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	In the absence of the overnight RRP exercise, these funds would increase their unremunerated balances at custodial banks or invest in other assets at lower and perhaps negative rates.	61	6
201407	97	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The top-right panel shows some of these dynamics: Reserve balances of foreign banking organizations decrease sharply at quarter-ends as they pare back the size of their balance sheets, while reserve balances at custodial banks rise.	61	6
201407	98	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The contraction in FBO borrowing activity at quarter-ends has increased as firms prepare to comply with Basel III leverage ratio requirements and excess reserves continue to grow.	61	6
201407	99	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	In addition, this was the first quarter in which balance sheet size will be used to assess whether an FBO will need to form an intermediate holding company and thus become subject to US regulatory requirements.	61	6
201407	100	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	This consideration may have further encouraged dealers owned by foreign financial institutions to shrink their balance sheets.	61	6
201407	101	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Participation in TDF test operations was also influenced by quarter-end dynamics.	61	6
201407	102	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	As you are aware, the staff completed its most recent series of tests, which involved increasing the offered rate over the past four operations.	61	6
201407	103	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-left panel, take-up rose as we offered higher rates, and reached $153 billion in the final operation.	61	6
201407	104	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The operation that covered quarter-end was an exception to this trend, as some large domestic and foreign participants appeared reluctant to hold term deposits over their regulatory reporting date.	61	6
201407	105	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	As discussed in a memo you received before the meeting, a wide range of banks continue to note that demand for TDF deposits is constrained because of how these deposits effect the LCR.	61	6
201407	106	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	If banks had the option to withdraw funds on a same-day basis prior to maturity, TDF deposits would become LCR-compliant.	61	6
201407	107	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The staff has developed plans for preliminary testing in late summer or early fall of a variation of the TDF that includes an early withdrawal feature.	61	6
201407	108	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Under such testing, a penalty rate would be charged to firms for breaking a TDF deposit, and it would be set at a level that would make opportunistic withdrawal of funds very unlikely.	61	6
201407	109	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Turning to Treasury markets, as shown in the middle-right panel, fails increased sharply in June, although they were quickly resolved and did not affect broader Treasury market functioning.	61	6
201407	110	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The increase largely reflected a temporary bout of fails in three of the most recently issued, or “benchmark,” securities.	61	6
201407	111	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Non-public data suggest that large holdings by certain foreign official accounts, which tend not to lend securities, help explain some of the spike in benchmark fails in June.	61	6
201407	112	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Importantly, it does not appear that the fails are related to large SOMA holdings of individual securities.	61	6
201407	113	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	In fact, our holdings often help prevent fails because we make them available to the market through Desk securities lending operations.	61	6
201407	114	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	There has been little change in our securities lending activity despite the rise in fails, largely because recent fails have been concentrated in benchmark securities of which we have few, if any, holdings.	61	6
201407	115	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Some market participants have speculated that changes in the regulatory environment may have made fails more likely, perhaps due to reluctance on the part of dealers to devote their balance sheet to low-margin businesses like repo or securities lending.	61	6
201407	116	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	In the MBS market, lower mortgage rates and increased summer purchase activity led to faster prepayment speeds on the SOMA portfolio, with paydowns increasing from $17 billion in June to $19 billion in July.	61	6
201407	117	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	As a result, reinvestment purchases will exceed the size of outright purchases.	61	6
201407	118	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Following the discussion of reinvestments in the June FOMC minutes, nearly all Desk survey respondents expect the Committee to continue reinvestments until after liftoff.	61	6
201407	119	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	If the Committee reduces the pace of Treasury or MBS purchases at this meeting, as expected by nearly all market participants, we would release a Desk statement at the same time as the Committee statement.	61	6
201407	120	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Lorie and I will have copies of the statement available for review tomorrow.	61	6
201407	121	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Next, I will review the market reaction to the discussion of policy normalization in the June FOMC minutes.	61	6
201407	122	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Prior to the minutes, many market participants anticipated that the overnight RRP and IOER would be the primary tools used to control rates, particularly while the balance sheet is large.	61	6
201407	123	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Market participants now expect overnight RRP to play a more supplementary role.	61	6
201407	124	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Some market participants were surprised that the Committee anticipates a spread between the IOER and ON RRP rates that is near or above its current level.	61	6
201407	125	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Following the minutes, the median expectation for the spread at liftoff seen in the Desk’s surveys shifted from 10 basis points to 20 basis points, as shown in the bottom-left panel.	61	6
201407	126	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Market participants still have dispersed expectations for usage of the ON RRP.	61	6
201407	127	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Among survey respondents who expect the spread between the IOER and ON RRP rates to be 20 basis points, the median expected level of overnight RRP usage at liftoff is $350 billion, down a bit from expectations ahead of the June FOMC.	61	6
201407	128	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Some market participants have argued that ongoing regulatory developments, including recently announced money market fund reforms, could lead to higher average usage in the future.	61	6
201407	129	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Dealers’ expectations for the levels of short-term rates at liftoff appear to have coalesced following the minutes, as shown in the bottom-right panel.	61	6
201407	130	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The average respondent now expects the effective federal funds rate to trade in the middle of the range created by the IOER and ON RRP rates, rather than near the top of the range.	61	6
201407	131	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Following the discussion in the minutes, most respondents now appear to interpret liftoff as entailing the first increase in IOER rather than just a tightening of the spread between the IOER and ON RRP rates.	61	6
201407	132	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	When we condition on the views of respondents who had a consistent definition of liftoff across the June and July surveys—specifically, the 20 respondents who expected IOER to be 50 basis points, represented by the red dot—we find that expectations for the effective federal funds rate at liftoff declined, on average, 13 basis points between the surveys.	61	6
201407	133	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	This decline is consistent with the market reaction following the release of the minutes.	61	6
201407	134	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Money market rates broadly declined, with rates on Eurodollar futures maturing in late 2015 and early 2016 falling as much as 9 basis points.	61	6
201407	135	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Market participants suggested that both secured and unsecured money market rates may trade lower than previously expected as a result of the wider anticipated spread between the IOER and ON RRP rates.	61	6
201407	136	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Finally, I would like to highlight briefly two distinct counterparty proposals from the Desk.	61	6
201407	137	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	In early August, the Desk is planning to announce a pilot program to extend our MBS trading relationship to a few firms that are too small to qualify as primary dealers, similar to the nearly complete Treasury Operations Counterparty Pilot Program.	61	6
201407	138	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Both pilot programs will provide useful insights into our counterparty framework.	61	6
201407	139	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Second, in a memo you received before the meeting, we discussed that in light of the understanding under which the current extended counterparties in the ON RRP operations were enrolled, the interests of reasonable governance argue for revisiting the counterparty list.	61	6
201407	140	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Specifically, we requested authorization to open an enrollment wave to firms that meet the current eligibility criteria.	61	6
201407	141	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	However, if preferred, we can postpone reopening until the Committee has finalized the normalization principles.	61	6
201407	142	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201407	143	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	That concludes my prepared remarks.	61	6
201407	144	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	61	6
201407	145	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for Simon?	62	6
201407	146	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	62	6
201407	147	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	62	6
201407	148	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Looking at your charts 13 and 14—when I do econometric work I spend a lot of time looking at outliers, and it looks like the end of the quarter has outliers that are relevant for understanding short-term credit behavior.	62	6
201407	149	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	When I think of federal funds, I think it’s a GSE-dominated market.	62	6
201407	150	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	When I think of excess reserves, I think of it as basically a foreign branch–dominated market.	62	6
201407	151	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I wonder if you could expand a little bit more on the behavior—we have been calling it “window-dressing” in some of the memos, but it might be worth just elaborating a little bit more on what is encouraging the branches to dramatically change toward the end of the quarter, and what would be the implication—are there other ways that we could affect behavior?	62	6
201407	152	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we had significant limitations on some of our facilities, are there other alternatives that could make us think about foreign branch behavior at the end of the quarter?	62	6
201407	153	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	My view of what’s going on is that a large amount of the reserves in the system are held at these foreign banks.	62	6
201407	154	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	About 52 to 54 percent is the average.	62	6
201407	155	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Most of the trading in the federal funds market, and also the Eurodollar market, is an arbitrage trade.	62	6
201407	156	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	It is an overnight trade, in which someone who doesn’t have access to interest on excess reserves gives money to a foreign banking organization who can then earn interest on excess reserves.	62	6
201407	157	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	At quarter-end, the easiest way for the foreign banks to reduce their balance sheet is to reduce those excess reserves, because they are not really serving any purpose other than the arbitrage trade.	62	6
201407	158	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	It’s a rather neutral event within financial markets for the foreign banking organizations.	62	6
201407	159	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	It does cause challenges for the investors that they deal with.	62	6
201407	160	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	As you can see, last year what would happen is the custodial balances in big custodian banks would go up at that point, because there wouldn’t be balance sheet available elsewhere.	62	6
201407	161	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	In terms of how we could change this, I’m not completely sure what the economics are behind the window-dressing that happens.	62	6
201407	162	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	It seems that there could be accounting incentives to do it.	62	6
201407	163	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	There are regulatory incentives.	62	6
201407	164	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Clearly, the incentive—not in the branches here, but for the other parts of a foreign banking organization—to reduce their balance sheet in the most recent quarter were quite strong because of their trying to calculate the $50 billion asset threshold for the IHC requirement.	62	6
201407	165	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I think it is worthy of more investigation.	62	6
201407	166	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	But overall this is reasonably neutral.	62	6
201407	167	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I think going in and out, there is no friction within money markets from the existence of the overnight RRP.	62	6
201407	168	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	It probably does make it a little bit easier for some of the people who want to do this behavior to maintain the relationships they have after that.	62	6
201407	169	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	If I’m a money fund, I feel less disturbed by the fact that I have to go to the ON RRP for one day, and then I form my relationship back with a foreign banking organization.	62	6
201407	170	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Just one quick follow-up.	62	6
201407	171	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	This is indexed to 100.	62	6
201407	172	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	When I look at $630 billion, how much of a movement was there just of the FBOs in terms of quantity of excess reserves?	62	6
201407	173	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	It was a reduction of 25 percent.	62	6
201407	174	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	We have the numbers.	62	6
201407	175	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	[Aside to Ms.	62	6
201407	176	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Logan]	62	6
201407	177	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Is that right?	62	6
201407	178	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	How much? $150 billion?	62	6
201407	179	2014-07-30	meeting	LOGAN	$350 billion, maybe—something on that order.	62	6
201407	180	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	It’s in one of my notes—$340 billion or 25 percent.	62	6
201407	181	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	62	6
201407	182	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	62	6
201407	183	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Can I just follow up on chart 13?	62	6
201407	184	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	If we weren’t to have a discussion, as we’re about to have this morning, or change the parameters, the normalization principles, all of the things we hope to issue in September, and we come to quarter-end September, would you expect a similar bar to what you saw in Q2?	62	6
201407	185	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	These bars have been growing.	62	6
201407	186	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	One of the differences from the previous quarter-end was that the cap was $10 billion rather than $7 billion.	62	6
201407	187	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I think four funds were maxed out at quarter-end, if I remember exactly, might have been a few more.	62	6
201407	188	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I would expect this to perhaps be a little bit higher, depending on what the dynamics were in money markets at that time.	62	6
201407	189	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The dynamics were quite unusual in this quarter-end, as dealers were trying to net down their repo books.	62	6
201407	190	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	It’s hard for us to think through what the rate configuration was, because rates are actually quite high in the GCF market.	62	6
201407	191	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	That wouldn’t be predictive of this kind of spike, but that’s what we got.	62	6
201407	192	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	It was a pretty sudden spike.	62	6
201407	193	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I think it surprised some of us here that it was that big.	62	6
201407	194	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Is that fair, Bill?	62	6
201407	195	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62	6
201407	196	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions?	62	6
201407	197	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	62	6
201407	198	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I have a question on the term deposit facility, and that is, we have a reference in the draft normalization principles to our other supplementary tools, which I take to include the TDF.	62	6
201407	199	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	The take-up is kind of interesting.	62	6
201407	200	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	There is really a big increase in take-up.	62	6
201407	201	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I guess my question is, if you eliminate the individual caps, make it LCR-friendly, and then start playing around with price, what kind of size could it get to?	62	6
201407	202	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Really, the question is, at the start, is this a tool that we can actually think might have some effect around the time of liftoff?	62	6
201407	203	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Or how many reserves do we really need to drain, do we think?	62	6
201407	204	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I’m going to let Bill answer this one—I’m sure I will agree with him.	62	6
201407	205	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I guess my first answer is, we don’t know.	62	6
201407	206	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	We’ll be doing testing of the breakable TDF, and we will get better information on how much that helps to increase the amount that we can drain.	62	6
201407	207	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think that my expectation is that it will help a fair amount—that we will get considerably larger amounts that we can drain.	62	6
201407	208	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	But I don’t think they will be so large that we will get to a situation in which reserves will be scarce, and we can kind of implement policy through scarcity of reserves, unless the rate is extraordinarily high.	62	6
201407	209	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Nonetheless, draining some reserves in this way, and offering an attractive investment for banks that they can then respond to, and their actions in other markets, should help to firm rates.	62	6
201407	210	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The extent to which that’s the case—it’s just hard to judge, I’m afraid.	62	6
201407	211	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62	6
201407	212	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I think that there are two things that could happen—the profits of banks go up, or they pass on some of this rate increase, and there will be some mixture.	62	6
201407	213	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	We will have more rate control from it the less it just increases the profits of banks.	62	6
201407	214	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	We shouldn’t count on this tool being useful at the time of liftoff?	62	6
201407	215	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I think in terms of theatrics, it might be useful, that we are actually doing things.	62	6
201407	216	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	But in terms of changing some of the competitive dynamics that might be there, you’d have to work really hard because it’s the same set of counterparties who have access to interest on excess reserves.	62	6
201407	217	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	You are not changing that competitive dynamic in money markets.	62	6
201407	218	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Okay.	62	6
201407	219	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Thanks.	62	6
201407	220	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	62	6
201407	221	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	I wanted to go back to something President Rosengren asked, to make sure I understood.	62	6
201407	222	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	On chart 14, when you look at those quarter-end responses from the foreign banks, so this is not eliciting a regulatory response in terms of managing the balance sheet as it relates to capital?	62	6
201407	223	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Or is this just a function of the amount of reserves in the system?	62	6
201407	224	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I am not a supervisor, so—I think that the answer I gave is they have massive reserve balances, so they’ve got 52 percent of $3.6 trillion.	62	6
201407	225	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	That’s a big number.	62	6
201407	226	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	They are not really using it for anything other than the arbitrage trades, so they are reducing it down.	62	6
201407	227	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	It’s risk-weighted capped to a charge of zero, so it doesn’t matter.	62	6
201407	228	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	But on the leverage ratio, it has the same weight as everything else, which is the behavior you’re seeing.	62	6
201407	229	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	62	6
201407	230	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	It was my understanding that there is an asymmetry between the domestic and foreign banks in the degree to which daily averaging was the relevant balance sheet measure versus quarter-end.	62	6
201407	231	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	And the foreign banks are more tilted toward quarter-end, and, thus, they place sort of a higher shadow value on actually doing it.	62	6
201407	232	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Is that understanding correct?	62	6
201407	233	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	As I said, I’m not a supervisor.	62	6
201407	234	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I think our leverage ratio is calculated as an average.	62	6
201407	235	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	There’s less of an incentive to do it.	62	6
201407	236	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	It is not obvious how people are going to apply the Basel III leverage ratio to foreign banking organizations, but they seem to be thinking that it might be applied more at the quarter-end.	62	6
201407	237	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	There’s some uncertainty.	62	6
201407	238	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	If you talk to some of the people who have to manage these balance sheets, they are unsure on a number of aspects about what the final rules will look like.	62	6
201407	239	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	They still have the net stable funding ratio, for example, that has to be finalized.	62	6
201407	240	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	62	6
201407	241	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	One more, just to follow up on that.	62	6
201407	242	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	The Europeans are doing a stress test this fall.	62	6
201407	243	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	If they are worried about their balance sheet at the end of the quarter, would we expect during the stress test that we might see even larger movements by the foreign banking organizations and need to be aware of that as we go into the fall?	62	6
201407	244	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I think that you saw that at the end of last year, when it was true that European banks tried to get their balance sheets a little bit lower, because that was the snapshot that was taken for the AQR and also for the stress test, in my understanding.	62	6
201407	245	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	That is less of an issue now.	62	6
201407	246	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	But in countries in which there are other regulations coming on—the United Kingdom, for example—you are going to see these dynamics continue if you do all of the measurement at a particular point in time.	62	6
201407	247	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions for Simon?	62	6
201407	248	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62	6
201407	249	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, I need a motion to ratify open market operations.	63	6
201407	250	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	63	6
201407	251	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks.	63	6
201407	252	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	63	6
201407	253	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I think we are now ready to turn to the next topic, which is monetary policy normalization.	92	9
201407	254	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Let me just make a couple of introductory comments to start things off.	92	9
201407	255	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I want to begin by once again expressing my appreciation to all of you for the productive discussions you have had over the past two meetings and also for your thoughtful and constructive comments on the draft normalization principles and the memos that were circulated for discussion today.	92	9
201407	256	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I also want to thank the staff for their continued excellent support.	92	9
201407	257	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I think we all agree on the importance of clearly communicating to the public our normalization plans well before the first steps in tightening policy become appropriate.	92	9
201407	258	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	In light of the good progress we have made so far, I believe we are on track to roll out our revised policy normalization principles and strategy in September.	92	9
201407	259	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	As you know, staff circulated a revised set of normalization principles yesterday that reflect the comments we received late last week.	92	9
201407	260	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I hope that any further revisions that seem necessary can be locked down in the coming weeks so that we can finalize and release these principles in September.	92	9
201407	261	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Therefore, my first goal for today’s meeting is to make sure we agree on the general approach to conducting monetary policy during normalization that is spelled out in the main memo, and incorporated in the policy principles, and that we iron out any remaining issues with the overall approach during today’s session.	92	9
201407	262	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Secondly, I hope we can make progress on the mechanics of our approach, and in particular on the role and design of the overnight RRP facility, something that is clearly a concern to many of you and to me as well.	92	9
201407	263	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I think that most of you agree that the overnight RRP facility needs to play a supplementary role in enhancing our control over the federal funds rate during the normalization process.	92	9
201407	264	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Personally, I will say that I think it’s important for us to demonstrate convincing control over short-term rates at liftoff.	92	9
201407	265	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	But because of our concerns about this facility’s potential to create systemic risk or to cause significant and unintended changes in the structure of money markets, we will definitely need to address these concerns.	92	9
201407	266	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to the numerical parameters pertaining to the caps, I would suggest that we still have time to work out these details, and we can and should wait to finalize these choices until we have done some further testing.	92	9
201407	267	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	We are likely, in that testing process, to learn more about usage and the limits that will be needed to establish adequate monetary control.	92	9
201407	268	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	There is no need to nail down the parameters today.	92	9
201407	269	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	That said, I will surely be asked questions about the facility in September, and I’d like to be able to describe some of the key design features of the overnight RRP facility at the press conference.	92	9
201407	270	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	But the draft normalization principles omit technical details, and I think we can say at that time that we have made no final decisions on numerical parameters.	92	9
201407	271	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	A third goal today is to address how we will handle intermeeting adjustments in the event that the funds rate moves outside the target range set by the Committee.	92	9
201407	272	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	As we have discussed before, under the unprecedented circumstances we face, we cannot know with certainty how well any specific approach to normalization will work in practice.	92	9
201407	273	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	We, thus, need to be able to adjust our mix of tools flexibly.	92	9
201407	274	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	One important issue raised in the staff memos regards the possible need to make an adjustment to one of our tools between FOMC meetings in order to help keep the funds rate in the Committee’s target range.	92	9
201407	275	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	We hope that this need would not arise very often, but I think we need arrangements for making adjustments that are prompt and effective and also appropriate from a governance standpoint.	92	9
201407	276	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	As noted in the staff memos, one possibility is for the Committee, at the outset, to delegate carefully circumscribed authority to me as Chair to make such intermeeting adjustments.	92	9
201407	277	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I want to make clear that I am not asking for this authority now, but I am interested in hearing your views on how we should proceed if, say, the federal funds rate moves significantly or persistently outside of our target range.	92	9
201407	278	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, the Committee is responsible for setting the stance of monetary policy, and I would not support any plan that, in practice or in appearance, distances the Committee from policy decisions.	92	9
201407	279	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I think we are ready to get to it.	92	9
201407	280	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	As in our previous discussions, I encourage you to make good use of the Q&A period after the staff presentations.	92	9
201407	281	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	We will then have a go-round to hear everyone’s views on the proposals.	92	9
201407	282	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	With that, I am going to turn the floor over to Patrick McCabe, who is going to start us off on the staff presentation.	92	9
201407	283	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	284	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	My colleagues and I will be referring to the exhibits labeled “Monetary Policy Normalization.”	92	9
201407	285	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	At the June FOMC meeting, many of you emphasized that using an ON RRP facility during the normalization process could have unintended effects on financial markets.	92	9
201407	286	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Participants noted the possibility that surges in take-up during periods of financial stress could exacerbate dislocations in funding markets and that expanding the Federal Reserve’s footprint in financial intermediation could reshape markets in unpredictable ways that could prove undesirable.	92	9
201407	287	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	However, the Committee has also recognized over the past several months the potential utility of an ON RRP facility.	92	9
201407	288	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	In particular, it was generally agreed that the facility could play an important supporting role for IOER by helping to put a firmer floor under money market rates when the time comes to tighten policy.	92	9
201407	289	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Thus, the risks on which the Committee focused in June need to be weighed against the usefulness of an ON RRP facility in improving control over the federal funds rate during normalization.	92	9
201407	290	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Given this tradeoff, participants discussed several design features—including constraints on usage and a relatively wide spread between the ON RRP and IOER rates—that could help address unintended consequences while preserving the usefulness of the facility for implementing monetary policy.	92	9
201407	291	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	In that discussion, participants appeared to envision an ON RRP facility that would be relatively small and limited in its possible growth, which would provide opportunities for adjustment by the Committee as experience is gained, and that would not remain in place permanently.	92	9
201407	292	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	In my remarks, I will discuss a specific structure for an ON RRP facility that has these features.	92	9
201407	293	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	This proposal, which aims to address participants’ concerns while maintaining the facility’s ability to assist in managing the level of short-term rates, was the subject of one of the memos that you received in advance of this meeting.	92	9
201407	294	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	The top-left panel of exhibit 1 outlines the basic structure of the staff proposal and its key parameters.	92	9
201407	295	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Clearly, the Committee could choose a different configuration of these parameters, and the initial settings could be adjusted during the normalization process, as experience and the Committee’s weighing of considerations dictate.	92	9
201407	296	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	First, reflecting the Committee’s concerns about the potential size of the program in normal times, the spread between the ON RRP rate and the IOER rate would be 25 basis points, a bit wider than the current spread.	92	9
201407	297	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Second, the proposal includes two distinct safeguards that are intended to mitigate the possible adverse effects discussed by participants in June—that is, usage would be the lesser of:  (1) a $500 billion overall limit on the size of the program that is intended to place a bound on the Federal Reserve’s footprint in money markets, and (2) a dynamic aggregate circuit-breaker cap that aims to limit sudden and potentially disruptive surges in take-up that may occur in periods of financial stress.	92	9
201407	298	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	As outlined in the memo, the circuit-breaker cap would be equal to average usage over the previous five business days plus $100 billion.	92	9
201407	299	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	We expect take-up at the facility to remain below the overall limit in normal times, particularly given the wide spread between the ON RRP and IOER rates.	92	9
201407	300	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	In the event that the circuit-breaker cap reached the overall limit, the Desk would consult with the Committee regarding possible policy responses.	92	9
201407	301	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	The Committee could also delegate to the Chair the authority to make limited, temporary changes to the overall limit or circuit-breaker cap during an intermeeting period.	92	9
201407	302	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Finally, the cap system would be implemented as part of a daily uniform-rate auction, which would provide a market-based allocation mechanism that sets the rate on ON RRPs in the event that either of the caps is binding.	92	9
201407	303	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	That auction could also have limits on the take-up by any single counterparty to preserve broad access to the facility and discourage counterparty business models that may depend on large potential use of ON RRP.	92	9
201407	304	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	As noted to the right, the combination of the overall limit on usage and the circuit- breaker cap has some advantages over either safeguard on its own.	92	9
201407	305	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	An overall limit on aggregate take-up assures that the Committee would determine the maximum size of the facility.	92	9
201407	306	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	A circuit-breaker cap alone would constrain surges on a given day but would not prevent take-up from continuing to rise over time.	92	9
201407	307	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	To be sure, an overall limit on its own would be more straightforward and likely simpler to communicate to the public.	92	9
201407	308	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	However, it could allow very large surges into the facility when recent usage has been low, unless the overall limit itself is very low, but a very low limit might bind often and materially reduce the facility’s ability to establish a floor on short-term rates.	92	9
201407	309	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	The circuit-breaker cap, in contrast, could be effective in containing surges without binding frequently.	92	9
201407	310	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Another advantage of including a circuit-breaker cap is that its automatic adjustments in response to routine market developments would not convey information about policy intent.	92	9
201407	311	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	The middle panel illustrates the proposed combination of safeguards using actual ON RRP usage to date—that is, the gray bars in the panel.	92	9
201407	312	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	To be sure, if the current exercise, which employs uniform caps for each counterparty, is modified to utilize the proposal’s combination of aggregate caps, future counterparty behavior and take-up may differ from current patterns.	92	9
201407	313	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Still, observed take-up provides a useful means of illustrating the relative utility of different types of aggregate caps.	92	9
201407	314	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	The blue line shows the proposed circuit-breaker cap.	92	9
201407	315	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Beginning on January 30, when the authorization of the exercise was extended for one year, that circuit-breaker cap would have been binding just twice, on the quarter-end dates of March 31 and June 30.	92	9
201407	316	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Potential one-day surges into the facility—that is, the differences between the heights of the bars and the blue line—would have averaged $98 billion, with a standard deviation of $26 billion and a maximum of $145 billion.	92	9
201407	317	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	In contrast, a standalone $500 billion overall limit, the red dashed line, would never have been binding to date, but it would have allowed very large surges into the facility.	92	9
201407	318	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	The average potential surge with such a static cap on its own would have been $378 billion over the sample period, and the maximum potential surge, $451 billion.	92	9
201407	319	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	The proposed circuit-breaker cap, as mentioned earlier, would be based on average usage over the previous 5 business days.	92	9
201407	320	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	As discussed in the appendix of the staff memo, the 5-day moving average has some advantages over alternative measures, such as average usage over the previous month, calendar week, and 10 business days.	92	9
201407	321	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Compared with caps set using these alternative measures and calibrated to allow similar magnitudes of average potential surge, a cap based on a 5-day moving average would have been binding or close to binding on fewer days.	92	9
201407	322	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Moreover, because of its greater sensitivity to changing conditions, this cap would have resulted in lower volatility in potential one-day surges and a smaller maximum potential surge.	92	9
201407	323	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Measuring previous usage over a longer period would make the cap less responsive to evolving market conditions and would result in greater variation in potential surges into the facility.	92	9
201407	324	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	That said, during a period of financial stress, a cap based on a shorter period, such as the proposed 5-day moving average, could increase fairly quickly.	92	9
201407	325	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Such a cap itself could rise by more than $100 billion in a week and allow for larger potential surges into the facility.	92	9
201407	326	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	This point highlights that this type of cap should be considered primarily as a circuit breaker intended to limit the size of an initial surge while giving the Committee a few days to assess the situation and consider policy alternatives.	92	9
201407	327	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	The lower-left panel highlights some key remaining questions for the Committee.	92	9
201407	328	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	First, is the proposed structure of the facility, including the combination of an overall limit on the size of the program and a circuit-breaker cap, appropriate?	92	9
201407	329	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Second, if so, are the proposed calibrations appropriate?	92	9
201407	330	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Is $500 billion the right level for the overall limit?	92	9
201407	331	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Is $100 billion the right amount to add to past usage to set the circuit- breaker cap?	92	9
201407	332	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Should past usage be based on the average take-up over the previous five business days?	92	9
201407	333	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Of course, if the proposal were adopted—with these calibrations or with others—the parameters could always be adjusted as more is learned about the operations, effectiveness, and usefulness of the program.	92	9
201407	334	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	A related question is whether to allow the circuit-breaker cap to bind occasionally, such as at quarter-ends.	92	9
201407	335	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Doing so would allow staff and market participants to become more familiar with the operational procedures associated with a binding cap, such as the auction process, so that their first experience with a binding cap would not occur during a period of market stress.	92	9
201407	336	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Furthermore, having caps that bind occasionally would encourage market participants to temper their reliance on the ON RRP facility and better incorporate in their contingency planning the possibility that an auction may leave them with more uninvested cash than expected late in the day.	92	9
201407	337	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	A potential cost is the reduction in the facility’s effectiveness in establishing a floor on rates, directly on the days when the caps bind and perhaps also indirectly as counterparties adjust their strategies in response to the expectation that the caps will bind occasionally.	92	9
201407	338	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Regarding timing and communications, as noted to the right, the Committee could adopt the proposed combination of an overall limit and a circuit-breaker cap with a new resolution authorizing the ON RRP exercise at the September meeting.	92	9
201407	339	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	The Committee also could publicize the shift to a new structure in conjunction with the announcement of the normalization principles and through a Desk statement.	92	9
201407	340	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	The authorization might also include options for additional testing of the design features of this proposal, particularly given the remaining uncertainties about the efficacy of the proposal in establishing a floor on short-term rates.	92	9
201407	341	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	The results of these tests could inform the Committee’s balancing of its objectives of managing the level of short-term rates and mitigating concerns about financial-stability risks, and aid in refining its calibration of key parameters.	92	9
201407	342	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	The Committee might also consider small-value tests of a binding cap outside of the regular daily operations.	92	9
201407	343	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Such tests could provide some operational experience with a binding cap while limiting any effect on interest rate control.	92	9
201407	344	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	In addition, during the testing process, staff could consider whether the use of projections for normal ON RRP demand would be more effective for setting the circuit-breaker cap than measures of past usage.	92	9
201407	345	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	If projections were used in this manner, the Desk could publish in advance its projections for take-up and the resulting levels of the cap.	92	9
201407	346	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	If the Committee is interested in testing any of the design features of the facility, including those that I have highlighted or others, the staff could provide a more specific proposal for testing for approval by the Committee.	92	9
201407	347	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Such a proposal also would outline how to assess the test results in terms of costs and benefits and the tradeoff between the two objectives of managing the level of short-term interest rates and mitigating financial-stability risks.	92	9
201407	348	2014-07-30	meeting	McCABE	Gretchen will now continue our briefing.	92	9
201407	349	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	Thank you, Patrick.	92	9
201407	350	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	In my remarks, I will summarize the key aspects of the overall approach to normalization discussed in the staff memo, and then describe some possible adjustments that could be made to allow for a smaller role for the overnight RRP facility if that were desired.	92	9
201407	351	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	As noted in the top panel of your second exhibit, under the approach in the staff memo, you would continue to set a target range of 25 basis points for the federal funds rate; that target range would be your primary means of communicating the stance of monetary policy.	92	9
201407	352	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	Framing the stance of policy in terms of the federal funds rate would focus monetary policy discussions and communication on a rate that is familiar to market participants and the public.	92	9
201407	353	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	In addition, setting a target range rather than a point target would afford some leeway in achieving your stated interest rate policy while the quantity of reserves in the banking system remains elevated, and could be especially helpful during the early stages of liftoff.	92	9
201407	354	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	The IOER and overnight RRP rates would be used as tools to move the effective federal funds rate into the target range and to maintain it within that range.	92	9
201407	355	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	The IOER rate would be set equal to the top of the target range and the overnight RRP rate set equal to the bottom of the target range, settings that would be straightforward to communicate.	92	9
201407	356	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	Because the resulting spread of 25 basis points would be a little wider than the current 20 basis points, it should continue to encourage a volume of trading in the federal funds market that is similar to the current level.	92	9
201407	357	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	A spread of 25 basis points would also help to mitigate concerns about having a large footprint in the nonbank financial sector during normal times.	92	9
201407	358	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	As I already noted, I’ll return to the topic of the role of overnight RRP operations in this approach a bit later.	92	9
201407	359	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	Communicating adjustments to the stance of policy would be straightforward under this approach.	92	9
201407	360	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	For example, the first tightening move could be to set the target range to 25 to 50 basis points, with the IOER rate at 50 basis points and the overnight RRP rate at 25 basis points.	92	9
201407	361	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	Subsequently, the target range could be adjusted in steps of 25 basis points, or multiples thereof.	92	9
201407	362	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	At a typical FOMC meeting, you would primarily focus on setting the target range for the federal funds rate.	92	9
201407	363	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	The staff memo included an illustrative draft of a postmeeting liftoff statement announcing the first change in the target range.	92	9
201407	364	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	The statement notes that, “In a related action to help move the effective federal funds rate into the new target range,” the Board had changed the IOER rate.	92	9
201407	365	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	It also notes that the Board had approved a change in the primary credit rate in the same way that changes in the discount rate have been communicated for quite some time.	92	9
201407	366	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	Next, the draft statement also notes that the FOMC had changed the overnight RRP rate.	92	9
201407	367	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	Mentioning the IOER rate first in the statement, and the overnight RRP rate subsequently, would help to signal that the IOER rate was seen as playing the primary role in implementing monetary policy.	92	9
201407	368	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	Of course, you do not have to mention the overnight RRP rate in your statement; it could be noted in the directive to the Desk instead.	92	9
201407	369	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	Assuming that the limits on usage of overnight RRPs were designed to rarely bind, as presumed in the staff memo, the staff expects that this approach would result in the effective federal funds rate residing in the lower portion of the target range.	92	9
201407	370	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	But if the federal funds rate were to move outside of its target range, you might find that you need to adjust some of the parameters of this approach, or employ other measures.	92	9
201407	371	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	As noted in the bottom-left panel, your preferred response would likely depend on the specific circumstances at hand.	92	9
201407	372	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	For example, if the baseline approach works broadly as intended, but the effective federal funds rate nonetheless moved out of its target range often enough and by a sufficient amount to warrant a response of some sort, you might decide to adjust the administered rates.	92	9
201407	373	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	Such adjustments could be made at the next scheduled FOMC meeting, or you might prefer to hold an unscheduled joint meeting of the Committee and Board.	92	9
201407	374	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	Alternatively, the Board and FOMC may want to delegate to the Chair the authority to make modest adjustments to the IOER and overnight RRP rates between meetings, if such changes were judged necessary to keep the effective federal funds rate within the target range established by the FOMC.	92	9
201407	375	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	For the same reason, as Patrick noted, you might also choose to authorize the Chair to adjust the caps on usage of the overnight RRP facility, if necessary.	92	9
201407	376	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	The Board and Committee would, of course, set limits on the size of the adjustments that the Chair could make under delegated authority and, consistent with past practice, the Board and Committee could instruct the Chair to consult them, if feasible, before making any intermeeting adjustments.	92	9
201407	377	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	If such adjustments were not successful in keeping the funds rate in its target range, there are several additional steps that you could take if warranted.	92	9
201407	378	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	For example, if the federal funds rate remained persistently below the bottom of its target range, you could use term-draining tools or sales of short-term Treasury securities to firm money market conditions.	92	9
201407	379	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	You may want to consider ways to alter this approach in order to allow for a more complete assessment of the need for overnight RRP operations as part of the normalization strategy, as noted in the bottom-right panel.	92	9
201407	380	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	One possibility would be to lift off by setting the target range for the federal funds rate to 25 to 50 basis points and the IOER rate to the top of that range, just as in the baseline approach, but keep the overnight RRP rate at its current level of 5 basis points.	92	9
201407	381	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	Relative to the baseline approach, having a wider spread between the IOER and overnight RRP rates at the outset should reduce the attractiveness of the facility, but it would also result in the facility providing a lower floor on short-term interest rates.	92	9
201407	382	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	It is possible that the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates could move up nearly one for one with increases in the IOER rate.	92	9
201407	383	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	If so, the Committee could subsequently maintain the wider spread between the IOER and overnight RRP rates, or consider widening that spread further in order to minimize use of the overnight RRP facility.	92	9
201407	384	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	However, if the IOER rate did not provide enough lift for the federal funds rate or other short- term rates, the Committee would likely need to make adjustments to the overnight RRP rate to move the funds rate into the target range.	92	9
201407	385	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	But in this case the first policy tightening would not have been successful, which could significantly undermine the Federal Reserve’s credibility and greatly increase uncertainty in financial markets.	92	9
201407	386	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	Such an outcome could also have reputational consequences in the political sphere, in which criticism of the asset purchase programs has included concerns about difficulty of exit.	92	9
201407	387	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	As a consequence, the Committee might want to take a more cautious course by first using the approach in the staff memo to lift off from the effective zero lower bound, setting the target range for the federal funds rate to 25 to 50 basis points and the IOER and overnight RRP rates to the top and bottom of that range, respectively.	92	9
201407	388	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	From that policy position, the Committee could then assess the size of the overnight RRP facility and conditions in money markets, and decide if the spread between the overnight RRP and IOER rates could be widened while still maintaining acceptable control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term rates.	92	9
201407	389	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	When it seemed prudent, the Committee could widen that spread, either at the time of the next policy tightening or sooner if desired.	92	9
201407	390	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	Such an approach would be consistent with the Committee learning about the tools during normalization and making adjustments to their use in order to best balance the Committee’s various objectives.	92	9
201407	391	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	That said, assessing the contribution of the overnight RRP facility to the behavior of the federal funds rate, a key feature of this approach, could be difficult.	92	9
201407	392	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	Steve will now continue our briefing.	92	9
201407	393	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	My assignment is to introduce revised drafts of the “Policy Normalization Principles and Strategy” document.	92	9
201407	394	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	Releasing such a document is one tool that you might use to give the public more information about how you intend to normalize the stance of monetary policy.	92	9
201407	395	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	The current drafts reflect your comments on the version we distributed with the two memos on normalization back on July 18.	92	9
201407	396	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	I suspect that the document will evolve further in light of your upcoming discussion.	92	9
201407	397	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	First, I will briefly compare the current drafts with the June 2011 “Exit Strategy Principles.”	92	9
201407	398	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	Then I will discuss how the current drafts differ from the version we sent you with the two memos.	92	9
201407	399	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	The June 2011 “Exit Strategy Principles” are reproduced as exhibit 3 in the handout.	92	9
201407	400	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	I’ve highlighted the portions of that document that staff took as principles— the rest seemed, to us, to be tactics.	92	9
201407	401	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	The highlighted principles appear—either verbatim or in substance—in both new versions of the normalization principles.	92	9
201407	402	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	Those new versions appear as exhibits 4 and 5.	92	9
201407	403	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	I should note that the organization of the two versions differs, but the content is the same.	92	9
201407	404	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	Exhibit 4 shows the principles as major bullets and the Committee’s current thinking, as we understand it, about how it will implement each principle in indented subbullets.	92	9
201407	405	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	Exhibit 5 more sharply separates tactics from principles.	92	9
201407	406	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	The key differences in the draft normalization principles shown in exhibits 4 and 5, from the June 2011 exit principles, include:  (1) ceasing or reducing reinvestments will come after the first increase in the federal funds rate, rather than before; (2) instead of referring to “temporary reserve-draining operations,” as in 2011, the current drafts refer to temporary use of an overnight RRP facility and other supplementary tools; and (3) the Committee now anticipates that it will rely primarily on ending reinvestments rather than on selling assets to reduce its securities holdings—particularly its holdings of MBS—although it retains the option to sell MBS to eliminate residual holdings in the longer run.	92	9
201407	407	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	The strikeouts and red text in exhibit 4 show the changes from the draft that we sent you with the memos on July 18.	92	9
201407	408	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	With respect to the high-level principles, the key change is adding back language, in the fourth principle, that explains why the Committee intends to reduce its securities holdings and return to holding primarily Treasury securities.	92	9
201407	409	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	With respect to tactics, there are two major changes from the earlier version.	92	9
201407	410	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	The first is to make clear that a standing ON RRP facility will be a supplementary tool to be used only as necessary to help improve control over the federal funds rate and, further, that the facility will be phased out as soon as it is no longer needed for this purpose.	92	9
201407	411	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	The second major change is to state that the Committee “currently anticipates that it will normalize the size and composition of its portfolio primarily by ceasing to reinvest repayments of principal on securities held in the System Open Market Account.”	92	9
201407	412	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	These words indicate that the Committee expects to let maturing Treasuries roll off but does not expect to sell Treasury securities.	92	9
201407	413	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	However, other new language—language stating that, during normalization, the Federal Reserve will use “other supplementary tools as needed to help improve control over the federal funds rate”	92	9
201407	414	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	—holds open the possibility of selling either Treasury securities or MBS if necessary to maintain control of the funds rate.	92	9
201407	415	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	The changes that I just summarized are also incorporated in exhibit 5, though they are not shown in strikeout and red in that exhibit.	92	9
201407	416	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	The markup shown in exhibit 5 shows wording changes from the version in exhibit 4.	92	9
201407	417	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	That brings me to the final page of the exhibit, which reproduces a set of questions that you received with the July 18 memos.	92	9
201407	418	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	You may wish to address these questions in your remarks today and, by doing so, give the staff guidance about how to proceed in further refining the approach to policy normalization so that it can best meet your objectives.	92	9
201407	419	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	I should note, however, that question 2 asks about the draft directive and postmeeting statement that Gretchen mentioned earlier, and that were attached to one of the memos.	92	9
201407	420	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	We jumped the gun with that question.	92	9
201407	421	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	There is no need for you to address statement and directive language today.	92	9
201407	422	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	Patrick, Gretchen, and I would be happy to answer any questions that you may have.	92	9
201407	423	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s go to Q&A for the staff, and President Lockhart.	92	9
201407	424	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	The implication of implementing an overnight reverse repo facility is that you have some doubt that IOER will work, that it will be a powerful enough tool, and that the arbitrage relationships that historically have had some power will not be as potent in the future.	92	9
201407	425	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Can you elaborate a little further on how you come to that conclusion, or why you think or doubt that the IOER tool will be powerful enough, and maybe talk about the latest we know about arbitrage relationships?	92	9
201407	426	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	I would just say—and maybe Simon would want to talk about the latest developments—but, in general, the activity that is going on in the federal funds market now is predominantly a singular kind of transaction.	92	9
201407	427	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	We have seen at quarter-end and other times when the purchasers of those funds who earn the spread by depositing in IOER, are unwilling to do that consistently on a through-and-through, day-in and day-out basis.	92	9
201407	428	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	That is one indication of why the strength of that upward pull might be limited, at least at times.	92	9
201407	429	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	And so—	92	9
201407	430	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I think what might happen is then the federal funds rate would jump to the top of the range but reflect these trades among banks that aren’t really relevant to the financial conditions that you are trying to set.	92	9
201407	431	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	There is a mixture of the low rate and high rate trades, and that is how you get the effective rate as it is now.	92	9
201407	432	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	That is one of the concerns we have had in terms of—	92	9
201407	433	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	I would just say the TDF has the same kind of merit in terms of rate control, in terms of trying to be kind of an upward force on money market rates.	92	9
201407	434	2014-07-30	meeting	WEINBACH	But it has a secondary merit in terms of the reserve scarcity properties, and so that could provide some upward pull as well.	92	9
201407	435	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	But, President Lockhart, rather than saying we doubt that IOER and arbitrage will work, I would say we are unsure about how well it will work, about how much the spread between the IOER and funds rates might widen when we start raising the IOER rate.	92	9
201407	436	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think the spread between the IOER rate and the federal funds rate reflects a number of factors, but one is the balance sheet cost to the borrowing banks, of having a larger balance sheet.	92	9
201407	437	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	One is imperfect competition in that market, and understanding how that would play out if there were, say, a gap of 50 basis points between the IOER rate and overnight RRP rate, instead of 25 basis points, is just very difficult to know.	92	9
201407	438	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	We don’t, I think, have enough understanding of exactly who the marginal player is and what the pressures are on the marginal player that are determining that spread to know how that would work.	92	9
201407	439	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	It is possible that if you raised the IOER rate, the way the markets would play out is you’d end up with roughly the same spread between the IOER rate and the federal funds rate, other short-term market rates.	92	9
201407	440	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Rates would just kind of move up together, and that would work out okay.	92	9
201407	441	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	But we are not confident of that and the evidence that we have seen from the overnight RRP exercises is that it does help to provide a firmer floor under money market rates.	92	9
201407	442	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think it would provide greater confidence when it comes time to liftoff.	92	9
201407	443	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	You’d get the effects on market rates that you desire.	92	9
201407	444	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Is there scope for more study to understand the details of the federal funds market and the arbitrage activity in the coming weeks?	92	9
201407	445	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Or do we essentially know as much as we’re going to know?	92	9
201407	446	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	With the new FR-2420, I think that we have learned more about what that arbitrage looks like compared with the brokered data that we have.	92	9
201407	447	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Then we can see which banks are actually doing this trade and how much they account for that trade.	92	9
201407	448	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	What’s very hard to work out is the competitive environment when we increase the interest rate on excess reserves.	92	9
201407	449	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The notion, I think, that the effective federal funds rate would stay at 9 basis points seems hard to imagine if we moved IOER to 50 basis points.	92	9
201407	450	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	If you have some trades at 25 basis points, and those trades move to 50 basis points, that is going to get you 5 basis points to start out with if that’s 10 percent of the trades.	92	9
201407	451	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	So you would expect some firming in the effective rate at that time.	92	9
201407	452	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Our issue is whether you could be pretty confident you would get the effective rate above 25 basis points.	92	9
201407	453	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Most likely, you would, most of the time I think from the arbitrage, but you would be running some risk, both that you wouldn’t get over 25 basis points and, more importantly, that the federal funds rate might disconnect from other money market rates.	92	9
201407	454	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Those are two possibilities.	92	9
201407	455	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	456	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Two-handers from Vice Chairman Dudley and then President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201407	457	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	458	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Isn’t there also a problem that the regulatory regime in which these firms are operating is changing, and it’s not clear exactly at what point in time they are actually going to take on board fully these new regulations that are going to be phased in over time?	92	9
201407	459	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	At the margin we would expect that the incentives to arbitrage are probably going to lessen because the leverage ratio is going to become more important for the foreign banking organizations.	92	9
201407	460	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It comes back to what Simon said—there’s the issue that just the incentive to do the arbitrage will change as the regulatory environment changes.	92	9
201407	461	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The second set of issues is that the federal funds rate itself could become different, more idiosyncratic, as this process unfolds.	92	9
201407	462	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there are sort of two sets of issues.	92	9
201407	463	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Having an overnight RRP rate that ensures a floor, I think, potentially can be important for the credibility of this Committee.	92	9
201407	464	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201407	465	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	92	9
201407	466	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My question might have been answered already, but I’ll ask it anyway.	92	9
201407	467	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m thinking about the bottom-right panel on page 2, the upper possibility, in which  you raise IOER at liftoff but keep ON RRP at the current level, and we observe that short- term rates, money market rates, don’t move up as much as we expected.	92	9
201407	468	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Isn’t there a response whereby you could actually raise IOER by more than we had originally raised it?	92	9
201407	469	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So we had raised it to 50 basis points.	92	9
201407	470	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We can just go up by another 25 basis points and see what happens.	92	9
201407	471	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That would be—	92	9
201407	472	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Completely.	92	9
201407	473	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	92	9
201407	474	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Okay.	92	9
201407	475	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	That’s right.	92	9
201407	476	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think we felt that at some point having the IOER rate far, far above the federal funds rate and other short-term market rates would be viewed by the Committee as a potential problem.	92	9
201407	477	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	It’s just paying a whole lot of money to banks to get a funds rate to 25 basis points if you have to have an IOER rate of 75 basis points or whatever.	92	9
201407	478	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I mean, at some point that spread presents real problems.	92	9
201407	479	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	It also potentially leaves you with less good control, in the sense that rates may be moving around in some range.	92	9
201407	480	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Again, having a floor may limit that variation over time and help you to have improved control over short-term market rates.	92	9
201407	481	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks.	92	9
201407	482	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I will come back to my one-hander questions later, which I will follow up on.	92	9
201407	483	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	You are next for one-handers as well.	92	9
201407	484	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Ah.	92	9
201407	485	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s convenient then.	92	9
201407	486	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Then we go to your zero-handers.	92	9
201407	487	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	92	9
201407	488	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m going to return to the same panel I was referring to earlier, which is the bottom-right panel of page 2.	92	9
201407	489	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It makes reference to the need to have sufficient interest rate control—it is certainly an important element in our decisionmaking.	92	9
201407	490	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Sufficient for what?	92	9
201407	491	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What are we trying to achieve by interest rate control?	92	9
201407	492	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There are references to reputational risk and credibility.	92	9
201407	493	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me try to talk about economics for a second.	92	9
201407	494	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Does the staff think that inflation expectations would rise in a material and untoward way if short-term money market rates do not rise one-for-one with the IOER rate?	92	9
201407	495	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I don’t know exactly what would happen.	92	9
201407	496	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think that the confidence in the Federal Reserve’s ability to raise and control rates would be damped, for sure.	92	9
201407	497	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The Committee would be subject to considerable criticism from various outsiders over the confidence it expressed earlier that it could tighten policy smoothly when the time comes.	92	9
201407	498	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	And, gee, that doesn’t really look like it’s true, and that would undermine the credibility of the Committee.	92	9
201407	499	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	If you could quickly reestablish control, presumably that has only limited effects.	92	9
201407	500	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	If it took a while and there was kind of flailing around, as perceived from the outside, I think that could have adverse effects on expectations.	92	9
201407	501	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	As we thought of it, there is a tool that would allow you to quickly reestablish control, which is the overnight RRP.	92	9
201407	502	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	You just have to do it in a much bigger size at that point.	92	9
201407	503	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	But you would probably not get much of a hit to how credible you were for a few weeks.	92	9
201407	504	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	You could try to explain that it doesn’t affect how you are going to achieve the long-run objectives.	92	9
201407	505	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	People in money markets might not listen to that, though.	92	9
201407	506	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	They might just question whether we are really serious about trying to raise rates.	92	9
201407	507	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	92	9
201407	508	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I guess I am still struggling with this, but that is somewhat helpful.	92	9
201407	509	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Another question I had was on the new normalization principles on page 4 of 8, exhibit 4.	92	9
201407	510	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What would be the conditions that would lead to phaseout?	92	9
201407	511	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s phased out as soon as it is no longer needed for this purpose, and certainly a line of questioning that I think this Committee will face if it were to issue these principles would be questions about, well, how long will that be, or—we could deflect that presumably and talk about conditions instead.	92	9
201407	512	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What would be the conditions under which we would no longer be using this facility?	92	9
201407	513	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	As Gretchen said, I think it is difficult to know and to judge precisely what the overnight RRP is contributing to control without experimenting.	92	9
201407	514	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	But if, for example, you raised rates once or twice, and found that usage of the facility was modest and rate control was pretty good—rates were not at the floor, they were above the floor by 5 basis points or 10 basis points—then I think you would, when you raised rates, you would raise the overnight RRP rate less.	92	9
201407	515	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	You could, in some sense, phase it out over time.	92	9
201407	516	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	You would allow that spread to widen.	92	9
201407	517	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Maybe the funds rate and other short-term market rates move down a bit relative to the IOER rate, but that’s not so bad.	92	9
201407	518	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Then you continue in that track.	92	9
201407	519	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	After a while, the spread is large enough that takedown at the overnight RRP facility is extremely small, and you just say, “Okay, we are going to close the doors.”	92	9
201407	520	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	That is what I had in mind.	92	9
201407	521	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I think I view it in a slightly different way.	92	9
201407	522	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	One of the ways we think the facility works is by changing the competitive conditions in the market.	92	9
201407	523	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Usage could be low, but it could still be helping to form the floor.	92	9
201407	524	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Can we achieve something similar to those competitive conditions in the market with a different tool?	92	9
201407	525	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	As reserve balances fall, I think we could use more traditional reverse repurchase agreements to achieve that similar effect, if it is still the case that we would have money funds as the counterparties.	92	9
201407	526	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	A lot of this, from my perspective, is how comfortable you feel for a period of time having the money funds as counterparties, because if we have the money funds that helps you with the competitive pressure to firm rates.	92	9
201407	527	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If you don’t mind, Madam Chair, a follow-up.	92	9
201407	528	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think you are describing benchmark outlooks to a certain extent.	92	9
201407	529	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	When you make a commitment of this kind, it is more about what is the worst-case scenario.	92	9
201407	530	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What is the worst that could happen?	92	9
201407	531	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That is what we’re sort of on the hook for.	92	9
201407	532	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What’s the worst that can happen in terms of using this facility?	92	9
201407	533	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Is it until reserve balances get back to normal?	92	9
201407	534	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Is that—	92	9
201407	535	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	No it’s not.	92	9
201407	536	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I was saying that reserve balances are about $2.6 trillion right now.	92	9
201407	537	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Last time we thought about exit, I think they were about $1.1 trillion, $1.2 trillion.	92	9
201407	538	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	We will have currency growing over time.	92	9
201407	539	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	That will help us.	92	9
201407	540	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	We will have the portfolio run off.	92	9
201407	541	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Then, we will also have the IOER rate moving up.	92	9
201407	542	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	We will have a better understanding of the dynamics.	92	9
201407	543	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I’m not sure at what point, but two to three meetings is one way to go.	92	9
201407	544	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The other way is thinking it might be two or three years.	92	9
201407	545	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	At that point, you feel you have sufficient control from other tools.	92	9
201407	546	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	You could still use sales as well if you wanted to.	92	9
201407	547	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	There are lots of tools that you have.	92	9
201407	548	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I think our focus has been on the initial time that you raise interest rates.	92	9
201407	549	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Having as little drama around the engineering of raising rates would seem helpful for you.	92	9
201407	550	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	“As little.”	92	9
201407	551	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Okay.	92	9
201407	552	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	As little.	92	9
201407	553	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	No drama at all would be good.	92	9
201407	554	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	They’ll move up and nobody will even notice that.	92	9
201407	555	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	They’re just talking about something else.	92	9
201407	556	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher, you had a two-hander.	92	9
201407	557	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	You’re also next on the list for one-handers.	92	9
201407	558	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	You mentioned portfolio runoff.	92	9
201407	559	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	We’re still, under the proposal, contemplating reinvestments.	92	9
201407	560	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Give me the time frame in which you think the portfolio runoff actually begins to occur, its size, and when it would be subject to the influences you described.	92	9
201407	561	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Lorie, can you summarize?	92	9
201407	562	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	What’s—2016 is how much?	92	9
201407	563	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I’m just trying to add some numbers in my head:  $160 billion plus $200 billion, so $360 billion in 2016, then another $400 billion in 2017.	92	9
201407	564	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	So it gets quite large.	92	9
201407	565	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	You could also, if you wanted to, sell short-term Treasury securities.	92	9
201407	566	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Suppose you’re at a point at which the federal funds rate is in the range—we have to say “range” now—of 2.75 to 3 percent.	92	9
201407	567	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Then you might feel comfortable at that point selling some of the short-term Treasury securities because that’s not going to have the kind of signaling effect it would have now.	92	9
201407	568	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	If you defined short-term Treasury securities as we did in the MEP, we’d have $300 billion to $400 billion at least of those, which, if we sold at $50 billion a month, would amount to $600 billion over a year.	92	9
201407	569	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	The total size of the portfolio would then be what?	92	9
201407	570	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The total size of the portfolio would be under $3 trillion probably.	92	9
201407	571	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	And remember, currency under the way that we do the projections is moving up at about 6 percent, I think at this time—6 percent or 7 percent.	92	9
201407	572	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	One of the other issues is, when we came to you in the summer of 2012, we had the other side of what the new regulations would do, which would increase the demand for reserves, and that is still going to be true as we get to smaller reserve balances.	92	9
201407	573	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I think the demand for reserves will be higher than under the old regulatory structure.	92	9
201407	574	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	In our projections, we’ve written down a somewhat larger number for reserve balances than we had in the past, but I think only $100 billion if I remember correctly.	92	9
201407	575	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	It might be larger than that.	92	9
201407	576	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	But there are other central banks.	92	9
201407	577	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The Bank of England, as I’ve told you, is thinking they’ll run with a high level of reserves at that point because of the regulatory demand produced for high-quality liquid assets.	92	9
201407	578	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Thanks, Simon.	92	9
201407	579	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher, did you have a one-hander?	92	9
201407	580	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	No, ma’am.	92	9
201407	581	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201407	582	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	92	9
201407	583	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Yes, just two kind of follow-up questions to the first two that you got.	92	9
201407	584	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	One actually is a comment—if the IOER has to be raised significantly to get market rates up, what we would be doing is paying a very high rate predominantly to foreign branches in order to get a small increase in market rates.	92	9
201407	585	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I can imagine that in testimony that wouldn’t play particularly well.	92	9
201407	586	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think there is a political risk that if that were the predominant way that we decided to move forward that that would be an issue.	92	9
201407	587	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	In terms of risk management, we’ve talked a lot about the risk management related to financial stability at the previous meeting, and I think it is good to get a better sense of kind of the subjective probabilities for monetary policy control.	92	9
201407	588	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Simon mentioned the phrase “pretty confident.”	92	9
201407	589	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I just wanted to get a sense of what kind of confidence I can have—and I know this is subjective and very hard for you all to answer—but if we just relied on the IOER rate and we were to raise IOER to 50 basis points, what kind of probability would you put that we would be in the range for both short-term rates and the federal funds rate?	92	9
201407	590	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Is that 1 percent?	92	9
201407	591	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Is that 5 percent, 10 percent, 25 percent?	92	9
201407	592	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	That subjective probability of how likely we are to miss actually does matter.	92	9
201407	593	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Now, I know it’s an unfair question, but if you could just scale it to me, am I 99 percent confident or am I only 80 percent confident?	92	9
201407	594	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I’ll start, seeing as how we talked beforehand, but I didn’t tell Bill he was going to get this question.	92	9
201407	595	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	My view on the federal funds rate is that there’s probably a 75 percent chance that you’ll get it in the effective range.	92	9
201407	596	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Basically, the FBOs have to offer around 22 basis points to collect the money to get the effective rate to around 25 basis points.	92	9
201407	597	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I am sure that they’ll be completely aware of what they need to offer such that we wouldn’t make any changes in that framework because they’re making money from it, and this is the other side of not having the overnight RRP.	92	9
201407	598	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	One of the comments that we got when the minutes came out from one of the foreign dealers is that the carry trade was still live, which I thought was quite interesting—they quite like this trade, because they’re making money on it.	92	9
201407	599	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	And just to follow up—	92	9
201407	600	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Simon is a little more optimistic.	92	9
201407	601	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think if you just raise IOER, it certainly is completely possible—	92	9
201407	602	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Just the federal funds rate, though; I wasn’t talking about the other short- term rates.	92	9
201407	603	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Agreed, but I guess I am making up numbers here, right?	92	9
201407	604	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	But 50-50 chance, whether you’d end up with the funds rate in the 25 basis point target range—	92	9
201407	605	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	To get the federal funds rate in the target zone?	92	9
201407	606	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Does that make you feel good, Eric?	92	9
201407	607	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Madam Chair, could I ask President Rosengren a question?	92	9
201407	608	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	What comfort level do you like?	92	9
201407	609	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	A one-in-four or a one-in-two chance of not achieving our goal when we announce it strikes me as a very high probability.	92	9
201407	610	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’d much rather get it down—	92	9
201407	611	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	To 95 percent.	92	9
201407	612	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	—to 95 percent.	92	9
201407	613	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Economists have a 95 percent confidence level for a reason.	92	9
201407	614	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	As I think about those kinds of probabilities, they seem extremely high, that we wouldn’t have the monetary policy control at the time that we first announced.	92	9
201407	615	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Now, obviously as we got further down the road, we could widen the spread, and that would be much easier to achieve, but I’m worried about how that first announcement would go.	92	9
201407	616	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I think you also just want to be careful—there are things we could do with the calculation of the effective rate that could make it much more likely.	92	9
201407	617	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	But that doesn’t help you if repo and other rates are still below 25 basis points.	92	9
201407	618	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	You’re trying to move up all of the rates.	92	9
201407	619	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I’d be closer to Bill’s estimate if you ask me about all of the other money market rates, but the effective federal funds rate is this rather strange market, and I think we could probably have a lot of influence because the FBOs would be saying, “Well, they’re just going to roll out the overnight RRP if this doesn’t work, and why would we let that happen because we’re going to lose money?	92	9
201407	620	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Let’s price this trade at a certain amount.”	92	9
201407	621	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	92	9
201407	622	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	92	9
201407	623	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	624	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I have a question that in the greater scheme of things may be trivial, but it’s the dynamics around quarter-end and how you’re thinking about that.	92	9
201407	625	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Quarter-end would constitute, as we’ve seen at least, a surge, and the circuit breaker then would conceivably bind, which would lead us to an auction, and then my question is:  What would be the likely rates around that auction?	92	9
201407	626	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Probably rates would rise to the extent that participants really, really, really want—	92	9
201407	627	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	They’ll fall.	92	9
201407	628	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	They’d have to go down.	92	9
201407	629	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	They would not be bidding up?	92	9
201407	630	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	They’re offering money.	92	9
201407	631	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	They would be taking a lower return on their investment.	92	9
201407	632	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Then there may be need for the Chair to try to raise that return?	92	9
201407	633	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Rates would trade soft that day.	92	9
201407	634	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I am confused then.	92	9
201407	635	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Just at quarter-end are we likely to end up with some kind of chronic dynamic every quarter-end that requires the Chair’s intervention and just how do you think it would work?	92	9
201407	636	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	What would happen is that the FBOs wouldn’t be borrowing.	92	9
201407	637	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	More funds would come into the overnight RRP auction or, as you say, if the cap were kind of as we expect it probably would be, it would probably bind, and the rate that would clear at the auction would fall.	92	9
201407	638	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	That’s actually okay.	92	9
201407	639	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	That’s kind of what happens at the end of quarters.	92	9
201407	640	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	It happened at the ends of quarters before we had an overnight RRP program.	92	9
201407	641	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Rates would fall, and I think the issues then are exactly the ones that Patrick raised.	92	9
201407	642	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	There’s kind of a tradeoff.	92	9
201407	643	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	On the one hand, you may be perfectly happy with that.	92	9
201407	644	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	You’re not encouraging the sort of adjustments in balance sheets at the end of the quarter, and you may feel that’s okay.	92	9
201407	645	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	On the other hand, your control over rates is less good.	92	9
201407	646	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	You’ve said that the funds rate is going to trade in some range and then it’s not trading in that range, and it’s possible that that could also result in different behavior of money market participants.	92	9
201407	647	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	They would want to make sure they’d have some place to park their money at quarter-ends.	92	9
201407	648	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	They’d be parking money with folks at low rates not at quarter-ends to make sure they have access to that balance sheet.	92	9
201407	649	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	It could affect your control some even not at quarter-ends, but that’s the tradeoff.	92	9
201407	650	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I mean, all of this discussion is full of tradeoffs.	92	9
201407	651	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	You can have a benefit on the one hand and a cost on the other, and we’re trying to trade off those things in a way that’s comfortable.	92	9
201407	652	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you.	92	9
201407	653	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer, you’re next.	92	9
201407	654	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Well, actually I was going to ask the question that President Lockhart has asked.	92	9
201407	655	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I will pass.	92	9
201407	656	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester, you had a two-hander.	92	9
201407	657	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Yes.	92	9
201407	658	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I just wanted to ask:  Would the recommendation be that when we do liftoff, it shouldn’t be at quarter-end?	92	9
201407	659	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	If you were going to lift off right at quarter-end, which actually—it’s an issue, given the timing of meetings.	92	9
201407	660	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	You might want to have a higher cap at that quarter-end just to show that you can hit your target.	92	9
201407	661	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I think the federal funds rate would be less susceptible to this because as the arbitrage trading goes down, those high rate trades would still be there.	92	9
201407	662	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Even though other rates would have gone down, a lot would depend on how much you just want to achieve that federal funds rate target range versus getting other rates to conform.	92	9
201407	663	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	92	9
201407	664	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	665	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I have a different question, and Gretchen alluded to this in her comments about the revised principles, and I want to turn attention to the balance sheet for a moment.	92	9
201407	666	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	In the new language in the revised statement, there’s a new bullet that says that the Committee currently anticipates that it will normalize the size of the balance sheet primarily through stopping reinvestments, in other words, primarily through no sales whatsoever.	92	9
201407	667	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Then it makes another blanket statement that says we’re not going to sell MBS, and then it makes another statement that says our goal is to return to a portfolio of nearly all Treasuries.	92	9
201407	668	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I find these three statements kind of confusing and partially at odds and inconsistent with each other because I don’t know what the path is then to normalizing back to an all-Treasuries portfolio if we’ve flatly said we’re not going to sell MBS.	92	9
201407	669	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	We’re actually going to be going in the opposite direction for a while probably.	92	9
201407	670	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m trying to figure out exactly how to put these pieces together in a coherent way because to me it’s a bit confusing in terms of how we’re expressing it.	92	9
201407	671	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Can somebody help me figure out how the markets and others ought to interpret these sorts of conflicting messages?	92	9
201407	672	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	At least it’s really clear for the market how to interpret it.	92	9
201407	673	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	You’re unlikely to sell stuff from the portfolio, and they’re going to be scratching their head—“Well, maybe they’ll get there in 2033.”	92	9
201407	674	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	A lot will depend on how much currency grows in the 2020s.	92	9
201407	675	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The faster it grows in the 2020s, the more we will have to do outright sales of MBS to get back to an all-Treasuries—pardon?	92	9
201407	676	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	If we’re not going to get to the right composition until 2033—	92	9
201407	677	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	If you buy mortgage-backed securities, then it’s 30-year mortgages.	92	9
201407	678	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Absent paydowns, it’s going to take a while.	92	9
201407	679	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The third subbullet does say “although limited sales [of MBS] might be warranted in the longer run to reduce or eliminate residual holdings.”	92	9
201407	680	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	So I guess I had in mind that after the size of the balance sheet is more or less normalized—admittedly you’re in 2020 or something like that—then the Committee may well choose a gradual, pre-announced, clearly communicated trajectory for selling down the MBS over a few years so that we get out of the MBS business.	92	9
201407	681	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Implicitly, that signals a sequential decisionmaking process in terms of normalizing the balance sheet in terms of its composition.	92	9
201407	682	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Two-hander?	92	9
201407	683	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	92	9
201407	684	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I actually am going to follow up with the line of questioning that President Plosser had, although I’ll probably take a slightly different tack on it, which is:  This prediction in the fourth bullet that we’re not going to hold more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively—we’re only going to hold Treasury securities—when Governor Stein was here, he had a number of interesting ideas about using the balance sheet as a tool for financial-stability concerns.	92	9
201407	685	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Is this bullet designed to rule out the use of the balance sheet for those purposes or not?	92	9
201407	686	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think your staff was trying to not rule things out, but just to say that the size of the balance sheet will be determined by the way that you choose to implement policy and what policies you implement in the longer run.	92	9
201407	687	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think this sort of wording originally came up as a way of avoiding saying that the Committee was going to go back to a corridor system or a floor system with the larger balance sheet.	92	9
201407	688	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	You could choose whichever system you like.	92	9
201407	689	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	One would involve a larger balance sheet than the other, but the idea was that it would be the smallest balance sheet that you need to implement a policy given the policy structure that you’ve put in place.	92	9
201407	690	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	If the Committee decided that as part of it—it would still be monetary policy—they wanted to pursue something along the lines that Governor Stein had suggested to have a bigger balance sheet and engage in overnight RRPs in volume to, in some sense, crowd out what we think of as undesirable, short-term, money-like assets, that would be fine.	92	9
201407	691	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	This would say you’re going to have the smallest balance sheet that you can, consistent with that intention for monetary policy.	92	9
201407	692	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	But we were trying, I think, to leave flexibility for later on.	92	9
201407	693	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The Committee has got a bunch of decisions to make about how it’s going to implement policy post normalization in the longer run and we are not prejudging that here.	92	9
201407	694	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	I’m going to do something dangerous by disagreeing with my boss.	92	9
201407	695	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	You’re finished.	92	9
201407	696	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	[Laughter]	92	9
201407	697	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	Well, the language that you were just discussing doesn’t rule out something like Governor Stein was suggesting.	92	9
201407	698	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	I think another bullet, which says you intend to get rid of the ON RRP facility as soon as you no longer need it for interest rate control, does rule that out.	92	9
201407	699	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	If you wanted to go the route that Governor Stein was suggesting, you wouldn’t want the language in your principles that says it’s a temporary facility.	92	9
201407	700	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Absolutely right.	92	9
201407	701	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The consensus of the Committee isn’t necessarily where Jeremy was.	92	9
201407	702	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I think we should also point out that if we change these each year, people might not think that they’re that cast in stone as well.	92	9
201407	703	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	Yes.	92	9
201407	704	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Do you have a two-hander or one-hander?	92	9
201407	705	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	I guess it’s two.	92	9
201407	706	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	92	9
201407	707	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I’ll dock you for a two.	92	9
201407	708	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Steve, are you saying—and I agree with this—that it appears to eliminate the use of an ON RRP facility, but you wouldn’t understand it to eliminate the possibility of holding a somewhat bigger portfolio of securities of different durations with the potential for Committee decisions to purchase or sell those securities in an explicit effort to affect the shape of the yield curve?	92	9
201407	709	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	Yes.	92	9
201407	710	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Okay.	92	9
201407	711	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	712	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	I would point out that we were responding to the comments we received from you, right?	92	9
201407	713	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	[Laughter]	92	9
201407	714	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	If we haven’t captured your intent or desires correctly, let us know and it’ll change.	92	9
201407	715	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Two-hander, President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201407	716	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Right.	92	9
201407	717	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Just to elaborate on this point about the penultimate bullet, the ruling out of holding mortgage-backed securities does rule out certain kinds of balance sheet interventions that the Committee might want to contemplate later.	92	9
201407	718	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The reason I’m bringing this up is I think the staff has done a great job of reflecting the comments they’ve received.	92	9
201407	719	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s more that these are principles that are intended to bind the Committee over the next 10 to 20 years, if I understood correctly, and I could imagine the composition of the Committee changing over that time, maybe in ways that might perhaps be even beyond imagination.	92	9
201407	720	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I wonder about to what extent we should be viewing these as commitments and that kind of thing.	92	9
201407	721	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	92	9
201407	722	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	723	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I have two questions.	92	9
201407	724	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	The language in the penultimate bullet about “will hold primarily Treasury securities, thereby minimizing the effect of Federal Reserve holdings on the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy”—could the staff explain the logic behind that additional insertion?	92	9
201407	725	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Those are words from the 2011 principles.	92	9
201407	726	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	We received comments suggesting they be put back in as a way of explaining why the Committee would want to go back to a Treasury-only portfolio.	92	9
201407	727	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	92	9
201407	728	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	92	9
201407	729	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	The second question I had was we talked a lot about monetary control, and I know that is very important obviously, and it is obviously important because we are going to talk about a federal funds target range, and there is an expectation that we are going to hit that.	92	9
201407	730	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Simon and, I think, Vice Chairman Dudley at various points have talked about how there could be a disconnect between the funds rate and other money market rates.	92	9
201407	731	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Are we contemplating any communications about the transmission mechanism for monetary policy?	92	9
201407	732	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	That strikes me as a very important additional line of communication.	92	9
201407	733	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	It could be the case that at some point the funds rate is going to be soft relative to our target.	92	9
201407	734	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	These are things that historically we’ve experienced at various times, and you can imagine some collection of financial market indicators, money market rates of some sort, auto loans, the things that matter for transmission, and if we could point to them moving up in our announcements, that would mitigate the embarrassment if there’s some period of softness.	92	9
201407	735	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I’m just trying to get at how much discomfort we should have over things taking off slowly and perhaps if we choose to experiment a little bit with spread sizes and things like that.	92	9
201407	736	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I realize that most of the discomfort is concentrated here in Washington and with you, Madam Chair, but just a question if anybody has considered the financial interest rate effects and how that might be communicated.	92	9
201407	737	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Were you talking about loans that consumers and firms have?	92	9
201407	738	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	When we announce that rates are going to take off, other interest rates are going to move up.	92	9
201407	739	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Historically—	92	9
201407	740	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The primary rate will, yes.	92	9
201407	741	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Well, and they’ll have a little bit of term to them, too, right?	92	9
201407	742	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Like auto loans of five-year maturity and such, and the fact that things like that are moving up and the entire monetary policy transmission is that we want more financial restrictiveness.	92	9
201407	743	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	We’ll be able to point to that as being in train, maybe even in a bigger sense since sometimes these things start out more quickly than we think.	92	9
201407	744	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	The slope of the term structure might be higher.	92	9
201407	745	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I’d say rates linked to LIBOR, which might be more closely linked to interest on excess reserves, would probably move up in a stronger way.	92	9
201407	746	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	We seem to have seen something like that, perhaps, when the minutes came out.	92	9
201407	747	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The repo market is pretty important, though, for overall financial conditions, and that will be harder to see directly in the rates that households and firms are getting on that day.	92	9
201407	748	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Over time, that kind of disconnect between the federal funds market and a really large market will be important for how policy is going to be interpreted.	92	9
201407	749	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	But I think you’re correct that some of the actual rates that people face would move up with the interest rate on excess reserves and the increase in the federal funds rate.	92	9
201407	750	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	For instance, it’s the entire time path of what we’re talking about.	92	9
201407	751	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	That’s why I’m talking about the term aspect of this.	92	9
201407	752	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	In the past, we’ve seen sort of outsized reaction in bond markets and other aspects.	92	9
201407	753	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	That might be enough for people to sort of have confidence that, yes, tightness has begun.	92	9
201407	754	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Could I rephrase your question?	92	9
201407	755	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Yes, please.	92	9
201407	756	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think I understood it, but I’m not positive.	92	9
201407	757	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	We’ll raise, at some stage, the target range for the funds rate today, but we would expect that that would move up expectations for the trajectory of the funds rate, and that would then be reflected in longer-term rates and maybe also, probably, there’d be some increase in volatility, and so term premiums might widen out, and that would push up longer-term rates as well.	92	9
201407	758	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I would expect to see those effects even if there was some floundering around in actually getting the funds rate into its target range.	92	9
201407	759	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think the concern would be if there was a difficulty and it took time and a further adjustment to get the funds rate in its target range, you may get more volatility than you want, and so more term premium than you want, and some concern—it depends on how big the problems were—	92	9
201407	760	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	But the higher term premium would mean higher rates.	92	9
201407	761	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I mean—	92	9
201407	762	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Maybe you’re okay with that.	92	9
201407	763	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Well, I’m just saying one of the concerns, I think, throughout this is we don’t get rates up.	92	9
201407	764	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	If term premiums are going up, then certain rates are going up even more.	92	9
201407	765	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	The balance is what we presumably care about.	92	9
201407	766	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	You’re talking a lot about morning-call-type issues here with respect to monetary control as opposed to a little bit more emphasis on the monetary policy transition.	92	9
201407	767	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I think our viewpoint is that, unless this looks smooth, then a lot of people want to be on the morning call to work out exactly how we’re going to fix the problem that we said we weren’t going to have.	92	9
201407	768	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Exactly.	92	9
201407	769	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	And I can agree with you that, in the big scheme of things, you’re tightening financial conditions.	92	9
201407	770	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The reason you want control over overnight rates in the money markets is, the more volatility that you have in there, the less control you have of that transmission from your intentions to the future.	92	9
201407	771	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I have two-handers from Governor Fischer and Vice Chairman Dudley.	92	9
201407	772	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Yes, just to continue President Evans’s comment, I assume that what we want is a very moderate version of the taper tantrum result—that is, things will move up, all the way up the term structure and then we’ll know we’ve done something.	92	9
201407	773	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	But we’re going to have to do it in a way that shows we can control the short rate.	92	9
201407	774	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Otherwise it’s going to be all over the place.	92	9
201407	775	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I think that’s a fair point, and through this discussion we’ve sort of had it on both sides of this.	92	9
201407	776	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	The short-term policy rate might not move, but the term rates might go up a little bit like the tantrum that you’re talking about, and that might be enough to convince markets that we’re serious at the outset.	92	9
201407	777	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	It is hard to know exactly what the circumstances are going to be when we start doing this.	92	9
201407	778	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	92	9
201407	779	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Well, that’s one of the arguments for using the overnight reverse repo rate actively, and it is sort of hard to imagine a setup in which the short rate doesn’t move and the long rates do move as a result of things we did at the short end.	92	9
201407	780	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t know.	92	9
201407	781	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think, to just amplify, Governor Fischer, how much long rates move in response to our moves in short rates—there are a whole bunch of things that affect longer-term rates other than the path of short rates, and it also depends on what the expectations are for the monetary policy change.	92	9
201407	782	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If the market expected us to do 50 basis points and we did 25 basis points, long rates would probably fall.	92	9
201407	783	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it’s pretty complicated when you look at long-term rates and try to tie them back sort of in a simple way to short-term rates and what we do.	92	9
201407	784	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that would just be very hard for us to explain, ex post, why long rates either did or didn’t do what we wanted them to do.	92	9
201407	785	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Is your question—suppose IOER goes up to 50 basis points and we can’t get the federal funds rate to quite move, but everyone knows we will at some point.	92	9
201407	786	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	We’ll have the intended effect on the long rate.	92	9
201407	787	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Is that the way you’re thinking about it?	92	9
201407	788	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I guess I’m interpreting this commentary as a bit of hand-wringing over the thought that we’re not going to be effective at the outset of our interest rate liftoff.	92	9
201407	789	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	But there are just a number of other factors that are going to come into play whereby a market reaction is likely to be, “Oh, this is restrictive.”	92	9
201407	790	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	It may not be concentrated in the money market funds in the New York morning call–type activities, but I think I’d be surprised if people out in the economy weren’t seeing this and if we continued that with our further actions, I think that it would have the intended effect largely.	92	9
201407	791	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But shouldn’t tighter control lead to a more solid linkage between financial conditions and what we do in terms of monetary policy?	92	9
201407	792	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Wouldn’t we want to have that link be as strong and as robust as possible?	92	9
201407	793	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I’m trying to get at this from risk assessment, which is, of course, if we get the monetary control right, then I think it works better.	92	9
201407	794	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	But what if we don’t quite get it exactly?	92	9
201407	795	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Is it as bad as most of the commentary here is suggesting?	92	9
201407	796	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	That’s how I’m coming at it.	92	9
201407	797	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Two-hander—President Lacker, President Kocherlakota, and then President Fisher.	92	9
201407	798	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	It’s pretty clear that the staff scenario should be on the table, the one in which we let the ON RRP rate sit at 5 basis points for a couple of weeks.	92	9
201407	799	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Worst case, a couple of weeks later, we get the RP rate up.	92	9
201407	800	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	The import of President Evans’s question is, I think, it should be obvious that it’s only if we fail to bring the RP rate up that we’re going to fail to have an effect on the rates we care about, which are things like three-month, six-month, one-year interest rates.	92	9
201407	801	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	To me, it means that the embarrassment factor, the “egg on the face” factor, doesn’t have to do with our effect on the economy.	92	9
201407	802	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	It’s just this little optical thing that people in the markets can kind of write clever newsletters about.	92	9
201407	803	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	The other thing to keep in mind here is that, I may be wrong about this, but I think my sense is that we’re not going to “spring” liftoff, right?	92	9
201407	804	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	It’s not going to be a bolt out of the blue.	92	9
201407	805	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	We’re going to signal beforehand.	92	9
201407	806	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Rates are going to rise before the meeting.	92	9
201407	807	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	We can actually find out if they expect it.	92	9
201407	808	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	We’ll be able to read off before the meeting whether they expect us to have control of short-term rates or not.	92	9
201407	809	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	That was part of my briefing.	92	9
201407	810	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Isn’t that kind of the problem?	92	9
201407	811	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	If there’s a problem and maybe the Committee doesn’t view there as being a problem, but they expect us to have control.	92	9
201407	812	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	If the time comes and we don’t have control, that’s—	92	9
201407	813	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Two weeks’ surprise and one-year rates don’t budge.	92	9
201407	814	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Maybe.	92	9
201407	815	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	For what we care about, it’s not going to matter.	92	9
201407	816	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	President Lacker, the example of the release of the June minutes—it’s controversial and I think the staff might disagree.	92	9
201407	817	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The interpretation of the Desk is that the changes that we made did ease money market conditions through 2015.	92	9
201407	818	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I’m not sure completely why.	92	9
201407	819	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I’m sorry.	92	9
201407	820	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	What changes do you mean?	92	9
201407	821	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The effective federal funds rate was going to trade lower in the range, less of a tight spread.	92	9
201407	822	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	You also saw that in the survey.	92	9
201407	823	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Of the 20 people across the two surveys who thought we’d have the interest rate on excess reserves at 50 basis points in the first tightening move, the median of the change in their effective federal funds rate was down 13 basis points.	92	9
201407	824	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	That was in my last chart.	92	9
201407	825	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	That’s consistent with the money markets, and it could be the newsletters they’re writing; I agree with you completely that the people in the middle of the country are not aware of it.	92	9
201407	826	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	That is something that is likely to happen.	92	9
201407	827	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	We could disagree on how likely it is that we’ll get above 25 basis points, but that’s a lot of noise, and it probably is going to mean the other rates aren’t exactly where you want them to be.	92	9
201407	828	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	But if you wanted to run this, you should probably just explain clearly in advance that’s the system that you’re going to do and see what kind of reaction you get.	92	9
201407	829	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	If you see a big easing of conditions—some of the letters that we got after the release of the June minutes said thanks for the rate cut.	92	9
201407	830	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	You have to think about whether that’s the situation you want to be in, whether you want to communicate a quite high path for the interest rate on excess reserves to get that insurance because that’s what you could do.	92	9
201407	831	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	You could communicate, instead of 50 basis points for the first move in the interest rate on excess reserves, something like 75 basis points.	92	9
201407	832	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Well, let me ask this.	92	9
201407	833	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	What research have we done on the effect of the overnight reverse repurchase facility on longer-term rates, like three-month, six-month Treasury rates and term RP rates?	92	9
201407	834	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	What do you know about the effect of that?	92	9
201407	835	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	It has been at 5 basis points, so not much.	92	9
201407	836	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I mean if—	92	9
201407	837	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Well, it didn’t used to be at 5 basis points.	92	9
201407	838	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	You told us you wanted to do some research.	92	9
201407	839	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	No, it was 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 basis points, but for a long time we’ve had it at 5 basis points, and as you know, the quality of the floor has improved over that time, so it’s hard for—	92	9
201407	840	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Then you should see an effect.	92	9
201407	841	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	At 5 basis points, though, it’s hard to say what effect you’d expect to see if it’s consistent with what we’ve been saying, but we did see rates in 2015 and predictions of repo in 2015 fall after the minutes.	92	9
201407	842	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I don’t understand.	92	9
201407	843	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	You told us that the evidence that you’ve gathered suggests that you’ve been able to establish an effective floor.	92	9
201407	844	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Of 5 basis points.	92	9
201407	845	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I think you’ve represented to us that you’ve influenced the RP rate.	92	9
201407	846	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The fact that the expectations of the spread widened, and that’s what pulled down money market rates.	92	9
201407	847	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s what happened.	92	9
201407	848	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	The expectation of what spread?	92	9
201407	849	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The spread between the interest rate on excess reserves and the overnight reverse repo rate was changed by the June minutes.	92	9
201407	850	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Market expectations widened, and that’s what caused the money market rate—	92	9
201407	851	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	It’s possible that people just had a trade on, and that’s what we saw unwind at that point.	92	9
201407	852	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Before the minutes, you could have been looking at this, right?	92	9
201407	853	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	We looked at the futures market to understand that.	92	9
201407	854	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	We do see influences from the announcements that we’ve made, and maybe 1 basis point or 2 basis points, because if you wanted us to do an experiment, which you wouldn’t, what happens if we put the overnight RRP at 25 basis points for a month in a surprise way?	92	9
201407	855	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I think we would have a strong effect on financial conditions in the United States.	92	9
201407	856	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	You probably would want to move up IOER at the same time, but you’d have a strong effect.	92	9
201407	857	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair, you can cancel my one-hander.	92	9
201407	858	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201407	859	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I have a two-hander from President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201407	860	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Is that still on?	92	9
201407	861	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	92	9
201407	862	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll be brief, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	863	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I just want to build on this really interesting conversation triggered by President Evans’s question.	92	9
201407	864	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Vice Chairman correctly reminds us that there are so many factors that are influencing the monetary transmission mechanism to two-year, three-year, five-year rates, which is the way we were actually trying to affect the economy.	92	9
201407	865	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we want to keep in mind the magnitude of this particular effect relative to all of the other variables that are going to be affecting that transmission mechanism, including the speeches we give on an everyday basis and that kind of thing that are also having an influence on all of that stuff.	92	9
201407	866	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	How we shape the expectations of what we’re going to be doing over the next three to five years, and how we are responding to shocks, those are all going to be really important characteristics of liftoff, and we should be putting this in the context of that bigger picture, I think.	92	9
201407	867	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The only actual thing that they get to see from you is what’s happening in money market rates or if you buy a large amount of assets.	92	9
201407	868	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The signal that is clearest for them about your intent is what’s happening in those money market rates.	92	9
201407	869	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	That’s, I think, the debate we’re having here—whether you can send the same signal when you have less control than you used to have, or whether you have to give a really clear signal of control at liftoff.	92	9
201407	870	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher had a two-hander.	92	9
201407	871	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I was just going to suggest that there will be other indicators that may not be manifest in rates themselves—covenants or, I think Charlie mentioned, subprime lending.	92	9
201407	872	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	If you look at autos, that’s where the growth is in autos—subprime lending.	92	9
201407	873	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	We’re going to get lots of signals, and we may get them before we see rates increase.	92	9
201407	874	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	That was the simple point I wanted to make earlier.	92	9
201407	875	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	These are subsidiary indicators, and we are just going to have to monitor them very carefully because I would expect, if there was confidence that we were going to be firm here and this would stick, then you would see some shift in these patterns.	92	9
201407	876	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Not an esoteric point, but I think it’s an important point to bear in mind.	92	9
201407	877	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	878	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	92	9
201407	879	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	880	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I just wanted to follow up on what Simon just said, that the only way markets can get a signal from the Committee is to look at tangible objects.	92	9
201407	881	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Doesn’t that bring into question putting so much emphasis on the federal funds rate?	92	9
201407	882	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	It’s a very idiosyncratic market.	92	9
201407	883	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	It’s moving around in odd ways.	92	9
201407	884	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	It seems to me you should be emphasizing other interest rates as policy rates and not the federal funds rate.	92	9
201407	885	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I’m not sure it’s true the funds rate has been moving around in an unusual way.	92	9
201407	886	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	We had a Board briefing that was distributed to the Committee—	92	9
201407	887	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	There’s certainly a smaller number of players in the market than there has been.	92	9
201407	888	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I agree with that, but the rate itself is moving about as closely with other short-term market rates as it has in the past.	92	9
201407	889	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I don’t think it’s—	92	9
201407	890	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	92	9
201407	891	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	If federal funds behaves normally, then we don’t have to worry about all of these issues.	92	9
201407	892	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	The question is if federal funds does not behave as expected.	92	9
201407	893	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I don’t think that’s right—sorry—if I’m understanding what you’re saying.	92	9
201407	894	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think the funds rate is moving with other short-term market rates about as it has in the past.	92	9
201407	895	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think with the 25 basis point spread between IOER and overnight RRP, that’s likely to continue to be true.	92	9
201407	896	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The question in my mind is, if you raise IOER, for example, without raising overnight RRP, what will happen to the funds rate and the whole panoply of short-term market rates?	92	9
201407	897	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Will they move up roughly one-for-one with the higher IOER rate or will they move up less than one-for-one?	92	9
201407	898	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	My concern is they’ll move up less than one-for-one and we won’t have the funds rate where we want it, and there are ways of handling that, as President Kocherlakota said.	92	9
201407	899	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	You could raise IOER more.	92	9
201407	900	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Another way would be to raise the overnight RRP rate to provide a better floor and move all short-term rates up.	92	9
201407	901	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	But, given the spread that you around the table seem to prefer between IOER and overnight RRP, I’m not so worried about the funds rate becoming suddenly an idiosyncratic rate.	92	9
201407	902	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	It’s kind of moving with other short-term market rates and there are, as we’ve talked about in the past, ways of making that a more robust benchmark as well.	92	9
201407	903	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Simon may disagree.	92	9
201407	904	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	No, I think that’s correct.	92	9
201407	905	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	IOER is what’s really causing that to happen, and that’s reasonably stable.	92	9
201407	906	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The issue is whether you need the overnight RRP to support the arbitrage by putting more competition into the market.	92	9
201407	907	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I think our feeling is from the testing that it’s helpful, but people could disagree both about how important the overnight RRP is and whether you really need to worry so much about the precise control in the overnight rates, as President Evans was saying.	92	9
201407	908	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans, you have a two-hander?	92	9
201407	909	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I had a one-hander, but I’m happy to ask it.	92	9
201407	910	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Oh, okay.	92	9
201407	911	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer has a two-hander.	92	9
201407	912	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	In thinking about the benefits of the auction at the end of each quarter, what we say is well, at that time, there’s great demand for funds and so we’re going to let the interest rate go down.	92	9
201407	913	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Well, great demand to invest funds.	92	9
201407	914	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	That’s the crucial point.	92	9
201407	915	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Yes.	92	9
201407	916	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Right.	92	9
201407	917	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We’re going to let the interest rate go down.	92	9
201407	918	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Why do we want to let the market work once every quarter and not otherwise?	92	9
201407	919	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Why do we want to not use the rate for the rest of the quarter?	92	9
201407	920	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	We could run a quantity-based operation.	92	9
201407	921	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	That’s one of the things we’ve been thinking about, where each day we just auction off a certain quantity, and you could have the same counterparties for that, and you could basically just take whatever rate was produced fulfilling that quantity, and that would be another way to go.	92	9
201407	922	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	That’s probably going to be larger in usage than the overnight RRP because it won’t have the same impact as when the Federal Reserve is offering a rate—this was the original way that we talked about it.	92	9
201407	923	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I can go trade with some other people and say, “If you don’t offer me the Fed’s rate, I will go to the Fed and I’ll get a higher rate.”	92	9
201407	924	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The problem we encountered is, at times of financial stress, if the Fed is there offering this fixed rate, a lot of people might just want to go there, which I think we’ve been trying to balance over the past three meetings—that is, the desirable part of adding in this notion of an outside option or threat point of going to the Fed facility versus what happens if there’s financial stress.	92	9
201407	925	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	The old-style RRPs we used to do, we’d just announce we’re going to do $700 billion, say, and we’d run an auction, and that would not have the financial-stability risk in the same way because if we thought there was a financial-stability risk, we wouldn’t auction that much and there would be no understanding that we’re going to auction more.	92	9
201407	926	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	That’s going to require a really big footprint with the money funds to do that.	92	9
201407	927	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	You’d get some interest rate volatility day-to-day.	92	9
201407	928	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	You’d get some volatility in interest rates.	92	9
201407	929	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	If we’re using the federal funds range, I think this would be reasonably effective.	92	9
201407	930	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	It’s a big operation to do each day.	92	9
201407	931	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	One small point, Governor Fischer, is, just to be clear, we would be running an auction every day under the arrangement that the staff has suggested, but with an amount that we would be auctioning that we would expect would exceed the demand for placing funds with us at the maximum bid rate.	92	9
201407	932	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	We would be auctioning an amount with a maximum bid rate, and we think most days, except maybe quarter-ends and occasionally other days, the quantity would not be the thing that would bind.	92	9
201407	933	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	It would be the maximum bid rate, but there would still be an auction every day.	92	9
201407	934	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	If there were events in markets that caused a surge in demand, as is laid out in the memos, then the quantity would bind and the price would be set at the auction.	92	9
201407	935	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans, did you have a further—	92	9
201407	936	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I do, if we are finished with that.	92	9
201407	937	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	92	9
201407	938	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	92	9
201407	939	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Back to monetary control issues, I want to make sure, as we have talked about this, all of the proposals on the table, as I understand it, envision some role for the overnight reverse repo facility.	92	9
201407	940	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Maybe IOER plays a stronger role for trying to push the funds rate than otherwise.	92	9
201407	941	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	But we still contemplate having this facility, and it is going to set a floor for the funds rate, right?	92	9
201407	942	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Maybe we have to adjust our thinking on what the target range for the funds rate should be.	92	9
201407	943	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I wonder if somebody could comment on President Plosser’s proposal in his memo about the 50 basis point spread between the IOER and the overnight reverse repo rates, because I, frankly, found that interesting.	92	9
201407	944	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I am thinking that if we implemented something like that and adjusted our public commentary about the federal funds target range appropriately, wouldn’t we expect the monetary policy transmission mechanism to behave in the same way?	92	9
201407	945	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	That is, the funds rate would trade in a certain area.	92	9
201407	946	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Other market rates and the nonfinancial borrowing rate would go up, and that would work to tighten as much as we were expecting if we got that right.	92	9
201407	947	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Or would there be more of a difficulty?	92	9
201407	948	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Let me just understand.	92	9
201407	949	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Interest on excess reserves goes to 50 basis points, and we say we are happy that the federal funds rate is trading between 0 and 50 basis points, is that it?	92	9
201407	950	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Then we just move up the overnight RRP—	92	9
201407	951	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Yes.	92	9
201407	952	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I think it’s a little cleaner if we get as far as 100 basis points on the IOER rate and overnight reverse repo rate is 50 basis points and the funds rate is 50 basis points.	92	9
201407	953	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	It might have to start off a little bit higher, but once we get going, wouldn’t everything move up the same way?	92	9
201407	954	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Or are there added difficulties with a wide spread?	92	9
201407	955	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think that that would be a plausible way forward.	92	9
201407	956	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think the wider spread gives you a smaller overnight RRP facility, which you may like.	92	9
201407	957	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Where in the 50 basis point range market rates would end up, I am not sure.	92	9
201407	958	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Probably higher relative to overnight RRP than now, but I’m not sure how much higher, because as we were discussing earlier I’m not sure how powerful a “magnet” the IOER is for market rates.	92	9
201407	959	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I don’t think there is a conceptual problem with implementing policy that way.	92	9
201407	960	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The control over money market rates would be less tight in the short run.	92	9
201407	961	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	There would be just a bigger range and probably more variability of rates from day to day.	92	9
201407	962	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	How much you care about that is yet another thing to trade off against the size of the overnight RRP program and the expense involved with the IOER rate being higher relative to market rates.	92	9
201407	963	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	All right.	92	9
201407	964	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	The expense I understand, but “less tight”	92	9
201407	965	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I’m not quite sure.	92	9
201407	966	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	It’s a definitional matter.	92	9
201407	967	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	What if you just sort of took the viewpoint that IOER is just going to be at a premium for a while, because we’ve got a large balance sheet, we understood this at the outset.	92	9
201407	968	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	So you might just sort of acknowledge that IOER might be 25 basis points higher than you could have imagined.	92	9
201407	969	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	It will take a while for the funds rate to get up, but it will still be within 25 basis points, maybe, of the floor—the overnight reverse repo rate—until you see it start to tighten and then you adjust that range.	92	9
201407	970	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	So I gave you a version in which LIBOR might be linked more to interest on excess reserves.	92	9
201407	971	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	You are going to have a lot of segmentation across these money market rates.	92	9
201407	972	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I don’t know what that does to financial conditions.	92	9
201407	973	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I think your assumption is, I can just move up interest on excess reserves, and look at where the federal funds rate is, and that is what the center of policy is.	92	9
201407	974	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I wouldn’t be so confident that I haven’t just said to banks, “Well, don’t bother lending stuff out.	92	9
201407	975	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Here’s 75 basis points just to put money back with us.”	92	9
201407	976	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	If this was the question about that, that’s the hurdle rate now.	92	9
201407	977	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	You’re increasing the hurdle rate of banks to lend to the households and firms relative to just putting cash back with us.	92	9
201407	978	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Isn’t that the point of financial restraint?	92	9
201407	979	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	We’re trying to curb lending at some level.	92	9
201407	980	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	You are, but I don’t think your intent is to curb it quite that quickly, because if that’s the path of—	92	9
201407	981	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I say this in public all the time.	92	9
201407	982	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	People ask, “Aren’t you worried about inflation?”	92	9
201407	983	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Oh, inflation could be when money starts growing.	92	9
201407	984	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	That means when banks start lending, and what we want to do is to restrict that.	92	9
201407	985	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Then I stop and think, it’s a little hard to envision this because banks aren’t really lending that much.	92	9
201407	986	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	But that’s the mechanism here.	92	9
201407	987	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	It is the mechanism, and the way you prevent them from doing that and getting the big increase in the money multiplier would be to have a high interest on excess reserves and they’ll just put the money back with us.	92	9
201407	988	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	I don’t understand what that would look like in terms of the intent, because it would be a new world for us with that big of a gap.	92	9
201407	989	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	Presumably that restricts bank lending, but it might just shift borrowing out of banks into nonbanks.	92	9
201407	990	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Well, if they’re offering much lower rates, yes.	92	9
201407	991	2014-07-30	meeting	MEYER	Unless other market rates go up.	92	9
201407	992	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	That’s very important.	92	9
201407	993	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I mean, if I understood that better, that would change my preferences a lot.	92	9
201407	994	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	If the narrowness of the spread on this is very important for the effectiveness of monetary policy, I’d like to know more about that.	92	9
201407	995	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I could have a very different attitude on the overnight reverse repo if somebody clarified and strengthened that argument.	92	9
201407	996	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	It would play a more important role, but to date I have not heard that, or, if I have, I missed it.	92	9
201407	997	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions?	92	9
201407	998	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	92	9
201407	999	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201407	1000	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we begin the go-round, and then maybe in half an hour we’ll take a break for lunch.	92	9
201407	1001	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	First on my list is President Rosengren.	92	9
201407	1002	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1003	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support the general approach in the revised principles and strategies of normalization.	92	9
201407	1004	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’d also prefer the reorganized revised principles, though I do have a few suggestions.	92	9
201407	1005	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	First, I view the use of the federal funds rate as a communication tool rather than a hard target.	92	9
201407	1006	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	This is consistent with the second main bullet in the reorganized revised principles memo that says, “The Committee intends to adjust the stance of monetary policy primarily through actions that influence the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term rates.”	92	9
201407	1007	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I like that phrasing.	92	9
201407	1008	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	“Influence” is not the same as “target.”	92	9
201407	1009	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Specifically, we are communicating using a federal funds range, but it is important to move short-term rates more generally.	92	9
201407	1010	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I am less concerned about a thinly traded market dominated by the GSEs.	92	9
201407	1011	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would like some more background provided at future meetings on federal funds trading patterns to get a better understanding of the arbitrage relative to IOER, as President Lockhart had suggested.	92	9
201407	1012	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Second, I like the principles document having no numbers.	92	9
201407	1013	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Precise numbers have a way of becoming hardwired and difficult to change.	92	9
201407	1014	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would prefer that we not hardwire details until we are more confident about how markets will react to our actions and gain experience that can help us better understand the interrelationships among the IOER, the overnight reverse repo facility, and the federal funds rate.	92	9
201407	1015	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Given the concerns raised about the overnight reverse repo facility, it may be worth making a technical change that would help us infer how much we can rely on the IOER alone.	92	9
201407	1016	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would suggest that we make a technical adjustment to the IOER of perhaps 5 or 10 basis points at a meeting prior to when we officially begin to tighten policy.	92	9
201407	1017	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	If all relevant short-term rates move up, we can have more confidence that we can more heavily rely on IOER as our policy instrument.	92	9
201407	1018	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would also note that I would view it as a significant problem if we observed little response by other relevant short-term rates through an announcement that we were tightening policy by 25 basis points using only the IOER.	92	9
201407	1019	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	We have said in speeches and testimony that we are confident that we can raise rates when that becomes appropriate.	92	9
201407	1020	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Announcing our intention to raise short-term rates with only modest reactions from short rates other than our administered rate would seriously harm our credibility and could lead to unnecessary financial turbulence.	92	9
201407	1021	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	We need to carefully balance the goal of meeting our monetary policy objectives with the legitimate concerns raised about the reverse repo facility.	92	9
201407	1022	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would view the initial announcement to tighten as critical to meet our monetary policy objectives.	92	9
201407	1023	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Depending on the market reaction, I would then adjust the reverse repo facility and potentially the IOER−ON RRP rate spread.	92	9
201407	1024	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	In terms of the caps, I would eliminate the dynamic aggregate circuit breaker.	92	9
201407	1025	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	The two main concerns raised at the previous meeting regarding the reverse repo facility were that the facility would have too large a footprint in short-term credit markets, and that the facility would exacerbate financial-stability problems during periods of financial turmoil.	92	9
201407	1026	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Having a large initial spread and an initial overall cap seems sufficient to avoid these two issues.	92	9
201407	1027	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, the dynamic aggregate circuit-breakers do not as effectively address either concern and will be quite complicated to explain.	92	9
201407	1028	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	For example, I am not sure why I should be concerned with declines or surges in the reverse repo facility take-up that have been primarily influenced by end-of-quarter window-dressing, which largely reflects decisions being made by foreign branches.	92	9
201407	1029	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Better understanding the role of foreign branches in short-term credit markets at future meetings would also be useful.	92	9
201407	1030	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	In addition, it is not obvious to me that a $100 billion change in the use of our overnight reverse repo facility constitutes an alarming change in short-term markets or will significantly affect the global supply of short-term credit.	92	9
201407	1031	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Given the size of financial markets, and the fluctuations in the facility to date, the dynamic cap is set quite low and would likely be influenced by one-day declines or surges that seem immaterial as long as the overall cap is not breached.	92	9
201407	1032	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would also prefer to keep the caps simple.	92	9
201407	1033	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	A complicated structure may imply more permanence than necessary.	92	9
201407	1034	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would imagine an initial cap that would be lowered when it becomes clear that the IOER is sufficient to move short-term market rates when that is appropriate.	92	9
201407	1035	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	The key point is that we need to be confident that we can move short-term market interest rates when that is appropriate.	92	9
201407	1036	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	We can scale the reverse repo facility flexibly as we learn more about how rates react to our actions.	92	9
201407	1037	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think the revised principles make clear that this is a temporary facility.	92	9
201407	1038	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Finally, I would not rule out using our balance sheet for financial-stability purposes, which is relevant to President Kocherlakota’s comments.	92	9
201407	1039	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	92	9
201407	1040	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201407	1041	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	92	9
201407	1042	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1043	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Thanks to some helpful memos from the staff and from some other Committee participants, I can be relatively brief on the questions on the table today.	92	9
201407	1044	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	There is one important issue I would like to spend a little time on.	92	9
201407	1045	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I’ll save it for last.	92	9
201407	1046	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	First, I support the general structure of the approach to conducting monetary policy during normalization outlined by the staff, including the directive and the statement.	92	9
201407	1047	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Like President Plosser, I don’t see a need for the proposed delegations of authority to the Chair.	92	9
201407	1048	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	In the past, we have been able to schedule videoconference meetings on very short notice.	92	9
201407	1049	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	And in this instance, the potential need for consultation is fairly predictable, so we might even want to schedule a videoconference in advance for the week after our liftoff announcement.	92	9
201407	1050	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	As for the structure of the overnight reverse repurchase facility, I very much share the concerns expressed eloquently by Governors Tarullo and Powell and President Plosser.	92	9
201407	1051	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I strongly support their proposal for a significantly lower overall cap.	92	9
201407	1052	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I agree with President Rosengren; I don’t believe a surge cap is necessary.	92	9
201407	1053	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	It’s complicated and a bit too fussy.	92	9
201407	1054	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I also support President Kocherlakota’s proposal to issue a public consultation paper.	92	9
201407	1055	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	The implementation of such a facility is clearly as consequential as many other things that we’ve put out for public comment on the grounds that they have an effect on the industrial organization of a particular sector.	92	9
201407	1056	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	And I think there are useful things we could learn from the process, despite all the research that the Desk has done.	92	9
201407	1057	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Regarding the spread between the IOER and the overnight RRP rates, 25 basis points is about the smallest spread I could support, including the option outlined today by the staff of leaving the interest rate on ON RRPs at 5 basis points when we lift off.	92	9
201407	1058	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	If the RP rate doesn’t rise, we can raise IOER within a week or two and limit the egg-on-the-face phenomenon to a relatively short time horizon.	92	9
201407	1059	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Regarding the spread between the IOER and the discount window rate, the rate on primary credit, I question leaving it at 50 basis points.	92	9
201407	1060	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	We haven’t discussed this at all, and we haven’t seen any staff analysis.	92	9
201407	1061	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	We had a fairly thoroughgoing study when we first set the spread at 100 basis points more than a decade ago.	92	9
201407	1062	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I think it deserves more thought, and I think the Committee would benefit from staff analysis of the pros and cons of a spread of 50 basis points versus restoring what I thought we carried around as our view of the normal spread of 100 basis points.	92	9
201407	1063	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	For the most part, I support the new statement of our normalization principles.	92	9
201407	1064	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I particularly support the revisions to the second bullet point that emphasize the possibility that we could withdraw and wind down the program, and that we intend to use it only as a supplementary tool.	92	9
201407	1065	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Finally, I would like to make a few observations about the plans for our holdings of the securities issued by or backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.	92	9
201407	1066	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	There is a tension within the principles as written, and President Plosser raised this question during a Q&A.	92	9
201407	1067	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	In one sub-bullet we state that we don’t intend to sell Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities.	92	9
201407	1068	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	In the second-to- last bullet, we say we want to minimize the effect of reserve holdings on the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy.	92	9
201407	1069	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	And these two, I think, directly conflict.	92	9
201407	1070	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	If we want to minimize credit allocation, we would obviously plan to sell Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities as soon as possible.	92	9
201407	1071	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	You might be wondering what credit allocation looks like.	92	9
201407	1072	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Fortunately, the staff has provided us with quantitative estimates of the effects.	92	9
201407	1073	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	An August 28, 2012, memo reports the estimates of the effects of buying $500 billion of long-term US Treasury securities and compares that with the effects of buying $500 billion in MBS.	92	9
201407	1074	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Buying Treasuries is estimated to lower both mortgage rates and the Treasury term premium by the same amount, 21 basis points.	92	9
201407	1075	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Buying MBS is estimated to lower mortgage rates by more, as you’d expect, 24 basis points, but to lower the term premium by less, only 16 basis points.	92	9
201407	1076	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Combining these estimates implies that by holding MBS rather than Treasuries, we are lowering mortgage rates but raising the term premium on long-term Treasury securities.	92	9
201407	1077	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	For example, if we sold all of our $1.7 trillion in MBS and bought Treasuries with the proceeds, the theoretical effect would be to raise mortgage rates by 10 basis points, but to lower the Treasury term premium by 17 basis points.	92	9
201407	1078	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	And we have been operating on the notion that the Treasury term premium passes through to other people’s borrowing rates, so borrowers outside the housing market are, in essence, paying higher interest rates by 17 basis points as a result of us choosing to hold Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities instead of US Treasuries.	92	9
201407	1079	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Now, there may be reasons for variance.	92	9
201407	1080	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Actual results may not match up with the staff’s estimate, but—	92	9
201407	1081	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Don’t try this at home.	92	9
201407	1082	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	92	9
201407	1083	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	And the staff may have updated the rest of this, but these are the estimates on which we based our decisionmaking in September 2012, when we embarked on the latest purchase program.	92	9
201407	1084	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I think they’re the best we have to go on regarding this effect.	92	9
201407	1085	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	So this is a measure, a 27 basis point twist in relative borrowing rates, that we’re engineering by holding MBS instead of Treasuries alone.	92	9
201407	1086	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Now, you might be tempted to resolve this tension by deleting the clause about minimizing credit allocation, but that’s not the only source of tension.	92	9
201407	1087	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	For several decades now the Committee has had standing guidelines for the conduct of System open market operations in federal agency issues.	92	9
201407	1088	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	They state that “System open market operations in federal agency issues are not designed to support individual sectors of the market or to channel funds into issues of particular agencies.”	92	9
201407	1089	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Now, it’s true that these guidelines were temporarily suspended in January 2009, but we did not abolish them, and they’re still on the Board’s website.	92	9
201407	1090	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Moreover, these guidelines have deep roots in Federal Reserve history.	92	9
201407	1091	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	They were first adopted in August 1971, a few years after Congress passed legislation authorizing Federal Reserve purchases of federal agency securities.	92	9
201407	1092	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	They did that with the intent to allow the Fed to buy the obligations of Fannie Mae and Federal Home Loan Banks to support the housing market.	92	9
201407	1093	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	The Board did not want to buy agency securities, and the FOMC initially instructed the Desk to just test doing repos in agency securities but to hold off making outright purchases.	92	9
201407	1094	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	But Congress repeatedly pressured the Fed to use its authority to make outright purchases and had some very contentious hearings on the subject.	92	9
201407	1095	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Senator Proxmire explicitly threatened legislation to reduce the Fed’s independence.	92	9
201407	1096	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	For a time the Fed resisted.	92	9
201407	1097	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Chairman William McChesney Martin testified that to have any effect on mortgage rates, the Fed would necessarily have to restrict credit to other sectors of the economy, such as state and local governments and business borrowers, consistent with our staff’s 2012 estimate.	92	9
201407	1098	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	He said that it would “violate a fundamental principle of sound monetary policy in that it would attempt to use credit-creating powers of the Central Bank to subsidize programs benefiting special sectors of the economy.”	92	9
201407	1099	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Arthur Burns wrote in a similar context, “Decisions as to social priorities in the use of credit are inherently political in character.	92	9
201407	1100	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	If such decisions are to be made at all, they should be made by the Congress, not by an administrative and nonpolitical body such as the Federal Reserve.	92	9
201407	1101	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	After all, tilting credit in favor of some borrowers implies denying credit to someone else.”	92	9
201407	1102	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	The most problematic source of tension surrounding our MBS holdings, however, is the March 2009 joint statement by the Department of Treasury and the Federal Reserve, titled “The Role of the Federal Reserve in Preserving Financial and Monetary Stability.”	92	9
201407	1103	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	The second point in that document states, “Actions taken by the Federal Reserve should also aim to improve financial or credit conditions broadly, not to allocate credit to narrowly defined sectors or classes of borrowers.	92	9
201407	1104	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Government decisions to influence the allocation of credit are the province of fiscal authorities.”	92	9
201407	1105	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	So here we are, quite clearly engaged in credit allocation.	92	9
201407	1106	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Our holdings of Fannie and Freddie securities are lowering mortgage rates by 10 basis points and raising borrowing costs outside the home mortgage arena by 17 basis points, and yet the official policy of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury is that influencing the allocation of credit is the province of fiscal authorities and not the Federal Reserve.	92	9
201407	1107	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I don’t see how to reconcile these two.	92	9
201407	1108	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I don’t see how we can justify deciding on our very own that more housing activity and less business investment would be a good thing.	92	9
201407	1109	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I don’t think we can claim we are ameliorating a dysfunctional market for mortgage-backed securities, as we might have plausibly claimed at the end of 2008.	92	9
201407	1110	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I don’t see us arguing that we should hold onto Fannie and Freddie securities to avoid realizing capital losses and impairing our remittances to Treasury.	92	9
201407	1111	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I also don’t see how to ignore the political risks associated with continuing to hold Fannie and Freddie securities indefinitely.	92	9
201407	1112	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	The longer we hold them, the longer the door is open to what I think are mischievous efforts to involve us more deeply or permanently in housing finance.	92	9
201407	1113	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	GSE legislation came close to passing in the Senate earlier this year, and it failed because of an apparent inability to bridge the gap between the desire of affordable housing advocates for more resources and the desire of others to limit the resources extracted from the housing finance sector for that purpose.	92	9
201407	1114	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	It seems plausible to me that some bright minds on the Hill will turn to the Fed’s balance sheet to attempt to bridge that gap.	92	9
201407	1115	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	After all, our balance sheet has been raided in the past to provide ersatz solutions to fiscal problems.	92	9
201407	1116	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	So I continue to believe it’s a mistake for us to buy and hold securities issued by or backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.	92	9
201407	1117	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I recognize I may be out of step with the brave new world of central bank activism.	92	9
201407	1118	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I recognize that our long journey into housing finance is less troublesome to many of the participants in this Committee, but from a broader historical perspective, this strikes me as an important component of our deliberations today, one that deserves careful thought.	92	9
201407	1119	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Should we continue along the path we seem to be on, of holding Fannie and Freddie securities to maturity, I believe some public explanation of our stance on credit allocation is necessary.	92	9
201407	1120	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1121	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201407	1122	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	92	9
201407	1123	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1124	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	In case it proves controversial later, I’d like to start by saying at the outset that I agree with the Chair that it’s unwise and premature to try to make a firm decision today on the precise numerical parameters of the facility.	92	9
201407	1125	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	At the September meeting the Chair can set forth the draft normalization principles that we finalize and release.	92	9
201407	1126	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	She can discuss them at the press conference.	92	9
201407	1127	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	She can describe the facility as narrow in purpose, scope, and time.	92	9
201407	1128	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	She can say that there will be appropriate size limitations in place, including aggregate and surge caps if appropriate, and that in finalizing those restrictions before liftoff, we’re all going to be informed by testing results and use patterns that we observe and analyze over the coming months.	92	9
201407	1129	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	So just to underscore that point.	92	9
201407	1130	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	If you ignore the quarter ends and look at the use patterns so far, we had a spike in April and May to the $200 billion range, really because of cash flow coming into Treasury and, therefore, bill supply decline.	92	9
201407	1131	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Other than that, usage has been in the $100 billion to $150 billion range.	92	9
201407	1132	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	And maybe those levels will rise between now and liftoff.	92	9
201407	1133	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	We don’t know that.	92	9
201407	1134	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	But if we try to make a decision today, it stands a big chance of being off by quite a bit, and therefore, the incentive is to guess high so as to avoid weakening monetary control—for example, by having a $500 billion overall cap, which is so much higher than these other levels.	92	9
201407	1135	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	By next spring or summer when it’s time for liftoff, the Committee will have a much longer period of data that’s been observed when we are trying to set these levels.	92	9
201407	1136	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Let me turn to the four questions in the appendix to the memo that we’re asked to respond to.	92	9
201407	1137	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	On the first one, I do support the approach to conducting monetary policy during normalization that is described in the memo, and I would also favor giving the Chair limited discretion to make adjustments to IOER and ON RRP rates in order to keep the federal funds rate within the range set by the FOMC.	92	9
201407	1138	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I am a little less enthusiastic about giving the Chair intermeeting discretion to increase the aggregate or surge caps, as that would risk sending a signal that the facility is designed to expand; I guess I would support that discretion, but prefer that it be used only as necessary.	92	9
201407	1139	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Second, I find the draft postmeeting statement broadly acceptable for governing and communicating policy during normalization.	92	9
201407	1140	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	And, third, I also support the draft set of normalization principles set forth as appendix 3, and I think the level and specificity of information are about right.	92	9
201407	1141	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I am also okay with the alternative version, which divides into principles and tactics.	92	9
201407	1142	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Coming back to the overnight RRP just for a moment, I support its overall design but have suggested a number of changes, which are set forth in the comments that Governor Tarullo and I submitted before the meeting.	92	9
201407	1143	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I see the ON RRP exclusively as a monetary policy tool to be deployed as long as needed to provide a floor for the target range for the federal funds rate.	92	9
201407	1144	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I like the 25 basis point range.	92	9
201407	1145	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	That makes sense to me as an appropriate level of control, and while it might be okay to tolerate a little deviation from that, I would tend to want to see it in that range.	92	9
201407	1146	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Without going through the whole memo, let me just say that the facility raises serious financial-stability concerns and related concerns about unpredictable effects on industry structure.	92	9
201407	1147	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	At the same time, it is very important, in my view, to demonstrate convincing monetary control at the outset, and for me, that would mean I would want the ON RRP to be used at liftoff to help assure control.	92	9
201407	1148	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I will also say that the sentence that’s been added to the policy normalization principles about phasing out the facility is a very helpful one.	92	9
201407	1149	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I want to emphasize one aspect of why, to me, the financial-stability problem—and it has been said by many around the table, and I think it’s right, that the caps would come under pressure during a financial stress event.	92	9
201407	1150	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I do think that’s right.	92	9
201407	1151	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	But it just seems really unlikely to me that that would ever be a good idea.	92	9
201407	1152	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	It’s one thing to offer liquidity in a crisis.	92	9
201407	1153	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	It’s entirely another thing to invite it to come onto our balance sheet.	92	9
201407	1154	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	So any sense in the market that there is a home here at all, that there is capacity that will be enlarged, is itself potentially very, very destabilizing.	92	9
201407	1155	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	And I think that the Committee needs to lean hard, really, against the perception that that could be the case.	92	9
201407	1156	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I won’t go through all of the details, but again, I would support reducing the caps.	92	9
201407	1157	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	If I had to make these decisions today—and fortunately, we don’t—I would reduce the aggregate cap to $300 billion and reduce the surge cap to $50 billion.	92	9
201407	1158	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I don’t see any public purpose to be served in facilitating quarter-end window dressing.	92	9
201407	1159	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I also think there are some benefits in having a cap that does bind with reasonable frequency, although I wouldn’t want it to bind much at the outset as we’re lifting off.	92	9
201407	1160	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Those benefits would include sending a signal that hitting the cap is not a big stress event.	92	9
201407	1161	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	In addition, it would acquaint market participants with how the mechanics of allocation will work, and it would send a signal that the Committee’s intent is not to seek or accommodate significantly higher levels of demand over time.	92	9
201407	1162	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I think changing the window from 5 to 10 days would limit the growth in the facility in times of stress without materially changing its operation in ordinary times.	92	9
201407	1163	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	In terms of adding new counterparties, I guess I would prefer to defer that question until the September meeting when we set forth our principles so that we’re sending the clear signal of limited time and scope for the facility.	92	9
201407	1164	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Finally, I would offer this.	92	9
201407	1165	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I share many of the same concerns that President Kocherlakota has, but I am skeptical of the idea of engaging in any kind of public consultation process.	92	9
201407	1166	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I do like the idea of getting input from the public, and that has been ongoing, but not in a formal consultation process.	92	9
201407	1167	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I do think that the facility as we’re now talking about proposing it, and the language we’re talking about including, would make it much less of a target in any event, but I think this is actually quite a dangerous precedent and a Rubicon that we’re crossing here.	92	9
201407	1168	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	It’s inviting political actors into our business, and I think that the risks of it would outweigh any potential benefits.	92	9
201407	1169	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1170	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201407	1171	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	92	9
201407	1172	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1173	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	First, I want to say that the discussion at the last meeting and the meeting before that—in my 10 years here, these have been the most interactive and interesting and challenging discussions we have had.	92	9
201407	1174	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I actually went back and read the entire transcript from the last meeting.	92	9
201407	1175	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I stayed awake for most of it [laughter] and so I want to start there because you made some key points that condition this discussion today.	92	9
201407	1176	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	First, you mentioned that “there is a general desire to preserve trading activity in the federal funds market,” and that second, to paraphrase the June transcript, in the range of uncertainties and concerns about the overnight RRP facility, there was a desire to keep that facility modest.	92	9
201407	1177	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	You also highlighted the need to decide how to limit the financial-stability risks associated with the overnight RRP facility.	92	9
201407	1178	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	And also at the June meeting, you said we need to decide on our reinvestment strategy.	92	9
201407	1179	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I’m going to come back to that.	92	9
201407	1180	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I want to comment on ON RRP—it is so hard to say “ON RRP,” so I just thought “on RIP and go”—and our reinvestment strategy.	92	9
201407	1181	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I’m also going to comment a little bit on MBS, but not to the same extent as my colleague from Richmond.	92	9
201407	1182	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	At the last meeting I said that I had concerns about the ON RRP proposal.	92	9
201407	1183	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I worried aloud about the expansion of counterparties, what I called at the time “the more the merrier” approach, and I suggested that we ought to have a clear and principled dividing line between those with access to the facility and those without; that without a dividing line, this facility could “grow like Topsy”	92	9
201407	1184	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	—I’m quoting myself here—and maybe grow out of control.	92	9
201407	1185	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	And I said I was struggling with what the order of dimension would be like.	92	9
201407	1186	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I said that we might create something, if we’re not careful, that puts us in the place of being too much a part of the market.	92	9
201407	1187	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Governor Powell just referred to this.	92	9
201407	1188	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	We can delay that discussion until later, but I still maintain that sentiment.	92	9
201407	1189	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Unspoken but implied was my concern that the ON RRP facility could exacerbate liquidity movements, particularly in times of market stress.	92	9
201407	1190	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Now, before Governor Tarullo’s and Governor Powell’s memo, which I’ll come back to in a minute, I sent a note to you and to Mr English repeating a sentiment that I expressed at that meeting.	92	9
201407	1191	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I suggested that we make it definitive and clear that we’re not planning to rely heavily upon this tool, and I suggested alternative language to that draft, which was then appendix 3 and is now appendix 4 of the normalization memo—to wit, that the sentence under the then fourth and now third sub-point should read that “the Federal Reserve will use overnight repurchase agreement operations as a supplement and contingent tool only as needed to keep the federal funds rate in the target range.”	92	9
201407	1192	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I was very pleased to see Governor Tarullo’s and Governor Powell’s more specific suggestion sent out that same evening.	92	9
201407	1193	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I fully endorse their recommendations.	92	9
201407	1194	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I want that on the record, and I think as you just went through this, we’re not going to get into that now, but I think it is important that we reduce the aggregate spending and surge caps; that we allow periodic binding of the caps; that we include a single counterparty cap.	92	9
201407	1195	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I like the idea of changing the surge range to 10 days and that we tread—and I thought this was a very important point—we tread very carefully in sending unintended signals through the testing of the facility.	92	9
201407	1196	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I think the important thing that was crystallized by the Tarullo–Powell memo, or any other approach we take, is that we convey unambiguously that the ON RRP facility is only a backstop, that the scale will be modest.	92	9
201407	1197	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	It will be carefully allocated so as to prevent abuse, but at all costs, it will do nothing to precipitate runs or financial instability.	92	9
201407	1198	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	With regard to the revised statements that we got last night and the further revision today—there’s one word that’s revised in what we got this morning from last night, changing the word “the” to “it”—but I would just add that the ON RRP facility is still explicitly referenced, of course, but it’s more clearly intended to be a subsidiary to the IOER, as I read it, as a tool for influencing the funds rate.	92	9
201407	1199	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I am comfortable with that.	92	9
201407	1200	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	In the second sub-bullet under the second bullet, I would feel more comfortable if there was explicit reference to the FOMC and not just to the Federal Reserve.	92	9
201407	1201	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I can envision changing the wording to say, “From that point on during the normalization period, the Federal Reserve intends to adjust monetary policy primarily by changing the interest rate it pays on excess reserve balances in order to achieve the target range for the fed funds rate set by the FOMC.”	92	9
201407	1202	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I may be a little paranoid about this.	92	9
201407	1203	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Someone mentioned 10 years or 20 years, a long time period, but we will have a different set of policymakers, as you mentioned, and I think it is best to avoid any ambiguity about the role of the FOMC and to always underscore the primacy of the FOMC.	92	9
201407	1204	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	So just adding those words at the end, I think that would be helpful.	92	9
201407	1205	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	With regard to the 25 basis point spread, I feel most comfortable with that.	92	9
201407	1206	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	And then I want to address the governance question, which others have raised, and I say this with great respect.	92	9
201407	1207	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I am uncomfortable in giving the Chair—and, again, we have to think of the very long term here, and this has nothing to do with you as the Chair—intermeeting discretion with regard to the IOER rate and the surge caps.	92	9
201407	1208	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	The IOER rate will be the main tool for implementing the regularly scheduled funds rate decision in the Federal Open Market Committee.	92	9
201407	1209	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Smooth governance hinges on there being a mechanical link between the FOMC’s fund rate decisions and the IOER rate.	92	9
201407	1210	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	And as I said earlier, I want to maintain the primacy of the FOMC.	92	9
201407	1211	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I really think we can deal with short-term problems, intermeeting problems, either by conference call or by having it clear that we let the Desk perhaps deal with some short-term perturbations.	92	9
201407	1212	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Now, as to reinvestment policy, this is something I articulated in my speech on July 16, but was not reprinted in the Wall Street Journal on Monday.	92	9
201407	1213	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I realize I’m in a very distinct minority on this front, although the idea came to me from President Rosengren from Boston, and that is I still think it would be a best first step to normalization to gradually taper reinvestment, including MBS, before raising rates.	92	9
201407	1214	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I am still definitely at one end of the range of views on this.	92	9
201407	1215	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Again, I’m in a distinct minority.	92	9
201407	1216	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	But at a minimum, if the majority of the Committee wishes to cease reinvestment only after liftoff, then I would suggest tighter wording than the current sentences we received this morning.	92	9
201407	1217	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I have particular concern about the phrase “at some point.”	92	9
201407	1218	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	To me, that provides too much room for equivocation.	92	9
201407	1219	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	At a minimum, I would suggest that the first bullet point— wherever it is, first, second, wherever it is now in the new order—read that “the Committee expects to cease or reduce reinvestments shortly after it begins increasing the target range for the federal funds rate.”	92	9
201407	1220	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	By in saying “at some point” we’re just leaving the door wide open; I don’t think it provides any kind of guidance, and I am uncomfortable with it.	92	9
201407	1221	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	And then the last point on mortgage-backed securities, the third subsidiary bullet point, I don’t accept the idea that we should not sell MBS under any conditions.	92	9
201407	1222	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Let’s say the market is suddenly robust for housing in 2017 or 2018, more robust than the Committee expects.	92	9
201407	1223	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Why wouldn’t we consider it?	92	9
201407	1224	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I think that sentence could be edited without losing its underlying meaning and reassurance by saying, “The Committee does not intend to sell mortgage-backed securities to normalize its security holdings unless the housing market becomes more robust than currently envisioned and market conditions for mortgage-backed securities can accommodate sales without disruption.”	92	9
201407	1225	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Now, I am not as far over as President Lacker on this subject matter.	92	9
201407	1226	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I love President Lacker, and I mean that in a manly way.	92	9
201407	1227	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I’m not as far over as he is on a lot of things, but on that one I think he has a point, but that’s not the point I want to make here.	92	9
201407	1228	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Let’s assume that the market is robust and conditions get out of hand.	92	9
201407	1229	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	We’re talking several years hence.	92	9
201407	1230	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	To say that we’ll never sell mortgage-backed securities doesn’t make sense to me.	92	9
201407	1231	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I would like to apply a condition and simply say that we do not envision doing so, but if it becomes robust and market conditions for mortgage-backed securities can accommodate sales without disruption—I think that would be a nice addition to that sentence.	92	9
201407	1232	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1233	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201407	1234	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we have President Williams and then we’ll take a break for lunch?	92	9
201407	1235	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have a very lengthy statement.	92	9
201407	1236	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1237	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	92	9
201407	1238	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think we actually have made a great deal of progress on these issues over the past few months, and I think we have really benefited from some exceptional help from the memos and the presentations from the Board and the New York staff.	92	9
201407	1239	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	My main point today is to answer the first question that was asked, and that is that I wholeheartedly endorse the outlined normalization approach of communicating the quarter point range for the federal funds rate with the IOER as our primary tool, and the overnight reverse repo facility playing a supplementary role in that.	92	9
201407	1240	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think this appropriately balances the pursuits of monetary control, clear communication, and financial stability.	92	9
201407	1241	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	And importantly, the outlined approach does retain quite a bit of flexibility so that we can evolve our framework as we learn along the way.	92	9
201407	1242	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, my answers to the other questions are going to follow from the same general principles that we need to balance monetary control, clear communications, and financial stability while retaining this tactical flexibility.	92	9
201407	1243	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of question 1.a., I do support giving the Chair authority to make modest intermeeting adjustments during the normalization process, modest changes in the administered rates.	92	9
201407	1244	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	The repo quantity limits are properly viewed as technical adjustments to support achieving the Committee’s desired range for the federal funds rate.	92	9
201407	1245	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Giving the Chair the authority to make such minor adjustments in the transition period is straightforward to communicate and should be widely viewed as dealing with back-office operational issues.	92	9
201407	1246	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	For question 2, the draft statement and directive are excellent models of how to communicate our policy stance and make clear that we are focused on using the familiar federal funds rate to pursue our monetary objectives and using the administered IOER or overnight reverse repo rates to support a desired federal funds rate outcome.	92	9
201407	1247	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of question 3, I favor the new reorganized, revised potential policy normalization principles and strategy approach that is in exhibit 5 of the handout.	92	9
201407	1248	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	It appropriately focuses on strategy and not on operational details.	92	9
201407	1249	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do have a question about what the title should be, given that the title says “Principles and Strategy” while the document says “principles ... and ... tactics.”	92	9
201407	1250	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I think it does have the right mix.	92	9
201407	1251	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s the principles and really the strategy, without getting into the specifics of numbers and all of those issues that we can clarify later.	92	9
201407	1252	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	It communicates clearly that our goal is to best achieve our dual mandate, and then lays out a clear strategy of how to accomplish that goal.	92	9
201407	1253	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	And regarding this suggestion to eliminate any reference to the overnight reverse repo facility, that does seem to run counter to our goals of transparency and clarity.	92	9
201407	1254	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	The statement already makes clear—and the revised statement, I think, does a good job of this—it makes clear that the repo facility is in a distinctly supporting role, and that it will be phased out as soon as it is no longer needed.	92	9
201407	1255	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Importantly, the set of principles is sufficiently flexible.	92	9
201407	1256	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	It allows us to learn and adjust along the way, and I think we should start with a 25 basis point spread between the IOER and overnight reverse repo rates.	92	9
201407	1257	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	If that is too much or too little to achieve monetary control, as we have been discussing quite a bit this morning, we can make adjustments.	92	9
201407	1258	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	And as we learn how our tools work in controlling the federal funds market, we can narrow the announced range for the federal funds rate.	92	9
201407	1259	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do want to emphasize something.	92	9
201407	1260	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I was in support of a federal funds target range, a 25 basis point range in terms of our target.	92	9
201407	1261	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	That is basically just the reality, that in the current environment it is probably going to be very difficult to—or be impossible, maybe, to control the federal funds rate at a point target as we have done in the past.	92	9
201407	1262	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t think it would be advisable to go to a 50 basis point range or looser view of what our target is.	92	9
201407	1263	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think there’s a governance issue here, too.	92	9
201407	1264	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	The FOMC is making a policy decision.	92	9
201407	1265	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	We want a federal funds rate or short-term market rates trading in a certain area, and we definitely want to have the tools that allow us to achieve that goal.	92	9
201407	1266	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Finally, question 4, the design of the reverse repo facility should, for the most part, allow it to supplement the IOER rate in achieving monetary control while having adequate safeguards to preserve financial stability.	92	9
201407	1267	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	And again, I think the 25 basis point spread is a good place to begin, because just the economics of it will limit the desired take-up.	92	9
201407	1268	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, some caps on take-up also seem appropriate.	92	9
201407	1269	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with the points that Governors Powell and Tarullo made in their memo.	92	9
201407	1270	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Like some others who have spoken already, I don’t actually see the need or see that much benefit from the surge caps or the dynamic caps.	92	9
201407	1271	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think the overall cap achieves that goal.	92	9
201407	1272	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I recognize that others do like the belt-and-suspenders approach that the Federal Reserve prefers, and having a combination of dynamic and static caps seems to be a reasonable compromise between the need for monetary control and clear communication on the one hand and concerns around market functioning and financial stability on the other.	92	9
201407	1273	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of aggregate limits, it was unclear to me whether $500 billion was the right number in the beginning.	92	9
201407	1274	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think we do need more staff analysis to quantify these tradeoffs.	92	9
201407	1275	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	But it’s really going to be the real-world experience, I think, that is going to help us understand that.	92	9
201407	1276	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	And given the concerns about the potential size of the facility, again expressed by Governors Tarullo and Powell, it may make sense to start with somewhat lower caps than the $500 billion, that bind only occasionally.	92	9
201407	1277	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	We can revisit these decisions later.	92	9
201407	1278	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	That said, I don’t think it would be wise to lower the caps too far or to jettison the overnight reverse repo entirely, since that could materially interfere with control of the federal funds rate.	92	9
201407	1279	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I want to talk just very briefly, but I think this is an important issue.	92	9
201407	1280	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	There are a number of commentators out there actively saying that the Federal Reserve cannot control interest rates with the $4½ trillion balance sheet.	92	9
201407	1281	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is not just a theoretical exercise.	92	9
201407	1282	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is a view that is expressed regularly out there, that we don’t have the ability to do that.	92	9
201407	1283	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	We can say we do, but I think an important part of this normalization statement is not only to state that we know how to do it, but to demonstrate how we are going to do it in a way that works from day one.	92	9
201407	1284	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that is actually very important for confidence in the Federal Reserve, it’s very important for our credibility, but it is also very important for our ability to conduct monetary policy as appropriate for our monetary policy objectives.	92	9
201407	1285	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I think that the ON RRP provides a useful tool to not only assure ourselves that we actually have the tools to conduct monetary policy the way we need to, but also to assure the public that we have the tools.	92	9
201407	1286	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, I think it’s very important that as we go out the gate that we don’t stumble, because although you can easily sit here today and say, “Well, we can figure it out over the next couple of weeks,”	92	9
201407	1287	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do think that it would play to an already expressed view that the Federal Reserve doesn’t have the capability to control monetary policy.	92	9
201407	1288	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Regarding the idea of adding counterparty caps as well, I have to say that I already view this as a bit of a Rube Goldberg contraption, and with the dynamic caps, the static caps, all of the mathematics underneath that, I don’t think that we really need to be adding individual counterparty caps, or that maintaining the ones we have is necessary.	92	9
201407	1289	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	It likely would add to confusion and uncertainty.	92	9
201407	1290	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, again, it comes at some potential cost in terms of monetary control.	92	9
201407	1291	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that the aggregate caps are all that we really need.	92	9
201407	1292	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of testing, I think that of course it is important that we thoughtfully and thoroughly test the caps that we plan to use in an appropriate time and in an appropriate way.	92	9
201407	1293	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with the comments that we don’t want to allow the testing to confuse or drive market participants to come to wrong conclusions.	92	9
201407	1294	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, still, we do want to have a good understanding of how this will actually work.	92	9
201407	1295	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	92	9
201407	1296	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	And then, I guess we get to eat lunch.	92	9
201407	1297	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I think we can eat.	92	9
201407	1298	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	92	9
201407	1299	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	So why don’t we take a half-hour break for lunch and come back—you know, when people are mainly finished, we’ll start up again.	92	9
201407	1300	2014-07-30	meeting		[Lunch break]	92	9
201407	1301	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I think we are ready to resume.	92	9
201407	1302	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Let me turn next to President Plosser.	92	9
201407	1303	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1304	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	It is great to be first after lunch.	92	9
201407	1305	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Everybody can put on their snoozing caps [laughter] for the next few minutes, take a little nap.	92	9
201407	1306	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	But anyway, I, too, want to thank the staff for an excellent set of memos on normalization.	92	9
201407	1307	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think this is the second meeting in which we have had excellent discussions, and I also want to thank the Chair for the opportunity this morning of having such a robust interactive discussion.	92	9
201407	1308	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think it was really quite productive, and I have benefited from that.	92	9
201407	1309	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I support a number of the features enumerated in the staff memos, and I disagree with some of the particulars.	92	9
201407	1310	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	For instance, I agree that using a range for the effective funds rate to communicate the stance of policy is the way policy should be conducted and communicated.	92	9
201407	1311	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I also agree that the primary tool for adjusting the funds rate should be changes in the IOER, at least until such a time that a smaller balance sheet allows us to return to a corridor system, and thus the targeted funds rate could be above IOER, which is something I have long advocated.	92	9
201407	1312	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I am less enthusiastic about a large role for the “on rip” or ON RRP or whatever—maybe it should be “ripoff,”	92	9
201407	1313	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m not exactly sure.	92	9
201407	1314	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	In any event, I would prefer not using it at all, if possible, and that there be no specific reference to it in the statement of principles.	92	9
201407	1315	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	We should simply refer to “other supplementary tools.”	92	9
201407	1316	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Many around this table have expressed reservations about this facility, and I share many of those concerns.	92	9
201407	1317	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Others believe that the facility could be useful if managed properly.	92	9
201407	1318	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I have doubts about managing it properly.	92	9
201407	1319	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I am greatly concerned about unintended consequences of such large interventions as anticipated.	92	9
201407	1320	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	However, if the facility is used, I’d prefer a much larger spread between the IOER and the ON RRP rates—say, 50 basis points—with a much lower overall limit and a cap of, say, $250 billion to $300 billion.	92	9
201407	1321	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Initially, I recommend we lift off without the use of the ON RRP facility.	92	9
201407	1322	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	We leave it where it is, go ahead and lift off.	92	9
201407	1323	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	This will allow us to test how effective the IOER is on its own at lifting rates.	92	9
201407	1324	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	If we’re unhappy with that outcome, then we could gradually increase the scale and operation of the ON RRP to begin closing the gap and narrowing the spread between the effective funds rate and IOER.	92	9
201407	1325	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	And it would be good if we could even shrink that spread gradually.	92	9
201407	1326	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	My own view is that I would be willing to tolerate more volatility and a bigger range for the funds rate than some around the table.	92	9
201407	1327	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	And I think we could do so and communicate it effectively if we are willing to, in fact, talk about that—that here is what we anticipate, here is the volatility that we anticipate.	92	9
201407	1328	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think that would serve to mitigate claims that we can’t control rates.	92	9
201407	1329	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	But if we start off with a rather wider range, I think we can mitigate some of those communication concerns.	92	9
201407	1330	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	In any event, by only gradually introducing the facility over time, we also could learn a great deal about the sensitivity of the federal funds rate to the size and scale of the ON RRP program, and so forth.	92	9
201407	1331	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Further, as I said in my memo that I circulated before the meeting, I believe the overnight reverse repo market facility should be viewed as temporary and shelved when it is no longer needed.	92	9
201407	1332	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The revised principles make this point very clearly, and I support that.	92	9
201407	1333	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	But I think it is easier said than done.	92	9
201407	1334	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	One of the things I worry about is that whatever particulars that we do have—for example, the spread, the cap, the size, the number of counterparties—will influence our ability to shelve the program.	92	9
201407	1335	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	That leads me to a preference to see us limit the counterparties rather than expand them, and make the caps smaller to keep the program of a small size, because as it expands and the counterparties grow, it will be harder and harder, I think, for us to convince ourselves to pull out of such a very large intervention and scale of operations.	92	9
201407	1336	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think at the last meeting we talked a little bit about the possibility of limiting, for example, accessibility to government-only money market funds rather than all money market funds.	92	9
201407	1337	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	There may be dimensions like that which we should think about—limiting the number of counterparties.	92	9
201407	1338	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	At a minimum, I don’t think we should do anything about our counterparties today until we have more discussion about this.	92	9
201407	1339	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Regarding the dynamic caps, I don’t see a lot of reason for them.	92	9
201407	1340	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m not too concerned about the volatility on odd days, and I think we could over-engineer this process if we are not careful, again making it more difficult to shelve when the time comes.	92	9
201407	1341	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The degree of interest rate control that was the primary concern in the memos was of the day-to-day variety and seeking to prevent volatility on certain days of the year, like quarter-end.	92	9
201407	1342	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	That kind of volatility has always existed in these markets.	92	9
201407	1343	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	It is not a new volatility, and I don’t see a particular concern for the conduct of monetary policy on those two or three days of the year.	92	9
201407	1344	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	In addition, we have so little knowledge of what it would take to keep the intraday effective funds rate trading within its target range, that I am reluctant, at least initially, to cede authority to the Chair to make intermeeting adjustments in the IOER or ON RRP rates, or caps.	92	9
201407	1345	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Altering the trading range of these rates could involve decisions reflecting a menu of choices, and I think that at least early on they should be made by the FOMC, if changes were deemed necessary.	92	9
201407	1346	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	And the question is partly, at what level do you begin to decide whether an intermeeting call is actually even necessary?	92	9
201407	1347	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Maybe we should just wait until the meeting.	92	9
201407	1348	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	But, again, if it’s deemed necessary for some reason.	92	9
201407	1349	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	As we learn more about how the federal funds rate reacts to changes in the IOER, I can see giving the Chair some authority on certain aspects of that, or perhaps the ON RRP rate, with limits during intermeeting periods, if we were more comfortable and we had learned more about how it was going to work.	92	9
201407	1350	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I have a few other concerns about the treatment of the balance sheet and the principles, as I alluded to earlier.	92	9
201407	1351	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	First, I believe that we should start shrinking the balance sheet sooner rather than later.	92	9
201407	1352	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Delay seems to accomplish very little in my mind, yet it will likely force us to raise rates higher and faster than we otherwise would choose to do under a smaller balance sheet.	92	9
201407	1353	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	At a minimum, I think we should remove the word “gradual” from the description of the path of the balance sheet, as we may find that constraining at some point.	92	9
201407	1354	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The second part of that—in announcing we will not sell MBS, we prolong our credit allocation policy and favor housing credit at the expense of other sectors, as President Lacker’s comments so clearly enunciated.	92	9
201407	1355	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I would also add to that, though, that we also don’t know how the world is going to unfold.	92	9
201407	1356	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	We may find it appropriate and desirable to sell MBS at some point.	92	9
201407	1357	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I don’t think it is wise to make such blanket, unconditional statements about our future policies.	92	9
201407	1358	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	President Rosengren suggested that he didn’t like hardwired numbers in a set of principles.	92	9
201407	1359	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Well, zero is a hardwired number, and I’m pretty uncomfortable with that as a statement of principle.	92	9
201407	1360	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Those are my remarks, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1361	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m done.	92	9
201407	1362	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you.	92	9
201407	1363	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201407	1364	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	92	9
201407	1365	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1366	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	First, my compliments, too, to the staff for their outstanding work in preparing us for this discussion.	92	9
201407	1367	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I’ve come to the view at this point in our deliberations on normalization that the wisest posture is to limit the role of the overnight reverse repo tool as much as possible.	92	9
201407	1368	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	That puts me in sympathy with the thrust of the broad concerns expressed by Governors Tarullo and Powell in their memo, President Plosser in his memo and his remarks, and the concern of President Kocherlakota in his memo.	92	9
201407	1369	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Considering what I know now, I am comfortable with a limited and possibly transitional role for an overnight reverse repo facility, but I’m not comfortable with the prospect of a major, permanent, and institutionalized element of the short-term money markets and monetary control architecture.	92	9
201407	1370	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	To the extent that we’re firming up today, and in the near future, our thinking about the preferred approach, I favor a phased approach to implementation of an overnight reverse repo tool.	92	9
201407	1371	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I prefer starting with an increase of the IOER rate and the federal funds rate range while holding the overnight reverse repo rate at or near current levels to see if IOER is strong enough to do the job.	92	9
201407	1372	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I am not yet convinced that IOER will not work.	92	9
201407	1373	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	In reality, we won’t know for sure until we start to execute, and we’ll be learning by doing.	92	9
201407	1374	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I acknowledge that the Committee’s credibility may be put in the balance by opting for measured escalation, but at this point, my sense is that a situation involving some trial and error can be managed.	92	9
201407	1375	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Now I’ll respond to the questions.	92	9
201407	1376	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I’ll start with question 3, on principles.	92	9
201407	1377	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	For the most part, I think the revised draft of normalization principles is workable for September dissemination.	92	9
201407	1378	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	As I said a moment ago, at the outset, I prefer that the heavy use of an overnight reverse repo facility be positioned as conditioned on necessity.	92	9
201407	1379	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Prior to the recent revisions, I was going to propose one change in the wording to downplay reliance on the overnight reverse repo tool.	92	9
201407	1380	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I wanted “if needed” inserted in the sentence on the tool, along with reference to other tools.	92	9
201407	1381	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Mission accomplished, without even resorting rhetorically to some suggestion of that.	92	9
201407	1382	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Telepathic.	92	9
201407	1383	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you.	92	9
201407	1384	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Though I am satisfied on that point, I think the statement may go too far by laying down the principle that the overnight reverse repo facility will be phased out as soon as it is not needed for this purpose.	92	9
201407	1385	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I don’t see the need to lock ourselves in to this degree.	92	9
201407	1386	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I’d prefer to maintain some optionality.	92	9
201407	1387	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I like the clean presentation of the reorganized version that distinguishes between principles and tactics.	92	9
201407	1388	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Under tactics, in the bullet point on normalization of the size and composition of the portfolio, if this statement is interpreted as taking asset sales off the table, I would try to avoid that interpretation.	92	9
201407	1389	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I would suggest that the word “mostly” could be substituted for “primarily” to avoid this interpretation.	92	9
201407	1390	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	On the first question on approach, I think the approach described in the memo is a good starting point for the Committee’s decisionmaking as we get closer to actual liftoff.	92	9
201407	1391	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	That said, I have concerns about immediate implementation at liftoff, as I’ve already said, of a $500 billion facility priced at 25 basis points.	92	9
201407	1392	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I think we should consider the option of not raising the overnight reverse repo rate for the first move.	92	9
201407	1393	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I believe President Lacker proposed this at an earlier meeting.	92	9
201407	1394	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Such an approach would imply, based on current reverse repo transactions, a starting spread to IOER of about 40 basis points versus the 50 basis points that President Plosser suggested.	92	9
201407	1395	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	By initially holding the overnight reverse repo rate at its current level or close to that, we can see if the IOER increase alone has the hoped-for effect.	92	9
201407	1396	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Apparently I have more confidence than others that IOER will work to raise the effective federal funds rate.	92	9
201407	1397	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	If IOER proves insufficient, the Committee or the Chair can walk the overnight reverse repo rate up based on assessment of timing requirements.	92	9
201407	1398	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	On the question of giving the Chair authority to make intermeeting period adjustments to IOER and overnight reverse repo rates as well as daily circuit breaker caps and an overall limit on take-up, I have no problem with tactical adjustments made at the discretion of the Chair to address intermittent, sporadic issues in the federal funds market.	92	9
201407	1399	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	If we experience persistent and material failures to maintain the funds rate within the target range, we would have deeper issues to address as a Committee, in my opinion.	92	9
201407	1400	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Finally, I’ll conclude with some comments on further testing.	92	9
201407	1401	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I think the Desk should proceed to test the auction mechanism at a lower cap chosen specifically for that purpose.	92	9
201407	1402	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	But more generally my thinking is the Desk should design and come back to the Committee with tests in the spirit of moving the program to a point of operational readiness as a contingent tool.	92	9
201407	1403	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	This may fall short of the complete readiness and comprehensive communication to market participants the Desk feels is needed to protect against the perception of tentativeness that might undermine credibility.	92	9
201407	1404	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Crafting guidance to the Desk and staff at this stage involves tradeoff judgments.	92	9
201407	1405	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	There is a tension between ensuring effectiveness of the tool and putting constraints on the program to balance off other concerns.	92	9
201407	1406	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Boiled down, the effectiveness concern is the argument that if you take a tentative approach, it may not work.	92	9
201407	1407	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m not convinced of that.	92	9
201407	1408	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	My starting point is the presumption that with effective communication that prepares markets for liftoff, followed by the decision to raise IOER and the federal funds rate range, the FOMC will get what it wants.	92	9
201407	1409	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1410	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201407	1411	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	92	9
201407	1412	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1413	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Staff did an excellent job putting together memos and a proposal consistent with the input the Committee gave them at the last meeting, and the recent changes were appropriately responsive to the concerns that a number of Committee members raised.	92	9
201407	1414	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I think the resulting plan is a sound one.	92	9
201407	1415	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I guess that’s my answer to question 1.	92	9
201407	1416	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I’m not going to go through the numbered questions.	92	9
201407	1417	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	First, I agree that it is appropriate for the Committee to set a range for the funds rate.	92	9
201407	1418	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Next, I also agree that it is highly appropriate to use IOER as the primary tool to pull the funds rate up into a higher range when that becomes appropriate.	92	9
201407	1419	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Of course, the real question for today is the role of our ON RRP facility during the policy normalization period.	92	9
201407	1420	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	The three memos circulated by Powell and Tarullo, Plosser, and Kocherlakota all express concerns about the design and use of this program, and I share many of these concerns.	92	9
201407	1421	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Revised principles have addressed many of these issues.	92	9
201407	1422	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Well, here are my views regarding the ON RRP program.	92	9
201407	1423	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	President Fisher has tried the pronunciation “on rip.”	92	9
201407	1424	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	My own staff uses “on ramp,” although it is really more of an off ramp, but that doesn’t go with the “on.”	92	9
201407	1425	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	During policy normalization, I believe the overnight program can play a useful role in defending our federal funds target range.	92	9
201407	1426	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	However, I prefer that markets form an expectation that the program will be small and will only be used during the normalization period.	92	9
201407	1427	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	The latest principles draft makes it clear we expect this program to be temporary.	92	9
201407	1428	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	A smaller program cap of $250 billion to $300 billion further supports the formation of these expectations, as Governors Powell and Tarullo and President Plosser suggested.	92	9
201407	1429	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	In terms of the IOER to ON RRP spread, I can support the 25 basis point proposal, but I will say I’m sympathetic to President Plosser’s suggestion that this spread start out at 50 basis points, and I guess President Lockhart’s suggestion was similar, if I understood it correctly.	92	9
201407	1430	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Although this might limit the initial effectiveness of setting a floor for our federal funds target range, we don’t know that with sufficient certainty.	92	9
201407	1431	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	An initial wider spread will signal to markets the Committee’s strong reluctance to use the ON RRP program vigorously.	92	9
201407	1432	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	This would again reinforce the primary role of IOER and enhance the expectation that the program will be temporary, which I favor.	92	9
201407	1433	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I think there’s sufficient scope for experimenting with the spread initially.	92	9
201407	1434	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	In my view, the initial setting for the funds rate floor is unlikely to be critical in the early stages of policy normalization in terms of generating financial restrictiveness.	92	9
201407	1435	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	We’re going to want to get this started and exactly how quickly it goes up isn’t going to be the critical issue, I anticipate.	92	9
201407	1436	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	IOER ought to be able to exert most of the necessary lift even if the funds rate trades soft initially.	92	9
201407	1437	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Based on our monetary control discussion this morning, if we learn that we need a tighter spread, this will be valuable information and we can adjust our tools accordingly.	92	9
201407	1438	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	And I think we could do it quickly.	92	9
201407	1439	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	All this said, if the Committee prefers a 25 basis point spread, I can support that.	92	9
201407	1440	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	President Williams made reference to exhibit 5 on the principles versus tactics formulation of the statement.	92	9
201407	1441	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I haven’t given this a lot of deep thought because it appeared only recently, and I haven’t seen anybody describe much about this.	92	9
201407	1442	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I’m not sure I’m a fan of this formulation.	92	9
201407	1443	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	The policy normalization principles are separate.	92	9
201407	1444	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	They’re stated at a high level, and they’re kind of a snoozer.	92	9
201407	1445	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I think it’s going to be ignored.	92	9
201407	1446	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	It’s boilerplate language.	92	9
201407	1447	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	It’s a little bit like airline takeoff precautions, if you read through them.	92	9
201407	1448	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I think that people will actually sort of ignore that part and go very quickly to the policy normalization tactics where the meat is, and that’s where all the action will be.	92	9
201407	1449	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I think if we spread it out the way we’ve done it before it will be a little more effective, but that’s just a personal view.	92	9
201407	1450	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	On the issue of delegating intermeeting adjustments to the Chair, I’m quite comfortable doing this for modest adjustments.	92	9
201407	1451	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	It’s the Chair’s job to assess, navigate, and lead the consensus of the Committee regarding policy adjustments.	92	9
201407	1452	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I’m quite comfortable with the Chair’s judgment on these assessments, and obviously any intermeeting adjustments will be carefully discussed at the next meeting.	92	9
201407	1453	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Assuming the IOER to ON RRP spread is 25 basis points, I thought the draft FOMC statement and directive were pretty reasonable.	92	9
201407	1454	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	If a larger 50 basis point spread were chosen, the obvious adjustments to the draft FOMC statement should work.	92	9
201407	1455	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	The principles statement also does a good job giving markets and the public a good preview of what we’ll be doing during normalization, and at the same time making it clear that we don’t expect ON RRP to be a permanent program.	92	9
201407	1456	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	My last point on this overnight program is that the Committee seems unsure of the benefits of the overnight reverse repo program and more comfortable with raising IOER more, and perhaps to higher levels, in order to gain monetary control.	92	9
201407	1457	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	At the moment that’s how I am, but the discussion of monetary control issues suggests the Committee may learn to value this overnight reverse repurchase program much more highly.	92	9
201407	1458	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	And frankly, if this comes to pass, we should welcome all the hard work that the staff has done and the fact that it is there for us to take advantage of and quickly readjust.	92	9
201407	1459	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	So I think we’re in a pretty good place.	92	9
201407	1460	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1461	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201407	1462	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	92	9
201407	1463	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1464	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	First, let me add my thanks to the staff for once again providing a very useful set of memos.	92	9
201407	1465	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I think we’ve made considerable progress toward a consensus on both strategy and communications on normalization, in no small part due to the staff’s excellent job of identifying the common ground among the participants.	92	9
201407	1466	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	And I believe we’re making more progress today.	92	9
201407	1467	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I feel some urgency to reach a consensus so that we are fully prepared when we begin our exit from the period of extraordinary monetary policy accommodation.	92	9
201407	1468	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	That time is sooner than we once thought, given the considerable improvements we’ve seen in labor market conditions and confirming evidence that inflation will gradually move back to our target.	92	9
201407	1469	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	In light of the potential for continued upside surprises, I believe it’s prudent that we are prepared in the event the Committee needs to act sooner than currently anticipated.	92	9
201407	1470	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	My comments are meant to be constructive within that context.	92	9
201407	1471	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Let me address strategy and program design first, questions 1 and 4, and communications next, questions 2 and 3.	92	9
201407	1472	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I broadly agree with the strategy outlined in the memo.	92	9
201407	1473	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I favor using a target range for the funds rate as the primary means of setting and communicating the stance of policy and using the interest rate on excess reserves as the main tool for ensuring that the funds rate remains within the FOMC’s target range.	92	9
201407	1474	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I think it’s going to be important in the initial stages of liftoff to show that we can raise the funds rate and hit our target range.	92	9
201407	1475	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Otherwise we risk the credibility of that range and the creation of a lot of confusion about the path of monetary policy, both to be avoided.	92	9
201407	1476	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	It’s going to be important to communicate our tolerance for variation in the funds rate.	92	9
201407	1477	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Whatever we come to agree about that tolerance, at this point we don’t know whether raising the IOER will be enough.	92	9
201407	1478	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	So I’m reluctant to take any of the other tools off the table, including term deposits, asset sales, and the overnight reverse repurchase facility.	92	9
201407	1479	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	That said, as I expressed at the last meeting, I do have concerns about the consequences of the ON RRPs for financial stability and market structure.	92	9
201407	1480	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	As I see it, the goal is to address those concerns by setting up the facility so that it can serve its purpose in providing backup support for the IOER, but in a way that appropriately limits the overall footprint of the program.	92	9
201407	1481	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Now, I know we’re not expected to agree today on the numerical details, but I do want to say that I agree with the amendments to the staff proposal suggested by Governors Tarullo and Powell, and for similar reasons.	92	9
201407	1482	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Lower caps that bind from time to time even when markets are not in distress will help to limit the program and overall reliance on it by market participants and serve to underscore that the facility is meant to play only a supporting and temporary role.	92	9
201407	1483	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	If it turns out we’re having difficulty keeping the funds rate above the lower edge of the target range, then we’re going to need to think about the tradeoffs between increased use of the reverse RPs, and a higher IOER rate, or using term deposits, which would mean higher payments to banks— and large banks at that, and foreign banks at that.	92	9
201407	1484	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	At that point, we’d also want to consider selling assets from our portfolio in a well-defined systematic path to lower the amount of excess reserves.	92	9
201407	1485	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Given that the IOER rate and the ON RRP facility are going to be important aspects of normalization that the Committee as a whole will want to monitor, my preference would be, consistent with past practice, to ask that the Chair confer with the Committee, if feasible, before changes are made during an intermeeting period, especially an initial period in which we are all learning from experience.	92	9
201407	1486	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Turning to communications, as I said at our last meeting, the communications surrounding the choices we make about normalization are going to be very important to how smoothly normalization will actually proceed.	92	9
201407	1487	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I’m going to refrain from making detailed comments about the directive and the illustrative time-of-liftoff FOMC statement included in the memo.	92	9
201407	1488	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	More broadly, I support communicating policy in terms of the funds rate target and when a change is made, including language on the change and the related changes in the IOER and primary credit rates in the FOMC statement, and I prefer references to the ON RRPs to be in the directive to the Desk and not in the statement.	92	9
201407	1489	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Because of the scrutiny the FOMC statement receives, major changes tend to be far and few between.	92	9
201407	1490	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	The beginning of normalization will require careful communication.	92	9
201407	1491	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Accordingly, I see this as a rare opportunity to evaluate the current statement’s format and language, including the forward-guidance piece, and to consider improvements that will serve the Committee well as we navigate the turning tide in normalization.	92	9
201407	1492	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Finally, regarding the draft normalization principles, I’m very supportive of providing a set of principles to the public in September.	92	9
201407	1493	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I believe the revised principles circulated yesterday have captured many areas of agreement among participants and were responsive to many of the comments that I sent in on the earlier draft.	92	9
201407	1494	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I think the challenge is to craft a statement of principles that appropriately balances generality and specificity to be a useful communications device.	92	9
201407	1495	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I think the revisions moved us closer to that, and in hindsight, I guess I view the June 2011 exit-strategy principles as probably too tactical.	92	9
201407	1496	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	The separation of principles and tactics in the second version of the revision is probably beneficial, but if we go that route, then I think we should be more explicit in the final paragraph that principles are less likely to be revised than tactics.	92	9
201407	1497	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I would support the white paper, which is mentioned in the memo, to explain the tools.	92	9
201407	1498	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I would not be in favor of doing a consultation paper in advance.	92	9
201407	1499	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I also want to note that in the revision in exhibit 5, there is now no mention of a target federal funds rate in the principles section.	92	9
201407	1500	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	That’s been moved to tactics.	92	9
201407	1501	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I guess my understanding is that I thought we had agreed that we were going to have a target federal funds rate.	92	9
201407	1502	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	So if that’s a subtle decision that we’re not going to be targeting a funds rate, even as a range of a funds rate, I think that will be something we want to discuss more fully.	92	9
201407	1503	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	My understanding is that we had agreed, sort of in principle, to have a target, notwithstanding the difficulties of hitting the target.	92	9
201407	1504	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	One remaining issue is asset sales.	92	9
201407	1505	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I think the revision does a better job of explaining our intention about asset sales.	92	9
201407	1506	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	My preference would be to leave ourselves a little more room to revise our sales strategy as we go forward.	92	9
201407	1507	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	We may decide that sales will be a useful tool in shrinking our balance sheet at a faster pace than currently anticipated.	92	9
201407	1508	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1509	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201407	1510	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	92	9
201407	1511	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1512	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I have three main comments, which I’ll list here, and then I’ll provide some background on my comments.	92	9
201407	1513	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	First, I think the federal funds rate is overemphasized as the key policy rate in the approach to normalization outlined in the two staff memos for this meeting.	92	9
201407	1514	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I will suggest that it may be prudent to de-emphasize references to the federal funds rate as the key policy rate during this period, and in this regard I share some of the views of President Rosengren.	92	9
201407	1515	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	This is just going to follow on some of the comments I made at the previous meeting.	92	9
201407	1516	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Second, I would prefer to make some changes to the restated normalization principles to bring them closer to what the Committee agreed to in 2011.	92	9
201407	1517	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I would prefer to say much less concerning the federal funds rate.	92	9
201407	1518	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I think we should handle reinvestment as we did in 2011, and like President Mester, I think we should maintain more optionality for selling assets.	92	9
201407	1519	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	And third, in other areas, I’m broadly supportive of the approach to normalization and of the proposed design of the overnight reverse repurchase facility.	92	9
201407	1520	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Let me now just walk through the questions that were asked in order.	92	9
201407	1521	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	On question 1— which concerns general support for the method of conducting monetary policy during normalization as described in the staff memos and also whether the Chair should have authority to change the IOER, the overnight reverse repurchase rate, or the caps on an intermeeting basis in order to keep the effective federal funds rate within the target range—in broad terms I’m supportive of using IOER and the proposed overnight RRP facility to normalize interest rates.	92	9
201407	1522	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	My main objection is that I do not think we can afford to emphasize the federal funds rate as much as it is emphasized in these memos as the primary tool of monetary policy.	92	9
201407	1523	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	The federal funds market is not, at the present time, a sufficiently robust market on which to base United States monetary policy.	92	9
201407	1524	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	What we are proposing is the federal funds rate on crutches.	92	9
201407	1525	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	The federal funds rate today is determined by a small number of idiosyncratic players, and movements in the effective rate can be idiosyncratic.	92	9
201407	1526	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	There is also some small chance that the market would cease to exist altogether during the period of normalization.	92	9
201407	1527	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	By contrast, the IOER applies to reserve holdings in the banking system and the overnight RRP facility touches on a broad range of institutions.	92	9
201407	1528	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	In short, the federal funds rate is a rate that does not matter in a macroeconomic sense.	92	9
201407	1529	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	It is the IOER and the ON RRP rates that matter, macroeconomically speaking.	92	9
201407	1530	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Of these two, the overnight reverse repurchase rate is probably the more important.	92	9
201407	1531	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Let’s think about the federal funds rate as dominated by noise trading.	92	9
201407	1532	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	The staff analysis suggests that, should the federal funds rate trade outside of the range assigned by the FOMC, the reaction may be to change the IOER rate, the overnight RRP rate, or both, to encourage  federal funds trading within the target range.	92	9
201407	1533	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I find this suggestion especially worrisome.	92	9
201407	1534	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	It would mean that noise trading in the federal funds market would be a driver of US monetary policy because idiosyncratic trades occurring there would induce changes in policy rates of far more import, namely the IOER and the overnight RRP rates.	92	9
201407	1535	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	That could have important macroeconomic effects, but in response to noise trades.	92	9
201407	1536	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	What can be done about this?	92	9
201407	1537	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I suggest that we do not put heavy emphasis on the federal funds rate as the key policy rate.	92	9
201407	1538	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Instead, we should say that all three rates are important and that we expect the federal funds rate to trade between the IOER and the overnight RRP rates.	92	9
201407	1539	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	We should then say that if the federal funds rate does not trade between the two rates because of idiosyncratic factors in that market, we may base policy solely on the IOER rate and the overnight RRP rate in the future.	92	9
201407	1540	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	This modified approach might keep us from changing rates of consequence in response to vagaries in the federal funds market.	92	9
201407	1541	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	It follows from these comments that I do not support giving the Chair authority to change the IOER rate, the overnight RRP rate, or caps in order to keep the federal funds rate in a specified trading range.	92	9
201407	1542	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Instead, should the federal funds rate consistently trade outside the Committee’s specified range, the Committee should convene and consider putting out a statement that the key policy rates are the IOER and the overnight RRP rates.	92	9
201407	1543	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I would keep the overnight RRP rate in this situation, as I feel it intersects with a broader set of counterparties than reliance on IOER alone.	92	9
201407	1544	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	The US banking system is only 20 percent of US financial intermediation, and in the future we’re probably going to have to do better than that in order to influence short-term interest rates.	92	9
201407	1545	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	In short, if the proposed system does not work as intended, I think we will have little choice but to de-emphasize the federal funds rate as the key policy rate.	92	9
201407	1546	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Let me now turn briefly to financial-stability issues.	92	9
201407	1547	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I have some sympathy with President Kocherlakota’s call for a fuller discussion with the private sector concerning the possible implications of the overnight RRP facility for financial stability.	92	9
201407	1548	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	It is certainly a fair comment that we do not, at present, have a good handle on the possible financial-stability effects of the overnight RRP facility.	92	9
201407	1549	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Still, my bottom line on this issue is that in a true financial crisis, the Committee will have to make decisions about appropriate actions to take, and that it would be difficult to script those actions sitting here today.	92	9
201407	1550	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Since this is the case, I prefer to lean against allowing financial-stability concerns to get in the way of implementing monetary policy during the period of policy normalization.	92	9
201407	1551	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	On question 2, which concerns proposed communications, I’m broadly supportive of the proposal as in the staff’s suggestion.	92	9
201407	1552	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	On question 3, which concerns newly proposed normalization principles, I have the following comments.	92	9
201407	1553	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Bullet 2 of the proposed principles, along with the sub-bullets, mentions the federal funds rate five times.	92	9
201407	1554	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Today’s updated versions are not that much different.	92	9
201407	1555	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	In my view, this is way overdone.	92	9
201407	1556	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I propose simply eliminating the three sub-bullets of bullet 2 in exhibit 4.	92	9
201407	1557	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	The federal funds rate would then just be mentioned once in conjunction with other short-term interest rates.	92	9
201407	1558	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I think this would more correctly characterize the state of affairs, which I see as moving the three interest rates in tandem if everything goes according to plan, and I think it would better reflect that reality.	92	9
201407	1559	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	As written, the bullets convey far too much technical detail, really tactics and not principles.	92	9
201407	1560	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	If we do go to exhibit 5 instead, I would eliminate the tactics section altogether.	92	9
201407	1561	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	On reinvestment, I suggest simply keeping bullet 2 from the 2011 exit principles.	92	9
201407	1562	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	One issue with these principles is how useful and credible they are if the Committee is willing to shift to a new set of principles as the time for implementation draws near.	92	9
201407	1563	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Bullet 2 from 2011 would restate that the Committee “will likely first cease reinvesting some or all payments of principal on the securities holdings in the SOMA.”	92	9
201407	1564	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	As I argued last time, I think it would be useful for the Committee to be able to cease reinvestment as an intermediate step between the ending of the QE program and the date of first liftoff in the policy rate.	92	9
201407	1565	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Also, this could be done in a more managed way by partially ceasing reinvestment or by reinvesting in shorter-term Treasury securities and partially undoing our twist operation that we did earlier in the period of unconventional monetary policy.	92	9
201407	1566	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I do not think that the macroeconomic impact would be large, but I do think it would help the credibility of the Committee by beginning to shrink the balance sheet, even if it were in a passive way.	92	9
201407	1567	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I think it would also signal that the Committee felt comfortable enough with the state of the economy that the time of policy rate liftoff was drawing near.	92	9
201407	1568	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I would also remove the second sub-bullet in the proposed normalization principles concerning the sales of MBS.	92	9
201407	1569	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	In this area, I agree with some of the comments of President Lockhart.	92	9
201407	1570	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I see no reason to commit to this in these principles.	92	9
201407	1571	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I prefer to keep options on the table.	92	9
201407	1572	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	The situation might change as we go down the road and we decide what we want to do.	92	9
201407	1573	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I also agreed with President Fisher’s suggestion that we could add a clause, at a minimum, to the MBS feature in this statement.	92	9
201407	1574	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	The clause was, as I recall it, to say that if the housing market was quite robust, then possibly we would consider selling MBS.	92	9
201407	1575	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I think we could have something like that included.	92	9
201407	1576	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	In general, in very broad terms I would actually prefer to keep the 2011 exit principles as opposed to moving to the 2014 set of principles.	92	9
201407	1577	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	It seems to me that we will be gaining very little while possibly sowing considerable confusion with the new set of exit principles.	92	9
201407	1578	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Question 4 concerns the broad design of the overnight reverse repurchase facility.	92	9
201407	1579	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I’m okay on most of these dimensions.	92	9
201407	1580	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I’ll just mention them here:  The 25 basis point spread, I’m okay with that.	92	9
201407	1581	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Circuit breaker cap is fine with me.	92	9
201407	1582	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	The $500 billion limit cap is fine with me.	92	9
201407	1583	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	The testing proposal is also okay with me.	92	9
201407	1584	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I’m actually fine with the broad design.	92	9
201407	1585	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Those are my comments, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1586	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	92	9
201407	1587	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201407	1588	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	92	9
201407	1589	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1590	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	I, too, thank the staff, and I think given the range of views and discussion today, I’m going to hit my answers to the questions at a generally high level.	92	9
201407	1591	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	I do support the approach to conducting monetary policy during normalization that’s described in the first staff memo, using a range for the federal funds rate.	92	9
201407	1592	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	If adjustments to that approach are needed to respond to substantive deviations, intermeeting calls, especially at the beginning of normalization, to consult with the Board and the Committee would seem appropriate.	92	9
201407	1593	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	However, once we have some experience, or if these adjustments are really of a technical nature, I would be comfortable providing the Chair authority to make intermeeting adjustments.	92	9
201407	1594	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	I support the revised normalization principles and the clarity they offer regarding the role of the overnight reverse repos and the long-run balance sheet size and characteristics, but I would be more comfortable if those principles allowed for asset sales under some circumstances; we might want to have that flexibility.	92	9
201407	1595	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	I’m comfortable with the broad design of the ON RRP.	92	9
201407	1596	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	I view the wide spread and the use of caps as important.	92	9
201407	1597	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	The proposed 25 basis point spread between the IOER and the ON RRP rates seems to be an appropriate starting point, realizing that narrowing that spread may be needed at some point to control rates.	92	9
201407	1598	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	I share the concerns that several have noted regarding market structure, financial stability, and expanding the Federal Reserve’s role in financial markets, and to that end, I think the changes proposed by Governors Tarullo and Powell could be effective in addressing those concerns.	92	9
201407	1599	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	92	9
201407	1600	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201407	1601	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201407	1602	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1603	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And like others, I’d like to thank the staff for their ongoing excellent work on a very challenging area of inquiry.	92	9
201407	1604	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As you suggested, Madam Chair, I think the most important issue facing the Committee right now is whether or not to commit to the use of the facility—as we call it, somewhat ominously, in Minnesota—in September.	92	9
201407	1605	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The memo I sent to the Committee on Saturday provides my view on that issue, so I’m going to elaborate on the key point that I made.	92	9
201407	1606	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And when I talk about committing to the use of the facility, what I am referring to is specific mention of it in the normalization principles that we would be releasing in September, and I do support the idea of releasing normalization principles at that time.	92	9
201407	1607	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	To go back to the memo that we circulated on Saturday, we have heard from both staff and FOMC participants that the facility could have adverse effects on the industrial structure of short-term funding markets and on financial stability.	92	9
201407	1608	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Unfortunately, we have relatively little information with which to judge the magnitude of these downside risks and the effectiveness of possible mitigants of, for example, the kind that Governors Powell and Tarullo suggested.	92	9
201407	1609	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We do have data from tests of the facility.	92	9
201407	1610	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	These tests are necessarily incomplete.	92	9
201407	1611	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	They cannot tell us the consequences of a larger or more permanent facility, nor how the facility would affect the economy in the event of a financial crisis—that’s what I have in my notes here, but actually, the testing period has been a time of very low volatility overall in financial markets, so we actually don’t even have a good test of how it would fare in what I would call a more normal period of volatility.	92	9
201407	1612	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we have received outstanding support, analysis, and advice from the Federal Reserve System staff.	92	9
201407	1613	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Nonetheless, I think we could benefit from receiving input from experts outside our own organization.	92	9
201407	1614	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I indicated in the memo on Saturday, I think it would be useful for the FOMC to gather more information about the facility before committing to its use.	92	9
201407	1615	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In the memo, I recommended the Committee collect this information by issuing a public consultation paper, seeking public comment on that paper, and convening a conference of outside experts on financial stability and short-term funding markets to discuss it.	92	9
201407	1616	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we do a lot of this information-gathering in a very informal way.	92	9
201407	1617	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think the Desk in New York does a great job with their contacts.	92	9
201407	1618	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	All of us, I presume, are reaching out to our contacts, some with small banks, some with large banks, and with other financial market participants.	92	9
201407	1619	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is just a systematizing of that process and opening it up to the public for this particular facility.	92	9
201407	1620	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is not a discussion of the stance of monetary policy.	92	9
201407	1621	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The independence of this organization does require the kind of isolation that we impose on that process.	92	9
201407	1622	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It is, rather, a discussion of a particular tool, a particular enhancement of the tools that we have available to us.	92	9
201407	1623	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And as I say, I think it is merely making transparent and systematizing a process that we are already undergoing.	92	9
201407	1624	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I indicated in the memo that I think there is a time frame in which all three of these steps could be accomplished by the end of October, in time for a decision at our December meeting.	92	9
201407	1625	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If you wanted to drop one of the three steps, I think convening a conference is not an essential feature here.	92	9
201407	1626	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think the public consultation paper and the commentary on that one is the best.	92	9
201407	1627	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, these three steps would give us more assurance that whatever choice we make is based on the best information and analysis available in the time that we need to make a decision.	92	9
201407	1628	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think engaging the public in this way would enhance our reputation for transparency and would help us learn about the likely responses to our potential use of this tool.	92	9
201407	1629	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Some of them would be political, but some of them, just from market participants, about who is going to be hurt and who is going to benefit—I think we should have information about that before making judgments.	92	9
201407	1630	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, I have been emphasizing our need to learn about the possible downside risks of the facility.	92	9
201407	1631	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The reason I have been doing that emphasis is because coming into this meeting, I saw the main decision before us right now as being whether to commit to the use of this tool in September.	92	9
201407	1632	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	When you are making a commitment, the downside risks are the more relevant factor than the upside risks.	92	9
201407	1633	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But the information-gathering that I propose in my memo would have broader uses.	92	9
201407	1634	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And this gets to a point that I think President Lockhart was alluding to in his remarks.	92	9
201407	1635	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Actually, I am not necessarily comfortable with what we say about phasing out the facility either.	92	9
201407	1636	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I don’t feel I know enough to make that judgment either.	92	9
201407	1637	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One of the ways in which my staff helped me prepare for this meeting is by actually having a debate about whether or not we should have the overnight reverse repo facility.	92	9
201407	1638	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One of my staff was able to fulfill a lifelong dream and play Bill Dudley in real life.	92	9
201407	1639	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	92	9
201407	1640	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It was a career highlight.	92	9
201407	1641	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And what became clear was there are some very good arguments on both sides that would be useful to gather more information about.	92	9
201407	1642	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Even if we decide to use the facility as we go through liftoff, we are going to face some key choices about how to use it.	92	9
201407	1643	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Right now, we are very nervous and scared because we don’t have enough information, and so we are trying to scale back and commit ourselves to scaling it back.	92	9
201407	1644	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So we are going to commit to use it and commit not to use very much of it.	92	9
201407	1645	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think if we go through the information-gathering steps, we might well learn information that would help us become more confident with using the facility, as well as information that might help us learn about mitigation of downside risks.	92	9
201407	1646	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So my suggested approach, I think, leads to fairly short answers to the questions posed to us by staff.	92	9
201407	1647	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I am not supportive of the draft normalization principles as written, because I believe it is premature to be mentioning the overnight facility at this time.	92	9
201407	1648	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would prefer just to make reference to supplementary tools.	92	9
201407	1649	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I think that, in our current state of knowledge, not only would it be premature, but also there is a possibility of going through a process to acquire more learning.	92	9
201407	1650	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s not just not mentioning for the sake of not mentioning it.	92	9
201407	1651	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I have sketched a process whereby we could gather more information.	92	9
201407	1652	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And, Madam Chair, you said we don’t need to nail down details of the facility at this time, and I would concur with that.	92	9
201407	1653	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The time between today and liftoff is certainly compressing, but I think we still have time to work on that.	92	9
201407	1654	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I like exhibit 5 better than exhibit 4.	92	9
201407	1655	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I agree with the amendment that President Mester suggested there, to make it clear that principles are more likely to be with us than tactics, which are more likely to change in response to the evolution of economic conditions.	92	9
201407	1656	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We were asked about delegating certain intermeeting adjustments to the rate on the overnight reverse repo facility to the Chair.	92	9
201407	1657	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I just don’t see the need for such delegation, given our ability to meet very quickly with today’s technology.	92	9
201407	1658	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me make three quick comments here.	92	9
201407	1659	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we do commit to a phaseout of the kind that is envisioned in the principles that were circulated yesterday, I would recommend making it more than verbal.	92	9
201407	1660	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it would be nice to try to structure some automaticity into the phaseout, talking about maybe having the spread get larger as the rate of interest on excess reserves gets higher.	92	9
201407	1661	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Presumably, we might not be insisting on a 25 basis point spread once interest rates are back up to 400 basis points.	92	9
201407	1662	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We might be willing to live with a larger spread.	92	9
201407	1663	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So maybe there is some way to build that into the description of the facility—but that is just one idea.	92	9
201407	1664	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it’s good to have structural features of the facility translate directly into its becoming less useful as we go through time.	92	9
201407	1665	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would delay the expansion of counterparties until after the normalization principles are released.	92	9
201407	1666	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And President Rosengren’s little experiment of raising the IOER in a technical way— of course, that’s the whole art—how do you tell people it’s technical?	92	9
201407	1667	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I think that’s a very clever idea, that could be very informative to us.	92	9
201407	1668	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The way I would try to make it technical as opposed to a true tightening is to do it for a two- to three-week period.	92	9
201407	1669	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We raise IOER for 10 basis points for two to three weeks, and then bring it back down and see what we can learn from that.	92	9
201407	1670	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Maybe we don’t learn much, but I am optimistic that it would be informative about the impact on short-term rates.	92	9
201407	1671	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1672	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201407	1673	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	92	9
201407	1674	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	92	9
201407	1675	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I am generally comfortable with the approach outlined in the staff memos.	92	9
201407	1676	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I do want to compliment the staff on the quality of the work.	92	9
201407	1677	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It is no easy task to take the musings of 17 different FOMC participants, try to boil that down to a coherent proposal that we could all agree to.	92	9
201407	1678	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m going to try to address the major substantive issues, so where I’m silent you can assume that I am in agreement with the staff proposal.	92	9
201407	1679	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The first major point concerns the use of the overnight RRP facility.	92	9
201407	1680	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	As I see it, the point of the facility is to help ensure that we have adequate monetary policy control.	92	9
201407	1681	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That is, we are able to control the constellation of money market rates sufficiently well so that we can affect financial conditions in a way consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate goals.	92	9
201407	1682	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I agree with others that we should rely on the overnight RRP facility only as much as needed to ensure adequate monetary policy control.	92	9
201407	1683	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If we could have sufficient control with the overnight RRP, with a relatively wide spread and small take-up, that would be a good outcome.	92	9
201407	1684	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	And if we could ultimately move to just having the IOER do all the lifting, that would probably be even a better outcome.	92	9
201407	1685	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	My own view is that the staff proposal, starting with 25 basis point spread, is a reasonable starting point.	92	9
201407	1686	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems likely to generate sufficient monetary policy control while keeping the footprint of the overnight RRP facility quite small.	92	9
201407	1687	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But I think we have to view this as just a starting point, because we are making a guess about what the optimal tradeoff is between monetary control and the size and footprint of the facility.	92	9
201407	1688	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I could imagine we could find that we have excellent control at a 25 basis point spread, and if we did that, we might consider widening the spread to further reduce the size of the footprint of the facility.	92	9
201407	1689	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Conversely, if we find that our monetary control is less than anticipated and the take-up of the facility isn’t very large, you might consider that narrowing the spread and accepting a somewhat larger take-up through the overnight RRP facility is appropriate.	92	9
201407	1690	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, there is a legitimate question of how to arrive at this optimal tradeoff between control and footprint.	92	9
201407	1691	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	And around the table people have said, “Well, we could conceivably start by just raising the IOER and leaving the overnight RRP rate unchanged at 5 basis points, and see if that was sufficient for monetary policy control.”	92	9
201407	1692	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But to me, I think that raises the risk of a messy liftoff.	92	9
201407	1693	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me it would be better to start with something like the staff proposal, the 25 basis point spread, and then evaluate whether the spread could be widened, and sufficient monetary policy control achieved, by leaning more heavily on the IOER.	92	9
201407	1694	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Initially, I have two goals—minimize the risk on liftoff with respect to monetary policy control, and have the opportunity to gain more information about the tradeoff between spread size and monetary policy control.	92	9
201407	1695	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	And then we use that to decide our subsequent adjustments.	92	9
201407	1696	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the long-term use of the overnight RRP facility, I very much see this as a supplemental and temporary tool of monetary policy.	92	9
201407	1697	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	And to ensure it stays that way, I think we have to be explicit about that in our principles.	92	9
201407	1698	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So I am very happy with the revised principles.	92	9
201407	1699	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think it is important to recognize that it is highly likely that the need for an overnight RRP facility should lessen as the balance sheet starts to normalize because reserves will become scarcer and arbitrage should work better when that occurs.	92	9
201407	1700	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we should understand that the overnight RRP facility is really most important when the balance sheet is at its biggest point, where we are today.	92	9
201407	1701	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the caps, I thought that the staff made a very compelling case for both an aggregate cap and a circuit breaker limit on daily movement and activity.	92	9
201407	1702	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But if we really are going to set the facility so the aggregate use isn’t that large, I think the incremental benefit of having a circuit breaker is pretty small.	92	9
201407	1703	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If we end up with a facility that has a cap of $300 billion or $400 billion and usage of $150 billion to $200 billion, that $150 billion of headroom—you just don’t gain that much by having that circuit breaker cap if you only have $150 billion of headroom to play with.	92	9
201407	1704	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So I don’t think that incremental benefit is very large.	92	9
201407	1705	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, with respect to the issue of the size of the facility, I think it is really too soon to be clear about what that aggregate cap should be.	92	9
201407	1706	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	When we introduce this, we really want to make sure that we have sufficient headroom so that when the facility is introduced you are not running into the cap frequently.	92	9
201407	1707	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If you are running into the cap frequently, then you are actually going to lose monetary policy control.	92	9
201407	1708	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So to go back to the Powell-Tarullo memo, if we had a $300 billion cap and the take-up of the facility was $150 billion, I think that would work very well, because you would have $150 billion of headroom.	92	9
201407	1709	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But if you were in the less fortunate circumstance of April, or maybe the take-up of the facility was $250 billion and the cap was $300 billion, that is not a lot of headroom.	92	9
201407	1710	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	You’d be sacrificing a lot of potential monetary policy control.	92	9
201407	1711	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that we should continue to run the experiment over the next six to nine months, and we will learn a lot more about what the expected size of the facility is likely to be.	92	9
201407	1712	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	We should try to do that in a form that is closest to how we think the facility will actually work when it is implemented, not in a testing phase but in the liftoff phase.	92	9
201407	1713	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think as we do that, then we can sort of decide what is an appropriate cap at the time of liftoff to make sure that there is sufficient headroom so you don’t hit the cap a lot inadvertently and undermine monetary policy control, but not have a cap that is so high, way higher than necessary, that then would send the wrong message to market participants about how important this facility is supposed to be over the longer term.	92	9
201407	1714	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The third point I would make with respect to the revised exit principles is that I think we should be explicit that we do plan to let the balance sheet normalize primarily by securities maturing and running off.	92	9
201407	1715	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m happy to entertain language that gives us a little bit more flexibility than what we have right now, but I think that if we really think that the balance sheet is going to be set mostly on autopilot, if we really think that’s the most likely scenario, then I think we should be clear to people that that’s how we are going to behave.	92	9
201407	1716	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I completely agree that the world can change and we could decide that we want to use the balance sheet in a more active way.	92	9
201407	1717	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But if most of us really think that it’s going to be on autopilot, I think it is better to communicate that as an expectation to markets, because otherwise it is just going to be an open issue and people are going to be musing about it and asking questions of the Chair at every press conference.	92	9
201407	1718	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it would better to tamp that down a bit.	92	9
201407	1719	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The fourth point I’d make is about making the federal funds rate more robust.	92	9
201407	1720	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	We have essentially deferred the discussion about what to do with the federal funds rate to a future meeting, but it’s pretty important.	92	9
201407	1721	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I mean, if the overnight RRP counterparty list ultimately is going to expand further, the arbitrage from the GSEs to the banks, particularly foreign banking organizations, could lessen further, diminishing the volume of the federal funds rate transactions and making the federal funds rate even more idiosyncratic.	92	9
201407	1722	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, to me, the way out of this dilemma is not to move away from the federal funds rate as a target but to change the concept of what we target to an overnight borrowing rate that includes Eurodollar borrowings undertaken by US banks and foreign banks operating in the United States.	92	9
201407	1723	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think that is very controversial, if we were to move to that.	92	9
201407	1724	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it would make a much more robust instrument in terms of what we’re targeting.	92	9
201407	1725	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The trickier issue is if we do move to this new borrowing rate, what do we call it?	92	9
201407	1726	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Do we have the old effective funds rate and the old definition?	92	9
201407	1727	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Do we also then have this new rate, or do we just move to a new definition of the federal funds rate?	92	9
201407	1728	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So that’s something I think we really do need to talk about at a future meeting.	92	9
201407	1729	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	This is also very relevant in terms of all of the discussion of reference rates and all of the trillions of dollars of derivatives contracts that reference the federal funds rate.	92	9
201407	1730	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It is not just a monetary policy issue; it is also an important issue with respect to reference rates.	92	9
201407	1731	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, on the issue of the timing of redemptions, I’d just reiterate what I said at the June meeting.	92	9
201407	1732	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think ending reinvestments before raising short-term rates could conceivably delay liftoff in certain states of the world.	92	9
201407	1733	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think that would be unfortunate, because it seems to me that getting off the zero lower bound is completely possible, consistent with our dual mandate objectives, and is important in order to regain monetary policy flexibility.	92	9
201407	1734	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think that if we delay ending reinvestment until after liftoff, it will simplify our communications.	92	9
201407	1735	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	There will be only one moving part, short-term interest rates, rather than two.	92	9
201407	1736	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So I very much favor ending the reinvestment after liftoff rather than before.	92	9
201407	1737	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think Richard Fisher has suggested “shortly after.”	92	9
201407	1738	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that is a little too prescriptive.	92	9
201407	1739	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I can imagine a situation where we lift off, the market reacts violently, we have a repeat of the taper tantrum, and then we have redemptions ending automatically shortly thereafter.	92	9
201407	1740	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That would be, I think, not such a pleasant place to be.	92	9
201407	1741	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, as far as this issue of giving discretion to the Chair, I think it is completely reasonable to give discretion to the Chair about the tactics needed to keep the federal funds rate target in its range.	92	9
201407	1742	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it is completely unreasonable to delegate to the Chair changes in the federal funds rate target rate.	92	9
201407	1743	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So I would discriminate between giving discretion to the Chair to move the target range around from making tactical choices in terms of IOER or the spread between overnight RRP and IOER to keep the funds rate in its range.	92	9
201407	1744	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me like that does not require a videoconference for that sort of tactical change.	92	9
201407	1745	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The Desk periodically makes decisions.	92	9
201407	1746	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I mean, back when we were running a corridor system, we had to make decisions every day about what intervention was appropriate to keep the federal funds rate at its target.	92	9
201407	1747	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	And we did not have a videoconference every day to address, “Should we do a system of overnight RRP?	92	9
201407	1748	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Should we do customer RP?”	92	9
201407	1749	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the kind of things that we are talking about delegating to the Chair are the things of that nature—how we used to run a corridor system.	92	9
201407	1750	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think delegating to the Chair the tactics of how you keep the federal funds rate in its range is completely reasonable, in my opinion.	92	9
201407	1751	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	92	9
201407	1752	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	If I may, Madam Chair, Vice Chairman Dudley, I’m not quite sure I understand why, if we are to reduce or taper reinvestments, it forestalls our raising rates.	92	9
201407	1753	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Could you walk me through that, please?	92	9
201407	1754	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, the question is, what is the market going to take as the timing of the first move to tightening?	92	9
201407	1755	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If we were to end reinvestment before the tightening of short-term rates—	92	9
201407	1756	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Not end, but begin to taper.	92	9
201407	1757	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	But either point.	92	9
201407	1758	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The market is going to say, “Okay.	92	9
201407	1759	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Now they are about to lift off.”	92	9
201407	1760	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	There could be a significant tightening of financial conditions.	92	9
201407	1761	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	We just don’t know how big the reaction is going to be to that decision.	92	9
201407	1762	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	And if it was a very large reaction like we had last summer, we might not actually feel comfortable, then, actually raising short-term rates.	92	9
201407	1763	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	And so I think it is cleaner just to raise short-term rates first, and then leave the redemption decision for later, having the ability to judge what the market reaction is to that initial lift.	92	9
201407	1764	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I mean, in theory, if everything went very smoothly and the market fully anticipated our actions, and there was no market mispositioning, when we lift off it should be a very trivial event and there is not going to be much change in financial conditions.	92	9
201407	1765	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But, as we saw last summer, even non-moves toward monetary policy tightening can lead to pretty significant moves in financial conditions.	92	9
201407	1766	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think we just want to be cautious as we go through that transition.	92	9
201407	1767	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	We have a difference of opinion, though, because I think it really is a function of communication, what we signal ahead of time.	92	9
201407	1768	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	On the second point, if I may, Madam Chair, still, “at some point” is a very broad hole you can drive a truck through.	92	9
201407	1769	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	One possibility, just drop that and say “after it begins increasing.”	92	9
201407	1770	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I just want to consider that.	92	9
201407	1771	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	It may not be “shortly,” but when we say “at some point” it’s indefinite.	92	9
201407	1772	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I understand that “at some point” is—	92	9
201407	1773	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	You might—I would just ask that you give some thought to that, and I apologize for interrupting.	92	9
201407	1774	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we can look for language that was a little bit in between the indefiniteness of “some time” and not quite as automatic as “shortly after.”	92	9
201407	1775	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	There is probably some language in between.	92	9
201407	1776	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Thank you.	92	9
201407	1777	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	92	9
201407	1778	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1779	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	There have been two tensions driving this discussion.	92	9
201407	1780	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	One is the need to demonstrate or to have the ability to run monetary policy, by which I mean being able to hit our interest rate, and I’ll explain why I think that matters in a moment, versus concerns about are we inventing a Frankenstein monster called ON RRP, or whatever set of initials we want to use for this thing.	92	9
201407	1781	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	That’s one of the tensions.	92	9
201407	1782	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	The other is a tension over how much to try to predetermine future choices.	92	9
201407	1783	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Let me start with the need to demonstrate the ability to run monetary policy.	92	9
201407	1784	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	This institution could have been, if it had not handled this crisis well—and I mean the crisis after September 2008—in very bad shape today and thought of as incompetent.	92	9
201407	1785	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	It wasn’t incompetent.	92	9
201407	1786	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	It wasn’t impotent.	92	9
201407	1787	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	It reestablished its reputation—I am speaking as somebody who didn’t know he was ever going to be part of this institution—and as a result of showing really remarkable technical competence in running an extremely complicated set of programs without error, or at least without error that anybody on the outside was able to identify.	92	9
201407	1788	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	92	9
201407	1789	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Sorry if you are losing your lunches.	92	9
201407	1790	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	And I don’t think we should be in a position in which, with our 22,000 employees, we have to go out and look for crowd justification for the measures we take.	92	9
201407	1791	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	This organization is very good at what it does.	92	9
201407	1792	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	It has to be a leader, not a follower of what a crowd of outside experts, and who knows who they’ll be, will tell us.	92	9
201407	1793	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I just think we ought to make the decision and get on and make it, and that the thing we have to do is to be sure.	92	9
201407	1794	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I want to answer the question of “with what probability,” and I want to be as sure as we can be that we can hit the targets we set out to hit.	92	9
201407	1795	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	And I believe that something which sounded really appealing to me at the beginning—well, first, we move up IOER, don’t move the ON RRP rate, and see how it works and then adjust it—is a sign that we really wouldn’t know what we are doing.	92	9
201407	1796	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	And as President Williams said, there are a lot of people out there who say the Fed doesn’t have the capacity to control monetary policy.	92	9
201407	1797	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	If it doesn’t, well, I don’t know what central banks are supposed to have the capacity to do, but controlling monetary policy seems to be high on the list.	92	9
201407	1798	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	And I think we just need to assure ourselves that we can do it.	92	9
201407	1799	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	So when it comes down to the choice between using the overnight reverse repo facility and having more certainty about our capacity to effect the target which we have chosen to continue to use, despite some concerns that were expressed—I think validly—around this table about whether this market will survive, I think we have to come down on the side of going with the overnight reverse repo facility and the 25 basis point range that has been suggested.	92	9
201407	1800	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	If we were a private group working something out, there could be attractions in the “let’s try this and let’s go ahead and gradually improve it” approach.	92	9
201407	1801	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We have got to really hit it hard from the beginning and show that we are in charge, because if we’re not in charge we are going to have a mess in the markets.	92	9
201407	1802	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	It is hard to describe exactly what it will be, but it will be a mess if the markets lose confidence in our ability to achieve the goals that we set out for ourselves.	92	9
201407	1803	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	The other tension is over how much to determine future choices.	92	9
201407	1804	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	And this one is always hard.	92	9
201407	1805	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	As I listened carefully—I hope nobody recognizes themselves.	92	9
201407	1806	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I recognize myself.	92	9
201407	1807	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Everybody wanted great flexibility on the things they thought they wanted to control, and they wanted to be certain about all of the other things, which other people might want to be controlling.	92	9
201407	1808	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	And so my sense is that there are future choices we don’t have to make now, and that flexibility would be quite desirable.	92	9
201407	1809	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	And in that regard, let me just mention that there was some hankering after the June 2011 principles.	92	9
201407	1810	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Well, there are two of them which we have changed, and there is another one which looks as if we have changed it.	92	9
201407	1811	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	So three of those principles that we want to go back to, by agreement of this Committee, are no longer relevant.	92	9
201407	1812	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	And so I like the principles that are set out by the staff in the proposed note, which is a considerable feat of draftsmanship, because as each new e-mail came in I said, “Wow, how are they going to deal with this one?”	92	9
201407	1813	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	And I think we got something which is pretty close to a consensus document and one—not only that, you know, getting a consensus about something that wouldn’t work is not great.	92	9
201407	1814	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We have a consensus document about something that I think is going to actually be successful.	92	9
201407	1815	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	The question is, if we go for this facility, we have two questions.	92	9
201407	1816	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	People really don’t want it to become permanent, and I can understand that.	92	9
201407	1817	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	The only way we can do that is by trying to find some way of tying our hands.	92	9
201407	1818	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Well, we can’t do that legally.	92	9
201407	1819	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think we can precommit a future Committee unless we involve the Congress, and I have a feeling we don’t want to involve the Congress.	92	9
201407	1820	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We have to make it expensive for us not to go through with getting rid of this facility, and that is why we need the commitments in our current documents to phase it out—I don’t know if the word should be “as soon as possible,” but soon, as soon as we can do so, because I understand the concern.	92	9
201407	1821	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	The concern is we are going to develop a whole industry around the overnight reverse repos and hedge funds and mutual funds, and God knows what will grow up, based on a facility which “the Fed had to invent in order to get out of the hole it had dug by buying these $4 trillion of securities.”	92	9
201407	1822	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Well, we don’t have to do that, and we should find a way of making sure that we don’t do that.	92	9
201407	1823	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Just a few other comments.	92	9
201407	1824	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I do wonder whether we shouldn’t have some more discussion, either among ourselves or possibly in writing, of what are the alternatives.	92	9
201407	1825	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Suppose this scheme doesn’t work.	92	9
201407	1826	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Do we know?	92	9
201407	1827	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Well, clearly, we can start selling assets if that’s—	92	9
201407	1828	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	We can.	92	9
201407	1829	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	If that’s what we have to do, and if we wanted to do that, we would have to make sure that that was done in a way which didn’t frighten the heck out of everybody.	92	9
201407	1830	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	And that would be why we wouldn’t start right there at the moment.	92	9
201407	1831	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I understand the argument that’s made about why we shouldn’t hang on to the MBS, but there are two problems there.	92	9
201407	1832	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Number one is—and here we are really into politics.	92	9
201407	1833	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Number one is, we’d better not be in a situation in which we have to use this creative accounting to explain how we are actually returning remittances to the Treasury when we are having difficulty doing that.	92	9
201407	1834	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	And we’d be in much better shape if we could actually be making remittances to the Treasury throughout.	92	9
201407	1835	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	The second is, everybody gets used to everything.	92	9
201407	1836	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We are very used to good, old- fashioned neutral monetary policy.	92	9
201407	1837	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Well, it isn’t neutral.	92	9
201407	1838	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	When you raise the interest rate, you hit housing, you hit investment, and it is not neutral.	92	9
201407	1839	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	It is just something we got used to and talk about it as if it’s neutral, but it isn’t.	92	9
201407	1840	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We face that problem all the time.	92	9
201407	1841	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Fortunately, it is accepted that that’s the way we do business, but we have to make that choice all the time.	92	9
201407	1842	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	And so I think there is some logic to the “let’s keep the MBS until we don’t need them any longer for revenue purposes, and let’s hope that the housing market comes back sooner” approach.	92	9
201407	1843	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Just to go through the questions—number 1, yes, I support the approach to conducting monetary policy during normalization.	92	9
201407	1844	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I would support giving the Chair the authority to make intermeeting—I had written down a series of adjectives and somebody came up with almost the identical set.	92	9
201407	1845	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I said small, technical changes, and we will have to define what is small and technical.	92	9
201407	1846	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	First of all, I trust the judgment of the Chair, and the issue should be if we have to make a change that is “substantive”—I don’t know how you would define that—but where we feel or you feel, the members of the Committee, that we are doing more than just a technical change.	92	9
201407	1847	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Then, we need to have a meeting to discuss that.	92	9
201407	1848	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I would ask the staff, who have been terrific in generating the statements of principles, to think about whether we can find a way of describing that.	92	9
201407	1849	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	The draft directive and postmeeting statement, fine.	92	9
201407	1850	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	The draft statement of normalization principles, also fine.	92	9
201407	1851	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Now, there are things here—I’m sure we’ve done it in the Fed—that a lot of banks do, and institutions do, FAQs, frequently asked questions.	92	9
201407	1852	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	And there are a lot of things around this facility which invite a set of answers to questions that people would ask—many of which questions have arisen around this table, incidentally.	92	9
201407	1853	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	You could go through today’s transcript and find out what people want to know.	92	9
201407	1854	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	So that might be useful.	92	9
201407	1855	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	On the overnight RRP facility, 25 basis points, yes.	92	9
201407	1856	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Circuit breaker, I agree with those people who say it sounds too complicated and too finicky.	92	9
201407	1857	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Propose $500 billion, I guess I would prefer $400 billion, but somewhere around there.	92	9
201407	1858	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I do not think we should go on testing.	92	9
201407	1859	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Too much testing and we’ll get more confused.	92	9
201407	1860	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I mean, everyone will be confused and we will each be all confused.	92	9
201407	1861	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I support going with the system we have now, and those are my answers.	92	9
201407	1862	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	And like everyone else, I really do want to thank the staff.	92	9
201407	1863	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	This is a very difficult set of issues, and it has been distilled to something we have been able to discuss in a very constructive way.	92	9
201407	1864	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1865	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201407	1866	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	92	9
201407	1867	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1868	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	I support both the overall approach to normalization as set forth in the staff memo and also specifically the principles and strategy.	92	9
201407	1869	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Coming into the meeting, I thought that I would have supported either format, although I think Loretta makes a good point that trying to separate principles from tactics in a precise way may actually put too much emphasis on one or too little emphasis on the other and lead to questions as to how seriously committed we are to the so-called tactics.	92	9
201407	1870	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	So I guess I would slightly lean in the direction of the first, more integrated articulation.	92	9
201407	1871	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	I also want to endorse the wise suggestion by the Chair, which I think a lot of you agree with, that we defer a decision on the specific features of an ON RRP facility until we have gathered more information, both by way of testing and—to elaborate on a point that I think Jeff made earlier—that the markets may do a bunch of work for us between now and the time we get to a decision on liftoff, which might make the necessary but limited parameters easier to zero in on.	92	9
201407	1872	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	I’m not sure if Governor Powell said it in this meeting, but he said to me yesterday—he actually thinks a decision will be easier to reach closer to the time of liftoff than it is further in advance.	92	9
201407	1873	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Having had the luxury of listening to almost all of you, to this point, I was struck by the consistency in my reaction to things that all of you said, both in agreement and disagreement.	92	9
201407	1874	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	And that consistency sort of fell under the theme of what I would term the “bias of first impressions.”	92	9
201407	1875	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	And it kind of captures the tension, I think, that Governor Fischer was talking about a moment ago.	92	9
201407	1876	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	I think, as you all know from my June remarks and from the memo that Jay and I sent around, I have been very concerned with the financial stability, financial structure implications of the ON RRP facility.	92	9
201407	1877	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	And many of the suggestions which we made in that memo—some of which might well be, as a technical matter, redundant—were designed to fashion the first impression that people have of the facility, and that is to say, a facility which was bound by a number of constraints and so was highly unlikely to develop into a key ongoing part of financial markets and was highly unlikely to serve as the basis for a business model of a particular kind of money market fund.	92	9
201407	1878	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	But alongside that first impression is the first impression of our liftoff decision.	92	9
201407	1879	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	And as President Williams and Governor Fischer have, I think, very convincingly argued, there is going to be enormous attention and focus on that first move, whether we like it or not.	92	9
201407	1880	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	And we can sit here and say, “Ah, you know, we can adjust later, we don’t need to quite get there right away, we know there will be some movement in rates up and down the yield curve.”	92	9
201407	1881	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	But I do think that, disproportionate to the arguable economic impact of falling somewhat short of the target range will be the reputational harm that is done within a few days of that first move.	92	9
201407	1882	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	You know, for five and a half years I have listened to many of you talk about the importance of credibility of the central bank in a variety of ways.	92	9
201407	1883	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	And this credibility—the credibility of competence, as Governor Fischer was expressing it, I think is really quite important.	92	9
201407	1884	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	That leads me to disagree with some who said that their instinct was to give no discretion to the Chair initially, but potentially to give more discretion over time.	92	9
201407	1885	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	I think, like Governor Fischer, my default position would be giving discretion to the Chair, but I think it’s particularly important that she have some discretion in that first, or perhaps first and second meetings, where we do attempt to raise rates, because as I said a moment ago, that’s where all of the attention is going to be focused.	92	9
201407	1886	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	If the first or first and second meetings are executed in a more or less smooth fashion, there will have been an enormous amount of credibility gained.	92	9
201407	1887	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	And at that point, sort of missing a little bit or taking a little bit more time to get there will not have the repercussions that it will in that first impression.	92	9
201407	1888	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Let me just offer for staff consideration, as they do more work between now and September, a possible compromise.	92	9
201407	1889	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Notwithstanding my own inclination, a possible compromise, as I think Bill was suggesting, might be to say on the ON RRP and IOER rates, we ought to give discretion, but maybe not on caps, or something of the sort.	92	9
201407	1890	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	I would say, though—and I can’t remember who made this observation, but I thought it was a trenchant one—it is probably important to communicate in the Chair’s September press conference and in other arenas our expectation that some measure of fine-tuning may be required as we are lifting off, even in that first meeting.	92	9
201407	1891	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	That is, we are not trying to promise a point- specific, or even a point-within-a-range-specific, outcome with enormous precision.	92	9
201407	1892	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	And I think there would actually, with that kind of advance discussion, be some understanding and acceptance of the proposition that this is a different kind of removal of accommodation than existed pre-crisis.	92	9
201407	1893	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Not so much that it seems as though we are being fuzzy about what we are going to try to achieve, but at least enough to give us a bit of an insurance policy in advance and also to communicate the fact that this is a different kind of exercise.	92	9
201407	1894	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	The next point is that I think President Rosengren and others have raised an interesting issue about the simplicity of a single cap versus the complexity of having multiple caps.	92	9
201407	1895	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	I am somewhat—somewhat—sympathetic to the argument that, again, in actual terms—that is, objective terms—setting a relatively low aggregate cap of the sort Governor Powell and I suggested should limit the potential for the other things we are worried about.	92	9
201407	1896	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	I think we fashioned that, as John put it, “belt-and-suspenders” approach in substantial part in order to affect the first impression that people were getting.	92	9
201407	1897	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	I do think, with the addition to the policy statement that was made over the last couple of days, that there will be some help from that principle or tactic, whatever it is, in supporting the idea that this is a confined facility.	92	9
201407	1898	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	And thus, we may not need all of those safeguards that Jay and I suggested.	92	9
201407	1899	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to that statement of intention, I am going to, I think, simultaneously try to give Dennis a little comfort but also suggest why I would still have some discomfort with relying only on that statement of intention and not bringing the cap down.	92	9
201407	1900	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Speaking as a lawyer, I would be quite comfortable arguing the case on behalf of a future Committee that there was some need to continue to have the ON RRP because it was necessary to ensure monetary policy control, given one’s conception of what monetary policy control meant.	92	9
201407	1901	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	You would need, in order to make a convincing case, to be able to point to some specific things that were happening that buttressed that case.	92	9
201407	1902	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	As we sit here now, this statement will, I think, be an important signal.	92	9
201407	1903	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	But it shouldn’t be regarded by us as an absolute commitment, as it would be if we said we are going to phase it out at a specific point, either when the federal funds rate was at a certain point or on a certain date.	92	9
201407	1904	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	That is also, though, the reason why I’ve thought that we still need a cap, and we need a cap that we are comfortable with because we don’t—at least I don’t want us to be in the position, some years from now, of being told by our staff that is trying just to be straightforward and do a good job, “Look, we have got a level of activity in this arena right now that is sufficiently large, that if you try to pull back on this facility, it could have some consequences in markets which will complicate your overall task of achieving the dual mandate.”	92	9
201407	1905	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	I will end with just the point on testing.	92	9
201407	1906	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	I think one of Governor Fischer’s many important points was that we probably don’t want to mess around too much with too many tests in too many contexts, because, as he said, that will confuse the markets and probably us.	92	9
201407	1907	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	I do think, as many of you have suggested, some additional testing with features more like what we imagine the facility would look like at liftoff will be very useful in helping us to make that decision.	92	9
201407	1908	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	I would urge that the initial testing parameters be set, at least with respect to the aggregate cap—what Governor Powell and I suggested was $300 billion—on the theory that that is the first impression that markets and others will get.	92	9
201407	1909	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	And if we learn over the course of the next six or nine months that, as Vice Chairman Dudley anticipated, there is actually going to be too much hitting of the cap in that process, that allows us to think either about spreads or caps or both, or some other feature, and then to make a decision later on.	92	9
201407	1910	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	But I feel it would be better advised to go in that direction rather than to start with something that looks larger, which will impress upon markets that the FOMC intends this to be a pretty big thing.	92	9
201407	1911	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	My final comment is I do think that we are going to get the benefit of a lot of reaction, perhaps more in some forms beyond what we think is, strictly speaking, helpful.	92	9
201407	1912	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	But as we include, as I would urge, the existence of an ON RRP facility in our principles, with the kind of qualifications that are included in here, and as the Chair elaborates a little bit, I presume, at her press conference in September about this, and maybe makes further reference to it in speeches or testimony, we are going to elicit a bunch of reaction and commentary.	92	9
201407	1913	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Markets, analysts are going to start masticating whatever it is that she says, whatever it is that comes out in the minutes.	92	9
201407	1914	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	And I think over the course of the next 6 to 9 or 12, however many months it ends up being, we actually will learn a lot, and I think we should learn a lot.	92	9
201407	1915	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	My guess is we will learn pretty much what we would have learned through some more formalized processes, and without needing to worry about whether we’re setting precedents about a notice and comment approach to monetary policy.	92	9
201407	1916	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201407	1917	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201407	1918	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	92	9
201407	1919	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	Let me start with aggregate caps, and I commit that I will come in under a 500-word cap, given how late we are in the process.	92	9
201407	1920	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	Generally speaking, I support finalizing a plan to be announced in September that addresses the key elements of a monetary policy normalization framework.	92	9
201407	1921	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	I think it’s really important to send a signal that careful preparations are underway for the normalization of the stance and conduct of monetary policy once the data warrant it.	92	9
201407	1922	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	I put a very high premium on establishing, at the outset, the credibility of our ability to execute that plan, and everything follows from that.	92	9
201407	1923	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	Due to the unprecedented size of reserves in the system, I think it is critically important to demonstrate at the very outset that we can exert effective monetary control as we come off the zero lower bound.	92	9
201407	1924	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	I have to say, I didn’t actually understand the line of reasoning being pursued earlier that it might not matter if we fail to hit the target range for the federal funds rate, and that we could simply keep trying until we did.	92	9
201407	1925	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	Given that we are in completely uncharted territory, and there is substantial concern and commentary in the markets, and, more broadly, that we won’t be able to achieve our stated goals, it seems to me to be of utmost importance that market participants have full confidence at the outset that we can effectively influence the path of short-term rates.	92	9
201407	1926	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	I think we only have to look around the world at recent episodes in which central banks have failed to do that to see how very costly it is to regain credibility after a misstep.	92	9
201407	1927	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	So I would prefer to start more cautiously and widen over time, rather than the reverse, which some have suggested, of starting a little looser, experimenting, and then thinking we can get tighter.	92	9
201407	1928	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	The critical importance of credible execution leads me to strongly support continuing with a range as opposed to a point target for the federal funds rate.	92	9
201407	1929	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, I would support maintaining the federal funds rate as the focus, recognizing that this market is fairly unusual and thinly traded at the moment.	92	9
201407	1930	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, there are substantial benefits, I think, in maintaining a policy framework that is familiar under circumstances that are, in all other respects, not at all familiar.	92	9
201407	1931	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	Second, the critical importance of establishing credibility argues strongly for employing the overnight reverse repo facility as a floor during the launch and initial stages, while making clear this is a subsidiary tool to the IOER.	92	9
201407	1932	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	The concerns that have been stated here, I think, are very real—concerns about ensuring that this instrument is designed in a way that its presence doesn’t alter the market structure, and it doesn’t amplify run risk.	92	9
201407	1933	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	It strikes me that the proposal on the table does the appropriate balancing between the need for effective monetary control and avoiding those two very important risks.	92	9
201407	1934	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, I think the language that has been artfully crafted to establish clearly at the outset that the overnight reverse repo facility will be used only to the extent and for the duration necessary to exercise effective monetary policy control is very important.	92	9
201407	1935	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	The proposal for an aggregate cap, together with the ability to widen the spread, and then the language that I just referenced, adequately addresses the financial-stability and market structure risks.	92	9
201407	1936	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	I agree with the Chair’s suggestion to defer questions on the size of the cap, pending further analysis once the decision here is clear.	92	9
201407	1937	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	With regard to the spread, I think the proposed initial one-for-one correspondence between the target range for the federal funds rate and the spread between the IOER and the overnight reverse repo rates has a certain appealing elegance.	92	9
201407	1938	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, I would at least presume that we have in mind that over time, as reserve balances diminish, that increasingly the federal funds rate is going to trade closer to the top of that range, increasingly anchored by the IOER, and that we will progressively widen the spread between IOER and the overnight reverse repo rates in order to further downplay the role of the latter rate, even as we might over time be tightening the range for the federal funds rate, so as to gradually phase out this facility altogether.	92	9
201407	1939	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	With regard to intermeeting adjustments, the proposal to delegate authority to the Chair seems to me eminently practical.	92	9
201407	1940	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	The one thing that I would suggest, having listened to the intensity of this engagement for two meetings now, and to the very good questions that are being raised, is that I think it might be valuable to provide the participants, the Committee members, an opportunity to get on the phone or a videoconference to consult in advance, not for decisionmaking purposes, but so as to give members of this Committee more of a real-time sense of how the markets are adjusting to the monetary policy framework at moments when it isn’t actually performing as was anticipated or projected.	92	9
201407	1941	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	Finally, on the reinvestment, I think the language gets it just about right.	92	9
201407	1942	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	I read it as preserving constructive ambiguity to have the debate about sales versus runoff at a later date.	92	9
201407	1943	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	I think the real news here is to clarify that liftoff will take place before reinvestment ceases.	92	9
201407	1944	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	And that too, I think, follows very straightforwardly and compellingly from the critical importance of reestablishing effective monetary control.	92	9
201407	1945	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	I think that sequence is just a logical follow-on from the primacy that we are placing on monetary control.	92	9
201407	1946	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	That’s it.	92	9
201407	1947	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Well, thank you, everybody.	92	9
201407	1948	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I really appreciate your comments.	92	9
201407	1949	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I think we have had another productive discussion, and obviously a wide range of views have been expressed.	92	9
201407	1950	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	To wrap up, I thought I might try to summarize where I think we stand.	92	9
201407	1951	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	On the approach to normalization, I heard widespread support for the overall approach that staff have proposed.	92	9
201407	1952	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	That includes retaining the federal funds rate as our key policy rate and continuing to target a 25 basis point range for this rate during the process of normalization.	92	9
201407	1953	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I also heard considerable support for using IOER as our main tool to raise and control rates.	92	9
201407	1954	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Initially, we would set this rate at the top of our target range for the federal funds rate, but we certainly could make adjustments over time, if necessary, to help keep the federal funds rate within the target range.	92	9
201407	1955	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	On redemptions, I think the majority seems comfortable ceasing reinvestment after liftoff rather than before, but I certainly heard a few of you who think the opposite:  Ceasing reinvestment first is the better approach.	92	9
201407	1956	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Views on the use of the overnight RRP facility were passionate and mixed, but I think there is broad support for the notion that the facility should play some role—although a carefully calibrated one—in the normalization process in order to improve our control over the funds rate.	92	9
201407	1957	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I think many of you agree, and I would concur, that the presumption should be that the overnight RRP facility will not be permanent, and that our communications need to reflect that, as in the revised normalization principles document that staff circulated.	92	9
201407	1958	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I think your concerns about the facility incline most of you to keep the overall size of the facility on the smaller end of the spectrum, but the size should be sufficient to afford some control over rates.	92	9
201407	1959	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I think where we have come out is that we have agreed that we have a bit of time before we need to set numerical parameters, and that we can benefit from further analysis and testing and come back to this, and also perhaps reconsider, especially if we end up with a somewhat lower cap, whether we actually need two caps, both an overall cap and also a dynamic cap.	92	9
201407	1960	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to the spread between IOER and the overnight RRP rates, I heard support for a relatively wide spread, as proposed by the staff, and it is something that will also serve to limit the size of the facility.	92	9
201407	1961	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Now, conceivably, as many of you pointed out, the spread can be wider, it may be possible for it to be wider than the 25 basis points proposed by the staff.	92	9
201407	1962	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Several of you suggested experimenting right at the outset with a wider spread to see if the facility is even necessary to establish a floor on the funds rate.	92	9
201407	1963	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	It is conceivable that moving up IOER alone might suffice.	92	9
201407	1964	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I have to say my own preference is to avoid experimentation on day one and instead to set the overnight RRP rate at the floor of our target range.	92	9
201407	1965	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	And, like a number of other speakers, I consider it very important, too, at the outset of the tightening process to ensure that the funds rate moves up rapidly into our new target range so that liftoff occurs smoothly.	92	9
201407	1966	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I think after six years of near-zero interest rates, and as President Williams pointed out, chronic concerns among many that our balance sheet is simply too large for us to control short- term rates, I do believe we need to convincingly demonstrate that we, as we have long emphasized, actually have the tools and the technical expertise to control short-term interest rates.	92	9
201407	1967	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	And so I see making sure that the funds rate moves up into our new target range as important.	92	9
201407	1968	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	So to me, experimentation in those first days after policy tightening is something that could prove immensely costly.	92	9
201407	1969	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I recognize that, conceivably, we could design our communications to explain that the initial phase of liftoff would involve experimentation and to set market expectations accordingly, not to expect a rapid move-up in the funds rate and some experimentation.	92	9
201407	1970	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	But I believe it would be very challenging.	92	9
201407	1971	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	That said, I do see the potential for experimentation to determine whether or not we can diminish the role of the facility and widen the spread as the tightening process proceeds.	92	9
201407	1972	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	And over time, I think we can consider allowing the spread to widen as a disincentive for the facility’s use.	92	9
201407	1973	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	But clearly, there are a wide range of opinions here, and I think this is an area in which more debate is probably going to be necessary before deciding what we should do.	92	9
201407	1974	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Regarding testing, I think most of you think it’s prudent to test the new features of the overnight RRP facility later this year to prepare market participants to gain experience with the auction structure and caps.	92	9
201407	1975	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I think I heard agreement that our other tools, like the term deposit facility, should be kept in reserve and perhaps referred to in our revised statement.	92	9
201407	1976	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	More generally, I think we all agree on the importance of maintaining flexibility as the normalization process evolves, in case we need to make adjustments along the way.	92	9
201407	1977	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you indicated that you would be willing to delegate to me, as Chair, the authority to make circumscribed or small and technical changes to administered interest rates in order to keep the effective funds rate within the target range set by the Committee, but I certainly did hear a number of you express concerns about such a delegation.	92	9
201407	1978	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Let me be clear that if you were to delegate that decisionmaking to me, I would of course try to consult, if at all feasible, through a call or videoconference with you before making any adjustments.	92	9
201407	1979	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	And in any case, there is no doubt that we would be in close consultation during the initial stages of normalization.	92	9
201407	1980	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Regarding communications, I think I heard general support for the revised version of the normalization principles that were circulated by staff.	92	9
201407	1981	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	There were different views on this, but I did hear quite a bit of support for the revised organization proposed by President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201407	1982	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I think maybe we will come back and circle around with you to try to get a better view about which organization you think is preferable.	92	9
201407	1983	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	In light of today’s discussion, we obviously have a couple of issues concerning the normalization principles still to sort out, so I will ask staff to circulate another revised version of the normalization principles very soon for you to comment on.	92	9
201407	1984	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I very much hope that we can reach agreement on them by the time we are heading into the September meeting, with the expectation that we will be releasing them to the public with the postmeeting policy statement so that I can discuss them in the press conference.	92	9
201407	1985	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	The directive and postmeeting statements, I think I heard some expression that we are off to a good start on that.	92	9
201407	1986	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	And of course we have time to further sort out details.	92	9
201407	1987	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	So that was the set of takeaways that I had, and I would ask, before we end this, if anyone has comments on my summary or whether or not there are further comments.	92	9
201407	1988	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201407	1989	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Madam Chair, I thought that was a very helpful summary of the, as you said yourself, wide range of perspectives we heard.	92	9
201407	1990	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The one question I had is the question that Simon raised during his presentation about the extension of counterparties.	92	9
201407	1991	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Not everyone commented on that, and I was just wondering what the sense of the Committee was on that.	92	9
201407	1992	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I think my sense was that we would wait.	92	9
201407	1993	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	Yes, I think that was clear that we can wait six more weeks.	92	9
201407	1994	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	It takes longer for them to be there, but just to be clear, this is a limited set of money funds and FHLBs who might want to relook at the facility.	92	9
201407	1995	2014-07-30	meeting	POTTER	It’s not an expansion to a different class of counterparties whatsoever.	92	9
201407	1996	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s helpful.	92	9
201407	1997	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	92	9
201407	1998	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	2	2
201407	1999	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	2	2
201407	2000	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Let me just state that this concludes our Board meeting, and now we’re just an FOMC meeting.	2	2
201407	2001	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	That’s plenty, but that’s it.	2	2
201407	2002	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	The next thing is, we have a little bit of the changing of the guard at the table, and we’ll go to the staff now and turn to economic and financial developments.	2	2
201407	2003	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	We will take a 15-minute break, and then we’ll return.	2	2
201407	2004	2014-07-30	meeting		[Coffee break]	2	2
201407	2005	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	2	2
201407	2006	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Let me turn things over to David Wilcox for discussion of the forecast.	11	1
201407	2007	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11	1
201407	2008	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	I’ll be referring to the one-page exhibit labeled “Material for Forecast Summary.”	11	1
201407	2009	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Social media being all the rage these days, I thought I’d demonstrate my agility by climbing aboard a mere decade or so after the fact and try my hand at composing the Twitter version of the Tealbook that we sent you last week.	11	1
201407	2010	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	I think it would go something like this:  “US economy looks to have been running warmer than earlier thought, not cooler; we’ve extended that better trend into the future a bit.”	11	1
201407	2011	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	That’s 133 characters, including spaces, even with the typical staff qualifier “a bit.”	11	1
201407	2012	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	I could stop there, but lest you think I’m going to let you off easy, let me dash your hopes immediately.	11	1
201407	2013	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	If all you knew about the US economy lately was the information that we have about GDP growth in the first half of this year, you would probably be mighty confused by the Twitter version of the Tealbook.	11	1
201407	2014	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	After all, as you can see from the first panel of your forecast summary exhibit, the data flow since the June Tealbook points to a sizable downward revision to real GDP growth in the first half of this year, to just ¼ percent at an annual rate, 1 percentage point lower than our June projection.	11	1
201407	2015	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	To make a long story short—though not quite Twitter length—we ultimately decided to treat that reading on GDP in the first half essentially as if it were driven by measurement error and on that rationale left our growth estimates for the second half and later mostly unrevised.	11	1
201407	2016	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Dave Stockton became famous for his remark at one of these meetings in 2004 that the staff forecast he was presenting then had a half-life shorter than a jar of mayonnaise in the Mojave Desert.	11	1
201407	2017	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Our forecast this time could make Stockton’s look like the Moai statues on Easter Island by comparison, because we are scheduled to be proven wrong at 8:30 tomorrow morning [laughter], when the BEA will publish its first estimate of second-quarter GDP, together with the annual revision to the national accounts three years back.	11	1
201407	2018	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	In contrast to the latest readings on GDP, the news on the labor market has, on balance, surprised us to the upside.	11	1
201407	2019	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	In the establishment survey, the level of payroll employment in June was 90,000 higher than our previous Tealbook forecast.	11	1
201407	2020	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	In the household survey, as shown in panel 2 of your exhibit, the unemployment rate in June came in 0.2 percentage point below our previous projection.	11	1
201407	2021	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Long-term unemployment has come down, initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits have been low, and job openings have moved up.	11	1
201407	2022	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	As a result, even though the labor force participation rate held steady rather than edging up as we’d projected, we judge overall labor market conditions to have improved, and our black-box summary measure of 19 labor market indicators concurs with that view.	11	1
201407	2023	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	The labor market data were not alone in pointing to a stronger pace of expansion.	11	1
201407	2024	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	For example, while the NIPA data imply a plunge in industrial-sector output in the first quarter, our own industrial production index posted a respectable gain over the same period (and the statistical evidence suggests that when such gaps have opened up in the past, the NIPA-based measure tends to correct toward the IP index rather than the other way around).	11	1
201407	2025	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	With stronger IP growth than we’d expected, second- quarter manufacturing capacity utilization is now running a little tighter than we had projected.	11	1
201407	2026	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	More broadly, business surveys including the national surveys of purchasing managers and your own regional surveys have generally been quite upbeat, not at all consistent with essentially flat GDP during the first half.	11	1
201407	2027	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Based on these considerations, we concluded that slack in the economy is probably being taken up a little more quickly than we thought in June.	11	1
201407	2028	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Moreover, especially in light of the repeated downside surprises in the unemployment rate that we’ve experienced over the past couple of years, we penciled in a slightly faster rate of uptake for the period ahead.	11	1
201407	2029	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	With weaker measured GDP growth but a judgment that resource utilization was running tighter than anticipated, we were compelled to adjust down our estimate of potential GDP in 2014.	11	1
201407	2030	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	The result is that we have potential GDP growth averaging zero this year.	11	1
201407	2031	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We don’t take this estimate terribly seriously as a gauge of how quickly the sustainable capacity of the economy is expanding, but instead see it as subsuming whatever measurement error is present in GDP, thereby achieving the larger purpose of delivering to you an estimate of the output gap that better conforms with our assessment of how much economic slack remains to be taken up.	11	1
201407	2032	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	The net result is shown in panel 3, which plots the GDP gaps from the July and June Tealbooks.	11	1
201407	2033	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see, we now estimate that the GDP gap—like its unemployment-based cousin—will close about a year from now, three calendar quarters earlier than we figured in the June Tealbook.	11	1
201407	2034	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Although the effect on medium-term GDP growth is small, I would also note that monetary policy is projected to be a little less accommodative in this forecast.	11	1
201407	2035	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	While we have maintained our assumption that asset purchases will end in the fourth quarter of this year and have likewise left in place our mechanical assumption that the federal funds rate will be set in accordance with the inertial Taylor (1999) rule starting two quarters after that, the narrower output gap in this forecast and slightly higher inflation rate cause the Taylor rule to deliver a funds rate path that is roughly 25 basis points higher than before by the end of next year and roughly 50 basis points higher by the end of 2016.	11	1
201407	2036	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Panels 4 and 5 summarize the inflation outlook.	11	1
201407	2037	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see in panel 4, our near-term forecast calls for a little more headline PCE inflation than we previously thought.	11	1
201407	2038	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Some of this upward revision is attributable to a higher path for food and energy prices, but the contour of futures prices leads us to expect the bulge in consumer food and energy price inflation to be relatively short-lived.	11	1
201407	2039	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	The incoming data on core PCE inflation—as shown in panel 5—have also surprised us a little to the upside.	11	1
201407	2040	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	In 2015 and 2016, we nudged up our forecast for core inflation by 0.1 percentage point, in light of the narrower margin of slack in this projection.	11	1
201407	2041	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	As in previous Tealbooks, we expect core PCE inflation to increase slowly over the projection period, from 1.6 percent this year to 1.8 percent in 2016.	11	1
201407	2042	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Headline PCE inflation is expected to run about ¼ percentage point below the core after 2014, mostly reflecting small projected declines in consumer energy prices.	11	1
201407	2043	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	As always, numerous risks and sources of uncertainty attend our activity and inflation projections.	11	1
201407	2044	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	One characterization of this uncertainty is provided by the forecast confidence intervals that are shown in this exhibit and in the Tealbook.	11	1
201407	2045	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	But I was particularly enamored of the specific risks that were sprinkled throughout the Tealbook document, both in various boxes and in our traditional alternative simulations.	11	1
201407	2046	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	I’ve listed four of them in panel 6.	11	1
201407	2047	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	In the latest installment of our “Alternative View” franchise, Eric Engen and Michael Palumbo highlight the possibility that the economy could be persistently stuck in a low-growth expectations trap, and that a dramatic change in policy regime may be required to jolt the expansion onto a more satisfactory trajectory.	11	1
201407	2048	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	In the “Risks and Uncertainty” section of the Tealbook, a pair of scenarios attempts to bookend the risks around our assessment of resource utilization.	11	1
201407	2049	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	In the one labeled “Stronger Activity with Higher Inflation,” we posit a world in which the unemployment rate continues to decline more in line with its recent pace rather than flattening out as we have it in the baseline, and inflation proves at the same time more sensitive to the increase in resource utilization.	11	1
201407	2050	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Alternatively, in the scenario labeled “Weaker Household Demand,” we examine the possibility that the first-quarter readings on GDP and GDI turn out to be sending the truer signal about the momentum of the expansion, and that a substantially more accommodative stance of policy will be required to achieve your dual mandate.	11	1
201407	2051	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	And, to illustrate the role that model uncertainty plays in our assessment of potential risks, we included a box in the Tealbook that analyzed the consequences of a disruption to credit markets using both FRB/US and a DSGE model with financial frictions.	11	1
201407	2052	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	While we cannot claim that these various alternatives exhaust—or even bound—the full set of outcomes that are possible over the next few years, we do think that they provide a reasonable indication of the considerable uncertainty that we face as forecasters and that you face as policymakers.	11	1
201407	2053	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Steve Kamin will continue our presentation.	11	1
201407	2054	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	I’ll be referring to the handout labeled “Material for the Foreign Outlook.”	11	1
201407	2055	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	From a political perspective, the world appears unusually turbulent at present.	11	1
201407	2056	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	The conflict in Ukraine has deepened, with the United States and Europe imposing further sanctions on Russia even before the downing of the Malaysian airliner.	11	1
201407	2057	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	The Islamist group ISIS now occupies a third of Iraq and is threatening Baghdad.	11	1
201407	2058	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	And although its links to global markets are less direct, the violence in Gaza continues unabated.	11	1
201407	2059	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	Even so, as Simon has described, investors have largely shrugged off these developments, with implied volatility in stock markets and risk spreads in credit markets at very low levels, while crude oil prices remain in their recent range.	11	1
201407	2060	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	To be sure, our baseline forecast for the global economy is reasonably benign, as we assume none of the economic risks that could be posed by these political problems will materialize in a significant fashion.	11	1
201407	2061	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	However, we are surprised that markets haven’t reacted more to these concerns.	11	1
201407	2062	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	Turning to that baseline, at the time of your June meeting, we were highly focused on the first-quarter pothole in foreign growth, shown in panel 1 of your exhibit.	11	1
201407	2063	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	As indicated in panel 2, the pothole was concentrated in the emerging market economies, or EMEs, as growth in China, other emerging Asian economies, and Brazil slowed sharply, while the Mexican economy continued to languish.	11	1
201407	2064	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	In the absence of clear and fundamental drivers of the slowdown, we judged the soft patch to be temporary.	11	1
201407	2065	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	In the event, the data received since your previous meeting have generally borne out our forecast.	11	1
201407	2066	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	Perhaps most importantly, Chinese GDP growth has picked up from 5½ percent in the first quarter to an estimated 7¾ percent in the second, even stronger than we’d projected, as the trade surplus bounced back and the economy responded to a steady stream of fiscal and monetary stimulus measures.	11	1
201407	2067	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	Partly as a result, activity in most of China’s emerging market neighbors also appears to have accelerated.	11	1
201407	2068	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	Meanwhile, on this side of the Pacific, we estimate the Mexican economy shook off its year-long torpor and grew at 3 percent in the second quarter as US manufacturing demand picked up, the effect of prior tax hikes waned, and a long-standing slump in construction began to ease.	11	1
201407	2069	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	All told, the rate of expansion in the EMEs bounced back to over 3½ percent in the second quarter.	11	1
201407	2070	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	Assuming that the United States and other advanced economies perform as projected, EME growth should level out next year at its trend pace of slightly below 4½ percent.	11	1
201407	2071	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	As shown in panel 3, the advanced foreign economies appear to have experienced a mini-pothole of their own in the second quarter.	11	1
201407	2072	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	However, this was largely an expected consequence of the April consumption tax hike in Japan, which is estimated to have lowered GDP more than 5 percent.	11	1
201407	2073	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	The most recent data on consumer spending and manufacturing for Japan have been reasonably favorable, and we believe Japanese GDP will start growing again in the current quarter.	11	1
201407	2074	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	With Canada having shaken off the effects of an unusually harsh winter and the UK economy slated to continue its solid expansion, the main question for the advanced foreign economies centers around the euro area.	11	1
201407	2075	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	Recent economic performance in the euro area has been decidedly mixed, and credit conditions remain tight.	11	1
201407	2076	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, we continue to project rather weak, sub– 2 percent growth for the region.	11	1
201407	2077	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	Even so, we think it likely that the recovery will stay more or less on track.	11	1
201407	2078	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	For starters, we do not anticipate the region falling into deflation, though that remains a risk.	11	1
201407	2079	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	Substantial resource slack and falling retail energy prices have pushed the 12-month inflation rate down to a dismally low ½ percent, but energy prices are rising again, and as the output gap narrows, overall inflation should pick up as well.	11	1
201407	2080	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	Nor do we see the troubles with Portugal’s Banco Espírito Santo, described by Simon in his briefing, as threatening substantial disruptions.	11	1
201407	2081	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	The bank is quite small—accounting for less than ½ percent of the total assets of euro-area banks—and its problems appear too idiosyncratic to trigger contagion to other institutions.	11	1
201407	2082	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	Outside of the euro area, the main risks to our forecast of solid but unspectacular foreign growth appear to be in the emerging market economies.	11	1
201407	2083	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	Coming a little more than a year after the start of the taper tantrum, this struck us as a good time to assess whether the likelihood of one key risk—a deep and broad-based EME financial crisis—has risen or declined.	11	1
201407	2084	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	All told, the results of our assessment are mixed.	11	1
201407	2085	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	Panel 4 displays our index of the fundamental vulnerabilities of the 13 EMEs we track closely.	11	1
201407	2086	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	This index improved only a touch between 2013 and 2014, and not at all for the so-called fragile five EMEs.	11	1
201407	2087	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	Despite this lack of significant progress on fundamentals, however, EMBI credit spreads, the red line in panel 5, have now returned to their pre–taper tantrum levels.	11	1
201407	2088	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	This raises the question of whether investors have again become too complacent about EME risks, increasing the likelihood of disruptive corrections down the road.	11	1
201407	2089	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	All that said, we see some reasons for judging the glass to be half full rather than half empty.	11	1
201407	2090	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	To begin with, as shown by the blue line in panel 5, the share of investment-fund assets devoted to EMEs declined after May of last year and remains subdued, despite some pickup from earlier this year.	11	1
201407	2091	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	As shown in panel 6, real effective exchange rates for the fragile five are now lower than they were at the start of the taper tantrum.	11	1
201407	2092	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	This depreciation should bolster investor confidence by reducing current account deficits, strengthening growth, and muting expectations that further depreciation will be needed in the future.	11	1
201407	2093	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	Finally, as indicated in panel 7, central banks in the most vulnerable economies have raised their policy rates, albeit to varying extents, over the past year, which should help tamp down inflation, support currency values, and thus also instill confidence.	11	1
201407	2094	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	Nevertheless, these improvements are not enough to take off the table the risk of a widespread EME crisis.	11	1
201407	2095	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	One possible trigger for such a crisis is the normalization of monetary policies in the United States and other advanced economies.	11	1
201407	2096	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	It is not clear why such a highly anticipated event should disrupt global financial markets, but we cannot be certain that markets are fully pricing in the future paths of advanced- economy monetary policies.	11	1
201407	2097	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	Another possible trigger would be a hard landing in China.	11	1
201407	2098	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	Due to its increasing prominence as an importer of both primary commodities and intermediate manufactures, a financial crisis and resultant sharp economic slowdown in China could have severe ramifications for the emerging market economies more generally.	11	1
201407	2099	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	In the QS Assessment of Financial Stability that was distributed to the FOMC last week, we considered two China-crisis scenarios, depicted in your next exhibit.	11	1
201407	2100	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	In the first scenario, a crisis and recession lower Chinese GDP growth to only 2 percent in 2015.	11	1
201407	2101	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	In turn, as shown by the green line in panel 1, spillovers through normal trade and commodity price channels lead to a sharp slowing of aggregate EME growth; as shown in panel 2, this leads to a discernable but limited hit to US activity.	11	1
201407	2102	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	In the second scenario, depicted by the red lines in both panels, China’s hard landing not only spills abroad through standard trade channels, but it also induces a surge in investor risk aversion that triggers financial crises in many EMEs and severe disruptions in the United States and other advanced-economy markets.	11	1
201407	2103	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	In this scenario, which was also presented in the Tealbook, growth falls by considerably more in both the United States and the EMEs.	11	1
201407	2104	2014-07-30	meeting	KAMIN	On this happy note, David Bowman will continue our presentation.	11	1
201407	2105	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	Thank you.	11	1
201407	2106	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	I will be providing an overview of the QS Assessment of Financial Stability.	FS	FS
201407	2107	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	We continue to see the overall vulnerability of the financial system as moderate, given the slow growth of credit within the nonfinancial sector and the relatively strong capital positions of US banks and subdued use of maturity transformation and leverage within the financial system.	FS	FS
201407	2108	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	Nevertheless, low and declining risk premiums and loosening standards in a number of markets raise the possibility of an eventual correction in asset valuations.	FS	FS
201407	2109	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	The pattern of steadily declining spreads on riskier assets has continued since April.	FS	FS
201407	2110	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	I’ll begin with a review of corporate debt markets.	FS	FS
201407	2111	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	As shown by the black line in panel 1 in the handout titled “Material for Briefing on Financial Stability Developments,” spreads on high-yield corporate bonds have fallen a bit further over the past few months, despite a recent uptick.	FS	FS
201407	2112	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	The red line, which adjusts for a staff estimate of expected default, indicates that risk premiums in this market have also declined, but they still remain above their lowest levels in the late 1990s.	FS	FS
201407	2113	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	Issuance of high-yield debt, the dark blue bars in the panel to the right, has continued to be robust, as has issuance of leveraged loans, the light blue bars.	FS	FS
201407	2114	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	Roughly half of the recently issued high-yield bonds and institutional leveraged loans are being used for purposes other than refinancing, and underwriting standards have continued to weaken.	FS	FS
201407	2115	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	For example, the debt multiples involved in recent leveraged buyout deals, shown in dark blue in the middle-left panel, have edged above their levels in 2005 and 2006, although as shown by the red line, the equity stake in these deals has been relatively stable.	FS	FS
201407	2116	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	More broadly, despite the Federal Reserve’s guidance, we have thus far seen no evidence that banks have in aggregate pulled back from originating riskier deals or that activity is shifting significantly to nonbank lenders.	FS	FS
201407	2117	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	In equity markets, prices have increased a further 6 percent since April, but while certain sectors may be overstretched, we have less concern about the equity market as a whole.	FS	FS
201407	2118	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	As seen to the right, the staff estimate of the equity premium, in red, is still reasonably high.	FS	FS
201407	2119	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	In contrast, the VIX index of implied volatility in the S&P 500, shown in black in the bottom-left panel, is quite low, but our concerns about this are to some extent ameliorated by the fact that realized and implied volatilities generally tend to be low during economic recoveries and that options at longer maturities indicate a still-healthy price of longer-term downside risk.	FS	FS
201407	2120	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	For example, the red line in the panel measures the price of insuring against a 10 percent decline in stock prices over the next year and has been fairly steady near its long-term average over the past two years.	FS	FS
201407	2121	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	Even so, the near uniformity of declines in short-term implied volatilities across markets may reflect an underpricing of risk and some complacency on the part of market participants.	FS	FS
201407	2122	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	The black line to the right shows that a composite index of implied volatilities across global equities, rates, currencies, and commodities is at an all-time low, and it is difficult to fathom why implied volatilities for oil, the red line, should be so low when Iraq is in an internal war, tensions with Russia are elevated, and Israel and Hamas are in open conflict.	FS	FS
201407	2123	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	Your next exhibit discusses the factors that contribute to our assessment that, despite these apparent signs of valuation pressures in some markets, the overall vulnerability of the financial system is judged to be moderate.	FS	FS
201407	2124	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	While leverage ratios for speculative-grade and unrated firms, the red line in the top-left panel, are above average levels, overall leverage in the nonfinancial business sector as a whole, shown in black, remains low by historical standards.	FS	FS
201407	2125	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	In addition, net borrowing by prime and superprime households, shown in the panel to the right, has risen only modestly in recent quarters, and there has been no net borrowing by subprime households.	FS	FS
201407	2126	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	The banking sector is also in relatively strong shape.	FS	FS
201407	2127	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	Reliance on wholesale funding by large bank holding companies, the black line in the middle-left panel, is substantially lower than in the mid-2000s, while Tier 1 common capital ratios (the red line) have continued to increase.	FS	FS
201407	2128	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	In addition, leverage in other parts of the financial sector appears to be fairly stable.	FS	FS
201407	2129	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	For example, as shown in the panel to the right, dealer responses to the most recent SCOOS indicate that the use of leverage by some of their clients—hedge funds, real estate investment trusts, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds—has changed little in recent months.	FS	FS
201407	2130	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	That said, separate data from prime brokers suggest that the use of leverage by hedge funds remains elevated, and overall levels of securitization, while still moderate, have been picking up especially in CLOs and to some extent CMBS.	FS	FS
201407	2131	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	While we take comfort from the relatively low levels of maturity transformation and leverage, any market correction could be magnified by sales of relatively illiquid assets.	FS	FS
201407	2132	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	As shown in the bottom-left panel, flows into mutual funds investing in less liquid assets, including corporate and emerging market debt, have continued to increase.	FS	FS
201407	2133	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	As we have discussed before, most of those flows began during the recovery and there is a danger that investors are ill prepared to expect potential losses and that they might pull out rapidly if a downturn occurred.	FS	FS
201407	2134	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	In addition, data from the CFTC (not shown) suggest that some institutional investors are taking long positions in interest rate derivatives, increasing their exposures to rate risk.	FS	FS
201407	2135	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	These risks would be compounded if term premiums in Treasury bonds, shown to the right, were to rebound or if market participants were to substantially increase their expectations for the future path of short-term rates.	FS	FS
201407	2136	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	Your last exhibit provides a summary of our overall assessment and of current policy initiatives.	FS	FS
201407	2137	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	As noted, although we consider the risk of a correction to have increased given the downward momentum in and comparatively low levels of risk premiums in some markets, we believe that the overall vulnerability of the financial system remains moderate given the fairly strong positions of household and corporate balance sheets and the relatively contained use of maturity transformation and leverage by the financial sector.	FS	FS
201407	2138	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	Nonetheless, the current environment of low volatility and low risk premiums may encourage greater risk-taking and leverage , and we will remain attuned to any deterioration.	FS	FS
201407	2139	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	On the policy front, the staff continues to pursue initiatives related to the specific vulnerabilities that we have identified.	FS	FS
201407	2140	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	Regarding leveraged loans, public data suggest that the terms and structures of new deals have continued to deteriorate despite the issuance of guidance and follow-up supervisory letters last year.	FS	FS
201407	2141	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	Currently, supervisors are engaged in completing the Shared National Credit (SNC) examinations, which are heavily focused on leveraged loans and the degree to which domestic and foreign banks are complying with the guidance.	FS	FS
201407	2142	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	The findings of the SNC exams are expected to be available in mid-August for the purposes of providing feedback to firms.	FS	FS
201407	2143	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	Regarding the potential effects on banks of a sharp rebound in interest rates, the staff is conducting a study of interest rate risk at six of the largest bank holding companies.	FS	FS
201407	2144	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	Firms were asked to revalue their trading books in a number of different scenarios for interest rates, and information also was gathered on the counterparties to these risk exposures.	FS	FS
201407	2145	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	This work should be able to both identify banks’ vulnerabilities and determine whether there are any key counterparties who have built up significant interest rate risk exposures with one or more of these banks.	FS	FS
201407	2146	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	Regarding flows into funds and less liquid assets, we are also continuing work with the FSB and IOSCO in understanding the risks related to exchange-traded funds under stressed market conditions.	FS	FS
201407	2147	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	Finally, last week the SEC issued a rule to reform money market funds.	FS	FS
201407	2148	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	The rule mandates that, within about two years, prime institutional funds float their net asset values, or NAVs.	FS	FS
201407	2149	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	The rule also contains provisions for the discretionary imposition of gates or redemption fees by fund boards in the event that a fund faces severe liquidity pressures.	FS	FS
201407	2150	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	The staff views the floating NAV requirement as a step forward but is concerned that discretionary fees and gates could be destabilizing.	FS	FS
201407	2151	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	The net effect for financial stability could depend, in part, on the extent to which the more run-prone institutional investors move away from prime money funds to other cash- management strategies, and the risks that may be posed by those strategies.	FS	FS
201407	2152	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	The Financial Stability Oversight Council currently is reviewing the proposal.	FS	FS
201407	2153	2014-07-30	meeting	BOWMAN	That concludes our remarks.	FS	FS
201407	2154	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for the staff?	12	1
201407	2155	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	12	1
201407	2156	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	This is a question for David Wilcox.	12	1
201407	2157	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I notice that in the Tealbook you basically assumed that the weakness in health-care spending is going to be temporary, and then you adjusted your potential growth accordingly.	12	1
201407	2158	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	We have a lot of business contacts from health care in our District, and they think there may be something more fundamental going on.	12	1
201407	2159	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Revenue growth at hospitals is way down, and one contact said there’s consumerism going on and, even though there’s the Affordable Care Act, people are now shopping for medical care and may be refraining from taking procedures.	12	1
201407	2160	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	So I was wondering, if you assumed in the Tealbook that it was a more permanent decline in the rate of spending on medical care, how would that show up in the forecast?	12	1
201407	2161	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Would it basically be a reduction in GDP growth?	12	1
201407	2162	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Would it affect potential?	12	1
201407	2163	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	And then what does it mean for the gap, in your estimate?	12	1
201407	2164	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t have a full analysis of that, but let me give you a few pieces of it.	12	1
201407	2165	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	First of all, essentially we assumed that the enormous surprise that we experienced in health-care spending in the first half is permanent in the level.	12	1
201407	2166	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	So we just absorbed it into the level of consumer spending, and we absorbed it into a number of other economic variables of interest.	12	1
201407	2167	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	So, for example, that’s a component of our downward revision to potential GDP growth.	12	1
201407	2168	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	It also results in a much higher saving rate in this current projection because we’ve taken the level of PCE spending down, but for all intents and purposes, we didn’t get any news about disposable personal income.	12	1
201407	2169	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	So we’ve assumed that it’s permanent in the level.	12	1
201407	2170	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	You’re right, essentially, on the growth rates.	12	1
201407	2171	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We’re in a state of high uncertainty.	12	1
201407	2172	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We don’t know what to expect.	12	1
201407	2173	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We think the reality is that that utilization that had earlier been assumed by the BEA will eventually show up later on.	12	1
201407	2174	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We didn’t have the courage to write that down right now because really the first time that could show up is when the next installment of the Quarterly Services Survey is published, and that will be, I think, a day or two after the September FOMC meeting, and we didn’t want to be hanging out there between now and then, apparently being demonstrated to be wrong.	12	1
201407	2175	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	So we took a different approach and said, we’re going to assume that the lackluster growth of health spending that the BEA has penciled in at the moment just continues, and then if the Quarterly Services Survey reveals that hospital revenues, doctor revenues, and other measures of medical utilization have in fact moved up, we’ll just take our estimate of potential GDP back up again, and that way we’ll attempt to insulate the gap in GDP from these vagaries in measurement and timing.	12	1
201407	2176	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	My best guess is that what’s going on right now is that this is like a pig in the measurement python that hasn’t quite shown up yet.	12	1
201407	2177	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Our fiscal colleagues have seen the increase in ACA subsidies go out the government door.	12	1
201407	2178	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We just haven’t seen it show up yet in hospital revenues.	12	1
201407	2179	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We still expect that it will, but your contact may be quite right that there’s something more fundamental going on.	12	1
201407	2180	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	At the moment we’ve taken an approach that attempts to cut through all of that and deliver to you an assessment of resource utilization that we tried to hold harmless from these kinds of buffeting factors.	12	1
201407	2181	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	12	1
201407	2182	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I just want to continue—oh, sorry—did you mean President Fisher?	12	1
201407	2183	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	No, you’re the superior Fischer.	12	1
201407	2184	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher is next after the governor.	12	1
201407	2185	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	This is a continuation of a question I started asking you yesterday.	12	1
201407	2186	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	You say here you have sort of ignored this downward bump, or pothole.	12	1
201407	2187	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Actually, you haven’t.	12	1
201407	2188	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	You’ve shifted the whole path of future GDP down by 2.9 percent at an annual rate, so by ¾ percentage point.	12	1
201407	2189	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	What would happen if you hadn’t done that?	12	1
201407	2190	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Where would we see it showing up—in higher interest rates, and what else?	12	1
201407	2191	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Andrew Figura’s briefing yesterday tried to provide a little back-of-the- envelope illustration of what would have happened if we hadn’t taken potential GDP growth down.	12	1
201407	2192	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We would have shown, in that case, an unemployment rate gap that was a little narrower this time because of the 0.2 percentage point lower unemployment rate in the June Tealbook.	12	1
201407	2193	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	And simultaneously, we would have shown a GDP gap that was considerably wider this time because there was about a point and a half further downward surprise in the first quarter in GDP growth relative to our June assumption and another ¾ percentage point.	12	1
201407	2194	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Dividing by four, that would have meant a GDP gap that was about ½ percentage point wider if we hadn’t done anything to potential GDP.	12	1
201407	2195	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	So we would have had our two measures of resource utilization going in opposite directions, and one source of discomfort there is that most, if not all, of our monetary policy rules respond to the output gap, and so the implication would have been that, for example, in Tealbook, Book B, in the Monetary Policy Strategies section, we would have been showing you prescriptions from the monetary policy rules calling for a considerably easier stance of monetary policy, and we just didn’t think that comported with our assessment of where resource utilization stands.	12	1
201407	2196	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	12	1
201407	2197	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks.	12	1
201407	2198	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	12	1
201407	2199	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201407	2200	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I have a couple of questions for David Wilcox, if I may.	12	1
201407	2201	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	In Tealbook, Book A, there’s a box on page 12.	12	1
201407	2202	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	It shows the headline unemployment rate is a bit out of line with an assortment of other indicators of labor market conditions, and I was hoping you could enlighten me a little bit on the analysis.	12	1
201407	2203	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I’m curious about a couple of things.	12	1
201407	2204	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	My first question has to do with the gap that currently exists between the labor market conditions index and the index excluding the unemployment rate.	12	1
201407	2205	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I was wondering whether you had compared those two indexes over other periods of time—during other economic recovery periods, say—and if so, to what extent that gap is large, normal, or small and, whether it’s large or not, to what extent it can be expected to close as the recovery continues and as the unemployment rate gets closer to estimates of the natural rate?	12	1
201407	2206	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	That’s the question on that particular observation, and then I’m curious as to whether the index provides information beyond that captured by the unemployment rate or the unemployment gap, information on wage and salary growth and price inflation or future revisions to the estimated unemployment gap.	12	1
201407	2207	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	This is central to some of our discussion, and I would like you to expand on that a little bit.	12	1
201407	2208	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Again, if you’ve studied that from a historical perspective, that would be helpful.	12	1
201407	2209	2014-07-30	meeting	WASCHER	We have not done that.	12	1
201407	2210	2014-07-30	meeting	WASCHER	I think that’s a good suggestion.	12	1
201407	2211	2014-07-30	meeting	WASCHER	We have not gone back to earlier recoveries and compared the LMCI with and without the unemployment rate information.	12	1
201407	2212	2014-07-30	meeting	WASCHER	As to your second question, the index does, in fact, include other measures of wages, measures of hiring, layoffs, people working part time for economic reasons, and things like that.	12	1
201407	2213	2014-07-30	meeting	WASCHER	So it is trying to capture a broader set of indicators of labor market slack than the unemployment rate alone.	12	1
201407	2214	2014-07-30	meeting	WASCHER	Some of those other indicators are what is driving that prediction for the unemployment rate in the right-hand side of that box.	12	1
201407	2215	2014-07-30	meeting	WASCHER	It would show less decline than the actual unemployment rate over the past year.	12	1
201407	2216	2014-07-30	meeting	WASCHER	The LMCI is really meant to measure the change in the unemployment rate over time or the change of labor market conditions over time.	12	1
201407	2217	2014-07-30	meeting	WASCHER	It hasn’t proven to be a very good measure of the level of labor market slack.	12	1
201407	2218	2014-07-30	meeting	WASCHER	It’s difficult to interpret in that context.	12	1
201407	2219	2014-07-30	meeting	WASCHER	So what we’ve emphasized here is the change.	12	1
201407	2220	2014-07-30	meeting	WASCHER	And the change in labor market conditions according to this index hasn’t been as strong as the decline in the unemployment rate.	12	1
201407	2221	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Could we go back and look at the first question?	12	1
201407	2222	2014-07-30	meeting	WASCHER	Yes, I think we could.	12	1
201407	2223	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	And then the other thing I wanted to ask about is something I’ve raised before.	12	1
201407	2224	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I’m going to try to raise it more gently if I can.	12	1
201407	2225	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I’ll first observe that the new Tealbook projection is very close to my previous forecast views on the path of GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and job growth over the next year or so, and also the differences of our views on inflation have narrowed considerably.	12	1
201407	2226	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I also noted, though, that the baseline policy path eventually drives the unemployment rate ¾ percentage point below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate, and a full percentage point below the CBO’s estimate of the natural rate, and thereafter the simulations show a smooth, gradual convergence to full employment under price stability.	12	1
201407	2227	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	And I wonder, when is the last time that we were able to pull something like that off?	12	1
201407	2228	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Have we ever managed to achieve a 1 percentage point, or ¾ percentage point, or even ½ percentage point increase in the quarterly unemployment rate without triggering a recession?	12	1
201407	2229	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Because we go down and come back up.	12	1
201407	2230	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	That’s my question here—and how much confidence does the staff have that we can overshoot full employment, as we estimate it, by such a large margin and then pull it back and achieve a soft landing?	12	1
201407	2231	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Am I missing something here?	12	1
201407	2232	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Did I overstate it?	12	1
201407	2233	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	David, you and I have talked about this a little bit before.	12	1
201407	2234	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Am I misinterpreting?	12	1
201407	2235	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	I have tremendous confidence in the ability of the Committee to pull that off.	12	1
201407	2236	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	[Laughter]	12	1
201407	2237	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We do have a period of subnormal growth.	12	1
201407	2238	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see on page 27 of the Tealbook, during that period when the unemployment rate is coming back up from about 4½ percent to the assumed natural rate, GDP growth is running in the neighborhood of about 1½ percent for a period of time.	12	1
201407	2239	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	If zero is a benchmark of special significance, then you’re running closer to zero, and if there are fragilities associated with that—fragilities are nonlinearities that are associated with running an economy that is growing more slowly—as some statistical analysis suggests that there might be, and here I’m referring to some of the research that posits the possibility of something like a stall speed, then there could be a greater risk of falling into a recession.	12	1
201407	2240	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	By the same token, in our baseline projection, this period of overshooting is what’s required to boost the inflation rate up to your target objective of 2 percent.	12	1
201407	2241	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	And without that period of overshooting, in our projection we would be showing you an inflation rate that would be continuing to run in the neighborhood of about 1¾ percent.	12	1
201407	2242	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	As you suggest, there are, no doubt, control fragilities associated with that period of the unemployment rate coming back up to the natural rate, but without it, again, in our baseline you’d have an inflation rate that was languishing a little bit below your objective.	12	1
201407	2243	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	As you know, I’m still worried about whether we can achieve it.	12	1
201407	2244	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I understand these tradeoffs, and your attempts to get at it mathematically, but I still worry about the capacity to achieve that.	12	1
201407	2245	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	It was just a question—I noticed it documented more this time in the Tealbook.	12	1
201407	2246	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Just one more comment.	12	1
201407	2247	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I’m not sure if you raised in your summary a comment about food prices, about the differences between CPI and PCE.	12	1
201407	2248	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I’m not going to mention this in my overview of what I’m hearing in my soundings from my interlocutors, but it’s very interesting to notice that we have retraced on all of the proteins—if you look at wheat, for example, its price has retraced from $8 per bushel to $5 per bushel.	12	1
201407	2249	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Corn, soybeans—this is beginning to work its way through now very slowly into pork, and especially chicken, which is fastest, and very slowly into beef.	12	1
201407	2250	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	There’s usually a lag, as you know, into retail food and then into the restaurant end.	12	1
201407	2251	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	But it’s pretty clear that a turn has taken place.	12	1
201407	2252	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	We have world-record crops, and the budgeting for next year is likely to be the same, despite the drought that we had here in the United States.	12	1
201407	2253	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	For what it’s worth, my interlocutors at Archer Daniels and at the other big food companies are saying that we’ve seen almost a five-year turn.	12	1
201407	2254	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Their argument is that this was largely driven by speculative money, mainly the funds, and then also the algorithm of trading that took it from $5 to $8.	12	1
201407	2255	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I think that’s probably good news, because we heard Governor Fischer mention last time that he was seeing, in terms of his own family market basket, considerable price pressures at least on the food side and the energy side.	12	1
201407	2256	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	But there seems to be, at least in the minds of those that are in the physical markets, some retracement taking place, and I just wanted to mention that.	12	1
201407	2257	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201407	2258	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman Dudley.	12	1
201407	2259	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I had just one observation entirely on President Fisher’s comment.	12	1
201407	2260	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If I remember the data right, I think there has rarely been a rise in the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate—if it rises 0.3 percentage point or more, you always get a recession, going back a very long period of time.	12	1
201407	2261	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So it is unlikely that you would actually get an uptick in unemployment and not get some bad outcome.	12	1
201407	2262	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The second question I have relates to the assumption that inflation expectations stay well anchored even as you go well below the so-called full employment rate.	12	1
201407	2263	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	How realistic is that?	12	1
201407	2264	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	At what point is it reasonable to expect that the short-run Phillips curve is still really flat because inflation expectations are anchored?	12	1
201407	2265	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Presumably you couldn’t drive the unemployment rate to 2 percent.	12	1
201407	2266	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	At some point it would give way, and how does that affect your thinking about the risk to the forecast?	12	1
201407	2267	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	I think it’s a risk.	12	1
201407	2268	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	If somebody had asked me five years ago how realistic is it that we would have the unemployment rate so many percentage points above the natural rate and so little disinflation—we were initially pretty wrong about that.	12	1
201407	2269	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We expected much more disinflation until we adopted this assumption that inflation expectations were well anchored.	12	1
201407	2270	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Now, that was on the downside, and it could well be, as you suggest, that different mechanisms might apply once the economy is running hotter.	12	1
201407	2271	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	It could be that considerations like downward nominal wage rigidity were providing some support to inflation that wouldn’t operate on the upside.	12	1
201407	2272	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	So I can’t offer a whole lot of reassurance there.	12	1
201407	2273	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	I would note, though, that just for our inflation projection to come true we think—without a huge amount of conviction—it’s a better bet than not that we need to see some material acceleration in compensation, and if we just continue with compensation sort of trundling along in the neighborhood of 2 percent or so, that in itself won’t be enough to get inflation back up.	12	1
201407	2274	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	So we do need to see some acceleration in compensation.	12	1
201407	2275	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Now, whether it’s going to be contained, modest like we have, obviously I can’t say for sure.	12	1
201407	2276	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	12	1
201407	2277	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	12	1
201407	2278	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Vice Chairman’s first comment was the same as what I was going to say.	12	1
201407	2279	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Are there further comments?	12	1
201407	2280	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	12	1
201407	2281	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	This observation has come up a couple of times.	12	1
201407	2282	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	The—what is it, 0.3 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate in history is always associated with a recession, and yet statistical models don’t live by that rule.	12	1
201407	2283	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Do you have any guidance for us on how to think about those types of anomalies, David?	12	1
201407	2284	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Well, for one thing I’d note the sample is pretty darn small.	12	1
201407	2285	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	In small samples you get peculiar results.	12	1
201407	2286	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	There was an extremely nice illustration of this on the radio the other day, where they had the really terrific example that small states are always the ones that have unusual health outcomes, and they pointed out that some cancer incidence was the highest in the nation in North Dakota and the lowest in the nation in South Dakota.	12	1
201407	2287	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Go figure.	12	1
201407	2288	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Well, the answer is, they’re both really small samples.	12	1
201407	2289	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	This was of a rare brain cancer.	12	1
201407	2290	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Now, during the postwar period, we don’t have that many observations of recessions and increases in unemployment, thank goodness.	12	1
201407	2291	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	So in conducting statistical inference, I think you want to exercise some care before declaring it can’t happen.	12	1
201407	2292	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	That said, many of our models presume a linear structure, and there are deep uncertainties, which I think it would be presumptuous at best to pretend might not exist, about whether there could be some sort of nonlinear dynamics that could be triggering a greater fragility in those sorts of circumstances.	12	1
201407	2293	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	So I think it’s an interesting regularity.	12	1
201407	2294	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Whether it’s more than that is really hard to say.	12	1
201407	2295	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	12	1
201407	2296	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions for the staff?	12	1
201407	2297	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	12	1
201407	2298	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	If not, we have an opportunity for those who are interested to comment on financial stability.	FS	FS
201407	2299	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	We don’t intend a full go-round, but I have a list of people who’d like to speak and anyone else can add themselves to the list.	FS	FS
201407	2300	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to start with President Rosengren.	FS	FS
201407	2301	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	FS	FS
201407	2302	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	While it’s well understood that monetary policy operates with long and variable lags, as we think about financial-stability issues and the potential substitutability or complementarity of supervisory and monetary tools, it’s important to remind ourselves that long and variable lags are just as applicable to our supervisory tools, particularly given the long lags that frequently occur in instituting new rules.	FS	FS
201407	2303	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	For example, the draft guidance on leveraged lending was released for public comment in March 2012.	FS	FS
201407	2304	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Two years later a number of institutions, particularly some of the foreign institutions, are still reluctant to address the concerns raised in the guidance.	FS	FS
201407	2305	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Given the importance of this market segment to the business model of some foreign banks, it’s not a complete surprise they are reluctant to tighten standards in an area that generates substantial fees.	FS	FS
201407	2306	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	There are probably ways we can shorten the timeline in regulatory and supervisory tools and be more creative in writing rules that provide more flexibility to make changes without going through additional rounds of comments.	FS	FS
201407	2307	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Still, this very recent experience certainly raises the question of whether we have fully considered how promptly we can address financial- stability concerns and which tools will be most timely and effective.	FS	FS
201407	2308	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	In a similar vein, we should consider how we would address the problems currently facing the Bank of England and the Riksbank regarding real estate prices.	FS	FS
201407	2309	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Choice of homebuyers would be influenced by higher rates generated by monetary policy, higher interest rates generated by imposing higher capital charges on banks through bank regulation, or higher underwriting standards through bank supervision.	FS	FS
201407	2310	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I don’t expect that this is an immediate area of concern, it may be an area in which considering the tradeoffs between relying on monetary policy tools or relying on supervisory or regulatory tools would be particularly instructive.	FS	FS
201407	2311	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	In principle, we could use targeted monetary policy tools to address real estate excesses, such as selling long-term mortgages, MBS, or Treasury securities to directly raise mortgage and other long-term rates.	FS	FS
201407	2312	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Our ability to use such tools will be influenced by our decisions about how long-run balance sheet size and composition are decided.	FS	FS
201407	2313	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	But such decisions should also be informed by how confident we are that supervisory or regulatory tools will be effective in addressing some of the issues already being confronted elsewhere.	FS	FS
201407	2314	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	FS	FS
201407	2315	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	FS	FS
201407	2316	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	FS	FS
201407	2317	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As usual, I found the financial stability report to be very useful.	FS	FS
201407	2318	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’d like to especially thank the staff for the incorporation of financial-stability risks into the analysis of macroeconomic risks, and here I’m thinking of the discussions of low equity volatility, on page 46 of Tealbook, Book A; credit market turbulence, on page 58 of Tealbook, Book A; and the China crisis memo.	FS	FS
201407	2319	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I really like the dashboard in the QS report.	FS	FS
201407	2320	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This was on page 2.	FS	FS
201407	2321	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it could be enhanced even further by reducing the number of words in it and just having colors—simplifying it further for policymakers.	FS	FS
201407	2322	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You know, it could be highlighted even more.	FS	FS
201407	2323	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I don’t think it was brought forward in the presentation today, and I think it’s a great way to frame the assessment of financial-stability risks.	FS	FS
201407	2324	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Madam Chair, I have three comments about three financial-stability issues.	FS	FS
201407	2325	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The first is about bank legal risk.	FS	FS
201407	2326	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The second is about a way to incorporate more information into the financial-stability briefing.	FS	FS
201407	2327	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And the third is about the overnight reverse repo facility.	FS	FS
201407	2328	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The last two are very brief.	FS	FS
201407	2329	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of legal risk, the QS report noted the potential for legal risk, which is exemplified by recent misconduct findings against very large banks, to shock the financial system.	FS	FS
201407	2330	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This legal risk kind of shock could raise concerns about counterparty risk, which in turn could lead to liquidity shortages.	FS	FS
201407	2331	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we’ve made good steps to bolster the financial system against these kinds of episodes, but such liquidity threats have to be seen as remaining very serious in the context of resolution regimes that still are in need of substantial enhancements.	FS	FS
201407	2332	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, I think this legal risk is a nice example of how possible financial instability need not imply that we should keep monetary policy less accommodative than otherwise.	FS	FS
201407	2333	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	After all, there is no sense in which you can reduce legal risk by raising interest rates or reducing the size of our balance sheet.	FS	FS
201407	2334	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In fact, the presence of this risk could actually be seen as arguing for more accommodation, not less.	FS	FS
201407	2335	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Here’s what I mean by that.	FS	FS
201407	2336	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	A negative systemic shock caused by the realization of legal risk that occurs after liftoff could lead us back to the zero lower bound, and at that point, definitionally, we would be unable to provide as much stimulus as we would like in order to offset the shock.	FS	FS
201407	2337	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	How should monetary policy respond to the risk of hitting the zero lower bound in the future?	FS	FS
201407	2338	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Well, the basic conclusion of the macro literature is that risk of insufficient stimulus in the future implies that it’s optimal to preemptively provide additional current stimulus.	FS	FS
201407	2339	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So potential instability due to legal risk is actually a reason to keep interest rates lower than otherwise, not a reason to keep monetary policy tighter than otherwise.	FS	FS
201407	2340	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of additional information, again, here I’m going to be brief.	FS	FS
201407	2341	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The QS financial stability report is based only on public information.	FS	FS
201407	2342	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think the stability analysis coming to the FOMC could benefit from more direct incorporation of assessments based on supervisory evaluations.	FS	FS
201407	2343	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, these assessments are based on information that’s private to the Fed, and I’m sure that the public pretty much expects the FOMC to be able to use this private information to inform our assessments of financial-stability risks.	FS	FS
201407	2344	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	To be clear, if we so desired, this analysis based on supervisory information could be entirely separate from the current QS analysis, and it could, if so desired, remain at the aggregate level to avoid discussions of specific firms.	FS	FS
201407	2345	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it could be very helpful to have this kind of information brought in at an aggregate level.	FS	FS
201407	2346	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There’s no reason necessarily to be discussing specific firms.	FS	FS
201407	2347	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So that’s the additional information piece.	FS	FS
201407	2348	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of the overnight reverse repo facility, what I took away from the thrust of the dialogue we heard earlier today is that the overnight facility will end up being used during the course of liftoff.	FS	FS
201407	2349	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	At the same time, I think both the staff and participants have pointed to potential financial-stability risks associated with the usage of that facility.	FS	FS
201407	2350	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It would be useful, I think, to begin the process of incorporating those kinds of risks into the financial stability report that the Committee receives.	FS	FS
201407	2351	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	FS	FS
201407	2352	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	FS	FS
201407	2353	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	FS	FS
201407	2354	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	FS	FS
201407	2355	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	The comments that I had prepared really were in substance along the lines of what President Rosengren already raised, and so I will forgo those, except to say to Nellie and the staff that I did think the heat map was a helpful way to think about that.	FS	FS
201407	2356	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	When I thought about the comparison with 2004, when I was head of bank supervision, it reminded me that even though you may have seen the risk, the timing, speed, and ultimate consequence were far less clear.	FS	FS
201407	2357	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	So the questions that President Rosengren raised were ones that, as we evolve this process, thinking about the interplay of monetary policy versus whatever we decide our macroprudential tools will be and the role of bank supervision and how successful it is in the guidance that it’s trying to accomplish will make this process even better.	FS	FS
201407	2358	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	FS	FS
201407	2359	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	FS	FS
201407	2360	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	FS	FS
201407	2361	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I agree with President George.	FS	FS
201407	2362	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	This is developed so well.	FS	FS
201407	2363	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I think it is much more helpful and gives us greater insight.	FS	FS
201407	2364	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I just want to turn to the report on China very quickly, which I thought was superb, and I’m going to counter what my respected colleague, President Kocherlakota, just argued.	FS	FS
201407	2365	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I’ll use that as an example, because a couple of things leapt out at me from that report.	FS	FS
201407	2366	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	One is residential investment as a percentage of GDP going from 3 to 10 percent.	FS	FS
201407	2367	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	That’s comparable with what happened in Ireland, by the way, even though it’s a tinier country, and we know what the consequences were.	FS	FS
201407	2368	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	But it also strikes me that the overall increase in credit in China over the period of 2007 to 2013 is actually larger than what happened in Korea prior to the 1997 crisis, in Mexico prior to the crisis of 1994, and in Thailand prior to the crisis in 1997.	FS	FS
201407	2369	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Here we have a much more integrated relationship with China, a deeper relationship between China and two of the countries that I just mentioned and the rest of that part of the world.	FS	FS
201407	2370	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Now, this just makes me pray that we will have lessened the amount of accommodation we have.	FS	FS
201407	2371	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	We will have tightened, however slightly, toward a more hawkish direction, whatever tiny bit, so that perhaps, if this were to lead to the kind of reaction that is illustrated by the graph that you presented in this summary this afternoon, we’d have a few bullets to shoot, because we are at risk here, having become as integrated as we have.	FS	FS
201407	2372	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	So I want to thank you especially for the report on China.	FS	FS
201407	2373	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	That was thoroughly done.	FS	FS
201407	2374	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	It does raise the risk of globalization.	FS	FS
201407	2375	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	If anything, it makes me want to push even further on tightening the screws a little bit so we have something in reserve, just in case things fall apart.	FS	FS
201407	2376	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	It doesn’t lead me to conclude we should be more accommodative.	FS	FS
201407	2377	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	It leads me to conclude that we should be better prepared.	FS	FS
201407	2378	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	That’s the point, and I wanted to thank you for that report.	FS	FS
201407	2379	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	FS	FS
201407	2380	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	FS	FS
201407	2381	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman Dudley.	FS	FS
201407	2382	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	FS	FS
201407	2383	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I thought the staff memo was terrific.	FS	FS
201407	2384	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The QS report was terrific, and I liked the heat maps a lot, and I liked the fact that the staff reached firm conclusions—it’s hard to decide whether it’s green, yellow, orange, or red, but I really appreciate it.	FS	FS
201407	2385	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	One risk that the QS report doesn’t focus on, because it’s a pretty narrow risk, is the situation in Puerto Rico, and since that sits in our District I thought I would comment on it.	FS	FS
201407	2386	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Unfortunately, the island economy has been essentially in recession for years, and during this period there’s been a rapid buildup in the debt burden of the island, particularly among the public corporations that are there.	FS	FS
201407	2387	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	As a result, the island is losing market access.	FS	FS
201407	2388	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	There was a large general obligation issuance this spring that was funded mainly by hedge funds at around an 8 percent yield.	FS	FS
201407	2389	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So that sort of tells you the degree of extremis.	FS	FS
201407	2390	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Recently the government attempted to differentiate between the obligations of the commonwealth and the obligations of the public corporations by passing bankruptcy legislation that would apply only to the public corporations.	FS	FS
201407	2391	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	This did not work in achieving the desired differentiation.	FS	FS
201407	2392	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The rating agencies downgraded both the government and the public corporate obligations.	FS	FS
201407	2393	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, utilizing this new law and putting a public corporation into bankruptcy doesn’t seem to be viable in fact, because there’s legal uncertainty about how such a bankruptcy filing would work, given the absence of legal precedents.	FS	FS
201407	2394	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	We also have a situation of liquidity being drained.	FS	FS
201407	2395	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	They made this big bond issuance, but the liquidity is getting exhausted relatively quickly, both seasonally—because tax receipts in Puerto Rico are back-loaded in the fiscal year, and the fiscal year starts July 1—and by the fact that energy suppliers to the island’s public utility are demanding much tougher trade terms.	FS	FS
201407	2396	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So what’s happening is the government is trying to negotiate a restructuring of the public utility company’s obligations, and if that were to succeed, it would provide some additional liquid resources and buy some time.	FS	FS
201407	2397	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, it will be very important to see if the government could actually issue tax anticipation notes, which it typically does this time of year.	FS	FS
201407	2398	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If it can’t do this and it can’t do the public utility restructuring, then the cushion of liquid resources may not be adequate to meet its obligations for very much longer.	FS	FS
201407	2399	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So the bottom line is, the outlook is pretty grim.	FS	FS
201407	2400	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If things go well, so that they get the public utility restructuring and the government issues tax anticipation notes, that will probably get them into next year, but if those efforts fail, then Puerto Rico might be either unable or unwilling to meet its obligations much sooner.	FS	FS
201407	2401	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	There are over $70 billion of tax-exempt securities outstanding from Puerto Rico—both the government and the public corporations.	FS	FS
201407	2402	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So if this thing sped up, this would be a pretty significant shock to the US tax-exempt market.	FS	FS
201407	2403	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, I do think even if this worst case were to occur, the systemic effect probably would be pretty modest in the sense that the Puerto Rico situation does appear to be quite unique.	FS	FS
201407	2404	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s not like there are a lot of other Puerto Ricos lurking around, and the fact is the prices for much of the island’s obligations already are depressed.	FS	FS
201407	2405	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So it’s not like the elevated level of risk in terms of the island is not known.	FS	FS
201407	2406	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But this is something that could happen potentially very soon—even as early as next week.	FS	FS
201407	2407	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I just want to flag that.	FS	FS
201407	2408	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The second issue I’d like to discuss is whether the Fed should flag incipient bubbles in those asset classes that are sufficiently small in size that they’re unlikely to pose systemic risk.	FS	FS
201407	2409	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I was struck by the reaction of market analysts and others to the Monetary Policy Report’s observation that valuations were “substantially stretched” for small biotechnology and small media stocks.	FS	FS
201407	2410	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Many analysts argued that it was inappropriate for the Fed to offer up its opinion as this was interfering with the market pricing of such obligations.	FS	FS
201407	2411	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I have to respectfully disagree with this argument.	FS	FS
201407	2412	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It strikes me that there’s a pretty important asymmetry in markets.	FS	FS
201407	2413	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Many more market participants favor rising stock prices than the opposite.	FS	FS
201407	2414	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	FS	FS
201407	2415	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	And that really does create an impetus for bubbles, and I think it’s appropriate for someone without a dog in that fight to comment when valuations appear to be excessive.	FS	FS
201407	2416	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, I think it’s useful to opine on such issues of valuation on a regular basis because I think this is an aspect of keeping a watchful eye on financial-stability issues.	FS	FS
201407	2417	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	This is a space in which we need to be credible.	FS	FS
201407	2418	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Silence does not build credibility.	FS	FS
201407	2419	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we have to condition market participants that it’s completely appropriate for us to offer up our views, especially when pricing becomes substantially stretched in our eyes.	FS	FS
201407	2420	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you for that.	FS	FS
201407	2421	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So hang in there.	FS	FS
201407	2422	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	You should see some of the e-mails that I got.	FS	FS
201407	2423	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	FS	FS
201407	2424	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, Governor Fischer.	FS	FS
201407	2425	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Opening your mouth is a good idea if you’re right, and I don’t know exactly how good we are at spotting bubbles and saying which stocks are overvalued.	FS	FS
201407	2426	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The valuations are pretty extreme in those two areas.	FS	FS
201407	2427	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	But that area is one that’s habitually had extreme values for even small and medium-sized firms.	FS	FS
201407	2428	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	They’re high relative to their own history.	FS	FS
201407	2429	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Yes, but we’ve got zero interest rates now, and when you divide the future stream of profits by zero, you get a large number.	FS	FS
201407	2430	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Other comments on financial stability?	FS	FS
201407	2431	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	This is something for us to potentially debate.	FS	FS
201407	2432	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it’s an important issue that was raised by those comments.	FS	FS
201407	2433	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	FS	FS
201407	2434	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	FS	FS
201407	2435	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	As difficult as it is to evaluate geopolitical risk, we have in Governor Fischer someone who can give some perspective on risk associated with the Middle East, and I think we would be interested in your views on how this could develop into something that we have to be concerned about here.	FS	FS
201407	2436	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I used to explain in Israel that they brought me because I knew economics, not because I knew strategy.	FS	FS
201407	2437	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	It’s a very complex situation.	FS	FS
201407	2438	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	It’s far more complex than it has been in a long time because the Arab world is changing completely and is in its own battle.	FS	FS
201407	2439	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	This is a side battle that is deeply related to what’s going on between the Sunnis and the Shias, with Hamas being supported by Turkey and Qatar, and Egypt being on Israel’s side in its dealings with Hamas.	FS	FS
201407	2440	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	It’s clear that Israel did not know about the extent of these tunnels—they knew about tunnels, as there has been previous incidents where people came out of tunnels from Gaza, but they didn’t know about the extent of these tunnels, and that changed the story completely.	FS	FS
201407	2441	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I haven’t spoken to anybody in the Israeli government.	FS	FS
201407	2442	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t know what their plans are.	FS	FS
201407	2443	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	They’re in a period in which they’re trying to make it clear to Hamas that they’d better stop.	FS	FS
201407	2444	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	The war with Hezbollah in Lebanon in 2006 was thought to be a failure, but Hezbollah has not come out of its bunkers since 2006.	FS	FS
201407	2445	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	So there is a deterrent power in these very tough and ugly battles.	FS	FS
201407	2446	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	But how is that going to affect the global oil markets?	FS	FS
201407	2447	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Well, there’s a lot going on in the Arab world that will.	FS	FS
201407	2448	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I doubt that this is one of the things.	FS	FS
201407	2449	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	It’s now very localized.	FS	FS
201407	2450	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	It wouldn’t have been four years ago or three years ago, but it is now.	FS	FS
201407	2451	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	But I really don’t want to go into this because I just don’t know any more than a well- informed reader of the New York Times.	FS	FS
201407	2452	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I do read some Israeli papers, but I don’t know more than that.	FS	FS
201407	2453	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	It’s clear that this prime minister has decided he’s going to go after Hamas in a big way, having not wanted to go in, in the first place.	FS	FS
201407	2454	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	And one of the things that surprises people about Netanyahu is that actually he’s fought relatively few wars for his period in office.	FS	FS
201407	2455	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	He doesn’t jump into them.	FS	FS
201407	2456	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	He didn’t want to get into this one.	FS	FS
201407	2457	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	But once he was in it, he decided he might as well try and do something with it.	FS	FS
201407	2458	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	The underlying Israeli view is, we cannot live forever with the southern one-third of the country under rocket attack whenever our neighbor decides that that’s what they want to do.	FS	FS
201407	2459	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Hamas has been firing rockets.	FS	FS
201407	2460	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	A few have come over.	FS	FS
201407	2461	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	They’re well protected.	FS	FS
201407	2462	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	You don’t usually have many casualties.	FS	FS
201407	2463	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	But I’ve spoken enough, so I’m going to stop.	FS	FS
201407	2464	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks.	FS	FS
201407	2465	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Any further comments on financial stability?	FS	FS
201407	2466	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	FS	FS
201407	2467	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	David.	FS	FS
201407	2468	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	If there are no further comments on financial stability, I wanted to come back just briefly to the unemployment rate increase question that Vice Chairman Dudley raised.	12	1
201407	2469	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	I had mentioned that the sample of relevant events was small.	12	1
201407	2470	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Bill Wascher makes the smart observation that it’s probably a lot smaller than I suggested, since several of the postwar episodes that were increases in unemployment were deliberately engineered for the express purpose of bringing inflation down.	12	1
201407	2471	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	So you probably don’t want to think about those as proving the case that having a soft landing is impossible, and you probably also want to throw out the most recent episode, given the historically unprecedented dynamics that were associated with the financial crisis.	12	1
201407	2472	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	So I think when you come down to it, the sample of actually relevant episodes is extremely small, and we just don’t have the empirical basis for determining that a soft landing is not possible to be engineered.	12	1
201407	2473	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	I think the fairest summary is, we don’t know.	12	1
201407	2474	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	In a simple linear model, it’s doable, but in the real world, no doubt it’s hazardous.	12	1
201407	2475	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Could I?	12	1
201407	2476	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	12	1
201407	2477	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	That’s a good point because it reminds me that I think the intuition in the question is, if we had a single increase of 0.3 percentage point on unemployment, it’s always led to a recession, but it’s almost always the case that you get the 0.3 percentage point on the way to a point and a half.	12	1
201407	2478	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes, it doesn’t stop.	12	1
201407	2479	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Or something like that.	12	1
201407	2480	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s a huge gap.	12	1
201407	2481	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	The point we were making is, it was the point and a half that, at least in some cases, might very well have been the intended result.	12	1
201407	2482	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Yes, yes.	12	1
201407	2483	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	That’s very helpful to me.	12	1
201407	2484	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	12	1
201407	2485	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	12	1
201407	2486	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Just for the point, so that we’re all on the same wavelength, in terms of our estimated natural rate, where does it fall in the historical range?	12	1
201407	2487	2014-07-30	meeting	WASCHER	Well, it’s clearly lower than it was in the ’70s and for most of the ’80s.	12	1
201407	2488	2014-07-30	meeting	WASCHER	I’d guess it’s not as low as it was in the ’50s and ’60s, so maybe in the middle, but certainly low by comparison with the ’70s and ’80s—and then it came down over the ’90s.	12	1
201407	2489	2014-07-30	meeting	WASCHER	Between the early ’80s and 2000, it came down quite a bit, and we think it leveled off after that at around 5¼ percent.	12	1
201407	2490	2014-07-30	meeting	WASCHER	That’s our estimate.	12	1
201407	2491	2014-07-30	meeting	WASCHER	It has a wide confidence band around it.	12	1
201407	2492	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Yes, sir.	12	1
201407	2493	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12	1
201407	2494	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we begin our economic round and go, I guess, until six and then go to dinner.	13	1
201407	2495	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	And maybe we’ll finish or, alternatively, I think we’ll have a chance to finish tomorrow morning if not now.	13	1
201407	2496	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	So let’s start off with President Lacker.	13	1
201407	2497	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	2498	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	And thank you, President Fisher, for your fulsome expression of manly affection.	13	1
201407	2499	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	While it goes without saying that the feeling is, of course, mutual, I suggest we take further discussion of this topic offline.	13	1
201407	2500	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	On balance, recent reports on economic activity in the Fifth District have been fairly positive.	13	1
201407	2501	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Business sentiment seems to have improved, as can be seen in our diffusion indexes of economic activity.	13	1
201407	2502	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Our composite manufacturing index rose slightly in July to a plus 7 reading, and our service sector revenue index rose to plus 12.	13	1
201407	2503	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	A typical comment comes from a bank CEO, who recently stated that his bank has been experiencing organic loan growth this year for the first time in five years.	13	1
201407	2504	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	There are significant headwinds, though, attributable to recent austerity measures at the federal level.	13	1
201407	2505	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Portions of Virginia and Maryland along with the District of Columbia have seen weakening activity in commercial real estate and significant retrenchment among federal contractors.	13	1
201407	2506	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	One vivid indicator of the fallout is that over the past 12 months, employment in professional and business services fell by 2.0 percent in Virginia, with the decline concentrated in northern Virginia, and that’s in sharp contrast to a 3.5 percent increase in that category nationally.	13	1
201407	2507	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Contacts in the Hampton Roads area of southeast Virginia and elsewhere are also concerned about prospective defense cuts that could have a large effect locally.	13	1
201407	2508	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Turning to the national outlook, the staff has lowered its forecast for consumer spending significantly for 2014 and trimmed a bit off of 2015 and 2016, as we’ve heard.	13	1
201407	2509	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Still, the Tealbook has consumer spending growth at well above 3 percent for six consecutive quarters, beginning with the current quarter.	13	1
201407	2510	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Note that real consumer spending rose only 2.3 percent last year and 2.0 percent in each of the previous two years, and it has been even softer over the past two quarters.	13	1
201407	2511	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Real income gains have been modest recently, with growth in average hourly earnings, or the ECI, only slightly above inflation over the past 12 months.	13	1
201407	2512	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I remain a bit skeptical that the long-awaited acceleration in consumer spending is upon us.	13	1
201407	2513	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Residential investment is also a critical part of the forecast, and I’d like to compliment the staff for the memo on housing.	13	1
201407	2514	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I, too, have been thinking about some of the fundamentals underlying housing demand.	13	1
201407	2515	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Looking at factors such as headship rates, housing vacancies, and depletions gives one an appreciation of the significant uncertainty surrounding some of the key determinants of future housing activity.	13	1
201407	2516	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	On top of that, the combination of rising prices and disappointing volumes suggests that it might be worth understanding supply constraints in a bit more detail.	13	1
201407	2517	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Anecdotal reports certainly point in that direction as well.	13	1
201407	2518	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	It seems plausible to me that the puzzling weakness of the housing market over the past year is due to restraining factors that will turn out to be persistent.	13	1
201407	2519	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	So I’m a little bit worried about the notion that residential investment will return soon to double-digit growth.	13	1
201407	2520	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Taking everything together, I still expect lower GDP growth than is shown in the Tealbook.	13	1
201407	2521	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Turning to inflation, recent readings have been unexpectedly firm, and the question is how much of that additional firmness to carry forward into the forecast.	13	1
201407	2522	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	The staff has pumped up its forecast a bit but not by a lot, and I think there could be some upside risk there.	13	1
201407	2523	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Two meetings ago I talked about the labor market, since we were about to drop our forward guidance referring to numerical thresholds for the unemployment rate.	13	1
201407	2524	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	For this meeting, we are considering a statement that shifts the emphasis away from the standard unemployment rate and toward other labor market indicators.	13	1
201407	2525	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	This is consistent with our general practice of considering the broadest possible range of data, as well as our continuing struggle to assess labor market conditions in the wake of the Great Recession.	13	1
201407	2526	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	We’ve been worried about the unusually large increase in long-term unemployment, the declining labor force participation rate, and the relatively high numbers of people working part time for economic reasons.	13	1
201407	2527	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	At the previous meeting I argued that despite these unusual developments, the unemployment rate still seems to be a good summary statistic for the current state of the labor market.	13	1
201407	2528	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	At this meeting I want to describe briefly a little bit of additional research on this question.	13	1
201407	2529	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	One simple way to approach this is to look at the joint behavior of an extended unemployment measure such as U-6, which includes both marginally attached workers and people working part time for economic reasons, with the standard unemployment rate, U-3.	13	1
201407	2530	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	The U-6 measure is greater than U-3, obviously, but if you look at a scatter plot with U-6 on the vertical axis and U-3 on the horizontal axis, you see a very tight linear relationship for unemployment rates below 7 percent.	13	1
201407	2531	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Since the Great Recession, however, there’s been an apparent upward shift in that relationship.	13	1
201407	2532	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Any given value of the standard unemployment rate has been associated with a higher value of U-6 than in the past, and right now the gap is about 1.6 percentage points.	13	1
201407	2533	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	And this fact supports the view that there is now more labor market underutilization than is typically associated with an unemployment rate of 6.1 percent.	13	1
201407	2534	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I want to make a couple of observations.	13	1
201407	2535	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	First, this apparent gap does not seem to be related to marginally attached workers, since for U-5 the current values lie along the relationship that was displayed before the Great Recession.	13	1
201407	2536	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Second, part-time workers are by definition working more than zero hours per week.	13	1
201407	2537	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	In fact, from the CPS, it looks like the average is about 23 hours per week.	13	1
201407	2538	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	As a result, a measure like U-6, in which a part-time worker counts the same as an unemployed worker, is biased upward as a measure of labor market underutilization.	13	1
201407	2539	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Part-time workers who would like to work full time are underutilized only to the extent that their hours worked would increase if they had the job they desired.	13	1
201407	2540	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	This suggests that in a good measure of labor market utilization, the proper weight for people working part time for economic reasons would be less than one.	13	1
201407	2541	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	In the CPS, the average weekly hours of part-time workers are about half the average weekly hours of full-time workers.	13	1
201407	2542	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	So the number of people working part time for economic reasons should get a weight of one-half, and if you adjust U-6 this way, you significantly reduce the extent to which it’s unusually high now.	13	1
201407	2543	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	In fact, you cut it almost in half.	13	1
201407	2544	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	In April, I discussed research on this topic by Richmond Fed economists.	13	1
201407	2545	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	What they did is take this reasoning to its logical conclusion.	13	1
201407	2546	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	They constructed a comprehensive index of labor market underutilization that includes all nonemployed adults.	13	1
201407	2547	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	The phrase “unemployment index” was already taken, so they call it the “nonemployment index.”	13	1
201407	2548	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Different groups are weighted by their likelihood of transitioning from their group to employment relative to the transition rate observed for the short-term unemployed.	13	1
201407	2549	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	So the long-term unemployed have about half the transition rate of the short-term unemployed.	13	1
201407	2550	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Those who are marginally attached are actually about the same as the long-term unemployed, with about half the transition rate of the short-term unemployed.	13	1
201407	2551	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	This seems like one of the most straightforward ways you could think of to construct a quantitative measure of labor market utilization that takes into account people out of the labor market who might transition back into the workforce as demand picks up.	13	1
201407	2552	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	It weights them by the historical odds of them making that kind of transition.	13	1
201407	2553	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	This nonemployment index turns out to be right in line with what’s usually associated with the current level of the standard unemployment rate.	13	1
201407	2554	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	In other words, it’s close to equal to the level of the index displayed in the past, before this recession, at times at which U-3 was 6.1 percent.	13	1
201407	2555	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	So this, to me, suggests that we ought to be a bit cautious about shifting the emphasis from the unemployment rate to some other labor market indicators, since they all seem to be pointing in about the same direction regarding the improvement in labor market outcomes.	13	1
201407	2556	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	13	1
201407	2557	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201407	2558	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	13	1
201407	2559	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	2560	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	The recent employment report was quite encouraging.	13	1
201407	2561	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I was once again surprised by how much the unemployment rate has declined and pleasantly surprised by the number of jobs created.	13	1
201407	2562	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Has this changed my view of the degree of labor market slack in the economy?	13	1
201407	2563	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	The short answer is yes, somewhat, but I still view labor markets as having substantial slack.	13	1
201407	2564	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	The U-3 measure of unemployment, at 6.1 percent, is well above my measure of full employment at 5¼ percent.	13	1
201407	2565	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	In addition, I think the U-3 measure of unemployment is not a sufficient statistic for labor market slack.	13	1
201407	2566	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	The combination of a significant number working part time for economic reasons, elevated long-term unemployment, and still-limited compensation pressures makes me comfortable pushing U-3 a bit lower than my estimate of full employment until these other factors are normalized as well.	13	1
201407	2567	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	For example, while New Hampshire and Vermont have unemployment rates well below 5 percent and Maine and Massachusetts are at 5½ percent, I’m not hearing any concerns of large wage pressures from employers.	13	1
201407	2568	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Consistent with this, I would note that in all four states the percentage of workers in the labor force who are working part time for economic reasons is roughly double the rate it was in 2005.	13	1
201407	2569	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Turning to my real GDP forecast, like the Tealbook I’m anticipating that growth will pick up during the second half of this year.	13	1
201407	2570	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, given that I and others have been overpredicting real GDP growth for some time, I will need to see signs that the pickup is really happening this time before I can have much confidence in that outlook.	13	1
201407	2571	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would note that the models we run in Boston have been expecting stronger residential investment and consumption than has occurred.	13	1
201407	2572	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Both equations have a desired, or target, level in their econometric specification.	13	1
201407	2573	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	With actual spending significantly below these target levels, the equations imply an acceleration of growth in the forecast as residential investment and consumption catch up to their target levels.	13	1
201407	2574	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, there’s an alternative explanation that is becoming more difficult to dismiss.	13	1
201407	2575	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Consumers and homebuyers may have become more risk-averse as a result of the financial crisis, or they may have significantly revised down their perceptions of lifetime resources.	13	1
201407	2576	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	In this scenario, the desired or target levels of consumption and residential investment, whose estimates cannot yet adequately capture this structural change, may be too optimistic.	13	1
201407	2577	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	For this reason, I still see some important downside risks to my modal forecast of a pickup in real GDP growth during the second half of this year.	13	1
201407	2578	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	My forecast for inflation is for a very slow return to our 2 percent goal.	13	1
201407	2579	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I expect core PCE inflation to remain below 2 percent into 2016, roughly in line with the Tealbook forecast.	13	1
201407	2580	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	If inflation continues to come in as expected—below target, as it has been for the past five years— we should have the latitude to be sure we get maximum employment before we fully normalize interest rates.	13	1
201407	2581	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	2582	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201407	2583	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	13	1
201407	2584	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	2585	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Economic activity in the Third District continues to grow moderately, and business contacts are becoming increasingly optimistic.	13	1
201407	2586	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Over the three months ending in June, employment grew at a 2.2 percent rate, and the unemployment rate fell to 6 percent, pretty much in line with the nation as a whole.	13	1
201407	2587	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Our Business Outlook Survey’s current activity index strengthened to 23.9 in July and is well above its nonrecession average of 9.9, as is the current employment index.	13	1
201407	2588	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The future general activity index rose to 58.1, just a touch below its highest reading in this recovery.	13	1
201407	2589	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	It is also well above its nonrecession average, which is only 29.	13	1
201407	2590	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Additionally, nearly 74 percent of the respondents to a special question anticipate increasing production over the second half of this year, with the majority anticipating increases of more than 4 percent.	13	1
201407	2591	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	When asked this same question a year ago, respondents were basically evenly divided between those expecting to and not expecting to increase production.	13	1
201407	2592	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Those attitudes among manufacturing firms in our District are markedly more upbeat than they were a year ago and, actually, more upbeat than they were earlier in the year.	13	1
201407	2593	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Residential construction remains at low levels in our District and is recovering at a disappointingly slow pace.	13	1
201407	2594	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Unlike the rest of the nation, much of the growth we have seen has been driven by the multifamily-sector market.	13	1
201407	2595	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I talked a little bit about this last time and the nature of the shift between single-family and multifamily construction.	13	1
201407	2596	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Permits for multifamily housing have risen sharply in the region year to year, led by very fast growth in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.	13	1
201407	2597	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Nonresidential construction has also been somewhat slow, although, as I previously reported, Comcast just broke ground for a new 50-story-high office building in Philadelphia, and two more of those are about to break ground later this summer.	13	1
201407	2598	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Regarding the slow nationwide recovery in housing, part of the sluggishness appears to be due to the significant declines in the homeownership rate among 25- to 39-year-olds.	13	1
201407	2599	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	This was indicated in the 2011 American Housing Survey, when compared with other surveys.	13	1
201407	2600	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	For example, there was a drop in homeownership of 10 percentage points between what one observed in the early 2000s and what one observed after 2011.	13	1
201407	2601	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Further, it appears this demographic group is increasingly relying on renting single-family homes.	13	1
201407	2602	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	This substitution may hint at difficulties in obtaining mortgages or perhaps at more-uncertain income prospects for this group, making homeownership less attractive.	13	1
201407	2603	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	It might also reflect attractive rental terms on distressed properties bought by investors.	13	1
201407	2604	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	This substitution could be contributing to the weakness in starts for new homes, as more rentals may originate from this pool of distressed home sales, thus lessening the need for new construction.	13	1
201407	2605	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	This trend may continue to weaken new single-family starts but still support multifamily dwellings.	13	1
201407	2606	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	No doubt this is only a partial explanation of the weakness in residential construction, but I generally think this topic of demographic and other shifts deserves a lot of investigation, and I welcome the staff’s memo on this topic.	13	1
201407	2607	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	It was quite good.	13	1
201407	2608	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Another puzzle, from my point of view—and this has been expressed around this table by a number of people—is the disparate behavior of employment and output.	13	1
201407	2609	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Over the first six months of the year, the economy has added approximately 1.4 million jobs and some additional capital, and yet it is producing roughly the same amount of output as it did in the fourth quarter of 2013.	13	1
201407	2610	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Now, as negative as one might be, it is hard to believe that total factor productivity has really taken such a dive as that.	13	1
201407	2611	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	One might be tempted to haul out the old labor-hoarding story, but when I talk to businesspeople in my District, they are searching hard for workers, especially those with skills, something they would not be doing if they had armies of idle employees sitting around on their factory floors.	13	1
201407	2612	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Another measure of output that I have started to look at is what we call GDP-plus, which we now post on our real-time data website in Philadelphia.	13	1
201407	2613	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	This measure results from optimally filtering GDP and GDI, or gross domestic income.	13	1
201407	2614	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	They measure different things.	13	1
201407	2615	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	They are supposed to be equal, but they are not.	13	1
201407	2616	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	And there is a lot of measurement error that goes into explaining why one may differ from the other.	13	1
201407	2617	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	We do this filtering in order to extract an underlying measure of output, and what this indicates is that the dramatic drop and first-quarter weakness in GDP was not as severe as the optimally filtered version would suggest.	13	1
201407	2618	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	So this sort of calculation actually tends to support the staff’s view that there is probably a lot of noise in the GDP numbers, and the weakness may be transitory in some sense.	13	1
201407	2619	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Now, all of these puzzles aside, my medium-term outlook for the national economy remains fairly upbeat and pretty much in agreement with the staff’s overall assessment of GDP growth.	13	1
201407	2620	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Actually, mine is a little below theirs, but not much.	13	1
201407	2621	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The incoming data, for me, appear consistent with growth of about 3 percent over the remainder of this year and next.	13	1
201407	2622	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I expect inflation will gradually approach the Committee’s objective, actually, by the end of this year.	13	1
201407	2623	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Thus, my views on the economy indicate that sometime late in the fall, we should stop reinvesting at least some portion of our principal payments and begin the process of normalizing the balance sheet.	13	1
201407	2624	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I also suspect that it will be appropriate to start raising the federal funds rate sooner than is implied by our current statement language, and that the forward guidance in our statement has outlived its usefulness.	13	1
201407	2625	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	And I will discuss those views in more detail tomorrow.	13	1
201407	2626	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	2627	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201407	2628	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13	1
201407	2629	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	2630	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	As President Plosser just mentioned and as others have remarked, the extent of the first-quarter contraction in real GDP is deeply puzzling in light of the wide array of data that point to solid gains in economic activity.	13	1
201407	2631	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	So my staff actually went to see how big this disconnect was between the GDP number—the decline of nearly 3 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter—and what we saw in the other data.	13	1
201407	2632	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	For this purpose they used a statistical FAVAR model that takes 121 individual economic indicators and looks for the common trend in those.	13	1
201407	2633	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	And this FAVAR model that doesn’t use GDP would have predicted real GDP growth of 2¾ percent in the first quarter—almost exactly what was reported, except for the sign.	13	1
201407	2634	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13	1
201407	2635	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	So it is a striking statistical way to see that what we are saying, and what I think the Board staff said in the Tealbook, is really supported by the data.	13	1
201407	2636	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Pretty much everything that we threw in the hopper was telling us that we were continuing with moderate growth.	13	1
201407	2637	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I wouldn’t declare the entire shortfall in first-quarter growth to be a measurement error, but I do agree with the Tealbook and many others that it does appear that the first-quarter GDP number is an anomaly.	13	1
201407	2638	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	We shouldn’t take much signal from it in terms of the underlying pace of expansion.	13	1
201407	2639	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	And overall, the broad set of incoming data is consistent with moderate growth for the rest of the year, as well as gradual progress toward our inflation goal.	13	1
201407	2640	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	My forecast for the next few years is very similar to the Tealbook’s.	13	1
201407	2641	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	The only difference, which has been there for some time, is that I expect inflation to come back toward our 2 percent goal slightly faster than the Tealbook does.	13	1
201407	2642	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	One area that continues to surprise on the upside is the labor market.	13	1
201407	2643	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, I think we have seen a wide range of indicators in the labor market showing improvement as good as or better than we were expecting.	13	1
201407	2644	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Notably, payroll and household employment have been showing solid gains.	13	1
201407	2645	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Many of us have already referred to this good news concerning the labor market, but the one striking exception is the tepid pace of compensation growth, which, despite the improvement in the labor market, continues to run around 2 percent or so.	13	1
201407	2646	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	And this is obviously an important issue, because we look at wage growth both as a sign of the state of the labor market in terms of slack—in terms of our maximum employment mandate—and also as a signal of its effects on inflationary pressures, in terms of our inflation mandate.	13	1
201407	2647	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	A couple of meetings ago I talked about some of the research at the San Francisco Fed about the effects of downward nominal wage rigidities that may be influencing the pattern of compensation growth and holding it back over the past couple of years.	13	1
201407	2648	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	But still, there is a deeper puzzle about what has been happening with wages for several years, and I am going to focus the rest of my comments on some of the longer-term structural changes in the labor market, specifically concerning labor’s share of income, which obviously affects compensation growth and also inflationary pressures.	13	1
201407	2649	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s good to remember that in many economic models, including FRB/US and most DSGE models, labor share is a key driver of marginal cost and inflationary pressures.	13	1
201407	2650	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Over the past few years, labor share in the nonfarm business sector has averaged about 57 percent, which is well below its long-run historical average of around 62 percent.	13	1
201407	2651	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	If you take it at face value, which most models would do, this metric—this very low labor share—would suggest very low cost pressures for inflation.	13	1
201407	2652	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	It suggests also that wage growth should be quite strong in the period ahead.	13	1
201407	2653	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, my message is one of caution against relying on where the labor share is relative to some historical measure of its normal value in gauging either labor market slack or inflationary pressures.	13	1
201407	2654	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	One of the things that many of us were taught is that the labor share in the United States is relatively constant.	13	1
201407	2655	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	And that was true for several decades.	13	1
201407	2656	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	But in fact, when you do a deeper dive, looking underneath the fact that labor share is relatively constant for the first four decades after World War II, there were actually a lot of things happening.	13	1
201407	2657	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	In certain sectors it was going up, and in others it was going down.	13	1
201407	2658	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	So in a way it was pure coincidence that it happened to seem so flat.	13	1
201407	2659	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Actually, since the late 1980s, we have seen a substantial downward trend in labor share.	13	1
201407	2660	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the fact that it has been going on for so long—it’s not related to the current recession or recovery—suggests that there really are structural, rather than cyclical, factors driving this, or at least most of this.	13	1
201407	2661	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	There is quite a bit of literature on this now, talking about what could be causing labor share to decline.	13	1
201407	2662	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Maybe it’s information technology capital replacing routine labor, the effects of globalization, or the reduced bargaining power of workers.	13	1
201407	2663	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Due to the timing of the decline, one of the prime suspects has been the increasing rate at which IT capital is replacing labor.	13	1
201407	2664	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	If robots replace workers on the auto assembly line, a greater share of the price of a car may go to capital rather than labor.	13	1
201407	2665	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Another explanation involves globalization:  If the labor-intensive jobs, such as those at call centers, are offshored, the income share of the US economy going to domestic workers is reduced.	13	1
201407	2666	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, these explanations for a lower labor share are likely complementary and reinforcing, and I am not going to take a stand on the question, is it IT, is it labor bargaining power, or is it globalization.	13	1
201407	2667	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	But the key theme that comes out of this literature is that these are long-running structural changes in our labor market.	13	1
201407	2668	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	So in our own thinking about where the economy is going, we shouldn’t be expecting labor share to go back to some normal historical level.	13	1
201407	2669	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, looking forward, it is really hard to know which way labor share should go.	13	1
201407	2670	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Should it stay at its very low level of around 57 percent?	13	1
201407	2671	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Should it rise somewhat as the economy improves?	13	1
201407	2672	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Or maybe this downward trend will actually continue into the future.	13	1
201407	2673	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I view labor share, which used to be viewed as one of these cosmological constants— these great stylized facts of macroeconomics, like potential output growth, like the natural rate of interest, and a lot of things that we took for granted were constant, probably never really were, and clearly aren’t today.	13	1
201407	2674	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	And so in thinking about the implications of that, I think what it means is that we shouldn’t be expecting labor share to be moving back.	13	1
201407	2675	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	We should be more realistic about our ability to measure the equilibrium value of wages, or real wages, relative to productivity.	13	1
201407	2676	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Looking forward, if we thought the labor share would return to its earlier postwar benchmark, we would be expecting strong compensation growth relative to productivity growth.	13	1
201407	2677	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	But my reading of this literature is that a large part of this decline is really driven by structural factors, and a full recovery in the labor market may have real wages growing at no more than the pace of potential productivity growth, and perhaps actually below that, because if you have a declining labor share, you would actually expect real wages to be growing slightly slower than productivity growth.	13	1
201407	2678	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I think it’s one of the factors that can help us understand why wage growth hasn’t been as strong as we might have thought.	13	1
201407	2679	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I still think there is a significant cyclical aspect of this.	13	1
201407	2680	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m not downplaying that.	13	1
201407	2681	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	But we have been going through all of the factors that might explain why wage growth has been well below what we thought.	13	1
201407	2682	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I think we just have to keep this in mind when we think about what the new normal for the economy is.	13	1
201407	2683	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Pretty much every variable seems to have a new normal, and we need to adjust this in our models and our thinking.	13	1
201407	2684	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13	1
201407	2685	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201407	2686	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	13	1
201407	2687	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	2688	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I am going to briefly mention my District, and then talk about my soundings with my interlocutors, and then just make a comment or two about the national economy.	13	1
201407	2689	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	And I’m going to refrain from signaling my views on policy until tomorrow.	13	1
201407	2690	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	First of all, with regard to my District, I think it was General Sheridan who said that if he had a choice, he would live in hell and rent out Texas, and I am trying to figure out why, because I think if he had rented out Texas, he would have made a hell of a lot of money.	13	1
201407	2691	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	[Laugher]	13	1
201407	2692	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	He probably wouldn’t have enjoyed it as much being in hell.	13	1
201407	2693	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	But just to give you some statistics, again, we continue to be an aberration.	13	1
201407	2694	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Our employment grew at a rate of 4.3 percent in the second quarter.	13	1
201407	2695	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Our output was 3.7 percent last year—that’s twice the national pace of 1.8 percent.	13	1
201407	2696	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	So on both fronts we continue to barrel along.	13	1
201407	2697	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	And I use the term “barrel.”	13	1
201407	2698	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Of course, energy is a helpful underwriter of what we are doing.	13	1
201407	2699	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	We’ve got a highly diversified economy.	13	1
201407	2700	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	The real median sales price of homes in my District, which is 96 to 97 percent Texas, rose 0.7 percent last month.	13	1
201407	2701	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	And leasing activity for office and industrial space is strong.	13	1
201407	2702	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Rents are rising.	13	1
201407	2703	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Construction is robust.	13	1
201407	2704	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	And it’s not Philadelphia, but we actually have a 50-story building being built in Midland, Texas, which is in the middle of nowhere.	13	1
201407	2705	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I am seeing that in every city—San Francisco, as we talked about earlier, President Williams, and all across the country, and it’s certainly true in our case.	13	1
201407	2706	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	We released our Texas manufacturing survey on Monday.	13	1
201407	2707	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	From the standpoint of new orders, capacity utilization, and shipments, the July readings for these indexes were more than twice their 10-year averages.	13	1
201407	2708	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	And today we released the service numbers and the retail sales numbers, and we are seeing a similar type of pattern.	13	1
201407	2709	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	So my District continues to barrel along, and nothing has changed from that standpoint.	13	1
201407	2710	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	In terms of interlocutors and my CEO contacts, as you know, I like to look first at what moves things—the ships, the rails, the express companies, or the airlines.	13	1
201407	2711	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	You have to set ships aside to a great degree because of the Chinese builds that have come.	13	1
201407	2712	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	They are now only second to Korea.	13	1
201407	2713	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	They have surpassed Japan.	13	1
201407	2714	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	There is enormous capacity in the market.	13	1
201407	2715	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	It’s very hard to look at the leasing rates in terms of the large ships, and particularly the bulk shippers, and really ascertain any pattern other than the fact that China continues to stockpile iron ore in bulk.	13	1
201407	2716	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	But I was very strongly impressed by the reports of the airlines.	13	1
201407	2717	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Advance bookings are up 5 to 6 percent, year over year, depending on who you speak to.	13	1
201407	2718	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	From the standpoint of the express companies, if you look at the volume of packages that they are processing, through last week, when I had my last conversation, it was up 7 percent year over year.	13	1
201407	2719	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	There’s been quite a change in composition, by the way—if you’re looking at the standard stuff that one would ship, the numbers are in single digits.	13	1
201407	2720	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	But if you look at what is processed through e-commerce, the rates are running 14 percent year over year.	13	1
201407	2721	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	These are substantial.	13	1
201407	2722	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	And they are beginning to take price, both the airlines and the shippers, and the way they are doing it in the express shippers is really by what they call dimensional pricing, but it’s just a change in format.	13	1
201407	2723	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	The net, bottom-line effect is a price increase of about 2½ to 3 percent.	13	1
201407	2724	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	From the standpoint of the issue of wage/price pressure, there are certain areas where you see it, certainly in an area of robust economic growth like we have, or like you have in San Francisco and the Bay Area.	13	1
201407	2725	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	But the constant theme that I am hearing from my contacts is more related to the quits ratio.	13	1
201407	2726	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	That is, whether it is a very large telecom company or one of the smaller companies, they are seeing an ability of their workforce with middle-level compensation to take the risk to go somewhere else, and they are finding jobs.	13	1
201407	2727	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	That is one manifestation.	13	1
201407	2728	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	It might be a leading indicator—we’ll just have to monitor that.	13	1
201407	2729	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	The other is the rapidity with which they can replace an employee that leaves.	13	1
201407	2730	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	And that has been stretched out, according to my interlocutors.	13	1
201407	2731	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	So I think this is just something worth observing.	13	1
201407	2732	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	And, last, I would observe, as far as the US economy, that all of the indexes that we have seen, at least the regional ones that have come out recently—I hasten to remind you that ours is the most timely because it runs through last week—they are all positive.	13	1
201407	2733	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I was impressed by the Chicago Fed’s national activity index, which showed above-normal growth in June, and also by the jobless claims report, which may be a little bit variable.	13	1
201407	2734	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	But if I read the four-week moving averages correctly, the last time we had this kind of movement was in May 2007.	13	1
201407	2735	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	The best description I received in all of my CEO calls—and I completed 30 for this meeting, not just in my District but all across the country, all sizes and shapes, public and private—was that the economy is proceeding in a “methodical, protracted, sustainable growth mode.”	13	1
201407	2736	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Among people who operate businesses, the fear that we are going to slide into deflation or into a Japanese stasis, or reverse gears, has become a miniscule—in their word—tail risk.	13	1
201407	2737	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	We may not be growing at a robust pace, but there is much more confidence in the private sector, and it increases with each sounding that I take for these meetings.	13	1
201407	2738	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	2739	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201407	2740	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13	1
201407	2741	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	2742	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Following President Fisher reminds me of a quick story about the Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia speaking in Houston a few years ago.	13	1
201407	2743	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	He started his speech by saying, “I feel that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the State of Texas have much in common.	13	1
201407	2744	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	We both like close relations with the United States.”	13	1
201407	2745	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	[Laughter]	13	1
201407	2746	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Let me start with a summary of views from District contacts in recent weeks.	13	1
201407	2747	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Sentiment about the course of the economy has clearly improved since the previous FOMC meeting.	13	1
201407	2748	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	The outlook and confidence level of our business contacts, while not over-the-top exuberant, are about as positive as we have heard over the recovery.	13	1
201407	2749	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Retail industry contacts recounted a nice bounceback in consumer spending from the first quarter.	13	1
201407	2750	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Consumer auto purchases, which are dominated by the new car segment that they call the light truck category, and that includes SUVs and crossover vehicles, continue to be quite strong and are expected to continue so.	13	1
201407	2751	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Commercial real estate investment seems to be picking up.	13	1
201407	2752	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard references to some amount of speculative building in commercial real estate.	13	1
201407	2753	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Business capital investment continues to strengthen.	13	1
201407	2754	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Notably, we heard reports of a pickup in capital investment plans on the part of smaller businesses.	13	1
201407	2755	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Most medium and larger companies indicated that credit is readily available.	13	1
201407	2756	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	It’s been our practice every cycle to ask contacts about their hiring activity and hiring plans.	13	1
201407	2757	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Despite the evident pickup in the national data, labor demand on the part of our contacts is still couched in cautious terms.	13	1
201407	2758	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Many companies continue to report postponing decisions to add employees.	13	1
201407	2759	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	From those who are hiring, we continue to hear reports of difficulty finding qualified workers.	13	1
201407	2760	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	This is not a new story, but the challenge of filling positions appears to be both intensifying and broadening out across the skill and occupation spectrum.	13	1
201407	2761	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Where companies are actively hiring and finding a shortage of qualified applicants, we heard reports of upward pressure on offer wages.	13	1
201407	2762	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	This is something of a new development.	13	1
201407	2763	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	More generally, we are getting some signals that we associate with tightening labor markets.	13	1
201407	2764	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard accounts, for example, of firms lowering hiring standards.	13	1
201407	2765	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	We also heard accounts of firms expanding training programs for both new hires and staff they hope to retain.	13	1
201407	2766	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Most companies still report merit increases of 2 to 3 percent, but we heard more mention of higher increases either planned or already implemented.	13	1
201407	2767	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Finally, we continue to ask about pricing power.	13	1
201407	2768	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	We are beginning to hear claims of successes in pushing through price increases.	13	1
201407	2769	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Several companies said they are intending to increase prices over the remainder of the year and are confident the price increases will stick.	13	1
201407	2770	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Because the estimation of labor resource slack is so central to policy questions, my staff did further work over the intermeeting period trying to more completely understand the total part-time worker phenomenon.	13	1
201407	2771	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Based on data in the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey, the total part-time share of employment rose about 3 percentage points to 19.7 percent during the recession, and it is currently about 2 percentage points higher than before the recession, at 18.3 percent.	13	1
201407	2772	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Almost all of the increase in the part-time employment share is accounted for by the rise in involuntary part-time workers.	13	1
201407	2773	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	The rise in PTER is broad based and can be seen in almost every industry and occupational group.	13	1
201407	2774	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	The greatest increases in PTER occurred in industries that typically have a large part-time workforce—retail sales, food services, personal care, health- care support, and construction.	13	1
201407	2775	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	But to repeat, PTER increased across a wide spectrum of industries and occupations.	13	1
201407	2776	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	My staff looked into whether feedback from operating businesses in our District lines up with the thesis that the elevated level of people working part time reflects primarily cyclical as opposed to structural forces.	13	1
201407	2777	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Additionally, my staff examined whether the weakness we have seen in hourly wage growth is consistent or uniform across both full-time and part-time workers.	13	1
201407	2778	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	To get at the first question, we conducted a survey involving a good spread of about 400 midsize to large firms in our District and asked them to compare their utilization of part-time workers today versus before the recession.	13	1
201407	2779	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	We also asked them to cite the main reason for any change in their mix of full-time and part-time workers.	13	1
201407	2780	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	We found that 25 percent of firms have a higher share of part-time workers.	13	1
201407	2781	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Those citing weak business conditions as the reason for greater use of part-time workers were about equal with those citing the increasing hourly compensation costs of full-time workers associated with the Affordable Care Act, for example.	13	1
201407	2782	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Our survey results suggest that there is a combination of cyclical and structural explanations for the rise in part-time workers.	13	1
201407	2783	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	On the wage growth question, we found from data in the CPS that the growth rate of median hourly wages for people who are working part time for economic reasons has been flat since 2007, while wages have increased about 5 percent over this period for voluntary part-time workers and 14½ percent for full-time workers.	13	1
201407	2784	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Our tentative conclusion is the weakness in aggregate hourly wage growth seems to have been influenced by relatively stagnant wages of part-time workers in general, but especially PTER workers.	13	1
201407	2785	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Turning to my outlook, my current thinking is very similar to that outlined in the Tealbook.	13	1
201407	2786	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I expect the second-quarter bounceback to be less impressive than earlier expected, but I am holding to the view that the growth run rate is accelerating to around 3 percent.	13	1
201407	2787	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Looking at indicators of GDP growth, I see the data on payroll employment, industrial production and manufacturing, and business capital investment, as indicated by capital goods shipments, all supporting the assumption of something near a 3 percent run rate.	13	1
201407	2788	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	The consumer spending trend is less affirming of a 3 percent assumption.	13	1
201407	2789	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	So I take that as a reason for reserving judgment on the true strength and momentum of the economy pending more validation by incoming data.	13	1
201407	2790	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	As regards the balance of risks, I continue to see the risks to the growth and inflation outlooks as broadly balanced.	13	1
201407	2791	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	And, like most others, I’ve consistently misread the path of the unemployment rate as it has fallen more rapidly than I projected.	13	1
201407	2792	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	My year-end unemployment projection is just a couple of tenths below the current rate of 6.1 percent, but I wouldn’t be surprised if I am on the high side once again.	13	1
201407	2793	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Since I am in the camp of putting substantial weight on other labor market indicators, the risks around U-3 per se influence my thinking on appropriate policy less than growth risks and inflation risks.	13	1
201407	2794	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	2795	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201407	2796	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13	1
201407	2797	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	2798	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Growth in the Seventh District was relatively strong in the second quarter.	13	1
201407	2799	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	The auto sector was a source of strength for the District, as well as industries supplying the aerospace and energy sectors.	13	1
201407	2800	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Activity also is picking up in the steel and heavy equipment sectors, although the latter is still being held back by weakness in global mining.	13	1
201407	2801	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Business contacts reported that capital expenditures and plans for future expansions continued to increase.	13	1
201407	2802	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Most expenditures remain concentrated on equipment for industrial and IT uses.	13	1
201407	2803	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	But our sources also noted modest capacity expansions, especially by auto suppliers.	13	1
201407	2804	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	As President Lacker reported, our banking directors reported stronger loan demand, and that’s a good sign if it continues.	13	1
201407	2805	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	By the way, one of my bankers went down to Texas and reported back that things are really booming, before I could stop him to say I already get a report on that [laughter].	13	1
201407	2806	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	It seems to be confirmation of that.	13	1
201407	2807	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Hiring in the Seventh District picked up, particularly in the service industries.	13	1
201407	2808	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	One of the big staffing firms noted that its clients have been experiencing higher turnover in skilled positions.	13	1
201407	2809	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	In addition, the firms are pushing to fill empty positions faster.	13	1
201407	2810	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	The continued improvement in the tone of my business contacts’ commentary strongly suggests that second-quarter growth was quite robust.	13	1
201407	2811	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Most CEOs I talk with note their improved economic performance, but they don’t readily see their improvement translating into an economy with national growth above 3 percent.	13	1
201407	2812	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Perhaps an abundance of caution is continuing to weigh on CEOs and prevent them from articulating stronger growth scenarios.	13	1
201407	2813	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	After all, one such storyline could be in housing.	13	1
201407	2814	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	We have been expecting housing to improve more, but as the special Board staff memo discussed, housing has yet to gain much traction.	13	1
201407	2815	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, our housing finance contacts are not optimistic that the pool of potential first- time homebuyers will be able to gain adequate access to mortgage credit over the near term.	13	1
201407	2816	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	And, as one of my banker directors noted, when commenting on the stability of his deposit base, households still have a relatively high propensity to save.	13	1
201407	2817	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Without a stronger consumer, there is no reason for business investment to ramp up.	13	1
201407	2818	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I think businesses still have concerns about the strength of future consumption.	13	1
201407	2819	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I hope this is just hand-wringing, but I still think we should avoid getting overconfident about our growth forecast.	13	1
201407	2820	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Meanwhile, I still don’t see a lot going on with regard to inflation.	13	1
201407	2821	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	My contacts did report some initial signs of upward wage pressures.	13	1
201407	2822	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Most were small, and many were for skilled labor.	13	1
201407	2823	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Nonwage labor costs were little changed, although energy costs remained elevated.	13	1
201407	2824	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	However, my contacts say prices at the wholesale level have changed little, and that competition is putting downward pressure on retail prices, compressing margins.	13	1
201407	2825	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	To be sure, we have seen some higher inflation numbers this spring, and the Tealbook quite reasonably has revised up its inflation projection.	13	1
201407	2826	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	But we need to keep in mind that the Tealbook forecast is still below target beyond 2016.	13	1
201407	2827	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	My own inflation forecast is a bit below the Tealbook.	13	1
201407	2828	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Most of our Chicago Fed statistical models are projecting inflation lower than the Tealbook forecast.	13	1
201407	2829	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Notably, our model that extracts inflation forecasts from the term structure of interest rates is looking for core PCE prices to increase only 1.3 percent in 2016.	13	1
201407	2830	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	My inflation outlook is higher than 1.3 percent for 2016, but these inflation indicator forecasts should remind us that we are not yet clearly on a sustained path toward our 2 percent target.	13	1
201407	2831	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	2832	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201407	2833	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	13	1
201407	2834	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	2835	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Economic conditions in the Fourth District have improved over the intermeeting period.	13	1
201407	2836	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Since our previous meeting, I have traveled to our Branches in Pittsburgh and Cincinnati, as well as to Columbus, Ohio, meeting with business leaders and bankers in all three cities.	13	1
201407	2837	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	There seems to be a sense of optimism that the expansion is sustainable and is picking up momentum.	13	1
201407	2838	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Now, I don’t believe all of the renewed confidence is attributable to Cleveland’s winning the hosting duties for the Republican National Convention.	13	1
201407	2839	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	However, it may be because LeBron James is returning home.	13	1
201407	2840	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	[Laughter]	13	1
201407	2841	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Only time is going to tell.	13	1
201407	2842	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	District payroll employment has increased at nearly a 1 percent annual pace so far this year, very similar to the nation and strong enough to have driven the Fourth District’s unemployment rate down to 5.9 percent, slightly below the national average.	13	1
201407	2843	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Over the longer run, District employment growth has tended to be less than the US average, and unemployment has tended to be higher, so I read the labor market trends in the District as being favorable.	13	1
201407	2844	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Anecdotal reports continue to suggest that more employment gains are likely in the future, with a large proportion of contacts reporting planned increases in staffing levels, although at a modest pace.	13	1
201407	2845	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	In addition, in light of improving conditions, about half of the contacts we surveyed for this meeting indicated they intend to increase capital expenditures in coming months.	13	1
201407	2846	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	This is a significantly higher fraction than at the end of last year.	13	1
201407	2847	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	An increasing number of District businesses also noted it was easier to obtain financing from banks than had been the case in some time.	13	1
201407	2848	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	While residential building activity appears to have changed little in recent months, nonresidential building activity is picking up.	13	1
201407	2849	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	So far, there are few signs of price pressures either building or diminishing among firms in the District.	13	1
201407	2850	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	So the bottom line is that the Fourth District’s economy is making steady progress and the outlook is for that to continue.	13	1
201407	2851	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	At the national level, like the Tealbook, I attribute most of the first-quarter weakness to transitory factors, especially the bad weather.	13	1
201407	2852	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I take more signal about the underlying strength of the economy from the improvement in labor market conditions, which has exceeded the expectations of many economists.	13	1
201407	2853	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	The unemployment rate has fallen to 6.1 percent.	13	1
201407	2854	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	That’s nearly 1 percentage point lower than last July’s Tealbook was projecting it to be at this point.	13	1
201407	2855	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	While long-term unemployment remains elevated, the declines over the past year in a broad set of unemployment rate measures are some of the largest we have seen in many years.	13	1
201407	2856	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Payroll employment growth has also strengthened and is running above expectations.	13	1
201407	2857	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	On the inflation front, the data continue to be consistent with inflation gradually picking up to our 2 percent goal over time.	13	1
201407	2858	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland Fed’s median and trimmed mean CPI measures decelerated last month, as did the overall CPI.	13	1
201407	2859	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Yet even with the most recent readings, by a number of measures including the CPI, core CPI, and the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI and trimmed mean CPI, year-over-year inflation has increased since the start of the year.	13	1
201407	2860	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	My staff’s VAR model forecasts inflation to be on a positive trajectory over the forecast horizon.	13	1
201407	2861	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Rising inflation is consistent with a pickup in economic growth and inflation expectations well anchored at our target.	13	1
201407	2862	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	And I note that the Cleveland Fed’s 10-year inflation expectations measure has remained essentially stable near 2 percent.	13	1
201407	2863	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	One question is whether this is a reasonable inflation forecast, as we haven’t seen much acceleration in wages yet.	13	1
201407	2864	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	So I asked my staff to investigate the lead-lag structure of wage and price inflation.	13	1
201407	2865	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Their analysis included several measures of wages and broader compensation and concluded that it has been difficult to find a lead-lag relationship between wages and prices.	13	1
201407	2866	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	The strongest correlations are contemporaneous ones, especially since the mid-1980s.	13	1
201407	2867	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	More-formal Granger causality tests are also quite mixed and, if anything, lean toward suggesting that price inflation Granger-causes wage inflation.	13	1
201407	2868	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Moreover, my staff finds no evidence that wages and compensation help to predict price inflation out of sample.	13	1
201407	2869	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Similar to a finding reported in the Tealbook, my staff found there hasn’t been a stable Phillips-curve relationship between unemployment gaps and price inflation since the 1980s, but there does seem to be a more stable relationship for wage inflation.	13	1
201407	2870	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Taken together, these results suggest that we should continue to include wage developments as an indicator when assessing tightness in labor markets, but that current subdued wage growth is not inconsistent with our forecasts of rising price inflation.	13	1
201407	2871	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	We should expect wages to rise with prices, not necessarily to lead prices.	13	1
201407	2872	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	In addition, we cannot simply wait for wages to accelerate before assessing the implications of future price inflation for the stance of monetary policy.	13	1
201407	2873	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	So I continue to forecast that inflation will move back toward target over time.	13	1
201407	2874	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Similarly, I have made little change in my growth and employment forecast since last time.	13	1
201407	2875	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I project that growth will be about 3 percent in the second half of this year through 2016, and that the unemployment rate will continue to decline.	13	1
201407	2876	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I see the risks around my forecast, including international developments, as broadly balanced.	13	1
201407	2877	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	At this point, financial-stability risk is low, but leveraged lending is something that we need to continue to monitor carefully.	13	1
201407	2878	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Now, my projections incorporate continued reductions in the pace of purchases, with the program ending in October.	13	1
201407	2879	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	With continued steady progress in labor markets toward the Committee’s longer-run goal of maximum employment, I tie liftoff from the zero lower bound to when inflation between one and two years ahead reaches the Committee’s goal of 2 percent.	13	1
201407	2880	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	After liftoff, my funds rate path follows the path suggested by a Taylor rule with inertia.	13	1
201407	2881	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	In my projection, liftoff occurs in the first quarter of 2015.	13	1
201407	2882	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Using my liftoff criterion, this is sooner than would have been projected at the start of this year, reflecting better-than-expected realized and projected progress toward our dual-mandate goals.	13	1
201407	2883	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	We have been consistently underestimating the economic progress being made.	13	1
201407	2884	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	The Tealbook sees the output gap as 1½ percentage points narrower than last July’s Tealbook was estimating it to be at this point.	13	1
201407	2885	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	The current Tealbook now sees the output gap being eliminated by next summer.	13	1
201407	2886	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	This is three quarters earlier than in the June Tealbook.	13	1
201407	2887	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I think it is prudent to plan for the possibility of liftoff sooner than market participants are currently anticipating.	13	1
201407	2888	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	2889	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201407	2890	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13	1
201407	2891	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	2892	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	The Eighth District economy continues to expand at a modest pace.	13	1
201407	2893	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Retail activity in the District has expanded, especially in the restaurant sector.	13	1
201407	2894	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Activity in residential real estate markets has been tepid, but commercial real estate markets have shown improvement.	13	1
201407	2895	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Labor market conditions in the District are improving but continue to lag the nation.	13	1
201407	2896	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Recent reports on hiring plans in manufacturing and services have been positive on balance.	13	1
201407	2897	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	One example is Big River Steel, which plans to open a $1.1 billion steel mill in northeastern Arkansas with approximately 500 employees and an average salary of $75,000 per year.	13	1
201407	2898	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Another example is an Amazon expansion.	13	1
201407	2899	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	They are building a new distribution center in Shepherdsville, Kentucky, with 500 new full-time employees, in order to meet increasing demand.	13	1
201407	2900	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Turning to the national economy, I continue to believe that we are in a wait-and-see mode, especially with respect to economic growth.	13	1
201407	2901	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	We need confirmation that the underlying strength that seems to be apparent in anecdotal reports on the economy as well as in labor market data is actually showing through in GDP performance.	13	1
201407	2902	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	But I largely agree with the Tealbook’s baseline interpretation that growth will be relatively strong in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2014 and into 2016.	13	1
201407	2903	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	In conjunction with this scenario, I see unemployment continuing to fall, other labor market indicators continuing to show improvement, and inflation continuing to rise to eventually exceed our 2 percent inflation target in 2015.	13	1
201407	2904	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I want to pause and acknowledge the box on multiple equilibriums in the Tealbook.	13	1
201407	2905	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I’m an advocate of multiple-equilibrium stories, and I appreciated the appearance of this in the Tealbook.	13	1
201407	2906	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I think the Tealbook gave a fair characterization that this continues to be a risk to any scenario—mine in particular, but anybody’s scenario about the US economy.	13	1
201407	2907	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I have become more concerned that something of a mismatch is developing between the distance of macroeconomic outcomes from Committee goals, on the one hand, and the distance of policy tools from normal settings, on the other.	13	1
201407	2908	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	In short, we are quite close in terms of macroeconomic goals, but as distanced as we have been in the postwar era from normal in terms of policy tool settings.	13	1
201407	2909	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	In terms of macroeconomic goals, inflation is just a few ticks from target, and unemployment, at 6.1 percent, is only somewhat higher than many of the estimates of the long- run rate put forward by members of this Committee.	13	1
201407	2910	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	If one puts these numbers into a loss function based on squared deviations from long-run values with equal weight on unemployment and inflation—the type of loss function often used in staff assessments of optimal policy—one finds that current goal variables are quite close to target compared with historical experience since 1960.	13	1
201407	2911	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	In fact, we are closer to goals today than we have been most of the time historically.	13	1
201407	2912	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Of all of the months since 1960, we’re doing better today by this criterion than we have approximately 80 percent of the time.	13	1
201407	2913	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Policy tool settings, in contrast, are nowhere near normal.	13	1
201407	2914	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	The policy rate, at near zero, is 350 to 400 basis points below normal.	13	1
201407	2915	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	The size of the balance sheet was on the order of 5 to 6 percent of GDP before the crisis but today is on the order of 25 percent of GDP.	13	1
201407	2916	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	If one puts numbers like this into a similar quadratic objective based on squared deviations of the policy rate from normal and the balance sheet from normal with equal weight on the two dimensions, one finds that the current values are as far from normal as we have ever been in the postwar era since 1960.	13	1
201407	2917	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	These simple calculations indicate a growing mismatch between what monetary policy is doing and the reality on the ground for the US economy.	13	1
201407	2918	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	If the economy confirms the relatively strong growth expectations that I have and that are contained in the Tealbook in the months and quarters ahead, this mismatch between policy settings and actual macroeconomic outcomes will become a more pressing issue for this Committee.	13	1
201407	2919	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	2920	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201407	2921	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13	1
201407	2922	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	2923	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	The Tenth District economy expanded modestly since the previous meeting, with unemployment rates falling near or below historical averages in most District states.	13	1
201407	2924	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Our contacts reported labor shortages and wage pressures for certain positions in trucking, construction, high tech, and high-skilled areas, although actual wage increases have been modest in most industries.	13	1
201407	2925	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Current high oil prices continue to support strong oil-drilling activity in the District, and production activity has started to create positive spillovers.	13	1
201407	2926	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Rail activity has been particularly strong this year.	13	1
201407	2927	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	A large railroad headquartered in the District plans to add some 1,000 jobs and to significantly boost capital spending.	13	1
201407	2928	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	A senior executive at this firm noted that it was the first significant midyear spending increase he has seen during his lengthy tenure with the company.	13	1
201407	2929	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	At a national level, of course, employment in the rail industry has hit its highest level in over two decades.	13	1
201407	2930	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Crop prices continue to fall alongside favorable growing conditions this summer, which have reduced profit margins for producers.	13	1
201407	2931	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	The profitability of livestock operations, however, continues to improve.	13	1
201407	2932	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Cattle and hog prices both set new records amid persistently low inventories and relatively strong demand.	13	1
201407	2933	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Turning to the national economy, I share the Tealbook’s view that the feeble growth readings during the first half of the year largely reflect influences that should not persist in the second half.	13	1
201407	2934	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Although forecast misses and data surprises have been the norm over the past few years, I do see something different this year in the labor market data that gives me growing confidence in the economy’s ability to sustain growth.	13	1
201407	2935	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Not only has job growth been strong over the past six months, but average payroll growth this year has exceeded the average of the top 10 most optimistic forecasts from this past January’s Blue Chip survey.	13	1
201407	2936	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Job openings have surged and are back to their post-crisis peak, while the private quits rate has moved higher.	13	1
201407	2937	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	I wanted to highlight three aspects of the labor market that I think corroborate the current level of the unemployment rate and point to less slack.	13	1
201407	2938	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	The first is that the labor market seems to be better allocating labor in terms of matching high-skilled workers with high-skilled jobs.	13	1
201407	2939	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	My staff has done analysis showing job growth has been strong this year for workers with a college education entering high-skilled occupations, which has occurred alongside their declining employment in middle-skill occupations.	13	1
201407	2940	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	This rotation has coincided with a sharp rise in employment for high school graduates into these middle-skill jobs.	13	1
201407	2941	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	This suggests to me that labor markets are functioning much better, as we are now seeing signs of workers moving up the job ladder.	13	1
201407	2942	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Second, I’m encouraged by the flow rates of the unemployed back into jobs.	13	1
201407	2943	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	While the probability of reemployment of the short-term unemployed is back to normal levels, the reemployment probability for the longer-term unemployed also has moved higher.	13	1
201407	2944	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	For example, the probability of reemployment of those unemployed longer than 52 weeks is near its pre-crisis average.	13	1
201407	2945	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	While the data can be volatile and subject to revision, I still view this as a positive development.	13	1
201407	2946	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Along these same lines, the U-6 measure of unemployment has fallen at its fastest pace compared with any other time in the past two decades.	13	1
201407	2947	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	My third point is my staff’s labor market index, which considers 24 labor market indicators, shows slack continues to diminish.	13	1
201407	2948	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Of these 24 indicators, 19 are currently making a positive contribution to the headline index over the past six months, indicating broad-based improvement.	13	1
201407	2949	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, the momentum indicator they pull from this data remains near its highest levels over the past two decades.	13	1
201407	2950	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	While the improvements in the labor market are encouraging, there is still the question of wage growth, but even here, growth in average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers has moved higher since late 2012, and the number of firms reporting few or no qualified applicants for job openings in the NFIB survey is back to pre-crisis levels.	13	1
201407	2951	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	So while we still wait to see firmer data indicating rising wages, these indicators and the general improvement in the labor market suggest to me stronger wage growth could be in the pipeline.	13	1
201407	2952	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Turning to inflation, longer-term inflation expectations, of course, appear to remain well anchored.	13	1
201407	2953	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	A five-year, five-year-ahead tradable measure of inflation has fluctuated tightly in a range that can be viewed as consistent with our 2 percent goal.	13	1
201407	2954	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Nearer-term measures of inflation expectations, such as one-year, one-year-ahead implied inflation from CPI swaps, have moved higher over the past few months.	13	1
201407	2955	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	These financial market indicators, along with firmer inflation data and strengthening labor markets, suggest inflation is likely to continue moving toward target and downside risks have diminished.	13	1
201407	2956	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	With the economy approaching full employment within the next year and inflation nearing the Committee’s target, both factors raise issues for the current stance of monetary policy, which I’ll comment on tomorrow.	13	1
201407	2957	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	13	1
201407	2958	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201407	2959	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	13	1
201407	2960	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	2961	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The news for the Ninth District has generally been good.	13	1
201407	2962	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Our business contacts generally expect moderate growth in the second half of the year, although we continue to hear reports of a sense of suppressed confidence about the medium and longer run.	13	1
201407	2963	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The unemployment rate in the District has fallen below 4½ percent.	13	1
201407	2964	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	However, outside North Dakota, there is evidence of continued underutilization of human resources in the District.	13	1
201407	2965	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	For example, in Minnesota, which has over half the population of the District, the latest measures of U-6 remain well above what they were seven or eight years ago.	13	1
201407	2966	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In earlier meetings I’ve reported on work that my staff has done documenting that the fraction of the labor force that is working part time for economic reasons helps explain the behavior of inflation across MSAs.	13	1
201407	2967	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Consistent with that analysis, wage pressures remain muted in much of the District, and this echoes President Rosengren’s observations from his own District.	13	1
201407	2968	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll turn next to the national economy.	13	1
201407	2969	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of quantities, my outlook for the national economy has changed a lot since the beginning of the year.	13	1
201407	2970	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My outlook for growth is considerably lower, around 1½ percent over 2014 as opposed to around 3 percent.	13	1
201407	2971	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And here I’ll pick up a point that Governor Fischer made.	13	1
201407	2972	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	A lot of participants around the table and members of the staff have commented that we’re downweighting the observations from the first quarter in terms of GDP, but in fact, that lower realization of GDP is being carried forward all the way through, so that, at least for myself, my estimate for GDP at the end of 2014 is now 1½ percent lower than it was at the beginning of 2014.	13	1
201407	2973	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s largely being driven by what happened in the first quarter, and I don’t have any reversal of that in the last three quarters of the year.	13	1
201407	2974	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, on the other hand, if you go to the labor markets, my outlook for unemployment is considerably lower than it was at the beginning of the year and now is down to around 5.8 percent by the fourth quarter of 2014, slightly lower than President Lockhart’s.	13	1
201407	2975	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But certainly I’ve been surprised before by the rapid decline in unemployment.	13	1
201407	2976	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of prices, my outlook has changed little since the beginning of the year.	13	1
201407	2977	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I expect PCE inflation and core PCE inflation to be around 1.6 percent over the course of 2014.	13	1
201407	2978	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll spend a little more time on my inflation outlook because it is central to what I’m going to be saying tomorrow about policy.	13	1
201407	2979	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	To be clear, like the Tealbook, I do expect PCE inflation to rise back to 2 percent, which echoes what many of you have already said around the table, but that rate of return, as in the Tealbook, is only slow.	13	1
201407	2980	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It gets back to target by around 2018.	13	1
201407	2981	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Unlike the Tealbook, I don’t have inflation overshooting in the latter part of the decade, and in part this is because I would assign more of the weak real GDP number in the first quarter to higher slack as opposed to lower potential.	13	1
201407	2982	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, I would say—as is true of any forecast, and David Wilcox’s pictures illustrate this very clearly—there are uncertainties around any forecast, and so there is a risk that under the Tealbook’s assumed policy stance, inflation could run above 2 percent.	13	1
201407	2983	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What matters for policy is that I do see these uncertainties as broadly balanced around my modal outlook.	13	1
201407	2984	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So what this means is that under the Tealbook’s policy assumption, I see inflation as considerably more likely to be below 2 percent over the medium term than over 2 percent.	13	1
201407	2985	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You could see this in David Wilcox’s pictures from the forecast summary, that the likelihood of inflation being under 2 percent over the medium term is considerably higher than being over 2 percent.	13	1
201407	2986	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Such an inflation outlook does not seem to me to be consistent with the balanced approach that we articulated in the fifth paragraph of our long-run goals statement.	13	1
201407	2987	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thus, as you will hear in the next go-round, my inflation outlook leads me to believe that policy should be more accommodative than the Tealbook assumes.	13	1
201407	2988	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We’ve heard very passionate discussions of credibility of this organization.	13	1
201407	2989	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One aspect of credibility that matters a lot, I think, is the credibility of our inflation target and our ability to hit that, and that will be influencing what I say about policy tomorrow, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	2990	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	13	1
201407	2991	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201407	2992	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chair.	13	1
201407	2993	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	2994	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	My views about the economic outlook haven’t changed much since the previous meeting.	13	1
201407	2995	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Like everybody else, I strongly discount the first-quarter GDP decline and anticipate the underlying growth rate will be about 3 percent on a going-forward basis.	13	1
201407	2996	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It strikes me that if you exclude the GDP data and you exclude the payroll data, everything else is pretty close to what we were anticipating, and so it doesn’t feel like there’s really a big change in the going-forward outlook.	13	1
201407	2997	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the disparity between growth in the first half of the year and the degree of tightening in the labor market, obviously, I put more weight on the labor market developments, but I don’t want to completely rule out the possibility that payroll growth could slow again.	13	1
201407	2998	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	We’ve been disappointed a number of times over the past few years.	13	1
201407	2999	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	We’ve seen these little spurts in payroll employment, and then they’ve died out.	13	1
201407	3000	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, I do think the time has come when we have to acknowledge that the labor market has continued to tighten more rapidly than we anticipated.	13	1
201407	3001	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the way we acknowledge that in the monetary policy statement tomorrow seems about right for this meeting, and if we get two more strong employment reports between now and the next meeting, then I think we’d have to take another step to even further underscore that development.	13	1
201407	3002	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to inflation, I was never that worried about inflation being too low, and I’m not particularly concerned that inflation is moving somewhat more quickly back to 2 percent than we’ve anticipated.	13	1
201407	3003	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there isn’t much signal in the upturn, especially given the fact that the underlying compensation trends don’t seem to have changed much.	13	1
201407	3004	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Most indicators suggest that compensation is still increasing at only about a 2 percent annual rate.	13	1
201407	3005	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Assuming that productivity growth improves from the dismal first-half performance, I think we need to see a considerable rise in labor compensation from here to really get worried about inflation.	13	1
201407	3006	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I want to turn to housing.	13	1
201407	3007	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I thought the staff memo on housing was really good, and I thought it was very germane.	13	1
201407	3008	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Why has the housing recovery been so disappointing?	13	1
201407	3009	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	My own view is that the weakness is mainly on the demand side and doesn’t stem from the perceived core fundamentals of owning a home, but instead reflects the difficulty of obtaining financing.	13	1
201407	3010	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	In a recent New York Fed survey, we asked renters why they would not purchase a home if they were to move within the next three years, and the three most common reasons that they cited were 1) do not have enough money saved or too much debt, 2) do not make enough money, and 3) my credit is not good enough.	13	1
201407	3011	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	About two-thirds of the renters thought it would be either somewhat difficult or very difficult to obtain a mortgage.	13	1
201407	3012	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	In contrast, when asked about the attractiveness of buying a home—so, “Would you like to buy a home?”—60 percent said it was a somewhat good or very good investment, and half the respondents said that buying property in their Zip code today is a better investment idea now than it will be a year from now, compared with 7 percent who think it would be better to wait for a year before thinking about it.	13	1
201407	3013	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	In contrast, for owners, buying a new home and qualifying for a new mortgage doesn’t seem to be that difficult.	13	1
201407	3014	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Only about 10 percent of owners have FICO scores below 680, and most, but not all, have considerable equity in their current homes.	13	1
201407	3015	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to student loan debt, there is evidence that this is important.	13	1
201407	3016	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Prior to the financial crisis, for people who were aged 27 to 30, those with student debt were more likely to have debt secured by a home.	13	1
201407	3017	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If you had a student loan, you were more educated, so you were making more income, and you were more likely to be a homeowner.	13	1
201407	3018	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	In contrast, currently, those without student loan debt now have a greater likelihood of having home-secured debt.	13	1
201407	3019	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s a pretty significant shift.	13	1
201407	3020	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The fact that the proportion of younger adults with student loan debt is rising and the amount of this debt is also increasing suggests that student loan debt is an issue impeding the first-time homebuyer.	13	1
201407	3021	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	13	1
201407	3022	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks.	13	1
201407	3023	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I am going to suggest that we, after having a long day, call it quits at this point, go have some dinner, and resume tomorrow morning.	13	1
201407	3024	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll finish off the go- round tomorrow with the Board, I will do a little bit of summing up, and then we’ll start the policy go-round.	13	1
201407	3025	2014-07-30	meeting		[Meeting recessed]	13	1
201407	3026	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	July 30 Session .	13	1
201407	3027	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	13	1
201407	3028	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to turn first to David Wilcox for a discussion of the statistics from this morning.	13	1
201407	3029	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	3030	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	As I hope you can appreciate, we haven’t had an enormous amount of time to engage in a deep excavation of the GDP data that were released this morning, but what we know at this point is that there was a little more GDP growth than we’d been expecting over the first half of this year.	13	1
201407	3031	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	The first-half growth figure now averages about 1 percent at an annual rate rather than the ¼ percent that we’d been projecting in the Tealbook.	13	1
201407	3032	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Before there’s any sense of satisfaction or celebration about that, it still is, obviously, an anomalously low rate of growth of GDP, given all of the other indicators that we have.	13	1
201407	3033	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	So, what I’m going to tell you this morning is, the picture hasn’t changed much.	13	1
201407	3034	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	One percent is still a very weak GDP figure, given what else we know.	13	1
201407	3035	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	The upward revision to GDP growth of eight-tenths of 1 percentage point that you see reflected in the next- to-rightmost column does not reflect any reconsideration of medical care spending in the first quarter.	13	1
201407	3036	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Instead, it’s in inventory investment.	13	1
201407	3037	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see, in the next block down, real GDI growth was also revised up in the first quarter, quite substantially—by nearly 2 percentage points.	13	1
201407	3038	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Again, here there’s no resolution of any of the puzzle that we had been seeing before.	13	1
201407	3039	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	The upward revision was in real DPI.	13	1
201407	3040	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	The place where we’d been puzzled was in the plunge in corporate profits.	13	1
201407	3041	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	The figure that the BEA wrote down for second-quarter growth of real DPI was weaker than we had expected.	13	1
201407	3042	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	So, on net over the first half of the year, there’s not much positive news about personal income, either.	13	1
201407	3043	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Taking a quick look at the annual revisions, at first glance, they appear to be of little consequence for our outlook.	13	1
201407	3044	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	If you integrate across the italicized rows, you get something very close to zero.	13	1
201407	3045	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	So there’s not much change in the level of either GDP or GDI or in the relationship between the two.	13	1
201407	3046	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	They’re not going to help resolve any of the tensions that we had earlier detected between labor market and output data in recent years.	13	1
201407	3047	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	On net, I don’t expect this information to have any positive implication for our GDP growth outlook in the second half of this year.	13	1
201407	3048	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	In fact, it may be a small negative, as we’ll be entering the second quarter on these estimates with a larger stock of inventories.	13	1
201407	3049	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	On inflation, just very briefly, as you can see, the four italicized zeros are not typographical errors.	13	1
201407	3050	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We happened to get very close on those.	13	1
201407	3051	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	So there’s no news here to speak of on the inflation front that we’ve been able to unearth yet.	13	1
201407	3052	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Thank you.	13	1
201407	3053	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for David?	13	1
201407	3054	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13	1
201407	3055	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I just want to be clear—President Fisher and I were talking here.	13	1
201407	3056	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	The 2014:Q2 real GDP has a revision here of 0.4.	13	1
201407	3057	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	That’s because it was a benchmark.	13	1
201407	3058	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	No—sorry.	13	1
201407	3059	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	The 0.4 upward revision is relative to our Tealbook estimate.	13	1
201407	3060	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	This is the first estimate of 2014:Q2.	13	1
201407	3061	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	So these other changes are benchmark revisions, though?	13	1
201407	3062	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Well, I’m not sure what the technical meaning of “benchmark” is.	13	1
201407	3063	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	It’s an annual revision, and that’s why earlier quarters were susceptible to revision.	13	1
201407	3064	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	So some years, the annual revision shifts around the pattern on the chessboard quite a lot.	13	1
201407	3065	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Thus far, it doesn’t look as though that happened this time around.	13	1
201407	3066	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	13	1
201407	3067	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing no further questions, let’s go back to our economic go- round.	13	1
201407	3068	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Our next speaker is Governor Fischer.	13	1
201407	3069	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks very much, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	3070	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I would like to start by saying that, as I read the Tealbook, I thought I really understood a heck of a lot more on my second go-round than on my first go-round, but then I discovered that this is the simplified Tealbook [laughter], which apparently is produced every two meetings.	13	1
201407	3071	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	But I did ask the people who write it, and you know the old line “I didn’t have enough time to write it short.”	13	1
201407	3072	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	They said that, actually, it took less time to write.	13	1
201407	3073	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	And it sure is a lot clearer.	13	1
201407	3074	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	So could we, at some point, take a poll on whether people prefer this version, which I certainly did on this occasion?	13	1
201407	3075	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We could do that right now before anybody loses the thought [laughter].	13	1
201407	3076	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	If you’d actually like to do that, why don’t we just spend one second, if you don’t mind being interrupted?	13	1
201407	3077	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Could I make a quick comment?	13	1
201407	3078	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	This was the fifth time we’d done the so-called short form of DEDO.	13	1
201407	3079	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	All of the other sections in the Tealbook were in the same format as usual.	13	1
201407	3080	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	It’s the red-tabbed section in the beginning of the book that is condensed.	13	1
201407	3081	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	When I went to Chairman Bernanke a year ago and requested permission to try a short- form DEDO, I made several pledges to him.	13	1
201407	3082	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	First, I pledged that we would do it on an experimental basis, and, if it was judged a failure, we’d go back to the long form every time.	13	1
201407	3083	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Second, I pledged that we would invest the same amount of analytical effort every time regardless of whether the exposition was condensed or full length.	13	1
201407	3084	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	And, third, I pledged that, if circumstances warranted and something came up that seemed to call for a full reset in long-form, and perhaps more confusing, format, we’d stand prepared to do that.	13	1
201407	3085	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We couldn’t do that overnight, but we could do it on pretty short notice.	13	1
201407	3086	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	That was the premise under which this was taken.	13	1
201407	3087	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We find it, frankly, more conducive to investing in some of the special analytical material that I tried to highlight in some of my comments yesterday.	13	1
201407	3088	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	And I have wondered, indeed, whether it didn’t present the material in a manner that was easier for you to digest as well and therefore might be a value-improving proposition.	13	1
201407	3089	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Do you want to ask for a quick show of hands of how many people prefer this shortened version to the—or do you want to come back and—	13	1
201407	3090	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We could do that, or we could do both.	13	1
201407	3091	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	And if participants wanted to send me a comment or—what’s the proper procedure?—send the Secretariat—	13	1
201407	3092	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	That would be fine.	13	1
201407	3093	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Send the Secretariat—maybe, why don’t we do that?	13	1
201407	3094	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	13	1
201407	3095	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	We can do that.	13	1
201407	3096	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Good suggestion.	13	1
201407	3097	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	And we’ll take nonvotes as—which way?	13	1
201407	3098	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Well, I’ll need to confer with the Chair, but I certainly would love to interpret silence as indicating approval of the short-form DEDO.	13	1
201407	3099	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Maybe we’ll send something around and ask everybody for a reaction one way or another.	13	1
201407	3100	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	That sounds good.	13	1
201407	3101	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Thank you.	13	1
201407	3102	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	13	1
201407	3103	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Well, thanks, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	3104	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	On the state of the economy, I thought it would be useful just to step back a little bit and think about where this Committee was a year ago and where we are now.	13	1
201407	3105	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I’ll be relying on the Tealbook forecast, which, I gather, isn’t going to change very much as a result of today’s data.	13	1
201407	3106	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Unemployment is lower than we expected at the last meeting and much lower than was expected a year ago.	13	1
201407	3107	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We expect to be at the natural rate by around a year from now and to be heading for 4¾ percent by the end of 2016, which is below most estimates of the natural rate, although there is a tendency for estimates of the natural rate to follow the actual rate.	13	1
201407	3108	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	So, by the time we get to 4¾, the 5.2 percent lower bound will have slipped down.	13	1
201407	3109	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I think that’s rational, by the way.	13	1
201407	3110	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We don’t know a heck of a lot about the natural rate.	13	1
201407	3111	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	If we’re somewhere and there’s no inflationary pressure—which is, by assumption, roughly where we’ll be—we might change our view on the natural rate, and that may be the right thing to do.	13	1
201407	3112	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Payroll employment is significantly above the level projected a year ago, so that’s positive.	13	1
201407	3113	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Going to growth, it’s still slower than was projected a year ago.	13	1
201407	3114	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We still have the puzzle of the first quarter, and, as we were told yesterday, we still have that puzzle because a major element in that was the reported reduction in medical spending in consumption, which nobody quite believes.	13	1
201407	3115	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We’re only going to get a better estimate of that in September.	13	1
201407	3116	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I’m not sure how to think about potential output.	13	1
201407	3117	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	In the Tealbook, the assumption was that potential output was cut in order to be consistent with unemployment via Okun’s law, which meant productivity was low.	13	1
201407	3118	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	And that meant we’re gradually becoming British, which, economically, didn’t used to be so good and may be becoming better these days, but we’ll see how long that lasts.	13	1
201407	3119	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We have positive factory output results.	13	1
201407	3120	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	So we still have that puzzle of the relationship between growth and the unemployment rate, and we have to put considerable faith in the unemployment data.	13	1
201407	3121	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Inflation was revised up a bit.	13	1
201407	3122	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	It’s 2.3 percent this quarter but is expected to be 1.8 percent in 2016.	13	1
201407	3123	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	So it’s going down and then coming up.	13	1
201407	3124	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	How sure can we be about that?	13	1
201407	3125	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Not very.	13	1
201407	3126	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	When you’re at 1.6, 1.7, or 1.8 percent, you’re very close to 2 percent.	13	1
201407	3127	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Just recalling changes in the prediction, we were very worried that we weren’t going to be at 2 percent in 2016.	13	1
201407	3128	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	It seems to me that 1.8 is pretty close to being at the natural rate.	13	1
201407	3129	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	How much faith should we take in all of that?	13	1
201407	3130	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Well, we’ve got an incredibly flat Phillips curve, and we must be getting close to the point at which the wage Phillips curve would be becoming steeper in terms of the relationship between unemployment and the rate of change of wages.	13	1
201407	3131	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	So we’ll put that with a question mark.	13	1
201407	3132	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	The policy that’s in the forecast assumes that the federal funds rate lifts off in the second quarter of 2015 and is followed by the use of the 1999 version of the Taylor rule, which takes us to a federal funds rate of 2.8 percent at the end of 2016 and 4 percent at the end of 2018.	13	1
201407	3133	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	And we’ve had an upward revision in the 10-year rate in this forecast.	13	1
201407	3134	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	So some of the things that got a lot of attention, like the decline in the equilibrium federal funds rate, have actually been modified in this forecast.	13	1
201407	3135	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Well, what do we make of all that?	13	1
201407	3136	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I think the critical point, as was mentioned by several people yesterday, was that, according to this forecast, we’re moving the point at which the natural rate is reached three quarters earlier, and that’s a lot.	13	1
201407	3137	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	It seems to mean that we’re going to lift off ourselves probably somewhat sooner.	13	1
201407	3138	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Then we face the question of, what do we do about that belief, which I share?	13	1
201407	3139	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Yesterday I had a discussion with a few people—they weren’t Governors, so it was legal—about, how much does it matter if the market faces surprises, and should we care if we surprise them?	13	1
201407	3140	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I think we should care, because we’ve said a lot about how long we’re going to wait until we raise the rate, and a lot of people have built strategies—I’m not sure they’ve built their futures, their future savings and all of that, on that particular result.	13	1
201407	3141	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	For the long run, it doesn’t much matter.	13	1
201407	3142	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	But it will lead to a view that the FOMC has got things wrong again and didn’t send the market a warning until it was much too late.	13	1
201407	3143	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	So I think we should be moving a little bit earlier in changing the message we’re sending.	13	1
201407	3144	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Now, we’re only going to discuss that in the next round, but I think it’s clear what that will say about what we should be doing.	13	1
201407	3145	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	But I’ll discuss that in more detail later, and I’m sure everyone else will.	13	1
201407	3146	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	There are other things that are a problem in the forecast.	13	1
201407	3147	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	First of all, the weakness in housing is puzzling.	13	1
201407	3148	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	But I would like to add one thing.	13	1
201407	3149	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We’re all very concerned about financial instability, and we should be.	13	1
201407	3150	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	But if you look at what has been a problem in financial instability globally, it’s almost always housing.	13	1
201407	3151	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	And we are so far from having overvalued housing that, on the main element of financial instability, admitting all of the things about the computer-related media company and so forth, we should think that, on the big issue, which is having another housing bust—we hope we won’t have another one, because if we do, it’s starting from such a low level that it’s going to be pretty terrible.	13	1
201407	3152	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	But the concerns about that financial instability story seem to me slightly exaggerated at present.	13	1
201407	3153	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We should never allow ourselves complacency.	13	1
201407	3154	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	The IMF, when it goes to a country and things are going well, always says, having nothing else to say, “Complacency must be avoided.”	13	1
201407	3155	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Well, we should avoid complacency on this one, but, as of now, it’s not a major issue.	13	1
201407	3156	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	There’s a paragraph in the Tealbook on reaching for yield, which I thought wasn’t incredibly persuasive, although Nellie persuaded me that, in certain regards, there is clearly reaching for yield, which is when there are companies that have promised yields that they can’t get except by taking far more risk than they normally do.	13	1
201407	3157	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We also have the investment issue.	13	1
201407	3158	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I remember something that I thought was probably right and clever but which a lot of people think is irrelevant—the weight of GDP, which came out of this institution.	13	1
201407	3159	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	The weight of GDP has gone down a lot because it’s not all steel production.	13	1
201407	3160	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	China’s weight of GDP has undoubtedly gone up a heck of a lot, but ours has almost certainly gone down.	13	1
201407	3161	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I think the same must be true about the weight of investment.	13	1
201407	3162	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	So much of it is intellectual, without a whole host of investment in steel machines stamping out auto body parts and so forth, that I wonder how correctly we’re measuring investment right now.	13	1
201407	3163	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	What’s the bottom line?	13	1
201407	3164	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We’re well ahead of where we expected to be at this stage.	13	1
201407	3165	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	The labor market is doing well.	13	1
201407	3166	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Inflation is very close to the inflation target, although we expect it to decline a bit in the coming years and then to go back up.	13	1
201407	3167	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	But—and this is a serious “but”—if we had had a bad data point this morning, this would have sounded very different.	13	1
201407	3168	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	So I think we’re only one or two bad data points away from concluding that this is still a fragile recovery.	13	1
201407	3169	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	The balance of the weight has moved in favor of its being less fragile, but we could be knocked off that very well.	13	1
201407	3170	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	And when we get around to announcing the first move as getting closer, we’ll not be able to go back.	13	1
201407	3171	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We’ll say it’s data-driven and all of that, but once we’ve got that in people’s heads, we’re not going to be able to retreat from that.	13	1
201407	3172	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	So we need to be perhaps a little surer than usual before we send a totally unambiguous signal.	13	1
201407	3173	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	3174	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201407	3175	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13	1
201407	3176	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	3177	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	I’m going to address labor market issues predominantly.	13	1
201407	3178	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	But, first, I’ll start by echoing something Governor Fischer said about some continued uncertainty about why that first quarter was as weak as it was and by expressing my own feeling that, until we feel more comfortable with an explanation for that or until we’re far enough away from it with enough good data points in between, it still remains a little bit of a nagging worry, at least to me.	13	1
201407	3179	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Second, as I think I’ve said at the past couple of meetings, I continue to regard external— that is to say, geopolitical—risks as the biggest downside risks to the economy.	13	1
201407	3180	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	But, as I’ve also said, I just don’t know that there’s much that we can do with that, other than to acknowledge they were there.	13	1
201407	3181	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Yesterday, when Steve was showing the charts—I can’t remember whether it was yesterday or at the Board meeting—of the relative reaction of international markets, particularly commodity markets, to various problems internationally over the past couple of quarters, one looked and said, “Well, markets are largely untroubled.”	13	1
201407	3182	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	And I was reminded of the fact that, in the two weeks following Franz Ferdinand’s assassination in 1914, markets were completely untroubled.	13	1
201407	3183	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	It was only after the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Serbia that things actually started to get very tense.	13	1
201407	3184	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Turning to labor market conditions, there’s obviously been improvement across a broad range of labor market indicators, beyond the headline unemployment and jobs numbers that have been improving for some time and into some of the areas that many of us have regarded as reflecting continued labor market slack.	13	1
201407	3185	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	The average duration of unemployment has been declining.	13	1
201407	3186	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Hours worked have been increasing.	13	1
201407	3187	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	There’s been a pickup in the return of the long- term unemployed to work—I’ll return to that in a moment.	13	1
201407	3188	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	And, though still elevated by historical standards, the numbers of part-time unemployed for economic reasons have been edging down.	13	1
201407	3189	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Although, as we’re continually reminded, we don’t want to put too much weight on a few monthly readings, which are themselves subject to revision, the labor force participation rate has firmed a bit, and the employment-to-population ratio has actually been increasing.	13	1
201407	3190	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Information reflected in surveys of business intentions to hire in the coming quarters, while not hard data, is still somewhat encouraging as well.	13	1
201407	3191	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	All of this, though, still leaves us with the questions of how much more slack remains and what all of this might mean for the future path of inflation.	13	1
201407	3192	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to the question of slack, in theory, obviously, this should be pretty straightforward.	13	1
201407	3193	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	We just look for evidence of general, as opposed to sectoral or regional, wage inflation, and we’ll know that there’s a decreasing amount of, and maybe very little, slack left in labor markets.	13	1
201407	3194	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	But, in practice, as we all know, that’s hard to do because compensation data don’t seem as reliable or as uniform as other labor market indicators.	13	1
201407	3195	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	There are different measures, which may not track one another too closely, particularly in the short-to-medium term.	13	1
201407	3196	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Having said that, I note that it still does not seem as though there’s any evidence of generalized wage increases, as several of you commented yesterday.	13	1
201407	3197	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers are up.	13	1
201407	3198	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Some have pointed to the household survey on earnings.	13	1
201407	3199	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	But if the issue is whether labor markets are tightening, pushing up costs that employers have to pay for workers, it seems as though we should be looking most at broader-based gauges of what those employers are reporting that they’re paying.	13	1
201407	3200	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	I think that’s why the ECI and the hourly compensation component of the Productivity and Costs survey are most relied on by the staff for purposes of evaluating trends in wages.	13	1
201407	3201	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	And, with respect to those two, neither, at least to date, shows signs of any pickup.	13	1
201407	3202	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	But it’s true that staff forecasts have been expecting that pickup for some time, and we do have more anecdotes and surveys suggesting a wider range of employers intending to raise wages as well as to do some more hiring.	13	1
201407	3203	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	So I think we’re still left with looking at some of these other indexes of labor market slack, the ones I referred to earlier.	13	1
201407	3204	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	As has been the case for a while, some of them can be interpreted either way, probably depending on one’s conceptual and policy priors.	13	1
201407	3205	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	The increase in job openings is the current example of that.	13	1
201407	3206	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	You can explain it either as a growing mismatch between skills and job availability or as the next step in a stronger labor market that will be followed by larger gross hiring numbers.	13	1
201407	3207	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	We just don’t know yet which of those will play out and reveal itself to be the correct explanation.	13	1
201407	3208	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	But there are the data streams that seem pretty good evidence of continued slack.	13	1
201407	3209	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	One such piece of evidence is the decline, I think, in the long-term unemployment rate in the first half of this year and, particularly, what that reveals about a movement of people into and out of the labor force and into work when one looks behind the numbers.	13	1
201407	3210	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Since February, the absolute number of the long-term unemployed has declined from 3.8 million to 3 million.	13	1
201407	3211	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	The share of the long-term unemployed in total unemployment is now down to under 33 percent from the high that was in the mid-40s immediately following the recession.	13	1
201407	3212	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	This is encouraging because, as I noted earlier, this has happened in the context of the labor force participation rate stabilizing and the EPOP moving up.	13	1
201407	3213	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	The transition rate from long-term unemployment to employment has been moving up in the past several months, but it’s also true that the transition rate from long-term unemployment to being out of the labor force has moved up in the past couple of months.	13	1
201407	3214	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	So that fact reminds us that, based on monthly transition rates out of long-term unemployment to either jobs or nonparticipation over the past several years, the number of the long-term unemployed should be much smaller than it actually is.	13	1
201407	3215	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Some research that was recently posted on the Board’s website by Tomaz Cajner and David Ratner of the Board’s staff suggests what the answer to that puzzle may be and, in the process of doing so, makes, again, some case for the continuation of a nontrivial amount of labor market slack.	13	1
201407	3216	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	They’ve hypothesized that some of the long-term unemployed may be moving from that status to nonparticipation—not actively looking for work—several times before they end up either employed or more or less permanently out of the workforce.	13	1
201407	3217	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	To develop that hypothesis, they also looked at annual, rather than monthly, data on longitudinally matched individuals and found that individuals who were classified as long-term unemployed a year ago have a 38 percent likelihood of being employed today.	13	1
201407	3218	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	That’s the highest level since 2008.	13	1
201407	3219	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	In fact, individuals classified as long-term unemployed a year ago are more likely to be employed today than they are to be out of the workforce.	13	1
201407	3220	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	So Tomaz and David suggested that a deeper dive into the data yielded a fairly encouraging picture consistent with the hypothesis that the long-term unemployed in this still-unprecedented postwar economic episode are, to a significant though not complete degree, relevant for thinking about labor market slack and thus for the impact of the long-term unemployed on wages in particular.	13	1
201407	3221	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	As to the question of what all of this means for inflation, I think, first, it suggests that we’ve got at least some distance to go before the labor market is truly tight, suggesting in turn the possibility that increases in wages may be more gradual than sudden as they do begin to occur.	13	1
201407	3222	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Second, it’s also worth remembering that levels of real wage and compensation increases over the past few years have been running below even the modestly recorded productivity gains that we have.	13	1
201407	3223	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	And, third and most important, the relationship between wage inflation and overall inflation is harder to pin down than we might think—I believe President Mester alluded to this yesterday—and that’s related to, as Governor Fischer mentioned, the flat Phillips curve over a fairly long period of time and the work that the Board’s staff did a couple of years ago suggesting that the pass-through of labor cost to core inflation has become progressively more attenuated in the quarter-century beginning in 1985.	13	1
201407	3224	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	It’s obviously possible that curves that have flattened, or relationships that have attenuated, over some period of time could revert to their previous state.	13	1
201407	3225	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	But it seems to me that we shouldn’t take as an article of faith that wage increases will translate fairly quickly into significant inflation increases.	13	1
201407	3226	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	It would be useful, at least to me, to understand why those holding this view think that enough has changed from that pattern of the past couple of decades to have the kind of phenomenon that I think people associate with big run-ups in inflation 30, 35, or 40 years ago.	13	1
201407	3227	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	If all of that is true, it leaves us in the somewhat uncomfortable position of perhaps not having an early indicator of where inflation may be going, as would be the case if wage inflation were a pretty good foreshadowing of what was going to happen with inflation overall.	13	1
201407	3228	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	But that’s just the situation in which we may find ourselves for the coming couple of quarters.	13	1
201407	3229	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	3230	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201407	3231	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13	1
201407	3232	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	3233	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I would agree that the reduction in the estimated output gap in the Tealbook baseline forecast is particularly important and, potentially, quite significant.	13	1
201407	3234	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	It seems to me, therefore, that this is an important time to update prior views and consider the implications for policy.	13	1
201407	3235	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I’ll start with inflation.	13	1
201407	3236	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Since I joined the Committee in May 2012, the risk has really been on the downside.	13	1
201407	3237	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Regarding inflation for 2013, four-quarter changes were right around 1.2 percent for core and 1 percent for headline.	13	1
201407	3238	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	As the Committee knows, in the first half of this year, headline PCE inflation has come up to about 1.8 percent, and core is about 1.6 percent.	13	1
201407	3239	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	And congratulations on your forecast.	13	1
201407	3240	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	In my view, the threat of inflation to remain persistently low has clearly diminished.	13	1
201407	3241	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	And there seems to be no threat of a breakout to the upside, given the apparent stability of long-run inflation expectations and the margins of slack that are likely to exist.	13	1
201407	3242	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Although the most recent readings for the second quarter are higher, a significant portion of movements in inflation from quarter to quarter, or even year to year, tends to be idiosyncratic and unrelated to fundamentals.	13	1
201407	3243	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Indeed, that’s one reason why the confidence intervals that David Wilcox addressed yesterday are as wide as they are.	13	1
201407	3244	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Also, looking at history and bearing in mind that the Committee does not do price-level targeting, it’s worth noting that the PCE price index level is about 3 percent lower than it would have been if inflation had been 2 percent since the end of 2007, and it’s 1½ percent lower than it would have been if inflation had run at 2 percent since the end of the recession in 2009.	13	1
201407	3245	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	So my bottom line, really, is that the evolution of inflation readings has been about what the Committee should want, and it doesn’t seem to me that inflation is currently sending a signal that policy is either too loose or too tight.	13	1
201407	3246	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	It actually seems to be about right.	13	1
201407	3247	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	With regard to labor markets, my view has been that significant slack remains.	13	1
201407	3248	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Payroll and employment data and other data for the first half of this year are sending a strong signal about improving health in the labor market.	13	1
201407	3249	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	The level of slack in the labor market, in my view, has diminished by a substantial degree more than predicted by most forecasts, including even very recent forecasts.	13	1
201407	3250	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Still, the difference between headline unemployment and the estimated natural rate is something like ½ percent to 1 percentage point, according to the central tendency of the last SEP in June.	13	1
201407	3251	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Of course, the natural rate of unemployment is famously uncertain and subject to material revision, even years after the fact.	13	1
201407	3252	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	But there are other dimensions in which the labor market can adjust to a further strengthening in the economy.	13	1
201407	3253	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	In particular, the better-supported view, to me, is that the level of those working part time for economic reasons is materially higher than it should be, given the level of headline unemployment.	13	1
201407	3254	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	And even if most of the decline in the labor force participation rate is driven by demographics, there’s still almost certainly a cyclical component in that large decline since 2007.	13	1
201407	3255	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	So there are many outside the labor force who may come back in better conditions.	13	1
201407	3256	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Also, productivity has been low, and a tighter economy could produce higher productivity growth.	13	1
201407	3257	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Real wage growth has been well below what it should be, and a tighter economy could remedy that and pull even more back into the labor force.	13	1
201407	3258	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	My updated view is that, while slack is clearly diminishing, the labor market is not fully healed and significant slack remains.	13	1
201407	3259	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Now, if the July and August labor market readings validate or amplify this sense of the initial report for June, then I am prepared to revisit the pace of that healing and the desirable pace of removing monetary accommodation.	13	1
201407	3260	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I have one final point on the baseline forecast.	13	1
201407	3261	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I am not at all comfortable with the path described in the outyears, whereby the inertial Taylor (1999) rule is mechanically applied to drive output well above potential for several years in order to get inflation to go from 1¾ percent to 2 percent.	13	1
201407	3262	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I wouldn’t do that, for two reasons:  first, the concern about leaning too hard on inflation expectations and, second, the concern about courting extreme financial market conditions with three or four more years of policy that is more accommodative than almost all of the standard policy rules.	13	1
201407	3263	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	As for implications for the current policy, there are none at this meeting, but I have to think about that.	13	1
201407	3264	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	These are more implications for the outyears than they are for today.	13	1
201407	3265	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Finally, in an effort to keep it interesting, I looked into a noteworthy development in the financial markets, which is that merger-and-acquisition activity has suddenly and significantly increased this year in the United States, Western Europe, and, to a lesser degree, Asia.	13	1
201407	3266	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	There are lots of different estimates, but a representative one suggests that, by dollar volume, announced M&A activity is up 70 percent this year in the Americas and 53 percent globally.	13	1
201407	3267	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	The level of announced deals is on track to perhaps break the all-time record and beat the levels of 2006 and 2007.	13	1
201407	3268	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	M&A is often said to be a leading indicator of the “animal spirits” of business leaders, and I looked into it with a view to whether there are any implications for financial stability and the economy.	13	1
201407	3269	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	First, the character of the activity is very different from that in the pre-crisis era.	13	1
201407	3270	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	These are not the highly leveraged private equity transactions that were common in those years.	13	1
201407	3271	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Rather, these are transactions between large corporations heavily in telecom, media, technology, and health care.	13	1
201407	3272	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Some of these are the so-called tax-inversion mergers, which may have fiscal implications, but they wouldn’t be of a scope or level that would have macroeconomic implications, at least in the near term.	13	1
201407	3273	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Practitioners say that there’s a big wave of transactions coming in other industries as well.	13	1
201407	3274	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	The prices that are being paid by strategic acquirers are substantially higher than private equity can pay or should pay, and that is the natural order of things.	13	1
201407	3275	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	And the fact that, before the crisis, private equity was winning auctions against corporates was a real sign of the pre-crisis leveraged-finance bubble.	13	1
201407	3276	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	But the memories of private-equity firms and debt investors of the big, bad deals of those years have apparently not faded yet.	13	1
201407	3277	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Practitioners also say that it is the extremely low cost of financing for investment-grade corporates, using either debt or highly valued stock, that generates unusually attractive returns for buyers, even at very high valuation levels.	13	1
201407	3278	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	One long-time basic stylized fact about M&A is that the buyer’s stock always declines on the announcement.	13	1
201407	3279	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	But in the first half of this year, in almost three-fourths of the cases, the buyer’s stock has gone up on the announcement.	13	1
201407	3280	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	This is unheard of, in my experience, and along the lines of seeing a snow leopard on Park Avenue in July.	13	1
201407	3281	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	[Laughter]	13	1
201407	3282	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	The market is looking at these transactions as strategically well founded and adding value for shareholders, despite the high prices being paid.	13	1
201407	3283	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	The interesting question, of course, is, what are the financial-stability and economic implications?	13	1
201407	3284	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	In my view, there really are no implications for financial stability.	13	1
201407	3285	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	The investment-grade corporate sector is long on cash and low on leverage, so this is just very different from the pre-crisis years.	13	1
201407	3286	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	The economic implications of this merger wave seem to me to be mixed.	13	1
201407	3287	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	The corporate model since the crisis has been to cut costs—margins are now and have been at all-time historic levels—and use the free cash flow to pay dividends and buy back stock, not to invest in facilities or hire employees.	13	1
201407	3288	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	So this sudden desire to merge is a new feature of the model.	13	1
201407	3289	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I guess the positive slant would be to say that companies are willing to take risks again—the return of corporate animal spirits—and that could be a good thing.	13	1
201407	3290	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	It could lead to more hiring and more investment.	13	1
201407	3291	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	But in the near term, these transactions are not about investment, and they’re not about hiring.	13	1
201407	3292	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	They’re really about using the very low cost of capital to buy existing assets and about getting cost savings by reducing jobs, not about investment or hiring.	13	1
201407	3293	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	So I would say there’s a mixed picture on that.	13	1
201407	3294	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201407	3295	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13	1
201407	3296	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13	1
201407	3297	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	13	1
201407	3298	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	After this very puzzling and seemingly anomalous first quarter, we are seeing data that provide a more consistent pattern pointing toward an acceleration of the pace at which slack is being eliminated.	13	1
201407	3299	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	Many labor market indicators, as many around the table have indicated, are finally improving at a faster pace than had been anticipated, and I’m particularly heartened by the increase in job openings, the reduction in long-term unemployment, and the more robust rate of quits.	13	1
201407	3300	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	But I’m still troubled by the very low participation rate and very high level of workers working part time who would like a full-time job.	13	1
201407	3301	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	While the wage data remain very soft, a few business surveys provide some hope that wages might start to accelerate, which would be very important for a healthier consumer.	13	1
201407	3302	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	The flip side of that story is continued disappointment on GDP and GDI growth, and the large contraction in first-quarter GDP does not easily square, as has been pointed out, with other economic indicators.	13	1
201407	3303	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	The stark anomaly suggests that either potential is much weaker than we have hoped or the labor market data are substantially overstating the take-up in slack.	13	1
201407	3304	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	This distinction matters critically for monetary policy.	13	1
201407	3305	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	We’ll have data later this week and next month that should help us distinguish between those possible explanations, but we won’t have much more insight into the plunge in first-quarter GDP until revisions to the QSS following the September FOMC meeting.	13	1
201407	3306	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	The staff’s decision to take more signal from the labor market data and revise down potential GDP seems sensible, although it’s important to remember that this was a judgment call, and that decision is very consequential for monetary policy.	13	1
201407	3307	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	On the other side of the mandate, we see signs of healthier inflation approaching the 2 percent target.	13	1
201407	3308	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent data provide comfort that we will get to that target, and the prospect of long-lasting underperformance on inflation is somewhat less likely.	13	1
201407	3309	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	By the same token, it’s very hard to see any signs of acceleration that would be alarming on the other side of the target.	13	1
201407	3310	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	The considerably brighter picture on credit provision from the SLOOS also provides some reason to expect improvement in activity.	13	1
201407	3311	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	However, the indicators on residential investment are weighing on the outlook, and the disappointment here looks to be at least somewhat structural in nature rather than predominantly driven by interest rates.	13	1
201407	3312	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	And, again, I would highlight the staff memo as being particularly helpful in disentangling those two sets of drivers.	13	1
201407	3313	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	On business investment, we see it continuing to bump along—I think that’s the technical term—at a pace that probably can be explained by a cautious consumer and disappointment on income growth.	13	1
201407	3314	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	But it is, nonetheless, failing to provide the kind of engine for the recovery that one would hope.	13	1
201407	3315	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	With regard to financial-stability risks, I think the presentations yesterday suggest a landscape in which there are some warning signals in a number of markets, but these remain reasonably well contained, certainly not at a level or breadth that should materially affect our monetary policy discussion.	13	1
201407	3316	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	Taking all of these developments together gives us some reason to hope that the labor market is improving at an accelerating pace in a context closer to the targeted level of inflation.	13	1
201407	3317	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	But against this cautious optimism remain an array of possible risks, including the geopolitical risks that Governor Tarullo alluded to, that could once again derail progress, as well as this puzzling underperformance on the income front.	13	1
201407	3318	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	In light of the considerable uncertainty around this set of factors and the reality that this recovery has experienced many false dawns—and because once we commit to an alteration in the course of policy, it will be very difficult to moderate or to reverse it—I think it is wise to see some more evidence going in the same direction before making a commitment, a theme that, of course, we’ll return to in the monetary policy discussion.	13	1
201407	3319	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	But if labor market data continue to move in the same direction, I would expect the alteration in course to come sooner than, certainly, the market expects and than we had previously discussed.	13	1
201407	3320	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much, and thanks to everyone for a very interesting set of observations on the economic outlook.	13	1
201407	3321	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I’ll try once again to summarize some main themes in your comments that relate to the key questions that underpin our policy decisions.	13	1
201407	3322	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	With our wind-down of asset purchases now all but baked in the cake, our key decisions as we go forward pertain to the timing of liftoff and the pace at which the federal funds target range will rise thereafter.	13	1
201407	3323	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Our forward guidance specifies that these decisions should be data dependent, based, in particular, on realized progress, and the expected pace of future progress, toward the attainment of our maximum-employment and 2 percent inflation objectives.	13	1
201407	3324	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	So I’ll focus on the following questions:  To what extent have we made progress in closing the employment and inflation gaps?	13	1
201407	3325	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	And have our expectations about the likely pace of ongoing progress in closing the remaining gaps changed during the intermeeting period?	13	1
201407	3326	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Starting with the labor market, I heard general agreement around the table that the labor market is improving by virtually any metric one could look at.	13	1
201407	3327	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, I think it’s uncontroversial to say that slack has been diminishing more rapidly than we had expected.	13	1
201407	3328	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	In particular, payroll gains in June came in well above expectations, with the three-month averages of both total and private payroll gains now standing north of 250,000 per month, and U-3 continued its recent decline and, at 6.1 percent, now stands close to where most of us in June projected it would be at year-end.	13	1
201407	3329	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	The labor force participation rate, as you noted, seemed to have leveled off, on balance, since last fall rather than continuing to decline, and that suggests some progress in reducing the cyclical shortfall in participation.	13	1
201407	3330	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Long-term unemployment and the mean duration of unemployment, as you noted, have also declined quite sharply, and research that Governor Tarullo discussed by two of our labor economists suggests that this decline in long-term unemployment, on balance, reflects movement into employment rather than the long- term unemployed just dropping out of the labor force.	13	1
201407	3331	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	You mentioned a number of other labor market indicators that also suggest improvement.	13	1
201407	3332	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	For example, job openings have risen sharply.	13	1
201407	3333	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	The rates of hiring and quits are gradually moving up, although they’re still below normal levels.	13	1
201407	3334	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	The prevalence of hard-to-fill jobs is rising, and household surveys suggest some improvement in confidence in the labor market.	13	1
201407	3335	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Although we’ve come closer to our goal of maximum employment by almost any measure, there remains the question of how far we still have to go.	13	1
201407	3336	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	To return to my cross- country road trip analogy that some of you may remember from past meetings, the question is whether, on our journey to Manhattan, we’re now in Cleveland or the outskirts of Weehawken.	13	1
201407	3337	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	13	1
201407	3338	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Basing that assessment on U-3 alone, the unemployment rate, at 6.1 percent, still remains significantly above our central tendency estimates of the longer-run normal level.	13	1
201407	3339	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	But confidence intervals around estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, as many of you noted, are very wide, and, conceivably, the unemployment gap may already have closed.	13	1
201407	3340	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	We continue to debate whether U-3 is a sufficient statistic for labor market slack.	13	1
201407	3341	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you commented that the decline we’ve seen in U-3 overstates the decline in overall labor market slack, reflecting an unusually large fraction of the workforce that’s involuntarily unemployed and an unusually depressed labor force participation rate.	13	1
201407	3342	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	In other words, shadow unemployment may be disproportionately high relative to U-3, but several of you also expressed skepticism about this argument.	13	1
201407	3343	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I did hear some anecdotes of strong wage increases, but they mainly seemed to remain confined to a few occupations, regions, and sectors.	13	1
201407	3344	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	In general, I think most of you see wage increases as remaining subdued and certainly below the benchmark of inflation plus productivity growth that would keep the labor share of income stable.	13	1
201407	3345	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	However, President Williams described research suggesting that the decline in the share of labor income is likely at least partly structural rather than cyclical.	13	1
201407	3346	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	So we should probably not expect it to move back toward historical norms.	13	1
201407	3347	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	On the issue of the likely pace of future labor market gains, the Tealbook has edged up its projection of the pace of payroll employment growth, suggesting that the progress toward our goal may be quickening.	13	1
201407	3348	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, it’s been surprising to see job creation running at such a fast pace in the face of such slow growth in output, but most of you seem to agree with the Tealbook’s assessment that the sharp decline in GDP in the first quarter was not reflective of the underlying strength of the expansion, even during the first quarter.	13	1
201407	3349	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	It appears to contain a large noise component, and today’s second-quarter GDP report and a range of indicators on spending, production, and business confidence, as well as the labor market data, support the expectation of stronger growth in the second half.	13	1
201407	3350	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	However, a number of you cautioned that we should be careful about projecting a strong pickup in growth.	13	1
201407	3351	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	A pickup in growth to 3 percent or more does remain a forecast rather than a reality at this point, and many of you noted that we still have a fragile recovery.	13	1
201407	3352	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Some of you pointed to the continued sluggishness of housing, pointing out that this is a sector that may not be poised to have a quick revival.	13	1
201407	3353	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Turning to inflation, most of you noted that, as expected, inflation has moved higher but is still running below our 2 percent objective.	13	1
201407	3354	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to inflation risks, some of you are concerned that the closing of resource gaps at a faster-than-expected pace with a still highly accommodative monetary policy poses upside risks to our forecasts that we will see wage and price increases strengthen.	13	1
201407	3355	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	However, I didn’t hear many anecdotal reports of strong price pressures at this point, and, as a number of you commented, the relationship between wages and prices has not been very tight in recent years.	13	1
201407	3356	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to downside risks to inflation, I think most of you would agree that the stronger tone of recent labor market and production data has reduced the downside risks you attach to the inflation outlook.	13	1
201407	3357	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I would note, too, that the Tealbook’s estimate of the probability that PCE inflation will fall below 1 percent has declined quite sharply in recent months.	13	1
201407	3358	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there for a second.	13	1
201407	3359	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Would anybody like to comment on the summary?	13	1
201407	3360	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	13	1
201407	3361	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	If not, maybe I could add a couple of brief comments of my own.	13	1
201407	3362	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I agree with the sentiment expressed by many of you around the table that the most recent employment report and some other data on real activity have been encouraging.	13	1
201407	3363	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	On balance, labor market conditions do seem to be improving somewhat more rapidly than I had expected, and, if faster-than-expected progress continues, I think this does point to an earlier liftoff.	13	1
201407	3364	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Especially in light of the gap between the market’s and the Committee’s views concerning the likely funds rate path—and that’s a divergence that certainly concerns me—I consider it important that we convey to the public our assessment of labor market developments as well as the data-dependence policy.	13	1
201407	3365	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I did try to take a step in that direction in my recent Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, and I think that the FOMC statement we’ll be discussing also takes a step in the same direction.	13	1
201407	3366	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	It will not surprise you to learn, however, that, in my view, the preponderance of evidence still points to significant underutilization of labor resources.	13	1
201407	3367	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Like a number of you, I see the decline in U-3 as overstating the overall improvement in labor market conditions.	13	1
201407	3368	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	The Tealbook box, to my mind, nicely illustrates the point that U-3 has declined more than other, broader measures of labor market conditions.	13	1
201407	3369	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I recently noted a similar exercise undertaken by economists at Goldman Sachs.	13	1
201407	3370	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	In their exercise, there’s an attempt to estimate the degree of labor market slack from a broader set of labor market indicators and then, similarly, there’s a comparison to readings based on U-3 alone.	13	1
201407	3371	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Their dashboard estimate of slack shows a much weaker labor market than U-3.	13	1
201407	3372	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Scaled to U-3, they estimate overall labor market slack at 1.9 percent, versus the roughly 75 basis point gap that we now have between a 6.1 percent U-3 and our central tendency estimate of the natural rate.	13	1
201407	3373	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Now, President Williams mentioned work at the San Francisco Fed pertaining to labor’s share of GDP.	13	1
201407	3374	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I hope you won’t mind my mentioning another piece of San Francisco Fed research that I found interesting.	13	1
201407	3375	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	It pertains to the salaries of recent college graduates.	13	1
201407	3376	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	In particular, it examines median weekly earnings of recent college graduates compared with those of all full-time workers.	13	1
201407	3377	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Going back to the early 1990s, there is a clear pattern of recent college graduates’ earnings lagging those of all full-time workers in the aftermath of recessions.	13	1
201407	3378	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Strikingly, this same pattern has now persisted for six straight years, suggesting yet another dimension of the labor market that suggests the recovery remains far from complete.	13	1
201407	3379	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Turning to price inflation, taking in all of the recent data, Tealbook projects both total and core PCE inflation to run only slightly above 1½ percent for 2014 as a whole.	13	1
201407	3380	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	These data and projections accord closely with those in the June SEP.	13	1
201407	3381	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	So I see inflation as largely on track with our recent projections.	13	1
201407	3382	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	But with real activity resuming its expansion and slack being taken up at a somewhat faster pace, I do think it’s appropriate to acknowledge that the downside risks to the outlook of a gradual return of inflation to 2 percent have diminished somewhat.	13	1
201407	3383	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	To summarize, I think the data flow since our last meeting has been encouraging, and we’re making good progress in achieving our goals.	13	1
201407	3384	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I again want to emphasize the importance of signaling to the public that we’re taking note of the overall positive tone of the data.	13	1
201407	3385	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	If we continue to be surprised by the strength of the labor market and production data and, of course, if inflation moves up by more than we anticipate, then we will need to discuss whether those changes in the outlook are substantial enough to warrant a change in our forward guidance, although at this point, I view such a change as premature.	13	1
201407	3386	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there and call on Bill to start us off on the policy round.	21	2
201407	3387	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21	2
201407	3388	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I’ll be referring to the exhibits labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives” that were distributed earlier.	21	2
201407	3389	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	As shown in the top panels of your first exhibit, nearly all of the policy rule simulations in the Tealbook (the colored lines to the left), as well as the optimal control policy rate path (the red line to the right), prescribe liftoff in the current quarter—considerably earlier than in the staff baseline projections (the black solid lines).	21	2
201407	3390	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	However, as outlined in the Tealbook and noted in the middle-left panel, there are a number of reasons why you may not want to follow these prescriptions.	21	2
201407	3391	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	First, with regard to the rules, you may anticipate that headwinds from the financial crisis and subsequent recession will persist, with the neutral real federal funds rate returning only slowly to its longer-run normal level, calling for a highly accommodative path for policy in order to achieve and maintain the Committee’s objectives in the medium term.	21	2
201407	3392	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Second, you may not be confident in the outlook yet, and, in particular, you may be concerned that the risks to the outlook are asymmetric, as a consequence of the effective lower bound on interest rates.	21	2
201407	3393	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	As a result, you may see the current policy trajectory as best balancing the risks to achieving your objectives.	21	2
201407	3394	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Third, while the unemployment rate has declined unexpectedly rapidly over the past year or so, you may judge that the full range of labor market indicators suggests significantly less progress on the employment leg of your mandate and still-substantial slack in labor markets.	21	2
201407	3395	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	For example, the share of employed persons working part time, shown in the middle-right panel, is still quite elevated, labor force participation is low, and labor compensation is still rising only modestly.	21	2
201407	3396	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Finally, like the staff, you may see the Phillips curve as relatively flat and inflation expectations as well anchored and so anticipate that inflation will likely run below 2 percent for some time.	21	2
201407	3397	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Consequently, you may think that some overshoot of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment may be appropriate to speed the return of inflation to your objective.	21	2
201407	3398	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	As shown in the bottom two panels, the staff’s baseline path for the federal funds rate results in lower unemployment than the optimal control policy rate path, the left panel, but that serves only to move inflation back to 2 percent somewhat more rapidly with minimal overshooting, as shown to the right.	21	2
201407	3399	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	You may well prefer these economic outcomes, particularly if you think that the low unemployment rate could help undo some of the labor market damage caused by the recent recession.	21	2
201407	3400	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Turning to the alternatives for this meeting, you may view the information received during the intermeeting period as largely in line with your expectations for a rebound in economic growth in the second quarter and for inflation to remain below 2 percent.	21	2
201407	3401	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Thus, you may prefer the language in alternative B, on page 6, which continues on the policy rate path laid out in past Committee communications.	21	2
201407	3402	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The first paragraph of alternative B updates the Committee’s summary of recent economic developments, noting that economic activity “rebounded in the second quarter” and that labor market conditions “improved, with the unemployment rate declining further.”	21	2
201407	3403	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The statement replaces the reference to an elevated unemployment rate with a statement that “a range of labor market indicators suggests that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources.”	21	2
201407	3404	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	You might see this language as a clearer statement of your reading of labor market conditions as well as consistent with your recent forward guidance that the Committee takes into account “a wide range of information” in assessing progress toward its mandated objectives.	21	2
201407	3405	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The statement also acknowledges that inflation has moved “somewhat closer to the Committee’s longer-run objective.”	21	2
201407	3406	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The second paragraph expresses less concern about persistently low inflation than the June statement, indicating that labor market indicators and inflation are expected to move toward levels consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate, and that “the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat.”	21	2
201407	3407	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Another measured reduction in the pace of asset purchases is noted in paragraph 3.	21	2
201407	3408	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Market participants appear to anticipate the policy decisions incorporated in alternative B.	21	2
201407	3409	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	However, while some respondents to the dealer survey expected the Committee to recognize the improvement in labor market conditions and the recent pickup in inflation in the statement, they generally anticipated more modest changes to the description of economic developments and the outlook.	21	2
201407	3410	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Thus, while the response in financial markets to this statement is likely to be small, there’s more uncertainty than usual about that response.	21	2
201407	3411	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Alternative C, on page 8, may appeal to those of you who see the economy on a stronger trajectory than expected in June and think inflation may continue to move up fairly quickly.	21	2
201407	3412	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Moreover, some of you may be concerned that continuing asset purchases into the fall and keeping the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound well into next year could pose risks to financial stability.	21	2
201407	3413	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	These views may lead you to want to taper asset purchases more rapidly and adjust the forward guidance to suggest that liftoff is likely to occur earlier than financial markets now expect.	21	2
201407	3414	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The first and second paragraphs of alternative C are similar to those in alternative B but point to somewhat less slack in labor markets and a greater reduction in the risk of persistently below-target inflation.	21	2
201407	3415	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The third paragraph announces a larger reduction in the pace of asset purchases, and the fourth indicates that purchases may be wound down at the September meeting.	21	2
201407	3416	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The fifth paragraph replaces the “considerable time” wording introduced in March with the statement that the current target range for the federal funds rate will likely remain in place for “some time” after the asset purchase program ends—thereby signaling that liftoff may occur sooner than had been anticipated.	21	2
201407	3417	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	A statement along the lines of alternative C would surprise investors, would likely cause them to pull forward the expected timing of the first rate hike, and might lead them to anticipate a steeper subsequent path of the funds rate.	21	2
201407	3418	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Longer-term interest rates probably would rise, equity prices fall, and the dollar appreciate.	21	2
201407	3419	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The shift in policy expectations would likely be accompanied by a rise in measures of interest rate volatility, as the timing and pace of normalization would loom larger as considerations for investors.	21	2
201407	3420	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Finally, alternative A, on page 4, may appeal to policymakers who remain concerned that the significant drop in first-quarter GDP was not fully attributable to transitory factors and measurement error, especially given the coincident drop in first- quarter gross domestic income, and who are worried that inflation, after a temporary bump, could run below 2 percent for some time without additional monetary accommodation.	21	2
201407	3421	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Such policymakers may want to continue asset purchases at their current pace for now and await additional information clarifying the trajectory of the economy.	21	2
201407	3422	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	They may also want to strengthen the forward guidance in order to limit the risk of persistently low inflation.	21	2
201407	3423	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The first and second paragraphs of alternative A give a more guarded assessment of the recent economic news and the outlook for inflation than their counterparts in alternatives B and C.	21	2
201407	3424	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The third paragraph refers to unexpected weakness in the first half of the year as increasing uncertainty about the economic outlook and maintains the current pace of purchases.	21	2
201407	3425	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The fifth paragraph strengthens the forward guidance for the federal funds rate by adding an inflation floor.	21	2
201407	3426	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	An announcement along the lines of alternative A would come as a considerable surprise to market participants, likely leading them to mark up their expectations for total asset purchases and push back their anticipated timing of liftoff.	21	2
201407	3427	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Interest rates would fall, and the dollar could depreciate.	21	2
201407	3428	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Equity prices could rise or fall, depending on the size of the negative signal that investors took from the statement about the economic outlook.	21	2
201407	3429	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Draft directives for these alternatives are presented on pages 11 through 13 of your handout.	21	2
201407	3430	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21	2
201407	3431	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	That completes my prepared remarks.	21	2
201407	3432	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	21	2
201407	3433	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Bill?	22	2
201407	3434	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	22	2
201407	3435	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201407	3436	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I’m looking at “Optimal Control:  PCE Inflation,” which is in the exhibit on policy issues.	22	2
201407	3437	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	This seems like an unusual path for inflation that would come out of a simulation of this nature.	22	2
201407	3438	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	You’ve got it rising in 2015 and falling, and then you’ve got it rising gradually in 2016, with another fall and then another rise.	22	2
201407	3439	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	What’s going on here?	22	2
201407	3440	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think that this is consistent with the staff view that there’s some temporary factors pushing inflation higher in the near term that will unwind.	22	2
201407	3441	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	As for the wiggle in the end of 2016 and into 2017, I don’t know exactly why that isn’t smoother, but the computer is doing the best it can to minimize the loss function and that’s where it came out [laughter].	22	2
201407	3442	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	So, presumably, there are things going on.	22	2
201407	3443	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Well, I don’t see similar movements in the panel to the left on unemployment.	22	2
201407	3444	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	So why would inflation be moving around?	22	2
201407	3445	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I would expect a smoother path if we’re going to do an exercise like this.	22	2
201407	3446	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Well, but if you have a very flat Phillips curve and you have shocks that are moving around inflation, I’m not sure that you necessarily want to move the policy rate around and the unemployment rate around in order to smooth out what’s a pretty small bump in inflation.	22	2
201407	3447	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Remember that the loss function imposes a loss related to the change in the funds rate.	22	2
201407	3448	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	It’s trying to give you a smooth funds rate, and I think the result may be not an entirely smooth path for inflation.	22	2
201407	3449	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	22	2
201407	3450	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	As I understand the simulation, then—because we also have the upper-right panel up here—it’s going to put a premium on a smooth funds rate and a premium on a smooth unemployment rate, and residual variation has to occur in inflation.	22	2
201407	3451	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	No, I don’t think so.	22	2
201407	3452	2014-07-30	meeting	ENGLISH	It puts a premium on a smooth funds rate, and it aims to minimize deviations of unemployment from the natural rate of unemployment and to minimize deviations of inflation from 2 percent.	22	2
201407	3453	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	22	2
201407	3454	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes—thank you.	22	2
201407	3455	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m going to ask a question that I think might be hard to answer, but I’m going to try to ask it anyway.	22	2
201407	3456	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s certainly going to be hard to ask.	22	2
201407	3457	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I don’t know how hard it is to answer.	22	2
201407	3458	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Tealbook baseline and the optimal control pictures under “Policy Issues” both have the same feature of having unemployment run for some time below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate.	22	2
201407	3459	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And, as I understand the Tealbook outlook, in both Book A and Book B, this is essential in actually getting inflation back up to 2 percent—that you have to have this feature in order to get back to 2 percent.	22	2
201407	3460	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	At the same time, we’ve heard a level of discomfort from President Fisher and, to a certain extent, from Vice Chairman Dudley and Governor Powell with this feature of the outlook.	22	2
201407	3461	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I would be interested in the staff following up on these concerns from Committee participants.	22	2
201407	3462	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Suppose you forced the Committee to follow something that did not have unemployment going below the natural rate for any period of time or a much shorter period of time.	22	2
201407	3463	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What would happen then in terms of inflation?	22	2
201407	3464	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Where would we end up in terms of inflation?	22	2
201407	3465	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Inflation on our baseline analysis would settle in at about 1.75 percent.	22	2
201407	3466	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes—okay.	22	2
201407	3467	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I understood the staff’s work correctly—that this undershooting of the natural rate is an essential part of our getting back to 2 percent.	22	2
201407	3468	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	That’s right.	22	2
201407	3469	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Last meeting, we sent the Committee a memo by Deb Lindner that presented estimates of where inflation would settle out if resource utilization gaps were closed quickly and longer-term inflation expectations remained at their current levels.	22	2
201407	3470	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	There was a two-pronged message in that memo.	22	2
201407	3471	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	One is that we think that estimate is centered a little below 2 percent.	22	2
201407	3472	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	There were a range of model-based estimates that we presented.	22	2
201407	3473	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	The number we chose for purposes of putting together the staff forecast, quite frankly, was probably a little at the higher end of the model-based estimates.	22	2
201407	3474	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We had a fistful of model-based estimates.	22	2
201407	3475	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We chose to place that resting point for inflation within the envelope of that fistful of model-based estimates, but it was a little toward the upper end of that range.	22	2
201407	3476	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	The other prong of the message was that the confidence intervals around that resting point are very wide, so what we did was not only to give you our best shot at the center of the probability distribution, but also to communicate that we see the probability distribution as being very dispersed.	22	2
201407	3477	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But there is a risk that you could be right.	22	2
201407	3478	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	There’s a risk that we could be right, and I would also note that the probability distribution is two sided.	22	2
201407	3479	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	So we could be wrong.	22	2
201407	3480	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We will surely be wrong, but the chances are as likely that we could be wrong to the downside as they are that we could be wrong to the upside.	22	2
201407	3481	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	22	2
201407	3482	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Yes—question?	22	2
201407	3483	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	What is the essential mechanism in the model that produces the overshooting?	22	2
201407	3484	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Let me guess, and then you’ll tell me I’m wrong so that I can join you in being wrong with certainty.	22	2
201407	3485	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I assume that it may have something to do with the fact that you’ve got to get the real wage up in order to get to full employment.	22	2
201407	3486	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	So, somewhere along the path, you’re having a rise in wages.	22	2
201407	3487	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	And then there may be a differential response of prices to wages and to aggregate demand that produces this as an essential feature of the model.	22	2
201407	3488	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t know.	22	2
201407	3489	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	That’s a guess.	22	2
201407	3490	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Is that what it is?	22	2
201407	3491	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	I’m not sure what you’re asking.	22	2
201407	3492	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	There’s something in the model that makes this happen.	22	2
201407	3493	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	What is it?	22	2
201407	3494	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Yes.	22	2
201407	3495	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	At the risk of having a Pogo comic strip moment, it’s you.	22	2
201407	3496	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	If I may say so, the warranty on students ends at 25 years.	22	2
201407	3497	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	22	2
201407	3498	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Degree retracted?	22	2
201407	3499	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	I lost my train of thought.	22	2
201407	3500	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	[Laughter]	22	2
201407	3501	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Oh—we posit a deliberately mechanical monetary policy, which we believe conforms to the broad contours of what we understand the Committee to have communicated to the public.	22	2
201407	3502	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	That monetary policy succeeds in stabilizing both dimensions of the dual mandate around your objectives eventually.	22	2
201407	3503	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	It is not sufficiently restrictive over the next couple of years to prevent unemployment from undershooting its natural rate.	22	2
201407	3504	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	There’s nothing particularly optimal, of course, about that simple policy rule.	22	2
201407	3505	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	It does have the property, though, that, in the much longer run, it delivers an inflation rate that matches your 2 percent objective, because, given the resting point of inflation—that we place it a little bit below your 2 percent objective—a modest overshoot on the unemployment rate objective is what’s required to boost inflation expectations up so that the resting point of inflation can rise to reach your 2 percent objective.	22	2
201407	3506	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	22	2
201407	3507	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks.	22	2
201407	3508	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	22	2
201407	3509	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	22	2
201407	3510	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll try to summarize in my own words what you just said, David, which is, in order to get inflation expectations to rise above 1.75 percent, you actually have to have realizations of inflation above 1.75 percent.	22	2
201407	3511	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And the way to get that is to have unemployment undershoot.	22	2
201407	3512	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	That’s right.	22	2
201407	3513	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	It is what’s built into our analytics.	22	2
201407	3514	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	It is also built into our analytics with a great deal of humility because we don’t have a fantastic model, for example, of how inflation expectations are formed and that sort of thing.	22	2
201407	3515	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I absolutely agree with that.	22	2
201407	3516	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	So we put it forward as a reasonable hypothesis, but with no greater assertiveness than that.	22	2
201407	3517	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman—a two-hander?	22	2
201407	3518	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Thanks.	22	2
201407	3519	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes, I want to build on what President Kocherlakota was discussing.	22	2
201407	3520	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me that this is very sensitive to your view about how inflation expectations are formed.	22	2
201407	3521	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess, as a member of the Committee, I would be interested in the following:  If you had different assumptions about the inflation expectations process, how sensitive would the results be to that?	22	2
201407	3522	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, one can imagine a situation in which, if the unemployment rate is running below the natural rate, inflation expectations among some portion of the population might go up pretty rapidly, because people in the economy have different estimates of the full employment rate and some people would probably get pretty nervous as you were driving the unemployment rate down to 4.7 percent.	22	2
201407	3523	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	A question would be, how sensitive, then, are the results to how you characterize that inflation expectations process?	22	2
201407	3524	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The way I understand the model, you’re assuming that inflation expectations really do stay essentially anchored.	22	2
201407	3525	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	My understanding of your model is, as inflation is above 1.75 percent, it pulls inflation expectations up, but they never get above 2 percent.	22	2
201407	3526	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the reality is that, if you were running the labor market really hot, you could imagine that inflation expectations could go up more rapidly.	22	2
201407	3527	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The question is, how would that feed back into it—	22	2
201407	3528	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Broadly speaking, that’s right, and I’ll let Thomas Laubach fill in the details.	22	2
201407	3529	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	I would say it’s completely sensitive to the assumption about inflation expectations.	22	2
201407	3530	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	At the simplest level, it rests on, among other things, a premise that words alone from the Committee will not be enough, and that some demonstration of action will be required.	22	2
201407	3531	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Again, recognizing—I want to say it on every intervention that I make—that the confidence intervals are very wide, it rests on a judgment that some element of action will be required.	22	2
201407	3532	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Now, I do also want to clarify one more element of the picture before I turn it over to Thomas.	22	2
201407	3533	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	The largest contributor to the variance of inflation—and I’m going to put this in very clinical terms—is what we antiseptically refer to as the idiosyncratic component, a physician would say “the idiopathic component.”	22	2
201407	3534	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	That is the part we can’t trace to any specific cause.	22	2
201407	3535	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	So random variation matters overwhelmingly for the determination of inflation.	22	2
201407	3536	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	As one of you pointed out yesterday, that’s an important piece of why the confidence intervals around inflation are so large.	22	2
201407	3537	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	The component that we discuss in future inflation determination that you have any leverage over, which is the degree of utilization of resources, explains really quite a small portion of the variance of future inflation.	22	2
201407	3538	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	So I want to be clear that there’s a lot of stuff that will push inflation around that we can’t foresee and over which you have quite little control.	22	2
201407	3539	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	That is why there’s a very good probability that we will, in fact, attain the 2 percent objective without having to overheat the economy.	22	2
201407	3540	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	But, symmetrically, there’s also a very good probability that we could run substantially below the 2 percent objective.	22	2
201407	3541	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	What we’re trying to do, our design objective in putting together the forecast, is to give you a probabilistically evenly weighted outlook, and we try to center that on the baseline projection that we’ve put forward.	22	2
201407	3542	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	My concern is somewhat different.	22	2
201407	3543	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	My concern is that, by having these very strong assumptions about inflation expectations, you’re minimizing the cost of potentially pushing the unemployment rate too low for an extended period of time.	22	2
201407	3544	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So if you were to modify that assumption, how would that change the payoff function of pushing the unemployment rate too low?	22	2
201407	3545	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m worried that you’re getting the answer by the particular assumption you’re using.	22	2
201407	3546	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	And I’d love to see how sensitive the results are to that assumption.	22	2
201407	3547	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s all.	22	2
201407	3548	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Generically, your point is completely well taken—that a great deal rests on the mechanism that drives inflation expectations.	22	2
201407	3549	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	But there’s not a strong empirical foundation for basing that judgment on something other than what we have.	22	2
201407	3550	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	If there were, we would have adopted it—and now I will turn it over to Thomas.	22	2
201407	3551	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But you say yourself that your basis for the assumption that you’re making isn’t very strong.	22	2
201407	3552	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So it would be useful just to see what the alternatives were and how the results might vary.	22	2
201407	3553	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s all.	22	2
201407	3554	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Yes, and what I’ve stated is that—everything.	22	2
201407	3555	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	So if we posited something else, we’d get quite different results.	22	2
201407	3556	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	For example, if we posited that words were enough, we could get you to 2 percent immediately.	22	2
201407	3557	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Thomas.	22	2
201407	3558	2014-07-30	meeting	LAUBACH	All of this is exactly right.	22	2
201407	3559	2014-07-30	meeting	LAUBACH	It is indeed our lack of knowledge about how these long-term expectations are formed.	22	2
201407	3560	2014-07-30	meeting	LAUBACH	But, effectively, we have two data points—there was the big run-up in inflation in the 1970s, and then inflation and inflation expectations kept coming down.	22	2
201407	3561	2014-07-30	meeting	LAUBACH	That’s all of the observational material we have to go by.	22	2
201407	3562	2014-07-30	meeting	LAUBACH	Now, it’s a bit sad that, in this Tealbook, we didn’t include the “Low Inflation” alternative scenario, because that was exactly one of these scenarios that took as the starting point that there’s been much more learning about some perception of long-run inflation expectations than we have assumed.	22	2
201407	3563	2014-07-30	meeting	LAUBACH	In this case, it works in the opposite direction—namely, that from the past observations of lower inflation, people have taken more signal.	22	2
201407	3564	2014-07-30	meeting	LAUBACH	But it’s entirely right that, in future, we could see the opposite.	22	2
201407	3565	2014-07-30	meeting	LAUBACH	I’m sure that we can try to explore a little bit more the sensitivity to various assumptions but should always remind ourselves that these are really just assumptions, because we don’t have any firm basis.	22	2
201407	3566	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes.	22	2
201407	3567	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s my point.	22	2
201407	3568	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	You’re not that attached to this particular assumption, so wouldn’t it make sense to explore a range of assumptions just to see what happens?	22	2
201407	3569	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We can explore that sort of thing.	22	2
201407	3570	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We’ve thought about this really carefully.	22	2
201407	3571	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We think that, among a range of possible assumptions, this is quite a reasonable one.	22	2
201407	3572	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Among the lot of assumptions for which there’s not a great deal of empirical support, this is the one that strikes us as probably the best choice.	22	2
201407	3573	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	But we agree completely that our likelihood function here is pretty darn flat.	22	2
201407	3574	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	If I could find a 9th or 10th way to say that, I would.	22	2
201407	3575	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	This is an element of great uncertainty for us.	22	2
201407	3576	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	You’re right to highlight the sensitivity, and perhaps we can do some exploration in future editions of the  alternatives simulations section of the Tealbook, for example, about different mechanisms for inflation expectations.	22	2
201407	3577	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	I think I’ve just given Thomas an assignment.	22	2
201407	3578	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	22	2
201407	3579	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I had two-handers—first from President Bullard and then from President Fisher.	22	2
201407	3580	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201407	3581	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I complained last time about this memo that said that long-term inflation expectations are centered at 1.75 percent instead of at 2 percent.	22	2
201407	3582	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t really think that that’s right.	22	2
201407	3583	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	At least, you should present results for the person who thinks inflation expectations are still centered at 2.	22	2
201407	3584	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Then what would the optimal policy rate path look like?	22	2
201407	3585	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	That would be helpful.	22	2
201407	3586	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Or, if you think medium- or longer-term inflation expectations have drifted up, then what would the optimal policy rate path look like here?	22	2
201407	3587	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	That would be a variant on what Vice Chairman Dudley said regarding changing assumptions—but I think of changing assumptions in a somewhat different way than what he was describing and exploring.	22	2
201407	3588	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Also, I have to say, to come into a policy meeting and present this kind of stuff right before we’re looking at the alternatives—I think it would be more helpful to do something that would say, “If you choose alternative C, here’s what you’ll get.	22	2
201407	3589	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	If you choose alternative A, here’s what you’ll get.	22	2
201407	3590	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	And if you choose alternative B”—that would be more appropriate at this point in the meeting than coming with a simulation that stimulates a long debate here.	22	2
201407	3591	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	22	2
201407	3592	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	President Bullard, we’ll be happy to take a look at that.	22	2
201407	3593	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	It would, I think, really help advance the dialogue if you’d like to put forward evidence that supports your presumption that 2 percent is a better estimate.	22	2
201407	3594	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We took our best shot in the memo in June at putting forward our evidence, and it would be really constructive to have some dialogue about that.	22	2
201407	3595	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	So I’d very much welcome an alternative statement of empirical judgment.	22	2
201407	3596	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	I recognize that different model specifications will generate different answers, so there’s room for lots of disagreement.	22	2
201407	3597	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	But I think the way to advance the conversation would be to have that.	22	2
201407	3598	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Well, the Committee has specifically and repeatedly said in public statements that longer-term inflation expectations are stable.	22	2
201407	3599	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	What you’re saying is that they’re drifting down, and, because they’re drifting down, we have to take policy action.	22	2
201407	3600	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	That’s what these things are saying.	22	2
201407	3601	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	That’s why I’m passionate about this.	22	2
201407	3602	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	It’s conflicting with what the Committee has said publicly.	22	2
201407	3603	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	If you think the Committee should say something else, then give that as policy advice.	22	2
201407	3604	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	I’m not absolutely certain what you’re referring to, but the Michigan reading for longer-term inflation expectations in July did move downward.	22	2
201407	3605	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We noted that.	22	2
201407	3606	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We also noted that it’s based on a phone survey of 350 households, and we’re certainly on alert to the possibility that that could signal a larger downward move in longer-term inflation expectations.	22	2
201407	3607	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	But I would also point to other measures of longer-term inflation expectations, like the Survey of Professional Forecasters, that are rock steady at their previous readings.	22	2
201407	3608	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I’m referring to paragraph 1 of the FOMC statement, the last sentence: “Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.”	22	2
201407	3609	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	This is what the Committee has repeatedly said.	22	2
201407	3610	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Oh.	22	2
201407	3611	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	That’s true, and that’s not at variance with the observation that we’ve been making.	22	2
201407	3612	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We’ve been taking as given that longer-term inflation expectations may be steady, but there’s no reason that they’re necessarily pegged at 2 percent.	22	2
201407	3613	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	We’re taking that as a parameter to be estimated.	22	2
201407	3614	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	But this is not what I meant, at least, by supporting what’s in the statement here.	22	2
201407	3615	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher, do you have a two-hander?	22	2
201407	3616	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	First, I want to thank you for the humility with which you’ve presented it and for the heat with which you’ve just expressed the contrast between the two.	22	2
201407	3617	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I do want to go back to the interchange I had with Mr Wascher yesterday.	22	2
201407	3618	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	We went back and did a little research.	22	2
201407	3619	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	This is just to take a snippet of what Vice Chairman Dudley started out with.	22	2
201407	3620	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I was born in 1949.	22	2
201407	3621	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	It so happens that the CBO’s statistics on the natural rate go back to 1949—just so we are on the same factual basis.	22	2
201407	3622	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	And, very importantly, as the only former market operator in this room, I note that these are the kinds of things you look at for context—the natural rate has never been below 5 percent.	22	2
201407	3623	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	This is with all of the benefit of hindsight that we have from the CBO, going back to 1949.	22	2
201407	3624	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	It did bump along at that level in the first decade of this century.	22	2
201407	3625	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Its high, of course—in 1978, when things were pretty awful, it was 6.27 percent.	22	2
201407	3626	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	It was 5¼ percent or greater in the 1950s and 1960s.	22	2
201407	3627	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	In fact, it was 5.86 percent in 1969.	22	2
201407	3628	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Now, the Tealbook baseline calls for an unemployment rate falling to 4½ percent.	22	2
201407	3629	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	It’s a reasonable hypothesis, and we can also talk about the confidence bands and so on.	22	2
201407	3630	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	But, as a market operator, if I were to see that against the background of the history, it might certainly affect my expectations or raise the question “Are they going too far?”	22	2
201407	3631	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	And that might be reflected in the financial instruments that we look at, which, we admit, are imperfect in terms of understanding inflationary expectations.	22	2
201407	3632	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	You pointed to the survey data.	22	2
201407	3633	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	That’s one thing.	22	2
201407	3634	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I noticed yesterday that Esther pointed to the short-term numbers.	22	2
201407	3635	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	But, again, the way market operators think—and this is the beginning, I think, of Bill’s statement, even though that’s not where he came out—it looks a little out of context.	22	2
201407	3636	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	That’s my point.	22	2
201407	3637	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I don’t know the degree to which we can test this, but this has been my concern:  If we push too far beyond the norm—with a history in which we’ve never been, in at least my lifetime of 65 years, below 5 percent—then that may begin to affect the market expectation or it may raise some eyebrows.	22	2
201407	3638	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	That’s all I’m saying, and that’s why I’ve raised it two meetings in a row.	22	2
201407	3639	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I wish there was a way to test that.	22	2
201407	3640	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I don’t know if we can.	22	2
201407	3641	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	But I’m not comfortable—again, it was a humble statement, but whether we say “idiopathic” or “idiosyncratic,” we’re just saying we don’t know.	22	2
201407	3642	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	It’s an important variable, but we can’t really figure out why.	22	2
201407	3643	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Is that correct?	22	2
201407	3644	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Uncertainty, President Fisher, is pervasive in the monetary policy climate.	22	2
201407	3645	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	It is a fact.	22	2
201407	3646	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	It’s what we live with.	22	2
201407	3647	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	That’s true in the investment community, too, and in the business community.	22	2
201407	3648	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	So I wanted to satisfy our little conversation yesterday, because I think it’s an important consideration.	22	2
201407	3649	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	In some sense—again, premised all on the baseline outlook—running the unemployment rate below the natural rate is precisely, in this analysis, what’s required to get the attention of market operators, business owners, homeowners, households, et cetera, so that they say, “Gee, our inflation expectations”—you know what?	22	2
201407	3650	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Most people don’t have a clue about what inflation is, but we hypothesize that they think they have a longer-term inflation expectation, which we estimate, as a parameter, to be in the neighborhood of 1¾ percent.	22	2
201407	3651	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	And, in our baseline analysis, in order to get their attention—“Hmm, the FOMC must not be satisfied with 1¾ percent.	22	2
201407	3652	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	How do I know that?	22	2
201407	3653	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	I know that because they are conducting a policy that is consistent with allowing the economy to operate in a slightly overheated state for a temporary period of time.	22	2
201407	3654	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	It must be that their objective is a little higher than I previously thought, and, therefore, I’m going to nudge it up.”	22	2
201407	3655	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	Eventually, through this iterative process, they arrive at 2 percent.	22	2
201407	3656	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I understand that.	22	2
201407	3657	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	You also understand that I worry about the risks of operating in that manner.	22	2
201407	3658	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I know you do as well.	22	2
201407	3659	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	I can assure you, President Fisher—every night, when I go to bed, and every morning, when I wake up, I worry about the risks as well.	22	2
201407	3660	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	22	2
201407	3661	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	And I worry about the risks in between those two periods.	22	2
201407	3662	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	[Laughter]	22	2
201407	3663	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	You’re a very worried man.	22	2
201407	3664	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	I am, indeed.	22	2
201407	3665	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	When you’re in my business, it’s all downside.	22	2
201407	3666	2014-07-30	meeting		[Laughter]	22	2
201407	3667	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota—a two-hander.	22	2
201407	3668	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Madam Chair, I’ll be brief with my two-handed intervention because I am worried about leaving you enough time to prepare for your press conference in September.	22	2
201407	3669	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	22	2
201407	3670	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I thought I might have enough time.	22	2
201407	3671	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If you’re going to follow up on President Bullard’s suggestion of having 2 percent be the point at which inflation expectations are centered, I’d encourage you to also follow up with analysis in which you center those expectations at 1.5 percent, which I actually think would be consistent with empirical evidence that was presented in that very memo.	22	2
201407	3672	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	22	2
201407	3673	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I have President Evans as having a question, a one-hander.	22	2
201407	3674	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I did.	22	2
201407	3675	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	It could have been a two-hander, I guess.	22	2
201407	3676	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	At any rate, go on.	22	2
201407	3677	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	At any rate, the discussion on the inflation forecast is an important one and interesting.	22	2
201407	3678	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I would remind everybody that the Board’s staff circulated a memo several meetings ago in which they went into some depth as to how the inflation forecasting relationship behaved.	22	2
201407	3679	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	That memo is at the heart of the discomfort here because it’s more natural in a theoretical sense and all of our intuition to have short-term inflation expectations in there, at least over the medium term.	22	2
201407	3680	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	But, in fact, it’s hard to fit that.	22	2
201407	3681	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	It just doesn’t work so well.	22	2
201407	3682	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	So the Board staff has quite reasonably adopted the specification in which it’s long-term inflation expectations, and those are anchored.	22	2
201407	3683	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	It’s hard to move those.	22	2
201407	3684	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	And all of our intuition is that, well, the short term might be moving around.	22	2
201407	3685	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	So it may be that a little more discussion of that at the relevant time would be good for this.	22	2
201407	3686	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	On uncertainty, we’ve raised uncertainty many times.	22	2
201407	3687	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I believe, David, that every time you made a probabilistic statement, I agreed with the way that you characterized that.	22	2
201407	3688	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	But I want to be very careful.	22	2
201407	3689	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	In response to the chart that was displayed yesterday, “Forecast Summary,” with inflation in the big error bands, one attitude is to say uncertainty is big and throw up your hands.	22	2
201407	3690	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	But, in fact, you can make more-disciplined probabilistic statements.	22	2
201407	3691	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	According to this, unless I’m reading it wrong, it is still the case that the probability that inflation will come in below 2 percent is higher than the probability that it will be above 2 percent.	22	2
201407	3692	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	So there is discipline that needs to be imposed on our probabilistic statements in that regard.	22	2
201407	3693	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	22	2
201407	3694	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, all, for your comments and questions.	22	2
201407	3695	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	It was illuminating.	22	2
201407	3696	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s go into our policy go-round, starting with President Plosser.	23	2
201407	3697	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201407	3698	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I was going to make a comment about the last 10 minutes, but maybe I’ll let it go.	23	2
201407	3699	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	I’m dying to hear it.	23	2
201407	3700	2014-07-30	meeting	WILCOX	[Laughter]	23	2
201407	3701	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	No, you’re not.	23	2
201407	3702	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	All right.	23	2
201407	3703	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Over the past several meetings, I’ve supported the consensus statement, but, as I indicated at the last meeting, my discomfort has been growing.	23	2
201407	3704	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	That discomfort has reached the point where I can no longer support the language in alternative B or C.	23	2
201407	3705	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The economy appears to be bouncing back from a weak first quarter and is poised to grow at a pace somewhat above trend.	23	2
201407	3706	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Inflation appears to be firming, and I believe it will approach the Committee’s target by year-end.	23	2
201407	3707	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Given those views, I think that maintaining a near-zero federal funds rate well into next year is likely to be inappropriate, and that the current forward-guidance language in the statement is far too constraining and very much ignores the data and the progress the economy has made.	23	2
201407	3708	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Indeed, it’s time that we abandon our current communications and forward guidance and instead work toward a better articulation of a reaction function.	23	2
201407	3709	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	That, I believe, would serve us better than our ongoing practice of calendar- or time- based language for forward guidance that we’ve relied on.	23	2
201407	3710	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	At this point, my primary discomfort is in the current forward-guidance language.	23	2
201407	3711	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	It’s increasingly at odds with my past economic projections and my views of appropriate policy.	23	2
201407	3712	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Let me illustrate.	23	2
201407	3713	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	In December 2013, which was the meeting at which we started to taper, my economic projections indicated that, by the fourth quarter of 2014, the unemployment rate would have declined to 6.2 percent and we would have headline PCE, measured from fourth quarter to fourth quarter, at 1.8 percent.	23	2
201407	3714	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Consistent with that projection, I believe that an appropriate monetary policy would be a funds rate of about 1.25 percent by year-end.	23	2
201407	3715	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	By the end of 2015, I projected an unemployment rate of 5.8 percent and an inflation rate of 2 percent, calling for a funds rate just over 3 percent.	23	2
201407	3716	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The economy has now reached my December 2014 projections in terms of inflation and unemployment, nearly six months earlier than anticipated in December, and it’s projected to reach my December 2015 projections by the end of this year.	23	2
201407	3717	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Now, you might say, well, that’s your problem—that’s not the Committee’s problem.	23	2
201407	3718	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	But I’d also note that if you go to the December 2013 SEP, we are very close to what our projections were for December 2015, 18 months ahead of where we thought we would be.	23	2
201407	3719	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	That, to me, sounds like considerable progress toward our goals.	23	2
201407	3720	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	And, like me, a number of you around the table viewed the funds rate consistent with those 2015 projections as notably higher than it is now or is likely to be anytime soon based on our current statement language.	23	2
201407	3721	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	This discrepancy, I think, is increasingly problematic.	23	2
201407	3722	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I might note that this does not necessarily mean or assert that we’ve reached our goals.	23	2
201407	3723	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	That’s not what I’m saying.	23	2
201407	3724	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Yet many labor market metrics in addition to the unemployment rate have, in fact, improved—as many people have pointed out today.	23	2
201407	3725	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The change in nonfarm payrolls has averaged about 230,000 over the past six months and 272,000 over the past three months.	23	2
201407	3726	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	U-6 has fallen 1 full percentage point since December, and both the average and median durations of unemployment have dropped noticeably.	23	2
201407	3727	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The number of those unemployed for 27 weeks or longer has dropped by nearly 800,000 people since December, and the JOLTS data show more and more job offers.	23	2
201407	3728	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	On the inflation front, we’re also closer to our target.	23	2
201407	3729	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	As mentioned, year-over-year PCE inflation has risen from about 1 percent last December to 1.8 percent now.	23	2
201407	3730	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Other measures— including medians, trimmed means, and other indicators—also suggest we are moving closer to our goal.	23	2
201407	3731	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	But I don’t believe that monetary policy should remain at the zero bound until our goals are met or slack is zero.	23	2
201407	3732	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Monetary policy works with a lag.	23	2
201407	3733	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	But that seems to be the message— that is, that we were going to remain at zero until we reach our goals—or at least the interpretation of the message by many in the marketplace.	23	2
201407	3734	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think that this Committee must recognize and acknowledge that we are much closer to our goals today than we anticipated.	23	2
201407	3735	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	If we are to be appropriately data driven in our policy, we should be adjusting our policy, particularly our forward guidance, to reflect that progress.	23	2
201407	3736	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I don’t believe that the proposed statements reflect such an adjustment.	23	2
201407	3737	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Indeed, to me, the fact that there’s no change in our policy seems to deny the good news that many people have talked about around this table.	23	2
201407	3738	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	There’s another manifestation of my concerns that’s been alluded to around the table.	23	2
201407	3739	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The Tealbook, Book B, shows the outcomes for various rules for monetary policy, as usual, and we saw those in the charts that Bill presented.	23	2
201407	3740	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	With the exception of the nominal income targeting rule, for which, I think, we have very little evidence as to its practical or robust characteristics, all of these other rules see the zero bound as no longer binding and are calling for liftoff.	23	2
201407	3741	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The baseline funds path is now starkly at odds with these rules, and that tension is increasing.	23	2
201407	3742	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I would also note that the optimal-control exercise also calls for liftoff and is thus less accommodative than our baseline forecast.	23	2
201407	3743	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Some of you will argue, and perhaps appropriately so, that we don’t and maybe shouldn’t follow rules.	23	2
201407	3744	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Nevertheless, in my view, it should give us pause that our current policy stance stands in such growing contrast with these guidelines and historical experience.	23	2
201407	3745	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Even more notable, and perhaps troubling—and the Chair noted this—is that it seems that our statements and communications to date have resulted in market expectations for the future funds rate path to be even more accommodative than the baseline and, obviously, a lot more accommodative than the rules would suggest.	23	2
201407	3746	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I believe our statement today will likely reinforce these disparities.	23	2
201407	3747	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The longer we tolerate or encourage such a discrepancy can only increase the risks of a very bumpy, uncomfortable, and perhaps disruptive exit from this extraordinary period of accommodation.	23	2
201407	3748	2014-07-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201407	3749	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201407	3750	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	23	2
201407	3751	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201407	3752	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B as written.	23	2
201407	3753	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	As I mentioned yesterday, there remains substantial slack in labor markets, and PCE inflation has and is expected to continue to come in below our 2 percent target.	23	2
201407	3754	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would make no change in our current policy.	23	2
201407	3755	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	We have communicated clearly to the market that we will continue with the taper program, concluding in October.	23	2
201407	3756	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	At that time, we should have sufficient data to determine how best to interpret “considerable time” in the statement.	23	2
201407	3757	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	The earlier forward guidance in our statement implied that we might wait at least until the middle of 2015.	23	2
201407	3758	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Our current guidance focuses on a considerable time after the purchase program ends.	23	2
201407	3759	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I will be reluctant to alter that guidance unless there is strong evidence that inflation is coming in significantly higher than we currently anticipate.	23	2
201407	3760	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because of the uncertainty surrounding estimates of full employment, even in normal times, and the variety of labor market statistics that currently remain far from their historical norms, we probably should be highly focused on how wages and price pressures are developing.	23	2
201407	3761	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	While it is important to note that wage and price pressures can be lagging indicators of labor and product market tightness, at this time, both are well contained, suggesting that we still have some way to go before we reach full employment.	23	2
201407	3762	2014-07-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201407	3763	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201407	3764	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23	2
201407	3765	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201407	3766	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I fully support alternative B as written.	23	2
201407	3767	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	The incoming data since our last meeting have been favorable, and they indicate that a solid rebound from the first-quarter drop in GDP is well under way.	23	2
201407	3768	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	The improvement in labor market conditions has been especially encouraging, and inflation does appear to be heading back toward our longer-term target.	23	2
201407	3769	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think alternative B, the first paragraph, acknowledges these improvements appropriately, and the changes in the second paragraph also nod to the fact that inflation and labor market conditions are moving toward our goals.	23	2
201407	3770	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	It will be some time, however, before excess labor market slack is sufficiently reduced and underlying inflation has picked up enough to warrant an outright tightening of policy.	23	2
201407	3771	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	These circumstances call for maintaining the current course of monetary policy, including the further measured reduction in the pace of asset purchases, and maintaining the forward guidance that signals a highly accommodative future path for the funds rate at this time.	23	2
201407	3772	2014-07-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23	2
201407	3773	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201407	3774	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23	2
201407	3775	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201407	3776	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I support reducing the pace of asset purchases at this meeting as described in alternative B.	23	2
201407	3777	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I think two aspects of the draft statement for alternative B are likely to garner the most attention in market commentary.	23	2
201407	3778	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	One is the change in our inflation language at the end of paragraph 2.	23	2
201407	3779	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Those changes make eminent sense because of the firming we’ve seen in the inflation numbers of late.	23	2
201407	3780	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	The other focus of attention is going to be the characterization of labor markets in the first paragraph.	23	2
201407	3781	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I think it makes sense to drop “remains elevated” at this meeting and to note that labor market conditions have improved and the unemployment rate has declined further.	23	2
201407	3782	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	The next sentence gives me pause, however.	23	2
201407	3783	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	We qualify our acknowledgment of labor market improvements by citing “a range of labor market indicators” suggesting that “there remains significant underutilization” of resources.	23	2
201407	3784	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	As I noted in my comments during the economic go- round yesterday afternoon, there is always more underutilization than indicated by U-3.	23	2
201407	3785	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	The question should be whether there’s more underutilization than usually occurs when U-3 equals 6.1 percent, and the answer to that question is ambiguous.	23	2
201407	3786	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Yesterday I pointed to some research that’s consistent with U-3 being a good summary statistic rather than not, but I realize there are some around the table who disagree.	23	2
201407	3787	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Clearly, though labor market conditions are improving.	23	2
201407	3788	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	By shifting attention from unemployment to other indicators, we risk confusing the public.	23	2
201407	3789	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	We also risk being seen as cherry-picking the data to bolster a case for stimulus.	23	2
201407	3790	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	The key issue we need to face in the coming months is the disparity between the sense of the pace of tightening that we have and the market’s sense of that pace.	23	2
201407	3791	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Some people have made reference to that around the table here.	23	2
201407	3792	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I think we’d prefer to see that convergence take place smoothly, and, to me, this is another reason to avoid downplaying labor market improvements by shifting attention away from the unemployment rate.	23	2
201407	3793	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	The disparity between our expected funds rate path and the market’s suggests to me that the last sentence in our statement, which says that “economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run,” is having, perhaps, a greater effect than we intended.	23	2
201407	3794	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Now, if you look at it, it’s going to be a sentence that’s going to be hard to walk away from, in the sense that it’s hard for me to see how we’d be able to explain, at any given juncture, why we’re removing that sentence just then, since it’s about something way out in the longer run, but maybe we can.	23	2
201407	3795	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	But an alternative means of addressing this disparity problem that I talked about between the market’s path and ours would be to avoid downplaying the SEP dot plot in public.	23	2
201407	3796	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I know it has its limitations.	23	2
201407	3797	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I know everyone has some complaints about it.	23	2
201407	3798	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	But it’s one of the best vehicles we have for communicating how we expect the funds rate to unfold, particularly the steepness of the path after takeoff.	23	2
201407	3799	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	So in our public communications, I’d urge some support for the dot picture.	23	2
201407	3800	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Could I just mention that I did, in fact, point to the dot plot specifically, voluntarily [laughter], in my recent press conference, for exactly the reason you gave?	23	2
201407	3801	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	If I could make one other comment, I recognize, as I said in my summary, that there are disagreements among us about whether U-3 is a sufficient statistic or not, and I did not interpret the new language in paragraph 1 as intending to take any position on that matter at all.	23	2
201407	3802	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I don’t see it that way.	23	2
201407	3803	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	It’s, I think, a perfectly good sentence even if U-3 is a sufficient statistic.	23	2
201407	3804	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Even by that metric, one could say there is significant underutilization.	23	2
201407	3805	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	But I wanted to emphasize that I don’t see that sentence as opining on whether U-3 is sufficient or not.	23	2
201407	3806	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201407	3807	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I support alternative B as written.	23	2
201407	3808	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I can support the statement here.	23	2
201407	3809	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	I intended my remarks as cautionary in nature regarding what I see as the perhaps incipient movement of a bolder pace away from U-3 toward other labor market indicators, recognizing, as we always do, that we do look at a broad range of data in all of our assessments of economic conditions.	23	2
201407	3810	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks.	23	2
201407	3811	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	23	2
201407	3812	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201407	3813	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I support alternative B, but with reluctance.	23	2
201407	3814	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	First-quarter growth was weak, and now we’ve had a first estimate of pretty smart second- quarter growth.	23	2
201407	3815	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	My positive view of the outlooks for GDP growth, job growth, and inflation during the second half of 2014 and through 2015 hasn’t changed since June.	23	2
201407	3816	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	And my confidence that those expectations will be realized has substantially increased, based partly on the data we’ve seen and partly on what I’ve heard from my contacts in the business community.	23	2
201407	3817	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Downside tail risks, as I mentioned yesterday—and as you referred to in your summary as well, Madam Chair—have clearly diminished.	23	2
201407	3818	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	The unemployment rate continues to surprise.	23	2
201407	3819	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	We’re already in the 6 to 6.1 percent central tendency of unemployment rates that were projected for the fourth quarter, according to last month’s SEP.	23	2
201407	3820	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I did take note of Governor Tarullo’s excellent commentary and the staff work on the long-term unemployed.	23	2
201407	3821	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	However, I hold the view, personally, that it’s questionable whether monetary policy can affect the composition of the unemployed or the division of the unemployed between part and full time.	23	2
201407	3822	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I have argued publicly and at this table that we have to take into considerable account fiscal, education, and regulatory policy as well.	23	2
201407	3823	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	On the price front, the risk of deflation or downward de-anchoring of longer-term inflation expectations has receded.	23	2
201407	3824	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	As I said yesterday, there’s less danger than there certainly was before—and less than what we had discussed at this table—of slipping into a Japan-style low-inflation trap.	23	2
201407	3825	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	And the greater danger of significantly overshooting full employment is something I’m concerned with.	23	2
201407	3826	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	These changes in the actual and projected performance of the economy suggest to me that we’ll want to remove accommodation either sooner than previously planned, as in the “Optimal Control Policy” simulation in the Tealbook, Book B, on page 8, or more quickly than previously planned, as in the “Optimal Control with Forward Guidance Regarding Liftoff” simulation, which, by the way, happens to closely match my June SEP submission.	23	2
201407	3827	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	This is a personal opinion, and, as we all discussed, there’s some guesswork here, but I think the staff model of inflation likely understates inflationary pressures.	23	2
201407	3828	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Moreover, it’s certainly well within the realm of possibility that the natural rate of unemployment, as we discussed earlier, is above the Tealbook assumption and closer to the CBO estimate.	23	2
201407	3829	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Given what I see as the evident extreme difficulty of avoiding recession when policymakers try to engineer a period of below-potential growth, I don’t think we ought to push our luck.	23	2
201407	3830	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	That’s my point.	23	2
201407	3831	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Now, you have entertained us for quite some time with driving across our great country.	23	2
201407	3832	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I would suggest that we’re approaching a bend in the road, and I think the data are showing that.	23	2
201407	3833	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	If we continue to do that, I’d rather start easing up on the accelerator a little bit early as we approach that bend than wait until the curve is unmistakably on us.	23	2
201407	3834	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	That’s your analogy.	23	2
201407	3835	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I’m from Texas, so I prefer to talk about guns.	23	2
201407	3836	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	[Laughter]	23	2
201407	3837	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	We need to lead, not follow, so I have said in previous meetings that I want to see the whites of the eyes of this recovery before we raise rates.	23	2
201407	3838	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	But I’m not going to shoot—forgive me—in the back of the head.	23	2
201407	3839	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Or what I did in the speech in July was, I used duck hunting as an analogy.	23	2
201407	3840	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	You bag a mallard by leading the flight pattern, not by shooting where it is.	23	2
201407	3841	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Governor Fischer, I think, made a very good point, and this is where I continue to maintain the emphasis on wording.	23	2
201407	3842	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Governor Fischer said a lot of people built their strategies around what we’ve been doing.	23	2
201407	3843	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	This is one of the reasons I was against QE3, by the way— because we have created expectations.	23	2
201407	3844	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I don’t worry, Governor Fischer, about the moneychangers.	23	2
201407	3845	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	They made a hell of a lot of money.	23	2
201407	3846	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	What I do worry about is how it impacts the real economy and some of the things that Governor Powell was mentioning, which is the behavioral response of how it works its way through the real economy.	23	2
201407	3847	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I do think that, if we’re going to move earlier, we need to be changing the message, and I agree with Governor Fischer on that point.	23	2
201407	3848	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	To that point, if I had my druthers with this statement, I would trim the third sentence of alternative B, paragraph 1, to read “However, a range of indicators suggests labor resources remain underutilized.”	23	2
201407	3849	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I would take out the word “significant.”	23	2
201407	3850	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	However, I note, Madam Chair, that we did take out “elevated,” and I also note that, in your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, you used this terminology.	23	2
201407	3851	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	And that was based on our last meeting.	23	2
201407	3852	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	But it may be a little bit too soon to take out the word “significant.”	23	2
201407	3853	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	But my bias would be to do so if I were writing the entire alternative.	23	2
201407	3854	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I would eliminate the adjective “significant,” as I said.	23	2
201407	3855	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	In paragraph 5, I’m increasingly uncomfortable with “for a considerable time.”	23	2
201407	3856	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I notice that, in alternative C, we have “for some time.”	23	2
201407	3857	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I don’t expect the Committee to agree with me, but I think that, as we get closer and closer, if the data get better—again, to follow up on Governor Fischer’s suggestion, with which I agree, we’re at a tender moment, and we don’t want to have a negative impact on the market—that’s a word that is changeable.	23	2
201407	3858	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I’m likely to argue very strongly for that at the next meeting.	23	2
201407	3859	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Let me comment on paragraph 2.	23	2
201407	3860	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I think it makes significant progress.	23	2
201407	3861	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Again, if I had my druthers, I’d take “diminished somewhat” out, but it’s in there, and I can support it as it is written.	23	2
201407	3862	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	In summary, I support alternative B—again, with reluctance.	23	2
201407	3863	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	If the numbers keep improving along the path by which they have been improving, then I’ll be less supportive in the future—without language changes, in particular.	23	2
201407	3864	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I think we will have to start signaling that we’re going to either move things up sooner, which would be my preference, or move things more sharply when we move.	23	2
201407	3865	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201407	3866	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201407	3867	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23	2
201407	3868	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201407	3869	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I support alternative B.	23	2
201407	3870	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	The characterization of the economy and outlook in alternative B is broadly consistent with my own reading of the situation.	23	2
201407	3871	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Because of the weight I put on elements of employment slack, such as persons working part time for economic reasons and the participation rate, I actually considered whether the language in alternative A that references these factors specifically would be preferable to the words “range of labor market indicators” in alternative B.	23	2
201407	3872	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	However, I don’t think it’s wise to set off unhelpful market speculation related to the specifics of our reaction function, so I am comfortable—as you are, Madam Chair—with the general language in alternative B.	23	2
201407	3873	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I also like the new verbiage in the last sentence in paragraph 2 acknowledging the firming of inflation and the reduced likelihood of inflation remaining soft.	23	2
201407	3874	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	So I’m comfortable with the statement language as presented.	23	2
201407	3875	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201407	3876	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201407	3877	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23	2
201407	3878	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201407	3879	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	To offer a counterpoint to President Fisher’s comment about QE3, I’d like to say I’m very happy that we undertook QE3 and the forward guidance, as I think the economy is better because of that.	23	2
201407	3880	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I do support alternative B as written.	23	2
201407	3881	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	This is a significant change in language.	23	2
201407	3882	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Unemployment has come down, and inflation has moved up from its lowest recent readings.	23	2
201407	3883	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Of course, it is still much too early to declare victory.	23	2
201407	3884	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I think that substantial risks remain.	23	2
201407	3885	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	In alternative B, the language recognizes these developments pretty well.	23	2
201407	3886	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	In paragraph 1, we mention that the unemployment rate has declined further.	23	2
201407	3887	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	We’re not using the term “elevated.”	23	2
201407	3888	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	In my own mind, I still think that 6.1 percent is elevated against my take on the natural rate of 5 to 5¼ percent, but I’m okay with that.	23	2
201407	3889	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	It’s important to acknowledge “significant underutilization,” as the statement indicates.	23	2
201407	3890	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I believe that’s accurate.	23	2
201407	3891	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	And, in terms of the range of labor market indicators, you’ve talked quite a lot about your dashboard for the labor market, and I think that everyone will understand the language pretty clearly.	23	2
201407	3892	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	In paragraph 2, the inflation language removes the phrasing that we’re monitoring for evidence that inflation is moving back to our objective.	23	2
201407	3893	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	That’s fine, but considerable uncertainty does remain.	23	2
201407	3894	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	The inflation uncertainty bands point to that.	23	2
201407	3895	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	As I mentioned in my question-and- answer, I do think that it’s useful to characterize our take on where inflation is going in terms of the probabilities of that.	23	2
201407	3896	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	As President Kocherlakota has noted quite often recently, the probability that inflation is going to underrun our objective is higher than the probability that it will be above 2 percent.	23	2
201407	3897	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	The bands show that.	23	2
201407	3898	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	There was some discussion between President Williams and me on the right way to calculate those bands and what they really mean.	23	2
201407	3899	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	It would be nice if, in the Tealbook, they tabulated some of these probabilities with respect to a couple of benchmarks, like 2 percent or something.	23	2
201407	3900	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I’m not quite sure exactly what the numbers and benchmarks should be, but that would be useful for resolving some of those questions.	23	2
201407	3901	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I do still worry that we’re hoping to thread the needle in terms of getting inflation up to 2 percent by getting it up gradually.	23	2
201407	3902	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I’d like to get it up there much more quickly and use our policy accommodation to do that.	23	2
201407	3903	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	The Tealbook takes until 2018.	23	2
201407	3904	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	I think we need more confidence that the probability of inflation being above 2 percent is balanced against the downside probability.	23	2
201407	3905	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	But, for today, I certainly support alternative B.	23	2
201407	3906	2014-07-30	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	23	2
201407	3907	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201407	3908	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23	2
201407	3909	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201407	3910	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I support alternative B today.	23	2
201407	3911	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	There’s not been a significant enough change in the outlook to warrant deviating from the path of tapering asset purchases by another $10 billion per month.	23	2
201407	3912	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	My expectation is that we’ll announce in September that the program will conclude in October.	23	2
201407	3913	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I do have two concerns about the language.	23	2
201407	3914	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	First, as we discussed, we’ve seen considerable improvement in the economy over time—in fact, more improvement in labor market conditions than was anticipated.	23	2
201407	3915	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	And the outlook on labor markets has, if anything, improved since June.	23	2
201407	3916	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	So I’m concerned about introducing the language that there’s “significant underutilization of labor resources” into paragraph 1.	23	2
201407	3917	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Now, we can reasonably disagree about estimates of the level of underutilization.	23	2
201407	3918	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	My concern is more about the message this new language will send.	23	2
201407	3919	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	In particular, to me, the language suggests we’re more concerned about labor market developments now than we were in June or earlier in the year—and perhaps even then, our estimates of the degree of underutilization increased—yet the data, our forecasts, and our discussion belie that.	23	2
201407	3920	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	So I would suggest we drop the qualifier “significant” and not give any characterization of the degree of underutilization, saying simply that “there remains underutilization.”	23	2
201407	3921	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Omitting any qualifier provides a wide umbrella for different views on the Committee about the amount of underutilization.	23	2
201407	3922	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I don’t view that as inconsistent with the Chair’s testimony.	23	2
201407	3923	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	I also believe it would set us up better for the next meeting.	23	2
201407	3924	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	We will have two employment reports before our September meeting, one coming out this Friday, as well as a new round of FOMC projections.	23	2
201407	3925	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	A qualifier on the degree of underutilization could become obsolete as early as our next meeting.	23	2
201407	3926	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	But a change in that statement language will get noticed.	23	2
201407	3927	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	In fact, our statements are a little bit like Hotel California—words check in, but it’s hard to get them to check out.	23	2
201407	3928	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	[Laughter]	23	2
201407	3929	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	So I think we’d better take that into account and not create a future communications issue for ourselves.	23	2
201407	3930	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	My second concern, which I talked about last time, is with our forward guidance on the federal funds rate.	23	2
201407	3931	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	The end of the asset purchase program is looming, and a rate increase is anticipated sometime next year.	23	2
201407	3932	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Pretty soon, it’s going to be both necessary and desirable for us to change that forward guidance that indicates the first increase will be “a considerable time” after the purchase program ends.	23	2
201407	3933	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Liftoff has been moving closer, not further away.	23	2
201407	3934	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	We’ve seen more rapid improvement in the economy than many anticipated, and both the Tealbook federal funds rate path and the June SEP path are steeper than market expectations.	23	2
201407	3935	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	That’s true of the dealer survey.	23	2
201407	3936	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	It’s true of the federal funds futures and Eurodollar futures paths.	23	2
201407	3937	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	So I think what we should be doing is to do our best to better align the public’s expectations with our own view about the path, and we should do that before we get too close to the liftoff date.	23	2
201407	3938	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	My hope is that the combination of a press conference, the release of the new SEP numbers, and the probable release of normalization principles will make the September meeting a good one to revise our forward guidance.	23	2
201407	3939	2014-07-30	meeting	MESTER	Thank you.	23	2
201407	3940	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201407	3941	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23	2
201407	3942	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201407	3943	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	President Fisher, I may have generated some heat a moment ago, but there’s nothing like the heat that was between you and President Lacker yesterday.	23	2
201407	3944	2014-07-30	meeting	FISHER	I’m so sorry I said that.	23	2
201407	3945	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Sorry, I can’t remember that.	23	2
201407	3946	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	There goes the transcript.	23	2
201407	3947	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	23	2
201407	3948	2014-07-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Wait until the historians get hold of it.	23	2
201407	3949	2014-07-30	meeting	LACKER	Try to keep it off www.federalreservehistory.org.	23	2
201407	3950	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Madam Chair, I agree with Governor Fischer that we are well ahead of where we expected to be.	23	2
201407	3951	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Last year at this time, we expected to be at 7 percent unemployment, and we expected to be done with the QE program.	23	2
201407	3952	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Instead, we’re at 6.1 percent unemployment, and the QE program has not been completed yet.	23	2
201407	3953	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I’m willing to support alternative B for today with a change to the phrase “significant underutilization of labor resources.”	23	2
201407	3954	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	And I’m agreeing with President Mester.	23	2
201407	3955	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I propose that we simply eliminate the word “significant.”	23	2
201407	3956	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	To me, the word “significant” would apply to a situation in which we have 8 percent unemployment or 9 percent unemployment.	23	2
201407	3957	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	We’ve come down to a much lower level, and, even on the other dimensions of labor market performance, things have improved.	23	2
201407	3958	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	So I think we can just say “underutilization” and get the point across.	23	2
201407	3959	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I like President Mester’s characterization that we don’t want to set ourselves up for difficulties in changing the language, as we have more labor reports coming and we are expecting reasonably good news, we hope, in those reports.	23	2
201407	3960	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	So you would eliminate one word.	23	2
201407	3961	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	The phrase would be “there remains underutilization of labor resources,” which I think is a perfectly fine characterization of what’s going on.	23	2
201407	3962	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	This would better reflect the labor market situation, in my view.	23	2
201407	3963	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	That’s my only suggested change to the statement today.	23	2
201407	3964	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Let me make a few comments on alternative A, which was more direct in noting alternative labor market indicators.	23	2
201407	3965	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	If we go in this direction in the future, I would encourage the Committee not to cite the labor force participation rate.	23	2
201407	3966	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Some of you know that I gave a speech called “The Rise and Fall of Labor Force Participation in the United States.”	23	2
201407	3967	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	That was a review of the literature on labor force participation.	23	2
201407	3968	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	My take on this is that demographic models explain nearly all of the decline in labor force participation since 2000.	23	2
201407	3969	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Demographically-based models developed in 2006 are basically spot-on with their predictions of where labor force participation would be today.	23	2
201407	3970	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	And most of these models predict that labor force participation will continue to decline in the quarters and years ahead.	23	2
201407	3971	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	That’s basically on a downward path.	23	2
201407	3972	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Labor force participation has not historically had a significant cyclical component.	23	2
201407	3973	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	So I think that, if we would lean more on that interpretation of the labor force participation rate, we would get better unemployment forecasts.	23	2
201407	3974	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	That’s what I’ve been doing in recent years.	23	2
201407	3975	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I’ve been fortunate enough to be more accurate on what was going to happen with unemployment.	23	2
201407	3976	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	The other labor market indicators, other than labor force participation, might be reasonable—persons working part time for economic reasons, for instance.	23	2
201407	3977	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	But labor force participation, I think, is a special category that is driven by factors outside of the control of monetary policy.	23	2
201407	3978	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I would also say this about other indicators of the labor market health, other than the unemployment rate:  I think we need better empirical evidence that would justify citing these particular measures in the statement as they are in alternative A, if we ever wanted to go in that direction.	23	2
201407	3979	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I’m doubtful that we can get improved empirical performance by adding one of the lesser-cited labor market indicators to variables in a VAR or a related empirical model.	23	2
201407	3980	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	In other words, the marginal contribution of adding a labor market indicator of that nature is probably small or zero.	23	2
201407	3981	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	So I think that, until we have some evidence of that nature, I would not raise those kinds of indicators to the level of putting them in the statement.	23	2
201407	3982	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	I understand that we, of course, want to talk about all information that’s in front of the Committee, but to raise it to that level says that it’s a variable that can really explain a lot about what’s going on in the macroeconomy.	23	2
201407	3983	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	And I don’t think the lesser-cited labor market indicators can do that or can meet that kind of test.	23	2
201407	3984	2014-07-30	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201407	3985	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201407	3986	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23	2
201407	3987	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201407	3988	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	I support alternative B in terms of a further reduction in asset purchases.	23	2
201407	3989	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Compared with the June statement, I had a similar reaction to the language in paragraph 1—that it seems to downplay labor market improvements.	23	2
201407	3990	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	And I, too, would prefer to reframe that characterization by dropping the word “significant” so that the Committee’s acknowledgment of the broad improvement in labor markets is clear.	23	2
201407	3991	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	I think the language we use is increasingly important as we steer toward normalization.	23	2
201407	3992	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Policy rules and the Tealbook, Book B, prescribe less accommodation than they did at the June meeting, even as the gap between the Committee’s views and those of the market remains wide.	23	2
201407	3993	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	The federal funds futures market shows a much more gradual trajectory for the funds rate following liftoff.	23	2
201407	3994	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Threading the communication needle will be challenging to avoid either surprising markets by moving faster than expected or delaying policy normalization at the risk of falling behind the curve and jeopardizing our long-run objectives.	23	2
201407	3995	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	In this regard, I remain concerned that we may already be behind the curve.	23	2
201407	3996	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	The current unemployment rate gap, looking at the difference between the unemployment rate and the CBO’s long-term estimate, is currently just over ½ percentage point.	23	2
201407	3997	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	This gap is the same as it was in June 2004 at the time of liftoff for the last round of policy tightening.	23	2
201407	3998	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	I understand the arguments for delaying liftoff longer than in the past, but we should not complicate this risk by letting markets expect that we will also move slower than in the past.	23	2
201407	3999	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Most research on monetary policy at the zero lower bound finds that, if liftoff is to be delayed because of the constraint on rates at zero, short-term rates should return to normal faster, not slower, following liftoff.	23	2
201407	4000	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Of course, these models generally do not incorporate the important role of financial stability for markets.	23	2
201407	4001	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	So my own preference would be to lift off sooner and move more slowly.	23	2
201407	4002	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	At a minimum, however, I would like to avoid painting ourselves into a corner by letting financial markets think we’re going to both delay liftoff and move exceptionally slowly following liftoff.	23	2
201407	4003	2014-07-30	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	23	2
201407	4004	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201407	4005	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	23	2
201407	4006	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201407	4007	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I support alternative B as written.	23	2
201407	4008	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would be opposed to removing the word “significant” in paragraph 1.	23	2
201407	4009	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think, especially since that word appeared in your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, it’s appropriate to leave it in at this time.	23	2
201407	4010	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I do agree with some of the comments from participants around the table that we will need to revisit the words “considerable time” in the very near term and try to provide more clarity about what exactly we mean by that.	23	2
201407	4011	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would hope we do that in terms of economic conditions and not so much in terms of dates, but I think that, very soon, in the September– October time frame, we’re really going to be put in a position of having to try to answer some tough questions about that.	23	2
201407	4012	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	For a long period of time, this Committee has been struggling with the employment mandate and focused on the employment mandate as really the main challenge facing us.	23	2
201407	4013	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m increasingly thinking that the big challenge for us is really on price stability, and the perhaps overly extended dialogue that we had leading into this round highlights some of those challenges.	23	2
201407	4014	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Staff estimates right now are that inflation expectations are 1¾ percent.	23	2
201407	4015	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that, if you carefully read the memo that we received in June, this estimate is unduly generous to this Committee.	23	2
201407	4016	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If you actually read the numbers behind the assessment, you could have gone with a lower number, as Mr Wilcox mentioned earlier, in fact.	23	2
201407	4017	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We heard lots of passion yesterday about the loss of credibility associated with missing the federal funds rate target range by 10 basis points for one day.	23	2
201407	4018	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We need to bring that same level of passion, or even more, to the prospect of missing our inflation target by 25 basis points or more over an extended period.	23	2
201407	4019	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	When we have a flat Phillips curve, that miss of 25 basis points represents lots of resource loss and lots of underutilization.	23	2
201407	4020	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I’m concerned that FOMC participants seem comfortable with long-run misses of inflation.	23	2
201407	4021	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Maybe I’m misreading the conversation—I apologize if I am.	23	2
201407	4022	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I am concerned that I’m hearing a degree of sanguineness about having inflation underrun our target for a very long period of time.	23	2
201407	4023	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	President Evans asked me if I had some good points to make, and I said I didn’t, but I do have a lot of points.	23	2
201407	4024	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	23	2
201407	4025	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	President Plosser, I think, raised a good point about how our behavior is likely to deviate from rules as we move forward.	23	2
201407	4026	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One reason for that lies in the behavior of inflation.	23	2
201407	4027	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Inflation has been so low for so long relative to target that we’re starting to see these estimates of what inflation expectations are drift downward.	23	2
201407	4028	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That really forces us to be more accommodative than we’d otherwise be, given the current metrics.	23	2
201407	4029	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As we contemplate how to interpret those words “considerable time,” my own thinking about how we should be formulating the conditions governing liftoff is really in terms of the inflation mandate and the price stability mandate.	23	2
201407	4030	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s very hard to justify liftoff taking place when the one- to two-year-ahead outlook for inflation is below 2 percent.	23	2
201407	4031	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In my mind, there’s no reason for us to be lowering rates simply because unemployment has gotten too low.	23	2
201407	4032	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s built into Tealbook objectives—that there’s a loss associated with unemployment being too low.	23	2
201407	4033	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I don’t read our statutory mandate as saying that you should not have unemployment be too low.	23	2
201407	4034	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I don’t read our communications from our long-run goals statement as saying, “We don’t want unemployment to be too low.”	23	2
201407	4035	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I would not be supportive of raising rates simply because unemployment has fallen too low.	23	2
201407	4036	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The other piece that’s built into Tealbook objectives is a desire to keep interest rates smooth.	23	2
201407	4037	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In fact, as the Tealbook, Book B, notes, a lot of weight is put on that.	23	2
201407	4038	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I don’t see that in our statutory mandates.	23	2
201407	4039	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I don’t see it in our long-run goals or communications.	23	2
201407	4040	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	For those reasons, I don’t put weight on that in my objective.	23	2
201407	4041	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Accordingly, I would see no reason for us to be raising rates as long as the inflation outlook remained below 2 percent.	23	2
201407	4042	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I say “no reason.”	23	2
201407	4043	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There is one reason—potential financial instability concerns, which I’ve talked about in the past.	23	2
201407	4044	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I agree with Governor Fischer here.	23	2
201407	4045	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As long as housing is not being affected by this, it’s really hard for me to see how this is going to get into the broader economy.	23	2
201407	4046	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s where you’re going to see it—in housing.	23	2
201407	4047	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Until we see it there—and we’re a long way from that, unfortunately—I don’t think that’s going to be a risk.	23	2
201407	4048	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	When I think about how to reframe “considerable time,” it would be to frame it in terms of the necessary condition for liftoff being a one- to two-year-ahead outlook for inflation of 2 percent.	23	2
201407	4049	2014-07-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201407	4050	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201407	4051	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23	2
201407	4052	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you very much, Madam Chair.	23	2
201407	4053	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t want to go back over, essentially, the previous round, so let me just address alternative B, which I support, and make a few comments.	23	2
201407	4054	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	But I would like to start by addressing a point that President Plosser raised.	23	2
201407	4055	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	It is clear that, if we were using the Taylor rule, or any rule, with this level of unemployment and this rate of inflation, we’d be well above zero.	23	2
201407	4056	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	That’s clear.	23	2
201407	4057	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	But I think that doesn’t take into account the history dependence of how we got here.	23	2
201407	4058	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We have only recently reached the conclusion—and when I say “we,” you’ll have to include me in some metaphysical sense—that we are making progress, in which the risk of deflation has fallen off the table and in which, at least in the labor market, we seem to be seeing significant, sustained improvements in performance.	23	2
201407	4059	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We haven’t seen it in growth yet, and it may just be that we won’t see it in growth, because it’s entirely possible that we may reach the unfortunate conclusion that the rate of productivity growth has declined.	23	2
201407	4060	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	If that’s it, so be it.	23	2
201407	4061	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	That’s one of the many things that monetary policy can’t particularly deal with.	23	2
201407	4062	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	It’s that we’re starting from a zero interest rate that causes us to be so significantly away from almost every monetary rule that would have applied if we had come to this point as a result of some normal business cycle, in which we’d gone up to 7½ percent unemployment and started coming down, and we hadn’t had a huge financial crisis and so forth.	23	2
201407	4063	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Then we wouldn’t be in this situation.	23	2
201407	4064	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	But we did go through a financial crisis of massive proportions, and I’m glad that the Committee voted for QE3, because I think that made a significant difference.	23	2
201407	4065	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	But it’s just an intra-Fischer/Fisher disagreement.	23	2
201407	4066	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	23	2
201407	4067	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We don’t have to worry about that too much.	23	2
201407	4068	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Let’s go to the issues.	23	2
201407	4069	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	I’ve also toyed with the issue that you’re dealing with, President Plosser, and have tried to explain to myself why I wouldn’t want to do what the Taylor rule says or what you recommend, and that’s my answer to that.	23	2
201407	4070	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Now, let’s look ahead a few months and ask what could happen.	23	2
201407	4071	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Well, we could continue to get good news out of the labor market, and that would almost certainly mean that we’d want to raise the interest rate sooner than late in the second quarter of next year or even early in the third quarter.	23	2
201407	4072	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	If that were to happen, we would want to send—by September, for sure—a fairly strong signal.	23	2
201407	4073	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Sending a fairly strong signal raises the risk of a “taper tantrum 2.”	23	2
201407	4074	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We went through QE1, QE2, and QE3.	23	2
201407	4075	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We really don’t want to get that series going on taper tantrums, and I think we should avoid it.	23	2
201407	4076	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	If that were to happen, we would want to have sent some signal that we already got an internal estimate that liftoff will be sooner than the markets think.	23	2
201407	4077	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Alternative B sends that signal pretty well.	23	2
201407	4078	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	This is going to be noticed, and people will say, “Oh, yes.	23	2
201407	4079	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	23	2
201407	4080	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	They are worried about inflation.	23	2
201407	4081	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	They continue to be worried about unemployment.	23	2
201407	4082	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	But there’s a very significant change, particularly at the end of paragraph 2.”	23	2
201407	4083	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	But, in fact, the whole of paragraph 2 is a significant change, and I think that will have been enough.	23	2
201407	4084	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Well, why don’t we say, “It could be in the first quarter of 2015”?	23	2
201407	4085	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	The reason is, we could get some bad news, and we don’t want to go too far.	23	2
201407	4086	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	We don’t want to do something that we’ll regret having done.	23	2
201407	4087	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	So my sense is, this language is about right.	23	2
201407	4088	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	It sends a signal that will be noticed, for sure, but it doesn’t send a signal of massive change.	23	2
201407	4089	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	If we get another two good labor market reports—or even another one—before the next meeting, I’m pretty sure we’ll want to change this statement, as President Fisher and others have suggested, in a far more definite direction.	23	2
201407	4090	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	And we will have given some warning that that’s on its way.	23	2
201407	4091	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	If we get really bad news, we don’t have to do any changes in the next meeting.	23	2
201407	4092	2014-07-30	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201407	4093	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201407	4094	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23	2
201407	4095	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201407	4096	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t hear any disagreement around the table with respect to the policy action we’re going to take today, so it all seems to be a matter of wording.	23	2
201407	4097	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	More precisely, as I think Stan has just tried to frame the issue, it’s one of strategic planning for how we’re going to word what we say now and over the course of the next several meetings.	23	2
201407	4098	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	I believe we have two sets of aims.	23	2
201407	4099	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	One is the aim that the Chair began with, which is an indication of wanting to move market expectations closer to where we all evaluate that a critical mass of next year’s voters probably occupies right now.	23	2
201407	4100	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	And it doesn’t seem to a lot of us as though there’s the degree of alignment in markets that we would like.	23	2
201407	4101	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	I think a second aim— which, again, Stan was just alluding to—is to maintain some optionality on our part, depending on what the data show over the course of the next several meetings, as to whether that critical mass is going to change its own set of expectations—that is, to pull forward the date of the first liftoff or, conceivably, depending on what I don’t think any of us expect—maybe getting some very bad data—to push it back.	23	2
201407	4102	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	We’ve got to have both of those aims in mind, not just in crafting today’s statement, but also in thinking about how today’s statement affects what we say over the next few meetings.	23	2
201407	4103	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	With that perspective in mind, I’ll begin by saying that, even if I agreed with Charlie Plosser’s substantive views, which he knows I don’t, I really wouldn’t want to make a change in the forward guidance today, because I think it would be more than bumpy—it would feel like one of those air pockets you hit over the Rockies sometimes.	23	2
201407	4104	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	It would be a complete reversal of expectations by markets as to what we may do.	23	2
201407	4105	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	We need to move more incrementally, and I believe the Chair tried, in her monetary policy testimony, to move incrementally.	23	2
201407	4106	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	I think most of us agree that what we’d like to see this statement today do is, again, to take a baby step further along the way to changing market expectations without some kind of giant leap forward, because those of us who feel that we don’t have a strong view as to whether we are going to pull forward or not do want to maintain some of that optionality, and we also don’t want to unnecessarily roil markets along the way.	23	2
201407	4107	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	With that in mind, with respect to the sentence that several of you have talked about, it seems to me there are three options there.	23	2
201407	4108	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	One, you leave it in as it is.	23	2
201407	4109	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Two, you take it out.	23	2
201407	4110	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	And, three, you either delete “significant” or change it to some softer adjective.	23	2
201407	4111	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	We all need to borrow David’s cloak of humility in trying to project how markets are going to react to any of this stuff.	23	2
201407	4112	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	But we should probably think it through roughly along the following lines:  If we put it in, it is, to my mind, a statement of fact.	23	2
201407	4113	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	I agree with it as a factual matter.	23	2
201407	4114	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	What it’s basically doing is trying to warn that the critical mass is not moving too rapidly to the conclusion that some might reach—and, I think, some of us around the table have already reached—that we’re on the way to liftoff.	23	2
201407	4115	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Changing “significant” is the hardest to figure out.	23	2
201407	4116	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	I’d be a little concerned about changing “significant,” either deleting it or changing it to something else, because everybody will just compare it with what the Chair said at her monetary policy testimony.	23	2
201407	4117	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	And that creates the largest chance of there being an excessive reaction, from our point of view.	23	2
201407	4118	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	The third option, obviously, is to omit it, and Loretta made the case for that.	23	2
201407	4119	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	President Mester made a dynamic case for it, which is, what do you do with it once it’s in there?	23	2
201407	4120	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	My own view is that, ultimately, this is the Chair’s call to make, because she’s the one who’s got to navigate this along the way.	23	2
201407	4121	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	But I do think that, right now, we probably do need that baby step forward in terms of market perceptions.	23	2
201407	4122	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	So the way I would try to judge this is, what’s our level of confidence that the statement with the sentence will move that baby step, but only a baby step, forward, as opposed to the statement without the sentence moving that baby step forward, bearing in mind what Loretta said about the future?	23	2
201407	4123	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	In some sense, Madam Chair, I’m throwing this back on you, but I do think this is a pretty important decision right now, precisely because of what Stan said.	23	2
201407	4124	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	It’s taking us one step at a time, and whatever we do in September is going to build on what we’ve done today.	23	2
201407	4125	2014-07-30	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	23	2
201407	4126	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201407	4127	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23	2
201407	4128	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201407	4129	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I will support alternative B today as written.	23	2
201407	4130	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	It does seem to me that the margin of slack is significantly smaller, and that it’s been disappearing significantly faster than I had expected.	23	2
201407	4131	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I was pleased to see that the primary dealer survey put some significant probability on a March liftoff.	23	2
201407	4132	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	The actual market readings are not so well aligned with that view, and I think the first rate increase needs to be well telegraphed in advance, obviously, and not a surprise to markets.	23	2
201407	4133	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	So if data come in as expected or better, we seem to have some work to do on that front.	23	2
201407	4134	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	On the statement language today, I want to think ahead.	23	2
201407	4135	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	If the modal case is realized and we get 250,000 jobs in each of the next two months, it seems to me that a couple of things will happen.	23	2
201407	4136	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	First of all, I think the SEP will start to show liftoff in the first quarter—on the part of some, at least—which would be appropriate at that time.	23	2
201407	4137	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	But, in addition, that would put significant pressure on the language in the statement in at least three places.	23	2
201407	4138	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	First, the word “significant,” at that point, will come under a lot of pressure.	23	2
201407	4139	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I subscribe to David Wilcox’s and Governor Tarullo’s belief in the need for humility on this, but I do think that that will be the most noticed word in this statement, and that it will be the word that characterizes the overall thrust of this statement.	23	2
201407	4140	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	So that would come under tremendous pressure in September.	23	2
201407	4141	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Second, I do think that, with respect to the “considerable time” language, at the end of paragraph 5, you would be under a lot of pressure.	23	2
201407	4142	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Finally, I believe that the next SEP will include 2017.	23	2
201407	4143	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	The Tealbook has the federal funds rate at 3.8 percent.	23	2
201407	4144	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	So I don’t know that that last sentence in the whole statement—which, I guess, President Lacker referred to—is going to be true any longer at that point.	23	2
201407	4145	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	In other words, it may not be correct that the federal funds rate is below normal levels at that point.	23	2
201407	4146	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	I think there is an opportunity to drop that, but the bottom line is, this is a risk-management call that the Chair really gets to make.	23	2
201407	4147	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	There’s risk in leaning too far forward now.	23	2
201407	4148	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	The risk is that there will be a lot more pressure on the September statement, and I’ll be happy to support your conclusions on that.	23	2
201407	4149	2014-07-30	meeting	POWELL	Thank you.	23	2
201407	4150	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201407	4151	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23	2
201407	4152	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	Let me start by saying I support alternative B.	23	2
201407	4153	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	In reflecting on the changes in alternative B from the June statement, obviously the new news for all of us is the accelerated pace at which slack is diminishing in the labor market.	23	2
201407	4154	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	That’s really the biggest piece of data that came in well ahead of expectations.	23	2
201407	4155	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	Of course, we’re also seeing signs of a healthier inflation rate and now a lower likelihood that we will not be able to reach 2 percent for a very protracted period of time.	23	2
201407	4156	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	We also don’t see, I think, anything on the financial-stability side that would materially change our inclinations on monetary policy.	23	2
201407	4157	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	The anomalous performance, though—the poorly understood performance on GDP and GDI—should give us some pause and, if nothing else, injects considerable uncertainty—and uncertainty that does matter, I think importantly, for monetary policy.	23	2
201407	4158	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	I don’t believe that uncertainty is likely to be greatly resolved at least until the QSS revisions, and possibly not even at that juncture, in September.	23	2
201407	4159	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	Because it’s very difficult to reverse course once liftoff is initiated and because this recovery has proven unusually susceptible to false dawns, I think that, if we have the breathing space to wait for a clear pattern of signals—and the inflation data suggest that we do have that luxury—the prudent course is to digest that additional data before committing decisively.	23	2
201407	4160	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	I will say that, on the other side of those considerations, I am troubled that market participant expectations on the date of liftoff and on the path of the federal funds rate seem both late and shallow relative even to the June SEP.	23	2
201407	4161	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	The June SEP path itself is below the July Tealbook projection for the funds rate.	23	2
201407	4162	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	And, as was said earlier, while a policy rule is not particularly binding for these sets of circumstances, I think that, nonetheless, we should be looking at a range of policy rules.	23	2
201407	4163	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	The Tealbook projections, in turn, are later and shallow than prescribed paths from a whole set of policy rules.	23	2
201407	4164	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	That growing divergence between market expectations and our internal projections argues in favor of altering the description of economic conditions, as is reflected in the proposed alternative B statement.	23	2
201407	4165	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	I would hope the market would have put greater weight, actually, on the data relative to the forward guidance, based on the statement made by the Chair in her Humphrey-Hawkins testimony.	23	2
201407	4166	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	Here I’m referring to the statement that “if the labor market continues to improve more quickly than anticipated ...	23	2
201407	4167	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	That does not seem to have gotten much traction.	23	2
201407	4168	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	And I would think we would want to see that sentiment, the data dependency, start to dominate the market’s thinking.	23	2
201407	4169	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s worth thinking a little bit about the tradeoff between waiting a little longer with a possibly steeper path of rates thereafter, versus moving a little sooner and thinking that we could actually see a somewhat shallower path.	23	2
201407	4170	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	If the dominant consideration is not moving prematurely in the context of considerable uncertainty about the extent of slack, then the later time of liftoff and possibly steeper path thereafter probably are preferable.	23	2
201407	4171	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	If, instead, we were particularly worried about risks to financial stability, then perhaps we would be more inclined toward the sooner, shallower path.	23	2
201407	4172	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s helpful, as many people have done here, to discipline our discussions about this thinking forward to a sequence of signals that we would be sending over the next few meetings as more data come in—especially, again, because it’s going to be very difficult to reverse course once that alteration is made.	23	2
201407	4173	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	So I think we would want to tilt toward a more positive read on the elimination of slack and inflation in this statement.	23	2
201407	4174	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	In September, we’ll have the new SEP numbers, which will move considerably—if I hear people around the table correctly—and the market will see that.	23	2
201407	4175	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	The Chair will be giving a press conference, and we’ll also have the principles on exit.	23	2
201407	4176	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	Those things together will give us the potential for adjustments based on the data that we’ll have in the intervening period.	23	2
201407	4177	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	Thereafter, if, in fact, we continue to see this acceleration of the elimination of slack, I do think we have to start moving away from the “considerable time” language and altering the forward guidance.	23	2
201407	4178	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	With regard to the actual characterization of underutilization, I have to say I share the concerns that have been articulated that the characterization of slack as “significant underutilization” does seem a bit strong in relation to the data that we’ve seen.	23	2
201407	4179	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	The real concern is, how do you move off of that without sending too strong a signal?	23	2
201407	4180	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	I think Governor Tarullo has suggested two alternatives, and President Mester stated that tradeoff nicely.	23	2
201407	4181	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	Again, I would defer to the Chair, but that is something that I would give a little bit more thought to.	23	2
201407	4182	2014-07-30	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	23	2
201407	4183	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201407	4184	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23	2
201407	4185	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201407	4186	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B as written.	23	2
201407	4187	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But before I get into the language, I’d like to make some observations about the outlook for monetary policy over the longer term.	23	2
201407	4188	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It strikes me that the prospects for an earlier-than-anticipated tightening of monetary policy have increased.	23	2
201407	4189	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I, for one, can certainly imagine liftoff occurring next March, presuming that the outlook evolves in line with the Tealbook forecast or something close to that.	23	2
201407	4190	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Given that, we need to start thinking about working backward.	23	2
201407	4191	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	How would we actually manage to a March liftoff?	23	2
201407	4192	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s not to say we absolutely will do that, but the data certainly could evolve in that way.	23	2
201407	4193	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The way I see it happening is in a number of steps.	23	2
201407	4194	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The first step happens today, when we basically move it a baby step, as Governor Tarullo said, just to start to change market expectations a little bit.	23	2
201407	4195	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	In September, if the next two employment reports confirm that we’re still on this trajectory, then we take a bigger step in terms of language.	23	2
201407	4196	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	And then in December, we remove the “considerable time” language, and that’s the signal that, at the next press conference meeting three months later, it’s highly likely that you’re actually going to go ahead with tightening.	23	2
201407	4197	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s how I think it would go.	23	2
201407	4198	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But we need to start to have some discussion around the table about how this sequence would work and get people in agreement on how this process would unfold.	23	2
201407	4199	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, the second question I want to talk about is something that Governor Fischer raised, which I think is interesting—this gap right now between what we think and what market expectations are.	23	2
201407	4200	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The question I want to pose is, how big a problem is this, and what should we do about it at this meeting?	23	2
201407	4201	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	My own view is, I’m probably a little bit less concerned about this problem than maybe some others at this meeting, and the reason for that is, consider two alternatives.	23	2
201407	4202	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The first alternative is a circumstance in which market participants expect us to go earlier than we think we’re going to go.	23	2
201407	4203	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The market has the tightening as occurring likely before we actually think we’re going to move.	23	2
201407	4204	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s a particularly dangerous circumstance because, if we don’t go when the market expects us to go, there’s a real risk of a loss of credibility and an unhinging of inflation expectations, and that could be very damaging.	23	2
201407	4205	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But that’s not the situation that we’re in.	23	2
201407	4206	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re in the opposite situation, in which we think we might go earlier than the market thinks, and that’s less risky in the sense that there is less risk of it leading to a real loss of credibility for the FOMC in terms of its commitment to keeping inflation in check.	23	2
201407	4207	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes, there would be a credibility hit in the sense that we misled the markets, and, certainly, there would be some jolt to financial asset valuation.	23	2
201407	4208	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But at least the misalignment we have today is the less dangerous of the misalignments that can occur when market expectations and what we think are not lined up.	23	2
201407	4209	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, I think it’s important to dig a little deeper about why market participants are in a different place than we are.	23	2
201407	4210	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Is it because they don’t understand our reaction function, or is it because they just have a different forecast in terms of how the economy will evolve?	23	2
201407	4211	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s interesting that, when you look at the Tealbook unemployment-rate projection and you compare that with the primary dealer survey unemployment-rate projection, you see a pretty wide gap.	23	2
201407	4212	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	In 2016, the Tealbook is at 4.7 percent, and market expectations are at 5.4 percent.	23	2
201407	4213	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, if that’s the reason for the disagreement about the timing of liftoff and the trajectory of interest rates, that’s not really something that we should be that concerned about, because one of those forecasts is going to be more right than the other and that gap will tend to close on its own as it becomes more clear whether the Tealbook forecast is the right forecast or the primary dealer forecast is the right forecast.	23	2
201407	4214	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So it’s really important to think about, what’s the reason for the disagreement?	23	2
201407	4215	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Is it a disagreement about the trajectory of the economy, or is it a disagreement due to a lack of understanding of our reaction function?	23	2
201407	4216	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If it’s a lack of understanding of our reaction function, that’s a much more serious problem.	23	2
201407	4217	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of alternative B, I do think it does exactly what we want to accomplish at this meeting.	23	2
201407	4218	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It acknowledges the improvement in the labor market, it acknowledges the fact that the risks of inflation getting stuck far below our 2 percent objective have lessened, and those are the changes made in paragraphs 1 and 2.	23	2
201407	4219	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But it doesn’t jump yet to drawing implications for those changes in terms of what’s actually going to happen in the later paragraphs with respect to monetary policy.	23	2
201407	4220	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It says we acknowledge what’s happened.	23	2
201407	4221	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re on watch, but we’re not quite ready to actually put that into action in terms of monetary policy, and I think that’s about right.	23	2
201407	4222	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If the next two employment reports and the data are consistent with 3 percent growth and 200-thousand-plus payroll gains in the two months, then, in September, you’d want to start to make changes to those latter paragraphs about the monetary policy pieces.	23	2
201407	4223	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That would be the second step that would affect the change in market expectations that’s appropriate.	23	2
201407	4224	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	There will be a market reaction to the statement today.	23	2
201407	4225	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think they will take it as our being more optimistic about the outlook and less concerned about inflation.	23	2
201407	4226	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So I believe that the market will take some signal from this.	23	2
201407	4227	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But the fact that we’re not changing the later paragraphs means the market reaction will probably be pretty mild.	23	2
201407	4228	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the language issues, the big debate around the table seems to be about the word “significant” in paragraph 1.	23	2
201407	4229	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	My own view is that that word should stay in, and I think it should stay in for a couple of reasons.	23	2
201407	4230	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The first reason it should stay in is that that’s the language that the Chair used in her testimony.	23	2
201407	4231	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So people are going to be comparing the two, and, if it comes out, people are going to view that as quite meaningful.	23	2
201407	4232	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The second reason it should stay in is, it’s actually accurate.	23	2
201407	4233	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If you read not just that sentence, but also the changes that are made to paragraph 1 in its entirety, we’re basically saying that the unemployment rate is no longer elevated, in our view.	23	2
201407	4234	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re acknowledging that it’s declined further, and we’re then qualifying that slightly by saying that, despite those things, which are good developments, we still think there’s “significant underutilization of labor resources.”	23	2
201407	4235	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If you read the statement as, we’re just saying there’s “significant underutilization of labor resources,” and that was the main point of the paragraph, then it could be up for debate.	23	2
201407	4236	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But the reality is, we’re using that sentence to qualify the other changes that we’ve made in that first paragraph.	23	2
201407	4237	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, to me, “significant” means meaningful, and the question I would have on the table is, do we think that the underutilization of labor resources that we have today is meaningful?	23	2
201407	4238	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, we almost certainly think that, because, if we didn’t think that, we’d probably be lifting off already.	23	2
201407	4239	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So it seems to me that “significant underutilization of labor resources” is exactly, completely paired with the policy that we’re actually pursuing.	23	2
201407	4240	2014-07-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	23	2
201407	4241	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23	2
201407	4242	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Well, thanks to everybody.	23	2
201407	4243	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	The comments on policy have been very thoughtful, and I think we’re actually in considerable agreement about where we’re heading.	23	2
201407	4244	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I believe everybody recognizes that we’re on a path here where, if the data continue to come in strong and to create a series of positive surprises, we’re likely going to be moving up sooner than we previously anticipated, and that we will have to signal our intention to do that in a series of steps.	23	2
201407	4245	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I am more than prepared to go in that direction if the data continue as they have been.	23	2
201407	4246	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	So, to my mind, the questions with respect to language concern the sequence of steps that so many of you have talked about and what’s the right move for today.	23	2
201407	4247	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	It’s always hard to know what the market reaction is going to be to language.	23	2
201407	4248	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I think, as many of you have indicated, the change in the characterization of the inflation outlook is going to be noted quite carefully and taken as a signal of a somewhat “hawkier” stance.	23	2
201407	4249	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I don’t know what markets will think of the word “significant,” but my own interpretation was that it was exactly in line with what the Vice Chairman indicated—that it means “appreciable” or “meaningful,” and that the overall thrust of that paragraph is, we’re no longer saying the unemployment rate is elevated.	23	2
201407	4250	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	We’re saying that not only has the unemployment rate declined, but we think labor market indicators quite generally show that there’s also been improvement in the labor market, and we’ve moved away from “elevated.”	23	2
201407	4251	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	But I do think it’s accurate to say that the degree of underutilization is significant.	23	2
201407	4252	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Obviously, I’ve heard many of you who would be inclined to change the word “significant.”	23	2
201407	4253	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Also, I’ve heard a considerable number of you who think that it’s the right word for today.	23	2
201407	4254	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	My preference would be to stick with “significant,” and I suppose this point that this is exactly the language that, just over a week ago, I uttered in testimony and was in our Monetary Policy Report inclines me to keep it.	23	2
201407	4255	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Because of how markets interpret these things, to remove that word would be taken as a serious signal.	23	2
201407	4256	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	But September—obviously, we will have to reconsider that characterization of the labor market if we continue to see very strong labor reports.	23	2
201407	4257	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	And I agree with those of you who have talked about the forward guidance and the eventual need for that to change.	23	2
201407	4258	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I think March is very much on the table as a time when we might begin to tighten.	23	2
201407	4259	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	I am concerned about the gap between market expectations and, perhaps, our own evolving expectations.	23	2
201407	4260	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	Obviously, the SEP will show, if things continue this way, meaningful changes in September, and I am completely open to changing the language.	23	2
201407	4261	2014-07-30	meeting	YELLEN	But I would like to do so in as smooth a way as possible and in a series of steps, if we can.	23	2
