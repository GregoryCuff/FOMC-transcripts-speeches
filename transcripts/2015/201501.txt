201501	0	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everyone.	5	5
201501	1	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	As you may have noted, we have a very full agenda for this meeting.	5	5
201501	2	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	In addition to quite a bit of normal beginning-of-the-year organizational business, I’m hoping for a thorough discussion of several important topics relating to normalization that should serve to prepare us for decisions we may face in the months ahead.	5	5
201501	3	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	But before we turn to that agenda, I’d like to welcome Presidents Evans, Lacker, Lockhart, and Williams back to the Committee and note that this is the last FOMC meeting for both Presidents Fisher and Plosser.	5	5
201501	4	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Tomorrow, as you know, we will have a farewell luncheon in honor of President Plosser, and, in the spring, we’ll have a farewell meal for President Fisher.	5	5
201501	5	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll have a chance to thank each of them for their service then.	5	5
201501	6	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	But I’d like to take this opportunity to briefly thank them here as well.	5	5
201501	7	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher started attending FOMC meetings in 2005 and has since participated in 78 regular meetings.	5	5
201501	8	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	He brought to this table unique perspectives based on decades of experience as a market participant and as a senior government official.	5	5
201501	9	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	He regularly reported at this table economic insights reflecting information gleaned from his deep set of contacts across the country and the globe, and few of us will ever forget his imaginative metaphors.	5	5
201501	10	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	5	5
201501	11	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser began attending FOMC meetings in 2006 and has since participated in 69 regular meetings.	5	5
201501	12	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	He brought with him rich academic experience in macroeconomic research, including a long list of publications covering a wide range of topics.	5	5
201501	13	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	With this deep experience paired with a sharp intellect, he regularly challenged this group to think rigorously and communicate clearly.	5	5
201501	14	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Both President Fisher and President Plosser have helped steer this Committee and the American economy through some of the most challenging and tumultuous times in several generations.	5	5
201501	15	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Richard and Charlie, let me say that we thank you for your service and want you to know that you will be missed.	5	5
201501	16	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you.	5	5
201501	17	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Thank you.	5	5
201501	18	2015-01-28	meeting		[Applause]	5	5
201501	19	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Now let’s turn to our first agenda item, which is the election of Committee officers.	3	3
201501	20	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Following long-established precedent, I’m going to ask Governor Fischer to handle the nominations of Chair and Vice Chair.	3	3
201501	21	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	3	3
201501	22	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I’ll be calling for two sets of nominations and votes.	3	3
201501	23	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	First, I’d like to ask for a nomination for Committee Chair.	3	3
201501	24	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I nominate Janet Yellen.	3	3
201501	25	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Is there a second?	3	3
201501	26	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I second that nomination.	3	3
201501	27	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Any other nominations or discussion?	3	3
201501	28	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We should try it out.	3	3
201501	29	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	3	3
201501	30	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Without objection.	3	3
201501	31	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Now I’d like to ask for a nomination for the position of Committee Vice Chair.	3	3
201501	32	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I nominate Bill Dudley.	3	3
201501	33	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Is there a second?	3	3
201501	34	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I second that nomination.	3	3
201501	35	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Any other nominations or discussion?	3	3
201501	36	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	[No response]	3	3
201501	37	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Without objection.	3	3
201501	38	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Madam Chair.	3	3
201501	39	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, Governor Fischer.	3	3
201501	40	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Now let’s turn to the election of staff officers.	3	3
201501	41	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Matt, I’d like to ask you to read the list.	3	3
201501	42	2015-01-28	meeting	LUECKE	For Secretary and Economist, Thomas Laubach; Deputy Secretary, Matthew Luecke; Assistant Secretaries, David Skidmore, effective February 2, 2015, and Michelle Smith; General Counsel, Scott Alvarez; Deputy General Counsel, Thomas Baxter; Assistant General Counsel, Richard Ashton; Economist, Steve Kamin; Economist, David Wilcox; Associate Economists from the Board, Thomas Connors, Eric Engen, Michael Leahy, William Nelson, and William Wascher; and Associate Economists from the Banks, Jonathan McCarthy, Daniel Sullivan, John Weinberg, David Altig, and Glen Rudebusch.	3	3
201501	43	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Any comments?	3	3
201501	44	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	3	3
201501	45	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	3	3
201501	46	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	3	3
201501	47	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	3	3
201501	48	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Next, we need to select a Reserve Bank to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account, and I understand that New York is again willing to serve.	3	3
201501	49	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any other nominations or comments?	3	3
201501	50	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	3	3
201501	51	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	3	3
201501	52	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	3	3
201501	53	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Now I’d like to call on Vice Chairman Dudley to nominate individuals to serve as manager and deputy manager of the System Open Market Account.	3	3
201501	54	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I nominate Simon Potter as manager, and Lorie Logan as deputy manager, of the System Open Market Account.	3	3
201501	55	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	3	3
201501	56	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	3	3
201501	57	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Next, we’re up to item 4, “Proposed Revisions to the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations,” and I’d like to call on Simon to introduce this item.	41	4
201501	58	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	41	4
201501	59	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	As part of the annual review of the Committee’s authorizations for domestic open market operations and foreign currency transactions, and as discussed in the memo titled “Request for Votes on Authorization for Desk Operations” that you received prior to the meeting, the Desk recommends approving the authorization with a few changes.	41	4
201501	60	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	In addition to these proposed changes, I’d like to highlight one additional item for the Committee’s consideration: In January 2009, the Committee suspended the Guidelines for the Conduct of System Open Market Operations in Federal-Agency Issues in light of the Federal Reserve’s programs to purchase agency debt and agency MBS.	41	4
201501	61	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The SOMA contains a significant amount of agency debt and agency MBS, and it continues to conduct transactions in agency MBS as part of the reinvestment policy adopted by the Committee.	41	4
201501	62	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Consequently, I recommend a continued suspension of these guidelines.	41	4
201501	63	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	No Committee vote is needed to continue the suspension.	41	4
201501	64	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	With respect to the domestic authorization, we recommend two sets of changes.	41	4
201501	65	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	In the first set of changes, FRBNY and Board staff collaborated on proposed updates to the text and structure of the document, with the aim of simplifying the language so that it can be more easily understood by the public.	41	4
201501	66	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	None of these changes affect the authority delegated or the policies outlined in the domestic authorization.	41	4
201501	67	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	In the second, more substantive set of changes, we recommend a set of revisions that, if approved, will affect some of the authority outlined in the domestic authorization.	41	4
201501	68	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Before discussing the changes that were highlighted in my memo, distributed last week, I’d like to go over a change in the authorization that I failed to highlight, related to the removal of explicit references to types of counterparties.	41	4
201501	69	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	I apologize for the omission of this change in the memo and thank the staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis for alerting me to the lack of explanation of the change.	41	4
201501	70	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	In the existing domestic authorization, outright transactions are authorized with “securities dealers,” while the term “dealer” is used to describe authorized counterparty types for the securities lending program and customer transactions conducted via the FRBNY account.	41	4
201501	71	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	It is not clear what the distinction should be between these counterparty types and whether it is important in determining who should be authorized to transact with the Desk.	41	4
201501	72	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	In particular, the primary dealer policy of the New York Fed explicitly allows for both SEC-registered broker-dealers and federally regulated banks to be counterparties.	41	4
201501	73	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Meanwhile, the authorization for temporary open market operations makes no mention of counterparties at all.	41	4
201501	74	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The existing language is inconsistent and makes distinctions between counterparty types that may no longer be relevant.	41	4
201501	75	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	To address this, we removed references to counterparties altogether.	41	4
201501	76	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Although this change could theoretically broaden the Desk’s ability to choose a wider range of counterparties, in practice the definition of a “dealer” is so broad that the existing language is not a constraint.	41	4
201501	77	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Further, the proposed change would not affect our existing practice, and, even under the proposed streamlined language, the Desk would not add or remove counterparty types or alter the current framework for managing counterparties without seeking FOMC approval.	41	4
201501	78	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	This change was not highlighted in the memo because it was seen as a change intended to deal with inconsistent language.	41	4
201501	79	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	However, the recent discussions of counterparties in Desk operations imply that this should have been highlighted as a substantive change.	41	4
201501	80	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	My apologies, again, for not including it in the memo.	41	4
201501	81	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	If you prefer, we can retain the existing references to counterparties.	41	4
201501	82	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Please see the exhibit in your handout titled “Material for Briefing on Proposed Revisions to the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations,” which compares the existing language on the left panel and the proposed language on the right panel.	41	4
201501	83	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The proposed language contains three insertions in bracketed blue text that can be made to retain the existing authority on counterparties; please see paragraphs 1, 3, and 4.	41	4
201501	84	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Returning to the four changes described in the memo, the first three of these changes are related to the desire to clarify existing practice.	41	4
201501	85	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The fourth change is intended to update the language to account for the current operating model in which there is a large total amount of commercial bank reserves.	41	4
201501	86	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The first change introduces the term “Selected Bank.”	41	4
201501	87	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	This conforms to a change proposed for all FOMC organizational documents and it amounts to prudent planning to simplify the transfer of authority from the FRBNY to another Federal Reserve Bank selected by the Committee in the event of a significant contingency.	41	4
201501	88	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The second change removes paragraph 3, which authorizes the Selected Bank to transact in agency MBS through agents such as asset managers.	41	4
201501	89	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	As the Desk now conducts all trading in agency MBS internally, it no longer requires this authority.	41	4
201501	90	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The third proposed change defines the types of collateral accepted in the Desk’s securities lending operation.	41	4
201501	91	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The existing language does not make any such specification.	41	4
201501	92	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The new language specifies that, for a loan of US Treasury securities, counterparties can pledge only US Treasury securities or cash; for a loan of US agency securities, counterparties can pledge US agency securities, US Treasury securities, or cash.	41	4
201501	93	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	This clarifies that the collateral pledged must be of equal or superior quality to the collateral borrowed.	41	4
201501	94	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Note that while the Selected Bank would now have the authority to conduct securities lending against cash collateral on a regular basis, it would not exercise this authority beyond current practice without the prior approval of the FOMC.	41	4
201501	95	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Currently, the Desk’s securities lending program accepts only US Treasury securities as collateral, although cash is accepted on an intraday basis as part of the settlement process.	41	4
201501	96	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Cash is accepted overnight only in instances in which a counterparty fails to deliver a security.	41	4
201501	97	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The fourth change to the domestic authorization updates the Chair’s authority in “exceptional circumstances.”	41	4
201501	98	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The existing authorization allows the Chair of the Committee to “adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the degree of pressure on reserve positions and hence the intended federal funds rate.”	41	4
201501	99	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	When the language in this existing paragraph was introduced 15 years ago, the memo proposing the language expressed a desire for the Chair to have the authority to alter the stance of policy in exceptional circumstances.	41	4
201501	100	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	However, the precise language incorporated into the domestic authorization in 2000 reflected the approach to policy implementation at the time.	41	4
201501	101	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Because adjustments to the monetary policy stance may now be implemented in a number of ways, we propose that the language be updated to take this into account.	41	4
201501	102	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	In particular, we propose that the directive provide that the Chair can “adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the stance of monetary policy.”	41	4
201501	103	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The proposed language would still require that the Chair make decisions in the context of the stance of policy at the most recent meeting and consult with the Committee in advance whenever feasible.	41	4
201501	104	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Note that the side-by-side comparison we sent in the memo used “if feasible” instead of “whenever feasible.”	41	4
201501	105	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	This is corrected in the handout in front of you.	41	4
201501	106	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Under modern communications technology, we’d expect that such consultation would nearly always be feasible.	41	4
201501	107	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Before the Chairman requests a vote on the domestic authorization, we would be happy to answer any questions on the proposed changes.	41	4
201501	108	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions or comments?	41	4
201501	109	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	41	4
201501	110	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	41	4
201501	111	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I’d like to comment on the counterparty matter that Simon raised at the beginning of his remarks, as part of our conversation yesterday about this.	41	4
201501	112	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Clearly, the situation we had in the previous authorization wasn’t ideal.	41	4
201501	113	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	The term “dealer” is there for historical reasons.	41	4
201501	114	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	It’s not precisely defined.	41	4
201501	115	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	It has a common-sense English language meaning, however, that I think is plausibly restrictive in the sense that there are some counterparties you could imagine that wouldn’t qualify as dealers in the plain-English version of the meaning of the word.	41	4
201501	116	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	So it seemed, at first blush, to be removing an important constraint on the Desk.	41	4
201501	117	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I totally trust the Desk not to expand the typical counterparties of open market operations and of repo and securities lending operations without consulting the Committee.	41	4
201501	118	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I totally get that.	41	4
201501	119	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	But my concern is that making this change with such short notice doesn’t seem advisable.	41	4
201501	120	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	So I’d advocate that we do include the bracketed items.	41	4
201501	121	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	The Committee needs a chance to understand what the implications are.	41	4
201501	122	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	There’s a study under way of the entire counterparty framework, and rationalizing how the authorization and other documentary devices of the Committee deal with counterparties would be a good thing.	41	4
201501	123	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	But we should probably await that before we make any substantive change.	41	4
201501	124	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	This is a substantive change that will appear to the public.	41	4
201501	125	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	While it’s not likely to be plastered over the front pages of many newspapers, there is a set of market participants who will take notice, wonder what this implies, and perhaps spend time speculating about what this implies about the Committee’s intentions for the capability of expanding counterparties of the Desk’s operations in the future.	41	4
201501	126	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	So until we actually get through more work to understand this— and in view of the very short amount of time the Committee has had to digest these documents that were posted Friday evening—I’d urge that we retain the status quo by including the bracketed phrasing in the proposed directive.	41	4
201501	127	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	And I should mention that I fully support all of the other changes in the directive.	41	4
201501	128	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	To clarify one thing with regard to temporary open market operations, there’s no reference to counterparties in the current authorization, and that would remain if we transported that language over.	41	4
201501	129	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Exactly.	41	4
201501	130	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I misspoke.	41	4
201501	131	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let me ask if there are other comments on the matter that President Lacker has raised here.	41	4
201501	132	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	41	4
201501	133	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	41	4
201501	134	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I won’t go back over the same ground that President Lacker covered.	41	4
201501	135	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll just say that I echo what he had to say.	41	4
201501	136	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Whenever we change language of this kind, we should have an opportunity to have careful deliberation over it, and so I would prefer to keep the status quo for that reason.	41	4
201501	137	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Similarly, I don’t know if I would counsel this at this meeting, but I think that, with the technological changes that have occurred in the past 15 years, it’s reasonable for the Committee to rethink whether there are any situations in which it would not be feasible for the Committee members to be called on to decide on a monetary policy issue.	41	4
201501	138	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Is there really any reason left to give those extraordinary powers to the Chair?	41	4
201501	139	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m not suggesting that at this meeting, but I would advise the Committee to have that issue on the table in a sufficiently timely fashion for next year.	41	4
201501	140	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think the thought was a true emergency—an attack on the United States or something like that.	41	4
201501	141	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It would be useful to have a discussion of what the scenarios are that we’re thinking about.	41	4
201501	142	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Any other comments on the authorization?	41	4
201501	143	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	41	4
201501	144	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Well, we’ve had a proposal, and I take it that it’s acceptable to the Desk to include the language that’s in blue and currently bracketed.	41	4
201501	145	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Two members of the Committee have spoken in favor of that.	41	4
201501	146	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let me ask everybody else, how many people—I’d like a show of hands—would like to include the blue bracketed language?	41	4
201501	147	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Just one interjection.	41	4
201501	148	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	We have a choice on page 4, right?	41	4
201501	149	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	41	4
201501	150	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	You would choose “dealers” if you wanted to keep the existing language.	41	4
201501	151	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	You would choose “market counterparties” if you wanted to modernize the authorization fully.	41	4
201501	152	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	What is in your recommendation?	41	4
201501	153	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	If you choose “market counterparties,” you don’t accept any of the other insertions.	41	4
201501	154	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	If you accept the first two insertions, you would choose “dealers.”	41	4
201501	155	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I see.	41	4
201501	156	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we’re saying “dealers,” then, in that case.	41	4
201501	157	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	41	4
201501	158	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I agree.	41	4
201501	159	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	“Dealers” is the status quo.	41	4
201501	160	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I just wanted to clarify that.	41	4
201501	161	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks.	41	4
201501	162	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	41	4
201501	163	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	How many people would like to include the blue bracketed language?	41	4
201501	164	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	41	4
201501	165	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	41	4
201501	166	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And is anyone opposed to keeping it for the time being?	41	4
201501	167	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	41	4
201501	168	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	41	4
201501	169	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I’m assuming, then, that we will keep the blue language.	41	4
201501	170	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any objections to approval of this?	41	4
201501	171	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	41	4
201501	172	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	41	4
201501	173	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Then let’s consider this approved.	41	4
201501	174	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	We’re ready to move on to item 5, which is a set of three related authorizations pertaining to foreign currency operations.	41	4
201501	175	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Again, I’d like to ask Simon to introduce this item.	41	4
201501	176	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	41	4
201501	177	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	We also recommend that the Committee approve the foreign authorization with two amendments.	41	4
201501	178	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The first change, as with the domestic authorization, is to adopt the “Selected Bank” language.	41	4
201501	179	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The second change reflects the ongoing challenges we face in managing the euro foreign exchange reserves portfolio in the current interest rate environment.	41	4
201501	180	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	As yields on European sovereign debt and money market instruments have fallen in recent months, we’ve increased somewhat the duration of the euro portfolio, and the Desk has, at times, faced difficulty finding short-term, positive-yielding investments.	41	4
201501	181	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Consequently, we propose increasing the maximum duration of the foreign currency portfolio from 18 months to 24 months, as discussed at the December FOMC meeting.	41	4
201501	182	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Increasing this limit will give us more flexibility to manage the portfolio.	41	4
201501	183	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Note that approval of these documents includes approval of the System’s warehousing agreement with the Treasury.	41	4
201501	184	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	As has been the case since February 5, 1997, the limit on warehousing is set at $5 billion.	41	4
201501	185	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	There are currently no outstanding balances.	41	4
201501	186	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions or comments?	41	4
201501	187	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	41	4
201501	188	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	We’re considering now the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive.	41	4
201501	189	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair, I will respectfully dissent once again from both of these, as I have every three years in the past and as my predecessor had going back to the 1990s.	41	4
201501	190	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Very briefly, the purpose of these facilities is to facilitate foreign exchange interventions undertaken at the behest of the US Treasury.	41	4
201501	191	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Such intervention is ineffective if it does not signal monetary policy shifts.	41	4
201501	192	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	If it does signal a shift in monetary policy, then it essentially compromises our independence.	41	4
201501	193	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Foreign exchange intervention is virtually nonexistent now.	41	4
201501	194	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I think we should take steps to wind down the infrastructure associated with it.	41	4
201501	195	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	In the meantime, though, I will respectfully dissent from the foreign currency authorization directives.	41	4
201501	196	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	41	4
201501	197	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Are there other comments or questions?	41	4
201501	198	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	41	4
201501	199	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	41	4
201501	200	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Hearing none, what I’d like to do is, we need votes on these, and I would like to take them separately to record separate votes.	41	4
201501	201	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	These are votes of Committee members.	41	4
201501	202	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	First, let’s start with the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations.	41	4
201501	203	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	All in favor?	41	4
201501	204	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[Chorus of ayes]	41	4
201501	205	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Any opposed?	41	4
201501	206	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	41	4
201501	207	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Second, the Foreign Currency Directive.	41	4
201501	208	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	All in favor?	41	4
201501	209	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[Chorus of ayes]	41	4
201501	210	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Any opposed?	41	4
201501	211	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Opposed.	41	4
201501	212	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations.	41	4
201501	213	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	All in favor?	41	4
201501	214	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[Chorus of ayes]	41	4
201501	215	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Any opposed?	41	4
201501	216	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	41	4
201501	217	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	All right.	41	4
201501	218	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	You got me on board on that one, given the other choice.	41	4
201501	219	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Are you sure you read that carefully enough?	41	4
201501	220	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	41	4
201501	221	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	41	4
201501	222	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Now, our next item pertains to a range of Committee documents.	44	4
201501	223	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	A staff memo distributed Friday proposed several changes to the program for information security that are aimed at largely exempting Bank economic information from FOMC classification and increasing the number of SDS users.	44	4
201501	224	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The memo also proposed some fairly technical changes that substitute the words “Selected Bank” for “Federal Reserve Bank of New York” and serve to standardize the language used to refer to the Committee.	44	4
201501	225	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Does anyone have a comment or question?	44	4
201501	226	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	These are intended to be uncontroversial.	44	4
201501	227	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	At least two people here haven’t read the memo and have a sense they didn’t receive it, but maybe they’re wrong.	44	4
201501	228	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	There’s been a blizzard of material coming to us, and maybe we overlooked it.	44	4
201501	229	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	But I don’t know what those changes are.	44	4
201501	230	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I got two pages with regard to the first item here—the proposed revisions to the FOMC Rules of Organization.	44	4
201501	231	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	That one I got.	44	4
201501	232	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Well, there’s a gigantic memo here that was posted on Friday and includes all of these changes.	44	4
201501	233	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Are you suggesting we not vote on this?	44	4
201501	234	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I don’t know what to do.	44	4
201501	235	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I’ve never seen it.	44	4
201501	236	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	And, as you flip through it, it’s got a lot of blue in it.	44	4
201501	237	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Well, as I explained, it’s meant to be a set of uncontroversial changes.	44	4
201501	238	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The only substantive thing is increasing the number of SDS users and clarifying that material produced by Reserve Banks is not FOMC-classified material.	44	4
201501	239	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	When you look through it, most of the blue is the authorization changes.	44	4
201501	240	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	We’ve already gone through those.	44	4
201501	241	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	There tend to be smaller changes in the rest of the organizational documents.	44	4
201501	242	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I was particularly interested in the FOMC Policy on External Communications of Committee Participants, and I am not completely familiar with the rules.	44	4
201501	243	2015-01-28	meeting	LUECKE	The only change to that document is the standardizing on the word “Committee” in place of “FOMC” or “Federal Open Market Committee” and the addition of a footnote that describes what “FOMC participants” means.	44	4
201501	244	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I’m willing for the vote to go ahead, but I want to say that one tries, but when the computer doesn’t open documents at home and something is sent late on Friday, and things like that, it’s very hard to keep up.	44	4
201501	245	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Would you like to wait until tomorrow to have a chance to look this over tonight, and we’ll vote on it tomorrow morning?	44	4
201501	246	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I’m willing to go ahead, but I will reserve the right to discuss these issues further with you.	44	4
201501	247	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	44	4
201501	248	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo, did you want to weigh in on this?	44	4
201501	249	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	As the changes have just been described, they seem fine, but I wanted to second Stan’s observation on the blizzard of memos coming in on SDS late Friday night.	44	4
201501	250	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think it’s reasonable, frankly, to send so many things at more or less the last minute when people are trying to prepare their remarks for the meeting.	44	4
201501	251	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	So I would hope there would be some way that things could come in with enough time for those of us on the Board, at least, to be able to absorb everything.	44	4
201501	252	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	But that reservation doesn’t go to the merits of this particular issue—which I’m fine with.	44	4
201501	253	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	44	4
201501	254	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	As a molting hawk, may I add, from a Bank president’s standpoint, that we are overwhelmed over the weekends with materials that were received as late as late Friday night.	44	4
201501	255	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	So, again, the staff does an incredible job, they give us so much to consider, and I admire them enormously, but it would be really helpful if we had maybe one or two more days to look at so many of these.	44	4
201501	256	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	These are all important matters, and so I will take a president’s stance and second what has been said by the two Governors.	44	4
201501	257	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	This is a polite suggestion.	44	4
201501	258	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	44	4
201501	259	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Madam Chair, I want to suggest one thing about these votes.	44	4
201501	260	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	As I understand it, we’re reauthorizing what has been standing practice for the Committee, because we’re reorganizing at this meeting.	44	4
201501	261	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Correct.	44	4
201501	262	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	That’s right.	44	4
201501	263	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	These are not new documents.	44	4
201501	264	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	So we’re reestablishing what already was in effect in December, with minor changes.	44	4
201501	265	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	On the communications memo, for instance, we had a separate discussion as a Committee, and a whole elaborate process, that put that into place, if I recall correctly.	44	4
201501	266	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	That’s correct.	44	4
201501	267	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	We can certainly review that at any point during the life of this particular incarnation of the Committee, and we can change that at any time.	44	4
201501	268	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	But, as I understand these votes, these are mostly to ratify what we’ve been doing in the past.	44	4
201501	269	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	That’s correct.	44	4
201501	270	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	These are documents that, even in the case of the external communications policy, have been in place now for a large number of years, and we’re reauthorizing them, which we always do at our January meeting, with minor changes.	44	4
201501	271	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	But I take the point about the timing and the blizzard of materials.	44	4
201501	272	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The staff is pretty overwhelmed in having to produce this material.	44	4
201501	273	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think it’s worthwhile for them to hear that we feel—and I feel the same way—that it comes to us as a blizzard.	44	4
201501	274	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	But I also hope you’ll recognize the strains that are on the staff in trying to produce this gigantic amount of material for our consideration.	44	4
201501	275	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	44	4
201501	276	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	44	4
201501	277	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Maybe I’m missing the description of what was in these changes.	44	4
201501	278	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought that the changes to the Program for Security of FOMC Information, while I welcome them, are perhaps a little more substantive than was outlined, in the sense that I believe it’s going to allow participants to be able to talk about their forecasts more openly than in the past—or maybe I misunderstood the sense of that language change.	44	4
201501	279	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	I think our intention there was to be clear that, for example, a Reserve Bank president can go out and talk about his or her outlook for the economy, and that Reserve Banks can, as they already have been, post their Reserve Bank’s projections for the economy.	44	4
201501	280	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	It would still not be appropriate, under the security rules that we’ve written down, for you to give a speech and say, “Here is what I submitted to the SEP.”	44	4
201501	281	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	But we have been comfortable for some time with Reserve Bank presidents going out and giving outlook speeches in which they talk about their sense of the outlook, why it is what it is, and what they think is going to happen.	44	4
201501	282	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	We have also been comfortable with Reserve Banks posting information about their forecasts—the staff forecast or even, implicitly at least, their president’s forecast—on their websites, and so this was acknowledging that.	44	4
201501	283	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	I want to be clear that some of the Banks may want to have some of this information subject to Bank security rules.	44	4
201501	284	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	These are the FOMC’s security rules, and the FOMC’s security rules have basically been rewritten to acknowledge the situation that I think we’re in.	44	4
201501	285	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks, Bill.	44	4
201501	286	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any further questions?	44	4
201501	287	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Just a clarification.	44	4
201501	288	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Would this mean that an individual president, for example, couldn’t go out and say which dot was his or hers?	44	4
201501	289	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Is that what this says?	44	4
201501	290	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	I think that’s correct, because it still says that what you submit to the SEP is FOMC information.	44	4
201501	291	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	It’s a fairly substantive change, then, in how we’re going to approach this.	44	4
201501	292	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	It actually isn’t.	44	4
201501	293	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	That’s been true—that was true with the old rules.	44	4
201501	294	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	We’re just maintaining that.	44	4
201501	295	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	But we’re saying that you could go out and talk more broadly about your sense of the outlook, what the economy looks like, and what your policy expectations or desires would be, but you should not say, “And here are the specific numbers that I submitted to the SEP.”	44	4
201501	296	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	That’s where we drew the line.	44	4
201501	297	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	Admittedly, it’s slightly arbitrary, but it seemed to us that once you submit that to the SEP, then it really is FOMC information—it’s being distributed at meetings, and so on.	44	4
201501	298	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	Whereas, if it’s just your forecast, then you can go out and talk about it.	44	4
201501	299	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	44	4
201501	300	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	So we can say that our forecast for four-quarter GDP is X percent, but we can’t say that we submitted that as part of our SEP.	44	4
201501	301	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	We can say that our answer to the question of what the funds rate would be at the end of 2015 is Y percent, but we can’t say that we submitted that to the SEP.	44	4
201501	302	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	If you wanted to be that specific, I guess so.	44	4
201501	303	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	It’s a bit Orwellian.	44	4
201501	304	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	44	4
201501	305	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	We’re trying to draw a line here, and, at the edge, it’s bound to be a little bit fuzzy.	44	4
201501	306	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I’m not driven by that ambiguity to question the policy regarding what we say in public.	44	4
201501	307	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I’m driven to think about why so much of the SEP is confidential.	44	4
201501	308	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	And maybe that’s what deserves some reconsideration.	44	4
201501	309	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	The Committee has talked about that at some length in the past, and the communications subcommittee may well take that up again.	44	4
201501	310	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	But, so far at least, the Committee has not wanted to release the matrix, with or without names.	44	4
201501	311	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Okay.	44	4
201501	312	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Can I follow up on what President Lacker was saying?	44	4
201501	313	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Because I’m a little confused about this, too.	44	4
201501	314	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	So you could put out your GDP projection, and you could put out your inflation projection, but you couldn’t say, “And the policy rate path that I’m thinking is appropriate to get those—”	44	4
201501	315	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	No, you can put out that, too.	44	4
201501	316	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	You could publish your whole submission.	44	4
201501	317	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	You can’t say it’s your submission.	44	4
201501	318	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes, exactly.	44	4
201501	319	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	They have to make the inference that it’s your submission.	44	4
201501	320	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	You can’t say it’s your submission.	44	4
201501	321	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s the subtle difference.	44	4
201501	322	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Okay.	44	4
201501	323	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I guess I was reading that as, you couldn’t take the document that you submit, because it’s an FOMC document, and publish that.	44	4
201501	324	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	But you could talk about everything that’s in there.	44	4
201501	325	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	You just can’t say it’s your submission, but you can say all of the information in it because it came from your head.	44	4
201501	326	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Okay.	44	4
201501	327	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Got it.	44	4
201501	328	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Thank you.	44	4
201501	329	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	May I ask a question, Madam Chair?	44	4
201501	330	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I recall at least two people giving us their numbers in these meetings.	44	4
201501	331	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Were they in the minutes?	44	4
201501	332	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	No.	44	4
201501	333	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	They will appear publicly in the transcript when it is released after five years.	44	4
201501	334	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Which is five years early.	44	4
201501	335	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	44	4
201501	336	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	44	4
201501	337	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Further comments or questions?	44	4
201501	338	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	44	4
201501	339	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	44	4
201501	340	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	So I would suggest we take a single vote on this whole collection of changes.	44	4
201501	341	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any objections to approving these documents?	44	4
201501	342	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	44	4
201501	343	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	44	4
201501	344	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Then without objection.	44	4
201501	345	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Now we’re going to move on to item 7, which is to approve our Statement on Longer- Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.	92	9
201501	346	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	As you all know, under the leadership of the subcommittee on communications, we’ve made an effort in recent months to investigate possible enhancements to the consensus statement.	92	9
201501	347	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Although we ultimately decided not to make any substantive changes at this particular time, I believe that this exercise was constructive, and I continue to view the consensus statement as a living document that will evolve over time.	92	9
201501	348	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Some of the options we discussed—for example, making explicit the symmetry of our inflation objective—may well make their way into the statement in the future when economic conditions are closer to normal and there’s less risk of confusing the public with a change.	92	9
201501	349	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	We also agreed to continue our discussions about the role of financial stability in monetary policy.	92	9
201501	350	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I certainly hope we will continue to think hard about the statement and work together under the leadership of Governor Fischer and the subcommittee to enhance it over time.	92	9
201501	351	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Personally, I think the consensus statement has been an indispensable tool in articulating both our monetary policy goals and our strategy for attaining them.	92	9
201501	352	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I realize that aspects of the statement allow for a range of interpretations.	92	9
201501	353	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	That’s both a strength and a weakness.	92	9
201501	354	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	But let’s not forget that it took this Committee well over a decade to formulate a document that was capable of achieving very broad support, and its value derives importantly from the fact that it does command an overwhelming degree of support in the Committee.	92	9
201501	355	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The only change to the statement before you from the version endorsed last year is the update of the central tendency of the longer-run unemployment rate from the SEP.	92	9
201501	356	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	So before we take a vote, I’d like to ask if anyone would like to comment on the consensus statement.	92	9
201501	357	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201501	358	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	359	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll echo the sentiments you expressed in your remarks.	92	9
201501	360	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I support the consensus statement, but I also support continuing discussion and dialogue within the Committee about ways in which we could further strengthen and enhance it under the leadership of the subcommittee on communications.	92	9
201501	361	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The core of the consensus statement is that it’s been able to provide a numerical target for inflation of 2 percent.	92	9
201501	362	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As you’ve described before, Madam Chair, the communication of the specific target by the FOMC was a culmination—you just referred to a decade.	92	9
201501	363	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I seem to remember references to nearly two decades, actually, of hard work and debate by yourself and others around this table.	92	9
201501	364	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As the consensus statement suggests, this target serves to anchor the public’s expectations of nominal variables and thereby makes monetary policy more effective.	92	9
201501	365	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As you will hear over the next couple of days, though, unfortunately, I remain deeply concerned about signs of downside risks to the credibility of our inflation target.	92	9
201501	366	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	These credibility risks pose a considerable threat to all that we have achieved together in the consensus statement, and we need to do all that we can to ensure that those risks don’t actually transpire.	92	9
201501	367	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	368	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201501	369	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	92	9
201501	370	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	371	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	The consensus statement of the Committee’s longer-run strategy for monetary policy is an important guide for our policy deliberations and decisions.	92	9
201501	372	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	In public, I discuss our policy goals for maximum employment and price stability every time I speak, and I strongly support the approach described in this document.	92	9
201501	373	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I firmly believe that my policy recommendations to date have been in line with this consensus statement, and I’m confident every other affirming participant believes the same.	92	9
201501	374	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	In light of the low-inflation environment we face today, our discussions last fall, and the policy choices ahead, I feel the need to clarify two of my expectations that I have from reading this statement.	92	9
201501	375	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	This is just how I interpret the statement.	92	9
201501	376	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	First, I believe that our 2 percent objective means that we should actively eschew stalling out before we reach our 2 percent objective.	92	9
201501	377	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	The statement cites a single value for the inflation objective, not an acceptable range.	92	9
201501	378	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	But if we should debate that, then we should debate that.	92	9
201501	379	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Second, I believe that our objective is a symmetric one.	92	9
201501	380	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Periodically, I have heard people make comments along the lines that they’re not worried about low inflation today because it is very unlikely it will go below zero.	92	9
201501	381	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Let me just state the symmetric dual for this observation and ask if there’s any doubt that everyone would be bothered by it.	92	9
201501	382	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Let me put this in language that the minutes might reflect:  “Participant X stated that they were not worried about inflation being well above our objective, because it was very unlikely to go above 4 percent.”	92	9
201501	383	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	My view of our consensus statement is that both extreme conditions require a policy response to get inflation back to our 2 percent objective.	92	9
201501	384	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I view our consensus statement as consistent with these modest views I’ve expressed today, and I will vote to reaffirm the statement before us.	92	9
201501	385	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	386	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201501	387	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	92	9
201501	388	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	389	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I, too, would like to express support for the consensus statement.	92	9
201501	390	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	In my view, the consensus statement has provided real value to the Committee by laying out for the general public the Committee’s broad approach to carrying out its responsibilities under the law, particularly—if I can echo President Kocherlakota—in the 2 percent inflation objective.	92	9
201501	391	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I see it as constitutional in nature, and it therefore represents many compromises among the authors, some of which are obvious to the reading public from the language and some of which are less so.	92	9
201501	392	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	It’s not reasonable to expect it to resolve all differences.	92	9
201501	393	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	It is reasonable, in my view, to expect that, when arriving at a common statement by a large group of people dealing with conflicts and controversial issues, there will be unresolved issues and compromises.	92	9
201501	394	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	All of that could easily be said of the US Constitution, which has worked well over these years.	92	9
201501	395	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Madam Chair, not every aspect of the statement is precisely what I would have written down, but I’m glad to support it as representative of the Committee’s carefully considered thinking about the areas in which there is broad agreement.	92	9
201501	396	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Thank you.	92	9
201501	397	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201501	398	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	92	9
201501	399	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	400	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	As everyone knows, I’ve abstained in the past during the vote on this statement.	92	9
201501	401	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I have to say that this year, I thought about voting “no,” because there’s been a virtually explicit rejection this year of specifying that our inflation objective is symmetrical around the 2 percent target.	92	9
201501	402	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	As people may recall, originally, my concern was the failure to specify a symmetric loss function regarding the two goals in the dual mandate.	92	9
201501	403	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I still think that that demands attention.	92	9
201501	404	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	But I’ve found that the issue of symmetry of the inflation objective has obviously been particularly important over the past few years.	92	9
201501	405	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Yet, notwithstanding the fact that people purported to agree with that in discussion, there was an unwillingness to agree to an amendment of the statement, which I think would have been meaningful and would have provided not only some real guidance to the public, but also a foundation for the kind of analysis and discussion that we have in this Committee.	92	9
201501	406	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	So I guess I’m more convinced than ever that this statement reflects an agreement on language, without any genuine consensus on the aims of monetary policy, something that is of particular significance now, in the immediate past, and perhaps in the immediate future.	92	9
201501	407	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Here I build on some of what Charlie said, even though I come out differently.	92	9
201501	408	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Now, I’m not going to vote “no,” and—I’ll be very explicit—this is largely in deference to the Chair.	92	9
201501	409	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t want to make her life more difficult with a “no” vote, but I really came very close this time around.	92	9
201501	410	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	To be honest, I’m going to have to vote against this in the future if there are not additional changes.	92	9
201501	411	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Just one thing, Jay, on the point about the Constitution.	92	9
201501	412	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	The Constitution was agreed- upon language, which then has a different authority doing the interpretation—thereby not allowing everyone who agreed on the original to be his or her own interpreter.	92	9
201501	413	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I think that’s an important point of distinction, which is why one has to look to something more like an international agreement to see whether there is a genuine consensus underlying the agreed-upon language, even though, inevitably, ambiguities will result.	92	9
201501	414	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	415	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201501	416	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	92	9
201501	417	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with much of what Governor Powell said and what Chair Yellen said.	92	9
201501	418	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that the consensus statement is a compromise in many respects, but it’s served us very well.	92	9
201501	419	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I am one of the people who thinks that there are potentials for improvement, especially concerning the symmetry and with regard to thinking further about financial stability.	92	9
201501	420	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	We had a good initial discussion of these issues.	92	9
201501	421	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	We didn’t make any substantive changes yet, but I do look forward to further discussions this year on both of these issues.	92	9
201501	422	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m obviously not going to get into what to think about the Constitution with experts at the table, but, being a native Californian, we have a looser attitude toward changing the Constitution in California [laughter].	92	9
201501	423	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I do have more of a Jeffersonian view of it.	92	9
201501	424	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even though it has this quasi-constitutional character, we should do our very best, every year, to think about how we can enhance and improve this.	92	9
201501	425	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do agree with the others that the symmetry issue is one on which we should really try to improve our language.	92	9
201501	426	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	But it’s served us very well, and I fully support the consensus statement.	92	9
201501	427	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	92	9
201501	428	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I guess I would characterize myself as a strong supporter of the statement.	92	9
201501	429	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	It’s an important piece of communication about our framework for policymaking, and it supports our desire for transparency.	92	9
201501	430	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I’ve been a staff member involved with this statement since its inception, and now I’m a member of the subcommittee.	92	9
201501	431	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	So I know firsthand all of the deliberation, consultation, and compromise that went into crafting the statement.	92	9
201501	432	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Of course, I’m not a fan of measuring input; we’ve got to measure output.	92	9
201501	433	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I’ll be the first to admit that there are still a lot of ambiguities in the statement, and we each could find parts to amend to suit our own particular approach to policymaking.	92	9
201501	434	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	But I still think that if we view it as a consensus statement and a consensus set of principles, I would call it a success.	92	9
201501	435	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Indeed, one could say that the document itself takes a balanced approach.	92	9
201501	436	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	It balances the need to encompass the diversity of views among participants with the need to convey important information about the Committee’s policy goals and framework.	92	9
201501	437	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	The statement has served us well during the extraordinary policymaking times that we’ve been in since it was adopted in 2012, and I expect it to continue to serve us well when we return to the more normal economic and policy environment.	92	9
201501	438	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I echo President Williams’s sentiments that we’re going to continue to work to make it the best statement we can, but I do think that we should call this a success.	92	9
201501	439	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	440	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks.	92	9
201501	441	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	92	9
201501	442	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	443	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I support the document, and I do think it’s a very important document in giving greater clarity to the public about how this Committee is interpreting the mandate that it has been given from the Congress and how that interpretation is evolving in response to changes in the nature of the challenges we’re facing.	92	9
201501	444	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	It obviously does represent a compromise.	92	9
201501	445	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	We had some very good conversations prompted by the need to agree on this statement.	92	9
201501	446	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	And those discussions are as important as the statement itself, for the purposes of the Committee being able to deepen its views and its agreement about how we’re interpreting our mandate.	92	9
201501	447	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I’d say that the discussions regarding the symmetry of the two aspects of the dual mandate and regarding the inflation target were pretty rich.	92	9
201501	448	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The one area in which I would hope to see a much richer discussion in the lead-up to next year’s statement would be the role of financial stability considerations in monetary policy.	92	9
201501	449	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	That’s an area that became very important in the crisis, but I don’t think we have grappled with it as much as we really need to at the Committee.	92	9
201501	450	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201501	451	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Are there other comments?	92	9
201501	452	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	92	9
201501	453	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Well, this has been an interesting and helpful discussion as well as an encouraging one, because three other members of the subcommittee have spoken, and I can agree with every word of every one of them—that is to say, Jay Powell, John Williams, and Loretta Mester.	92	9
201501	454	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I should just add that, when our subcommittee started working, one of those three people said, “You should know that there’s a body buried underneath every word in this document.”	92	9
201501	455	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	92	9
201501	456	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I understand that, but I still think we may make progress.	92	9
201501	457	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We’re not going to start immediately, but, probably somewhere around midyear, we’re going to be working on a fairly ambitious program of potential changes.	92	9
201501	458	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	If we get any of them, we’ll be making progress.	92	9
201501	459	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	460	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201501	461	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Well, thank you, everyone, for your comments.	92	9
201501	462	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	As in the past, the minutes will include a summary of the views that have just been expressed around the table.	92	9
201501	463	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Now, formally, approving the statement is a vote of the Committee.	92	9
201501	464	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	But, before we do that, because of the nature of this document, I would like to ask for a show of hands of all participants regarding their support for the statement, and that will constitute input for the writers of the minutes.	92	9
201501	465	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	So let me ask everyone, how many are in favor of the document?	92	9
201501	466	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	92	9
201501	467	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And how many are opposed?	92	9
201501	468	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	92	9
201501	469	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And abstentions?	92	9
201501	470	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands].	92	9
201501	471	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201501	472	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, although you have all just raised your hands, I’d like to take a separate formal vote of Committee members in order to approve the document, including the minor update.	92	9
201501	473	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	All in favor?	92	9
201501	474	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	92	9
201501	475	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Any opposed?	92	9
201501	476	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	92	9
201501	477	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Abstention?	92	9
201501	478	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	92	9
201501	479	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201501	480	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	92	9
201501	481	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	We’re ready to move on to our next item.	92	9
201501	482	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	We’re about to have a change of personnel at the table, with Thomas Laubach replacing Bill English.	5	5
201501	483	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	But, Bill, before you leave, I’d like to thank you for your exemplary service to the Committee during these past four years as secretary and economist and as director of the Division of Monetary Affairs.	5	5
201501	484	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Bill first began attending FOMC meetings in 1995 and has since attended 93 meetings, 34 of which were as secretary.	5	5
201501	485	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	His service in this role benefited not only from his broad institutional knowledge and extensive background in monetary policy and financial-sector research, but also from personal characteristics that have proven invaluable:  a keen intellect, a drive for excellence, an unmatched work ethic, the patience of Job, and an abiding kindness in the face of enormous challenges.	5	5
201501	486	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Bill, we thank you for your service these past years and look forward to working with you in your new role as senior special adviser to the Board.	5	5
201501	487	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	Thank you very much.	5	5
201501	488	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	[Applause]	5	5
201501	489	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Now I’d like to welcome Thomas Laubach to the table in his new roles as director of the Division of Monetary Affairs and as secretary and economist of this Committee.	5	5
201501	490	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	While Thomas is only a few weeks into his monetary affairs role and just a few minutes into his role as secretary, he is obviously not new, in any sense, to monetary policy or to the work of this Committee.	5	5
201501	491	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thomas began his work with the Federal Reserve System in 1997 at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and, in the years since, has contributed to a wide range of high-level policy memorandums.	5	5
201501	492	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	He’s provided analytical support to the FOMC’s subcommittee on communications and served as a trusted adviser to me and to this Committee.	5	5
201501	493	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thomas, welcome.	5	5
201501	494	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	We all look forward to working with you in this new role.	5	5
201501	495	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you very much, Madam Chair.	5	5
201501	496	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	I’m very honored, and I look forward to serving the Committee.	5	5
201501	497	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Our next two items are going to be considered in a joint meeting of the Committee with the Board of Governors, and, accordingly, I will need a motion to close the Board meeting.	2	2
201501	498	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	2	2
201501	499	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	2	2
201501	500	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	2	2
201501	501	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to now call on Simon to deliver the first part of the Desk briefing, which focuses on market developments.	61	6
201501	502	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201501	503	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	As you noted, Lorie and I will be splitting the Desk briefing into two parts.	61	6
201501	504	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	I will first discuss financial market developments.	61	6
201501	505	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Lorie will then review domestic operations, before discussing results of our year-end overnight and term reverse repo operations and a staff proposal for further testing.	61	6
201501	506	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Longer-run nominal rates in developed economies continued to decline over the intermeeting period, as shown in the top-left panel of your first exhibit.	61	6
201501	507	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Market participants have attributed the declines to a variety of factors, including increased downside risks to the outlooks for economic growth and inflation stemming from overseas developments.	61	6
201501	508	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Growing expectations of an expansion of ECB asset purchases, and then the announcement of the new program, also contributed to the declines while also supporting risk assets, especially in the euro area.	61	6
201501	509	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Market participants are increasingly focused on spillover effects from low rates abroad as a key factor pushing down interest rates in the United States.	61	6
201501	510	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Market commentary also continues to cite the possibility of “secular stagnation” across developed economies as underpinning the sustained declines over the past year.	61	6
201501	511	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Declining levels of inflation compensation account for an important portion of the moves in longer-dated nominal rates.	61	6
201501	512	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-right panel, market-based measures of five-year, five-year-forward inflation compensation have fallen across major developed economies over the past year, with the most pronounced moves in the euro area and the United States.	61	6
201501	513	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period, US forward inflation compensation measures declined further, while euro-area inflation compensation increased, on net, partly because of growing expectations of ECB policy action.	61	6
201501	514	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Despite the very low levels of domestic inflation compensation, survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations, including those from the Desk’s surveys of primary dealer and buy-side participants, remain relatively stable and close to the Committee’s longer-run inflation goal.	61	6
201501	515	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Contributing to the falls in forward inflation compensation in the United States and abroad have been low and declining realized inflation, continued steep declines in commodity prices, and questions regarding the ability and commitment on the part of central banks to move inflation back to target.	61	6
201501	516	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-left panel, commodity prices have fallen substantially since last summer, and these declines continued during the intermeeting period.	61	6
201501	517	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Front-month crude oil futures prices fell another 18 percent over the period and have declined over 55 percent since last July.	61	6
201501	518	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	For a better understanding of the declines since July, the most recent Desk surveys asked respondents to rate the importance of supply, demand, and technical factors in explaining the move.	61	6
201501	519	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Respondents were nearly unanimous in expressing their belief that supply-related factors have been the most important driver of the decline in oil prices.	61	6
201501	520	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Consistent with these responses, copper and other industrial metals prices, which many use as proxies for global economic growth, were relatively little changed during the early stages of the oil price declines.	61	6
201501	521	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	However, more recently, these industrial metals have also declined sharply, also shown in the middle-left panel, to the lowest levels in over five years.	61	6
201501	522	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Market participants have suggested that this likely reflects increased concerns regarding the demand outlook stemming from Europe and China.	61	6
201501	523	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	To counter building disinflationary pressures stemming from increased downside risks to the global growth outlook and commodity price declines, numerous developed economy and some emerging market central banks eased policy or signaled an easing bias over the intermeeting period, as shown in the middle-right panel.	61	6
201501	524	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	To counter the effects of ECB measures on their exchange rates, both the Swiss and Danish central banks cut interest rates, moving policy rates into deeply negative territory.	61	6
201501	525	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The SNB also abandoned its floor on the exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the euro.	61	6
201501	526	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The Swiss, Danish, Swedish, and European central banks now all have negative deposit rates, and there are expectations that the SNB deposit rate could be cut a further 25 basis points to negative 1 percent.	61	6
201501	527	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The experience of these central banks with negative interest rates and the limited market-functioning effects to date may reduce concerns about lowering deposit rates below zero for some other central banks.	61	6
201501	528	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Beyond continental Europe, the Bank of Canada unexpectedly cut its policy rate in response to recent oil price declines, and the Bank of England minutes signaled a slight shift in the distribution of MPC views as two longstanding dissenting members stopped voting for higher rates.	61	6
201501	529	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Some emerging market central banks also cut rates earlier than expected, while expectations of EM policy rates more broadly continue to be revised downward.	61	6
201501	530	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Of these policy actions, the ECB announcement was the most eagerly anticipated.	61	6
201501	531	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	As the bottom-left panel details, the ECB announced that it would expand its existing asset purchase programs and will purchase €60 billion of public- and private-sector assets per month.	61	6
201501	532	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The expanded purchases will start in March, and the ECB stated that it intends to continue purchases until at least September 2016 and, in any case, until it sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with achieving its inflation objective.	61	6
201501	533	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The purchases would total €1.1 trillion if continued through September 2016, which, all else being equal, would bring the ECB’s balance sheet above early 2012 levels.	61	6
201501	534	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The purchases will be allocated according to the ECB capital key, and the ECB will purchase securities with maturities of 2 to 30 years.	61	6
201501	535	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The ECB announcement was interpreted by market participants as more accommodative than expected due to the larger-than-anticipated size and open-ended structure of the purchases.	61	6
201501	536	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-right panel, following the announcement, euro-area sovereign yields declined, particularly at longer maturities, as some were surprised by the inclusion of very long-dated bonds in the purchase program.	61	6
201501	537	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Longer-dated peripheral spreads narrowed and euro-area equities rose broadly, led by financial institutions and peripheral equity indexes.	61	6
201501	538	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The euro also continued its recent sharp depreciation, weakening by more than 3 percent against the US dollar to its lowest level in a decade, and options prices moved to suggest increased demand for protection against further euro depreciation.	61	6
201501	539	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	These moves generally extended previous price movements as expectations for ECB sovereign debt asset purchases gradually built over the course of this past fall and winter in the wake of President Draghi’s remarks at Jackson Hole.	61	6
201501	540	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	As a result of substantial cumulative policy actions abroad and the subdued outlook in many countries, rates in many sovereign debt markets are at historically low levels.	61	6
201501	541	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-left panel of your next exhibit, German and Japanese yields out to the 5-year tenor are either negative or zero.	61	6
201501	542	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Swiss interest rates are negative out past 10 years.	61	6
201501	543	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Further, the German yield curve looks remarkably similar to that of Japan, an economy that has battled deflation for the better part of two decades.	61	6
201501	544	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	These negative rates have posed challenges to many global investors, particularly official managers of foreign exchange reserves, and have required many to increase the duration of their investments in order to achieve positive returns.	61	6
201501	545	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	We have, of course, faced similar challenges in the SOMA foreign portfolio, prompting the increase in the authorized duration limit.	61	6
201501	546	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	We will continue to update the Committee on our management of the portfolio in this negative-rate environment.	61	6
201501	547	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Over recent months, outsized declines in foreign interest rates have contributed to a widening in two-year sovereign interest rate differentials between the United States and other major developed economies.	61	6
201501	548	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	This shift in rate differentials has continued to support a broad appreciation of the dollar, as shown in the top-right panel.	61	6
201501	549	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period, the DXY dollar index increased more than 7 percent.	61	6
201501	550	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Although not included in the DXY index, Chinese authorities have recently allowed their currency to depreciate, which is adding to further broad dollar strength.	61	6
201501	551	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The shift in short-tenor interest rate differentials reflects the fact that most market participants continue to expect the FOMC to increase the target federal funds rate in the middle of this year while other major central banks are undertaking substantial actions to promote a highly accommodative policy stance.	61	6
201501	552	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Indeed, in the most recent Desk surveys, respondents continue to place the highest probability on liftoff occurring in June, as shown in the middle-left panel, though there has been a modest increase in the perceived odds of a later liftoff since the December survey.	61	6
201501	553	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Survey respondents attributed the slight shift to slowing core inflation, tepid wage growth, and increasing downside growth risks overseas.	61	6
201501	554	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Some market participants have suggested that recent declines in inflation and inflation compensation should prompt the Committee to hold off on beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy until direct signs of upward inflation pressures emerge.	61	6
201501	555	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The Chair’s press conference following the December FOMC meeting appears to have effectively pushed back against the view that low near-term inflation will delay liftoff, and Desk survey respondents increasingly expect that liftoff will occur against a backdrop of low realized inflation.	61	6
201501	556	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The median response for the most likely level of 12-month headline PCE inflation at liftoff declined 80 basis points from the December surveys, to a level of 80 basis points, as shown in the leftmost column of the middle-right panel.	61	6
201501	557	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The next column of the table shows that, in contrast to this decline, the central expectation for PCE inflation one to two years after liftoff has remained close to 2 percent.	61	6
201501	558	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	However, as shown in the final two columns, respondents, particularly those on the buy side, increased the probability they attach to inflation over that one-to-two-year horizon following liftoff remaining below 1.75 percent.	61	6
201501	559	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Looking beyond liftoff, expectations with regard to the federal funds rate path through 2017 declined modestly in the most recent surveys.	61	6
201501	560	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	These declines may reflect an increase in perceived risks of a premature tightening in the federal funds rate, an event that could subsequently lead the Committee to slow the pace of rate increases, pause the tightening cycle, or potentially cut rates and return to the zero lower bound.	61	6
201501	561	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	However, Desk survey responses suggest that the probability of returning to the zero bound within two years of liftoff is little changed since December at around 20 percent, and most respondents do not view premature tightening as the main factor in their assessment of the likelihood of returning to the zero bound.	61	6
201501	562	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Instead, they view future adverse shocks as the most important factor.	61	6
201501	563	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	While beliefs about the timing of liftoff and the federal funds rate path are relatively little changed as measured by the Desk surveys, market pricing continues to give a different read on market expectations and shows substantial changes in the risk-neutral expected path of policy, as shown in the bottom-left panel.	61	6
201501	564	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period, the market initially priced in an additional 25 basis point increase in the target rate by the end of 2017, with the implied end-of-2017 rate reaching its recent peak following better-than-expected third-quarter US GDP data on December 23.	61	6
201501	565	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Then, despite better-than-expected employment data, the market reversed course and is now pricing in one less 25 basis point rate increase by the end of 2017 relative to the path immediately before the December meeting.	61	6
201501	566	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Survey-implied term premiums embedded in 2016 and 2017 interest rate futures contracts—measured as the difference between the market-implied funds rate and the mean expectation from the Desk surveys—became more negative over the intermeeting period, as shown in the bottom-right panel.	61	6
201501	567	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	As discussed at the December meeting, such negative term premiums may reflect concerns about negative shocks to the global economic outlook in an environment of low nominal rates.	61	6
201501	568	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	An alternative and more benign interpretation is that the recent steep drop in term premiums largely results from spillover effects related to lower interest rates abroad and QE-related portfolio-rebalancing flows, which may have also supported the intermeeting increase in global equities and other risk assets.	61	6
201501	569	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Thomas Laubach will discuss some of the policy implications of these alternative views in his briefing tomorrow.	61	6
201501	570	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Before handing over to Lorie, we’d be happy to answer any questions on financial market developments.	61	6
201501	571	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Any questions for Simon?	62	6
201501	572	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	62	6
201501	573	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	On your panel 3, “Commodities Performance,” that’s strikingly different from what we saw beginning in, if my memory serves me, September 2008, when industrial metals and everything else followed suit.	62	6
201501	574	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	But it appears to the naked eye here that, if you’re looking at the broader metals index, there is a downward-sloping trend.	62	6
201501	575	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I’m just curious—from the standpoint of your discussions with market participants, is this something of concern?	62	6
201501	576	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Is it being exacerbated by the increasing ability, in terms of the tradability, of financial interests surrounding industrial metals?	62	6
201501	577	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I’m just curious about what your interpretation is from a Desk standpoint.	62	6
201501	578	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	If we were to see the same kind of behavior we saw in 2008, I’d really be worried, but we’re not seeing that at present.	62	6
201501	579	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	“Dr.	62	6
201501	580	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Copper” has come down, to be sure.	62	6
201501	581	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	My question is, from the standpoint of the financial markets, how much is this being exacerbated in terms of the volatility?	62	6
201501	582	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I will try to point out that in my general presentation.	62	6
201501	583	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	It certainly is the case in the oil market.	62	6
201501	584	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	There’s enormously more volatility than there used to be due to the nature of the instruments.	62	6
201501	585	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	I think some of the day-to-day fluctuations—we’ve seen this in copper recently—can be related to people trading in new ways.	62	6
201501	586	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	There are reports of Chinese hedge funds producing some of these changes.	62	6
201501	587	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	I’d say that regarding this overall pattern of a decline, it’s hard to separate out demand-type factors from some of the build that people have done to have an increased supply there.	62	6
201501	588	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	If I’d shown iron ore, we understand the investment there is really what’s produced the reduction in the price of iron ore.	62	6
201501	589	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Market participants, though, as the price of ore kept on going down, started to doubt a little bit whether it was completely a supply factor, because they look at prices.	62	6
201501	590	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	They tended to be less reassured as they saw, since the meeting, these red and light-blue lines coming down, because that looks a little bit more like 2008, which is why we put it that way in the briefing.	62	6
201501	591	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Simon.	62	6
201501	592	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Are there other questions or comments?	62	6
201501	593	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	62	6
201501	594	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	On the ECB action, which seemed pretty impressive to me, you mentioned that 2- to 30-year securities are eligible.	62	6
201501	595	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Have they discussed the plan on how much duration to take out of the market?	62	6
201501	596	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	They will buy across the curve, so that’s similar to what the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England do.	62	6
201501	597	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	They look at what’s out there and try to buy in proportion across the maturity structure.	62	6
201501	598	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	When we’ve run some of our large-scale asset purchase programs, we’ve bought not across the curve but with a duration target in mind.	62	6
201501	599	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	What was surprising to market participants is that they were prepared to buy out to 30 years.	62	6
201501	600	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	One of the reasons they had to do that is that the quantity they’re buying is quite substantial.	62	6
201501	601	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	There are restrictions on the issuer and per-issue amount.	62	6
201501	602	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	This allows them, in the calculations they’ve done, to get to the rather large number that is between €800 billion and €900 billion for the sovereign debt purchases.	62	6
201501	603	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Is it likely that they might vary that duration target, depending on how they feel about how things are progressing?	62	6
201501	604	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	They are going, potentially, to encounter a lot of market-functioning issues.	62	6
201501	605	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	They are buying at a reasonably fast rate compared with net and gross issuance.	62	6
201501	606	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The turnover in many of these bond markets is quite low.	62	6
201501	607	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	They won’t start until March, so the staff there is working quite hard on trying to figure out how to do this.	62	6
201501	608	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	They’re also going to decentralize, and most of these purchases will be executed by the national central banks.	62	6
201501	609	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	So they’re going to have to coordinate across the 19 of those.	62	6
201501	610	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Some of those national central banks will face the issuer limit because they’re in programs, and the balance sheet already contains a lot of their sovereign debt.	62	6
201501	611	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	62	6
201501	612	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Are there other comments or questions for Simon?	62	6
201501	613	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62	6
201501	614	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Should we turn to Lorie, who’s going to take us through the next part of this presentation and a discussion of testing?	61	6
201501	615	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201501	616	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	I’ll begin on exhibit 3 with a review of Desk operations and end with a proposal for additional testing of the Committee’s policy normalization tools.	61	6
201501	617	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	The Desk’s MBS reinvestment operations continue to proceed smoothly.	61	6
201501	618	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Notably, the size of those purchases is projected to increase meaningfully, as shown in the top-left panel.	61	6
201501	619	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	We now project that MBS reinvestments in 2015 will total almost $400 billion, approximately 30 percent higher than projected ahead of the December FOMC meeting.	61	6
201501	620	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	The projected increase is primarily due to the substantial decline in longer-term Treasury yields, a decline that has put downward pressure on mortgage rates and boosted expected refinancing activity.	61	6
201501	621	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	To enhance operational readiness should the Committee decide in the future to sell any of the SOMA MBS holdings, the Desk executed five small-value MBS sales operations totaling about $440 million over the intermeeting period.	61	6
201501	622	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	The sales were executed successfully and helped highlight a few technical and procedural improvements to our operating framework, which we’ll begin implementing in the near term.	61	6
201501	623	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	As we discussed at the October meeting, the Desk continues work on enhancing the calculation of the effective federal funds rate and publishing a new overnight bank funding rate, as detailed in the top-right panel.	61	6
201501	624	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	We intend to announce the planned changes in a Desk statement on February 2 and will circulate a draft of the announcement for comment ahead of the release.	61	6
201501	625	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	The statement will describe the change in the data source for the effective rate, from brokered to Federal Reserve 2420 data, as a technical enhancement to the calculation process made in the context of recent international efforts to improve reference rates.	61	6
201501	626	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	The statement will characterize the new overnight bank funding rate, which will include both Eurodollar and federal funds transactions of US-based banking offices, as a broader measure of banks’ marginal borrowing costs that will be published for purposes of transparency.	61	6
201501	627	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	We’re planning to implement these changes within a year, but, in the statement, we’ll leave some flexibility in the timing in case there are substantive comments to the Federal Register notice describing the data revisions.	61	6
201501	628	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Over the intermeeting period, the Desk completed the test of the term RRP operations that covered year-end.	61	6
201501	629	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	The $600 billion combined capacity of the term and overnight RRPs appears to have been effective at supporting money market rates by providing greater certainty to investors about the availability of investments spanning year-end.	61	6
201501	630	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-left panel, the first two operations were oversubscribed, with the rates determined by the auction process, while the final two operations were undersubscribed and awarded at the maximum bid rate of 10 basis points.	61	6
201501	631	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Government money market funds were the main participants in the early term RRP operations, reportedly because they have fewer investment alternatives than prime funds and wanted to secure investments over year-end early.	61	6
201501	632	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-right panel, there was a substantial amount of substitution between term RRP—shown in the blue bars—and overnight RRP—shown in the red bars—during the first two term operations.	61	6
201501	633	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	As a result, overnight RRP take-up declined, reaching just $35 billion after the second term RRP operation.	61	6
201501	634	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the dark-blue bars in the bottom-left panel, overnight RRP take-up over year-end increased to $171 billion but was well below the authorized cap, and thus all funds were awarded at the maximum rate of 5 basis points.	61	6
201501	635	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Total participation in the term and overnight operations was around $400 billion, similar to the amount of bids received at the overnight operation on the September quarter-end but far less than the $600 billion in available capacity authorized by the Committee.	61	6
201501	636	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Consistent with recent quarter-end dates, prime money funds accounted for most of the overnight RRP take-up on the year-end date.	61	6
201501	637	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	All of the term RRPs matured on January 5, which had led some market participants to express concern about operational risk associated with having a large portion of their portfolio mature on a single day.	61	6
201501	638	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	However, the unwind of the term RRPs was orderly.	61	6
201501	639	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Overnight RRP take-up did increase notably on January 5, absorbing some of the maturing term investments, a development you can also see in that bottom-left panel.	61	6
201501	640	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	As with previous quarter-ends, the increase in RRP take-up reflected the decline in private-sector money market activity primarily associated with foreign banking organizations’ desire to shrink their balance sheets on financial statement dates.	61	6
201501	641	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the bottom-right panel, the decline in money market volumes over year-end was broadly in line with previous year- and quarter-ends.	61	6
201501	642	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Conversations with market participants suggest that the combination of term and overnight RRP operations was effective in supporting money market rates leading into and at year-end.	61	6
201501	643	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel of your final exhibit, although some money market rates declined on year-end, they generally stayed at or above the overnight RRP rate both prior to and on year-end.	61	6
201501	644	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Recall that, in contrast, some money market rates fell below the overnight RRP rate leading into and over the September quarter-end.	61	6
201501	645	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	As also shown in the top-left panel, with the exception of a brief decline on year- end, the effective federal funds rate has remained between 12 and 13 basis points in recent weeks, even as the overnight RRP rate—the red line in the chart—was lowered back to 5 basis points in mid-December.	61	6
201501	646	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants have been somewhat surprised by this, as most anticipated that the effective rate would return to the level prevailing prior to the increases in the overnight RRP rate.	61	6
201501	647	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	The top-right panel provides more detail regarding the recent elevated levels of the federal funds rate by examining the distribution of rates on federal funds trades.	61	6
201501	648	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	In the weeks prior to the changes in the overnight RRP rate, the majority of federal funds trading occurred around 7 to 8 basis points, as shown by the dark-blue line.	61	6
201501	649	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Following the increase in the overnight RRP rate to 10 basis points, the distribution shifted higher—shown by the light-blue line.	61	6
201501	650	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Since the overnight RRP rate returned to its pretest level of 5 basis points, the distribution has remained near the levels observed when the overnight RRP rate was 10 basis points.	61	6
201501	651	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	The distribution of Eurodollar trading, which includes a much wider set of cash lenders than in federal funds, followed a similar pattern, as shown in the middle-left panel.	61	6
201501	652	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Federal funds and Eurodollars have remained higher even as secured rates have declined.	61	6
201501	653	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	The middle-right panel shows the same distributions as in the prior two panels, but for triparty repo rates.	61	6
201501	654	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	These rates also shifted higher with the increase in the overnight RRP rate but have generally moved back since the overnight RRP rate was decreased back to 5 basis points.	61	6
201501	655	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	It’s not entirely clear why unsecured rates did not decline after the overnight RRP rate test ended.	61	6
201501	656	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Some market participants have told us that cash lenders learned during the ON RRP test that many foreign banking organizations engaged in IOER arbitrage were willing to pay higher rates for funding, even though this meant accepting a smaller profit, and that this information has had a lasting effect on competitive dynamics in unsecured markets.	61	6
201501	657	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Notably, the uptick in recent months in unsecured rates does not seem to reflect a rise in perceived credit risk, as the movement in rates appears broad based across firms.	61	6
201501	658	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Finally, I’ll turn to staff recommendations for further testing of TDFs and RRPs.	61	6
201501	659	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	These recommendations were described in two memos you received prior to this meeting.	61	6
201501	660	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Beginning with TDFs, as outlined in the bottom-left panel, the staff proposes conducting a series of three test operations, beginning in February and maturing by mid-March.	61	6
201501	661	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	The operations would incorporate two changes relative to the testing thus far.	61	6
201501	662	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	First, they would introduce same-day settlement, which may encourage participation and allow the effects of the tool to be realized more quickly.	61	6
201501	663	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Second, the proposed operations would have overlapping maturities so that the quantity of outstanding TDFs would gradually increase.	61	6
201501	664	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	The staff recommends limiting the individual award per operation to $20 billion and offering a spread of 3 basis points over the IOER rate.	61	6
201501	665	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	With respect to further testing of term RRPs, the Committee may wish to conduct operations at the March quarter-end in order to test refinements to the term RRP operational framework.	61	6
201501	666	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	If the Committee thought it appropriate to do so, the Desk proposes testing that incorporates four operational refinements, which are based on lessons learned from the tests over year-end and outlined in your bottom-right panel.	61	6
201501	667	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	First, we recommend that the term RRP offered amount be reduced to $200 billion to improve our understanding of the effect of decreasing the available capacity.	61	6
201501	668	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	This is also consistent with the Committee’s interest in limiting its footprint in markets.	61	6
201501	669	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Second, we recommend that the term RRPs mature across multiple days in early April to avoid operational risks associated with all of the operations maturing on the same day.	61	6
201501	670	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Third, we propose modest changes to the frequency and tenor of term RRP operations that would result in fewer operations and shorter maturities.	61	6
201501	671	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Finally, rather than stating a specific maximum bid rate in our communications, the bid rate would be expressed as a spread above the overnight RRP rate on the day of the operation.	61	6
201501	672	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	This would be consistent with the possibility of a change in the target for the federal funds rate following the announcement of the term RRP test offerings but before the actual operations.	61	6
201501	673	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	If the Committee would like to proceed with the proposed term RRP test, the Desk could release a statement following this meeting, with a more detailed operational schedule announced through a second Desk statement in early March.	61	6
201501	674	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	A draft resolution authorizing this test is provided in a separate handout titled “Term Reverse Repurchase Operations Resolution.”3 Finally, the staff outlined a few additional ways of testing RRPs in the memo circulated to the Committee in advance of the meeting.	61	6
201501	675	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	These potential additional tests are also described in the bottom-right panel.	61	6
201501	676	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	If your discussion at this meeting regarding options during normalization suggests a need for additional testing, the staff could come back with detailed proposals along these lines.	61	6
201501	677	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	For example, depending on the preferred approach for the initial stage of normalization, the Committee may be interested in testing term RRP operations that don’t span quarter-ends.	61	6
201501	678	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	The Committee could direct the Desk on a one-time basis to offer a few consecutive term RRPs, with weekly maturities and in modest sizes, to learn more about the extent to which term RRPs could support overnight RRPs in controlling short-term market rates away from quarter-end.	61	6
201501	679	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	The Committee might also be interested in further testing the effect that changes in the overnight RRP rate have on short-term market rates, volumes, and overnight RRP take-up, which could provide additional insight into the desired setting of the IOER–overnight RRP rate spread during normalization.	61	6
201501	680	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you, and that concludes our prepared remarks.	61	6
201501	681	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	61	6
201501	682	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions?	62	6
201501	683	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	62	6
201501	684	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	62	6
201501	685	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I’m going to make a procedural suggestion, Madam Chair.	62	6
201501	686	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	This has to do with RRP testing.	62	6
201501	687	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	According to the January Survey of Primary Dealers, they already believe we will offer a term facility regularly at quarter-end.	62	6
201501	688	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	This is buried in the back of the primary dealer survey.	62	6
201501	689	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	This has to do with this tension we’ve faced throughout the time we’ve been testing.	62	6
201501	690	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	We’ve wanted to learn more.	62	6
201501	691	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	It’s a genuinely positive benefit of testing.	62	6
201501	692	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	But, at the same time, we’ve been anxious about the extent to which testing encourages broad expectation of a relatively permanent or overly large facility that’s going to persist for some time.	62	6
201501	693	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	And it looks as though, again, our testing over the year-end of a term RRP facility has led expectations to run a bit ahead of where the Committee is on the likelihood of using it.	62	6
201501	694	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	We haven’t even actually decided this yet.	62	6
201501	695	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I note that our next agenda item, agenda item 9, is where we’re going to discuss our liftoff options.	62	6
201501	696	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	The staff memo presented us with an option 1 and an option 2, and option 1 does without term RRPs.	62	6
201501	697	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	It’s an option I favor, and I think we can do fine without that, with a larger cap and a wide spread to 25 basis points, as I’ll argue later.	62	6
201501	698	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	But our decision about whether we test again a term facility at quarter-end might be usefully informed about whether we think we’re likely to use it on an ongoing basis when we raise rates.	62	6
201501	699	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Now, I understand that there’s the standard boilerplate whenever we announce these things, and that we can test until the cows come home and it doesn’t mean anything about how we’re going to do things when we actually liftoff.	62	6
201501	700	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	But, in point of fact, we see that what we do leads markets to expect us to use the things we test and roll out.	62	6
201501	701	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	So, if the majority of the Committee coalesces around option 1 and views us as likely to be able to lift off quite smoothly without the use of term RRPs, it might be useful to forgo testing term RRPs.	62	6
201501	702	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I’d like to suggest, Madam Chair, that we defer consideration of this resolution on testing term RRPs until we’ve had this discussion and go-round on liftoff tools and we have a better sense of where the Committee wants to head.	62	6
201501	703	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Can I just give you some background?	62	6
201501	704	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Ask the Chair.	62	6
201501	705	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	It’s up to the Chair.	62	6
201501	706	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Please, Simon.	62	6
201501	707	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	One of the things that we’re trying to deal with is to avoid indicating anything in our testing about whether a meeting is “live” or not.	62	6
201501	708	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Consequently, one of the things we’re trying to do in option 1 is to offer the possibility of using the term over a quarter-end.	62	6
201501	709	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	We thought that this particular resolution was the minimal testing that we could come out of this meeting with.	62	6
201501	710	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	I agree with you that it would be useful to find out whether that’s correct in the go-round coming up.	62	6
201501	711	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	But it’s not as if the testing that we did was changing people’s expectations regarding our footprint or whether the overnight RRP will be permanent.	62	6
201501	712	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The buy- side respondents actually reduced the amount of overnight RRP that they thought we would be using, and we have not heard anyone suggest that this will be permanent.	62	6
201501	713	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	62	6
201501	714	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m pretty sympathetic to what you’re saying, President Lacker, in the sense that, if the Committee decides determinatively that it’s not going to use something, then it doesn’t make sense to keep testing it, because that leads to the wrong inference by the markets.	62	6
201501	715	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	But, at the same time, it’s not unreasonable for the markets to see how well the tests do and, from how well the tests do, make inferences about how likely the Committee is to actually adopt that facility.	62	6
201501	716	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me that one reason why the markets might think term RRPs were more likely was that the tests seemed to show that they were helpful in putting a floor under money market rates.	62	6
201501	717	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t believe it’s reasonable to think that we could force the markets not to draw those kinds of inferences from whether the tests go well or the tests go not so well.	62	6
201501	718	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	They’re going to respond to how they see their experience with the test.	62	6
201501	719	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair, I’m happy to debate testing, but I think we should just wait a few minutes and do it after we discuss the liftoff tools.	62	6
201501	720	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	The time to have this discussion is after we have a sense of where we’re headed more broadly.	62	6
201501	721	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Personally, I think it’s fine if we defer the vote on the testing of the term RRPs until we’re done with the discussion of liftoff tools.	62	6
201501	722	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Do I see any objections to that?	62	6
201501	723	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62	6
201501	724	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	62	6
201501	725	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Governor Tarullo looks as though he’s about to do a two-hander.	62	6
201501	726	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Yes.	62	6
201501	727	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I wanted to ask whether we can still ask questions now about the testing to inform the later discussion.	62	6
201501	728	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Of course.	62	6
201501	729	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, please.	62	6
201501	730	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I just wanted to make sure.	62	6
201501	731	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Yes—absolutely.	62	6
201501	732	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Do you have a question?	62	6
201501	733	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I do, but Eric’s first.	62	6
201501	734	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Of course.	62	6
201501	735	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	My question follows on with that line of questioning of President Lacker’s.	62	6
201501	736	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Based on our experience over year-end, if you were to tally the financial cost of using term reverse repos instead of overnight, do we have a rough approximation of how much we spent by choosing to do it with term rather than overnight?	62	6
201501	737	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Just approximately.	62	6
201501	738	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	The second part to that is that there may be an inference that there’s a difference from a financial stability standpoint between term and overnight.	62	6
201501	739	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	So, based on your experience with year-end, could you give me a sense of how you see the financial stability differences between using overnight reverses and using term reverses?	62	6
201501	740	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	I think it’s easier if I answer the first question now.	62	6
201501	741	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The second might be more appropriate in the discussion of liftoff tools.	62	6
201501	742	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Okay.	62	6
201501	743	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	That’s fine.	62	6
201501	744	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	On the first one, the counterfactual exercise you’d have to do is the following:  Suppose we’d increased over the year-end the cap on the overnight RRP to $600 billion.	62	6
201501	745	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	That would be the same amount of collateral available.	62	6
201501	746	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Then the $225 billion that was in term, instead of going out at probably an average rate of 9 basis points, assuming we didn’t hit the cap, would have gone out at 5 basis points.	62	6
201501	747	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	So that’s 4 basis points times $225 billion.	62	6
201501	748	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	I don’t know if Josh can work that out.	62	6
201501	749	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	I don’t think it’s that much of a difference in terms of the income of the Federal Reserve.	62	6
201501	750	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	In terms of how it worked in markets, there’s some evidence that it has some social value due to the confidence it gives people that it will allow for smoother market functioning and less disruption.	62	6
201501	751	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	But, overall, if the two tools achieve the same rate control, that’s probably what we should look at primarily.	62	6
201501	752	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	And if they do, given that and market functioning, the one that’s slightly cheaper to use is probably preferred.	62	6
201501	753	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	62	6
201501	754	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Simon, on that point, how much learning do you think there was by markets as they saw how the different term operations are perceived?	62	6
201501	755	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Because one advantage of the term facility, in principle, is that you have these operations, and the market can see how the pricing occurs and what the demand is, whereas if you just have the overnight operation, at the end of the year, you know nothing until the operation actually materializes.	62	6
201501	756	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I’d be curious about whether you think there was learning and whether that was helpful.	62	6
201501	757	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	We heard from market participants that some learning took place, and they realized—as the operation, particularly the third one, wasn’t oversubscribed—that the year- end pressures were going to be fairly smooth.	62	6
201501	758	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	But if you pressed market participants to indicate whether they were fully confident that all of the demand would have been met on the year-end date with a larger overnight RRP cap, I’m not sure they would have preferred the term over the overnight.	62	6
201501	759	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	So when there’s uncertainty about whether the cap is high enough to accommodate that demand on overnight, that’s what you would be weighing against increased knowledge by having the term earlier.	62	6
201501	760	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	But I think the money funds do prefer higher rates.	62	6
201501	761	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Just one follow-up on that, if I may.	62	6
201501	762	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we had no cap on year-end for overnight, would that have served the same purpose?	62	6
201501	763	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Yes.	62	6
201501	764	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Madam Chair.	62	6
201501	765	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	62	6
201501	766	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Just to clarify, are they fairly close substitutes or not?	62	6
201501	767	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	That’s my question.	62	6
201501	768	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Fantastic question.	62	6
201501	769	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	[Laughter]	62	6
201501	770	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	And the answer is?	62	6
201501	771	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Yes—I think that was a “yes.”	62	6
201501	772	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	I think we’re going to talk to a greater extent about the degree of substitution.	62	6
201501	773	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	From an actual operations perspective in this particular briefing, there is more complexity in operating the term as opposed to just having an overnight that can be used.	62	6
201501	774	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	How you want to weigh those against certain scenarios in which the financial stability implications may be different is, I believe, a topic Jim is going to go into.	62	6
201501	775	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	But you were asking from the standpoint of the investor, weren’t you, Richard?	62	6
201501	776	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	From the investor’s standpoint, they like the flexibility of the overnight products because then their cash flows can be variable, and they have the opportunity to put it in daily and make daily adjustments.	62	6
201501	777	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	When we were designing this, the overnight RRP was as late in the day as possible so that they can even use every hour within the day to make a decision about whether they’re going to invest with the Federal Reserve.	62	6
201501	778	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	I think quarter-end is a little bit different in that they can predict that the balance sheet will be going down.	62	6
201501	779	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	That’s available to them.	62	6
201501	780	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	So the substitution between overnight and term, then, is one set of cases.	62	6
201501	781	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	What might be interesting is to learn, away from the quarter-end, is whether the substitution looks any different.	62	6
201501	782	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair?	62	6
201501	783	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Go ahead.	62	6
201501	784	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I want to follow up on President Rosengren’s question, the crux of which was that, with a sufficiently large cap, they have virtually identical effects and an identical effect on the counterparties, and that they view them as perfect substitutes.	62	6
201501	785	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I take it that the effect on market rates would be about the same as well.	62	6
201501	786	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	I don’t think they’re viewed as perfect substitutes.	62	6
201501	787	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	As I said, market particpants like just having the overnight products.	62	6
201501	788	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	62	6
201501	789	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Sure, they’d love a term instrument from us.	62	6
201501	790	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	But, aside from that, the effect on market rates is likely to be the same either way—the term versus a large cap?	62	6
201501	791	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	You have the potential, if you offered too much term, to, in fact, increase term rates unexpectedly.	62	6
201501	792	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Therefore, the market rate implications between the two scenarios may not be exactly the same.	62	6
201501	793	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	For the overnight rate on year-end, I think they would end up being the same.	62	6
201501	794	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	If I could follow up, there was an alarming 6 basis point drop in the funds rate.	62	6
201501	795	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I’m being sarcastic—I’m sorry.	62	6
201501	796	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	There was a huge drop in the funds rate on year-end.	62	6
201501	797	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	You don’t view that as compromising our monetary policy objectives, do you?	62	6
201501	798	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	We’ll pretty much get where we’re going to go anyway, right?	62	6
201501	799	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	I thought the objective was for that rate to be at or above the overnight RRP, and that we were running a floor.	62	6
201501	800	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	I thought that was the objective of the testing.	62	6
201501	801	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	No, our objectives are in the consensus statement we adopted earlier today.	62	6
201501	802	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	I think that, in the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, which you voted into effect in September, you did express the wish that this tool be used to support the federal funds rate trading in that range.	62	6
201501	803	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	But I’m thinking that, before the crisis, we had quarter-end and year-end rate explosions and implosions all the time.	62	6
201501	804	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	And I don’t recall that ever being brought to the Committee as a matter of concern or something that required a new facility.	62	6
201501	805	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	What we were trying to test, if you look at panel 19, was whether there was a difference in the dark-blue line in the days leading into quarter-end.	62	6
201501	806	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	In the old days, as you suggest, we might have had volatility on quarter-end, but you may be uncomfortable—and I think that’s very interesting—about the extent to which that had influence on other days beyond that one day.	62	6
201501	807	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	In this case, we didn’t see that dynamic at the year-end.	62	6
201501	808	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Now, it could have just been because we surprised market participants in September.	62	6
201501	809	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	So, again, we don’t know that for sure.	62	6
201501	810	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	But we didn’t see that leakage going into quarter-end, and I agree that on one day, if it’s just one day, that’s probably not so much of a concern.	62	6
201501	811	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	62	6
201501	812	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	A broader point is that—I don’t want to belabor this, but it’s obvious—in the old regime, it was predictable.	62	6
201501	813	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	The rates would crash or spike or whatever, and what was relevant to the things in the consensus statement, things like two-year rates and one- year rates, would smooth through that.	62	6
201501	814	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	So year-end never really had any economic consequence that I remember.	62	6
201501	815	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	I agree about that day, and we saw that other jurisdictions—the United Kingdom and the euro area—had volatility on their year-end date.	62	6
201501	816	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	I think what you may be concerned about are those days leading into the quarter-end—that it is more than just one day.	62	6
201501	817	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Right.	62	6
201501	818	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	And you’ve provided the information that an overnight with a sufficiently large cap would be adequate to provide ample comfort to market participants to smooth market function enough.	62	6
201501	819	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	As long as it’s available for some time before the year-end as well.	62	6
201501	820	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Of course, the related issue, President Lacker, is that if we actually do lift off in June or September and quarter-end is coming up right behind that liftoff, having rates move up—and do so pretty consistently—is probably more important than at other times.	62	6
201501	821	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I certainly accept your point that at past year-ends we didn’t care.	62	6
201501	822	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	But at this point, our credibility in terms of actually making the liftoff clearly work is a little higher than normal.	62	6
201501	823	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	So we would probably care more about quarter-end pressure and year-end pressure now than we would in past episodes.	62	6
201501	824	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Agreed.	62	6
201501	825	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I take your point, but I think there’s something a little special about these circumstances.	62	6
201501	826	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Particularly for the days before the quarter-end, because between, for example, the June meeting and the quarter-end, if it leaked into the days before, you wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between the liftoff pull and the actual quarter-end effect.	62	6
201501	827	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	So I think that window is particularly of interest.	62	6
201501	828	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Can I follow up on this?	62	6
201501	829	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Yes, it’s true—quarter-end is about one week after the June meeting, and there might be some articles in the paper the next day if we have a little crash in rates.	62	6
201501	830	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	But quarter-end effects are pretty well known in financial markets.	62	6
201501	831	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Some reporter is bound to come across somebody saying “usual quarter-end pressure.”	62	6
201501	832	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	A month later, is it going to be a problem if rates behave the normal way after that?	62	6
201501	833	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I don’t see it as a really serious reputational risk for us.	62	6
201501	834	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess it’s probably not a very serious reputational risk, but if you have a good tool to prevent that reputational risk from manifesting itself, why wouldn’t you want to use it?	62	6
201501	835	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	President Lacker, as Lorie said, no one has done this before.	62	6
201501	836	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Suppose we are lifting rates.	62	6
201501	837	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	There’s going to be noise around it, and it’s going to be very confusing for people if we don’t actually lift rates.	62	6
201501	838	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Exactly.	62	6
201501	839	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	We could try to say it’s quarter-end.	62	6
201501	840	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Wait.	62	6
201501	841	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	So you’re talking about one day a week after we raise rates.	62	6
201501	842	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	No.	62	6
201501	843	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	It’s the pressure of quarter-end leading into that day.	62	6
201501	844	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	That can put downward pressure on rates.	62	6
201501	845	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	That’s what we saw in September.	62	6
201501	846	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	There’s some controversy as to the source of that.	62	6
201501	847	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Was it 3 basis points?	62	6
201501	848	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	But remember the zero.	62	6
201501	849	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	There’s a zero line in here.	62	6
201501	850	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Zero is getting a lot farther away when we raise rates, and zero is a big push-off as well.	62	6
201501	851	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	We really don’t want—I don’t want and Lorie doesn’t want, in light of the directive you’ve given us—to have a lot of complications in those first two weeks in terms of raising rates.	62	6
201501	852	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Agreed.	62	6
201501	853	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	If, later on, we’re into normalization, does it matter if there’s a little bit of pressure on year-end?	62	6
201501	854	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Probably not.	62	6
201501	855	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	But after six years of being at zero and saying we want to raise rates, it seems to me we ought to be successful in doing it and do what it takes to make that happen.	62	6
201501	856	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Do you think the year-end pressure could be as much as 25 basis points?	62	6
201501	857	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Could this pressure into quarter-end push it down 25 basis points so that the day after we raise rates, it doesn’t go up?	62	6
201501	858	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	We have seen large moves.	62	6
201501	859	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	For Eurodollars at the end of the third quarter, the effective rate printed negative.	62	6
201501	860	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	We’ve seen big moves in the United Kingdom, and we don’t really know what it means to be far away from zero.	62	6
201501	861	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	It’s something that might come up in Jim’s discussion.	62	6
201501	862	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Recall that, for a lot of lenders, they can just leave it in cash.	62	6
201501	863	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	They might get charged, but it’s not a big opportunity cost.	62	6
201501	864	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	When we’re raising rates, the opportunity cost of not being invested goes up.	62	6
201501	865	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	62	6
201501	866	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I would say, President Lacker, that you’re making important analogies to previous periods that were completely different from the circumstances that we’re going to be facing.	62	6
201501	867	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	We are in uncharted territories, and market participants are going to be watching this with a different set of eyes because of the massive amount of excess reserves in the system and because we’re lifting off from the zero lower bound, where we’ve been for many years now.	62	6
201501	868	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I just don’t think we have historical examples of that in the United States.	62	6
201501	869	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Right now, we are getting support from the zero lower bound, but you’ll be moving that lower bound up.	62	6
201501	870	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The behavior we saw at quarter-end in September should lead us to be very concerned that, right after an announcement by this Committee that we’re lifting off, we could actually see rates drifting down for several days in a row.	62	6
201501	871	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	To me, that would be a very strong concern, particularly as we have the tools that we’re quite confident could prevent it.	62	6
201501	872	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The following question would arise:  Why wouldn’t you use those tools?	62	6
201501	873	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	62	6
201501	874	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I would strongly agree with Governor Brainard.	62	6
201501	875	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	We’re going to be in a world of superabundant reserves for many years.	62	6
201501	876	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	It’s very important that we establish good control over rates at the beginning.	62	6
201501	877	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	If, later on, things get a little sloppy, that’s one thing, but that would really not be the way to start this process, in my view.	62	6
201501	878	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Thank you.	62	6
201501	879	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo, did you have a quick question?	62	6
201501	880	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	My question was actually Eric’s second question, which Simon suggested was best deferred to the discussion of liftoff options, a topic I think President Lacker has already taken us into.	62	6
201501	881	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	62	6
201501	882	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I was dragged into it.	62	6
201501	883	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	But I have a feeling that Jim will address that question in the presentation, so I will defer.	62	6
201501	884	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any other questions?	62	6
201501	885	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	62	6
201501	886	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I have two really quick observations.	62	6
201501	887	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	One is that we’re worried about lifting off in June or September, very close to quarter-end.	62	6
201501	888	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	We can solve that problem by lifting off in April or July.	62	6
201501	889	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	[Laughter]	62	6
201501	890	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Get rid of it.	62	6
201501	891	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Don’t lift off near the year-end.	62	6
201501	892	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m being a bit facetious here, but my point is, if the only reason to change the way we approach the structure of the program has to do with quarter-end behavior, it seems the wrong way to design the program.	62	6
201501	893	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	For example, if we choose to lift off in June and we choose to do things in a particular way to avoid the quarter-end problem that we’re talking about, what will then be the expectations in the market about subsequent quarter-ends?	62	6
201501	894	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Once we start doing that, I’m worried we’ll find ourselves repeating this, and we actually will have adopted a practice that we didn’t have before, which is smoothing quarter-end.	62	6
201501	895	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	So I think it’s tricky on both sides.	62	6
201501	896	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Once you venture into that fray and start that practice, we may find it that much harder then to pull back on this program that we’ve said we want to pull back on.	62	6
201501	897	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	62	6
201501	898	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	This is a one-off, Madam Chair, but I want to come back to the previous meeting we had and the excellent memo that Simon wrote—on your own or with the Desk—and that I praised.	62	6
201501	899	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I simply want to ask the question:  Have we had any change in our expectation as to the ultimate size of the balance sheet and then the speed with which we expect to reduce it?	62	6
201501	900	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The balance sheet is $4.27 trillion at par.	62	6
201501	901	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	While we are investing, it’ll stay around that level.	62	6
201501	902	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	On the path of mortgage-backed securities, as Lorie showed you, it looks as though prepays will be quite high for the next few months.	62	6
201501	903	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	So that’s going to generate some lower coupons in there, which means that, if the rates eventually firm as we lift off, you might see a very small effect on how quickly the MBS run off.	62	6
201501	904	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	But that was part of the analysis in that memo:  A lot of getting the balance sheet back to a more normal size depends on the MBS runoff, and there are two factors there.	62	6
201501	905	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	What does the stock of MBS that we’re holding at the moment we stop reinvestment look like?	62	6
201501	906	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	And what are rates after that?	62	6
201501	907	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	So we’re going to get slightly more lower-coupon MBS from this prepayment increase.	62	6
201501	908	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I do want to urge the Committee again, Madam Chair, to please read that memo, because I thought it was one of the best ones, as I mentioned then, that I’ve read in 10 years at this Committee.	62	6
201501	909	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Thank you.	62	6
201501	910	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62	6
201501	911	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Then we do need a vote to ratify domestic open market operations.	63	6
201501	912	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	63	6
201501	913	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks.	63	6
201501	914	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	63	6
201501	915	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And we’ve agreed that we will postpone a vote on testing until after our next discussion.	63	6
201501	916	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63	6
201501	917	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	We’re next going to turn to liftoff tools and options, and, before turning it over to Jim for the staff presentation, I want to make a couple of comments myself.	92	9
201501	918	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	First, I’ll say again that, personally, I consider it absolutely critical that, when we announce liftoff, the federal funds rate move into our increased target range in a smooth, efficient, and prompt manner.	92	9
201501	919	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Personally, I think we need a very high degree of confidence that our normalization tools, in whatever configuration we settle on, will provide sufficient control over interest rates right out of the gate.	92	9
201501	920	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	To me, this is the highest priority.	92	9
201501	921	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Second, our policy tools vary in terms of their benefits, costs, and risks.	92	9
201501	922	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	So we clearly need to strike the right balance in their use.	92	9
201501	923	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	While we may differ to some degree in weighing these various factors, I believe we’ll be best served by an operational plan that’s relatively simple to implement and communicate.	92	9
201501	924	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	For liftoff to go smoothly, it seems essential that market participants will need to have a reasonable idea of what types of investment opportunities will be available to them.	92	9
201501	925	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, the plan needs to be feasible for the Desk to execute with manageable operational risk.	92	9
201501	926	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Third, as noted in the staff memo, the particular choices we make about our tools at the time of liftoff need not constrain us subsequently.	92	9
201501	927	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I am quite amenable to temporary alterations in the parameters of our tools, such as the cap on the overnight RRP facility, with the expectation that we will dial back the potential size of the facilities over time as we learn more about what’s needed to put a firm floor under rates once we move away from the zero lower bound.	92	9
201501	928	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	For example, we could substitute term RRPs outside quarter-ends for reliance on the overnight RRP facility.	92	9
201501	929	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	But with those preliminary comments of my own, I look forward to hearing your views, and I’m next going to turn the floor over to Jim for a presentation.	92	9
201501	930	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	Thank you very much, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	931	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	I’ll be referring to the handout labeled “Material for Discussion of Liftoff Tools and Possible Liftoff Options.”	92	9
201501	932	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	As noted in exhibit 1, in its Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, the Committee provided a broad outline of its high-level approach to policy normalization.	92	9
201501	933	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	However, the Committee has not yet described exactly how it plans to use its various tools to implement these general principles and plans.	92	9
201501	934	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	To facilitate your discussion of these issues, the staff prepared a memo that highlights some key issues that policymakers may wish to consider in this regard.	92	9
201501	935	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	An underlying theme of the memo is that policymakers may face some tradeoffs in developing an operational strategy for liftoff that seeks to maximize the odds that liftoff will proceed smoothly from the start while, at the same time, minimizing the risks that could be associated with heavy reliance on particular tools.	92	9
201501	936	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	To explore those issues further, the memo outlined two illustrative options that differ primarily in their relative reliance on overnight and term RRP operations.	92	9
201501	937	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	As noted in the first box in exhibit 2, the recent testing of term RRPs around the year-end provided the backdrop for structuring the options in this way.	92	9
201501	938	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	The year-end tests suggested that there was an important degree of substitutability between overnight RRP and term RRP, at least at the year-end.	92	9
201501	939	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	If that substitution relationship holds at other times as well, it may be possible to use term RRP operations to help manage the level of the take-up in overnight RRP operations.	92	9
201501	940	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	In addition, term RRP operations would be fixed in size, they would be offered only on specific dates, and the rate would always be determined at auction.	92	9
201501	941	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	As a result, the financial stability risks associated with term RRP operations may be viewed as lower than those associated with daily overnight reverse repo operations.	92	9
201501	942	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	On the other hand, term RRP operations are more operationally complex than overnight RRP operations, and heavy reliance on term RRP could result in distortions in term financing markets.	92	9
201501	943	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	In addition, term RRP operations with maturities that extend over FOMC meeting dates could present some potential challenges in avoiding perceptions of signaling policy actions in advance.	92	9
201501	944	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	With these observations in mind, as shown in the middle box, under the first of the two illustrative options, the FOMC would rely principally on overnight reverse RP operations at the time of liftoff to establish a floor for overnight rates.	92	9
201501	945	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	For this tool to provide effective support for short-term interest rates, market participants would require sufficient assurance that the aggregate cap on overnight reverse repos would bind only rarely.	92	9
201501	946	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	To provide this assurance while accounting for the possibility of significant shifts in investor preferences, the FOMC, in this option, would indicate its intention to temporarily increase the cap on overnight reverse repo operations to a level of, say, $600 billion.	92	9
201501	947	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	(Again, the particular numbers here are purely hypothetical at this stage.)  In addition, the FOMC would note that it intends to conduct term RRP operations after liftoff, if necessary, to help control the federal funds rate and to help avoid scenarios in which the cap on overnight reverse repo operations binds regularly.	92	9
201501	948	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	Policymakers might be attracted to option 1 if they judged that the financial stability and footprint risks associated with a sizable temporary increase in the overnight RRP cap are modest and were concerned that the costs of conducting sizable term reverse repo operations could be significant, or that the communications associated with undertaking term operations before liftoff could prove complicated.	92	9
201501	949	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	Policymakers might also be attracted to option 1 if they were confident that they could avoid a situation in which a sizable temporary increase in the overnight RRP cap became very long lived.	92	9
201501	950	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	For example, policymakers might judge that the Federal Reserve could communicate in advance its intention to reduce the overnight reverse repo cap if overnight reverse repo take-up did not increase much after liftoff and the additional capacity proved unnecessary.	92	9
201501	951	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	In addition, if overnight reverse repo take-up were quite elevated following liftoff, policymakers could indicate an intention to build up a sizable term reverse repo book or take other steps to return the size of overnight reverse repo operations and the overnight reverse repo cap to lower levels.	92	9
201501	952	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	Under option 2, shown in the far-right box, the FOMC would rely more heavily on the use of term reverse repos as a supplementary tool and would indicate its intention to boost the cap temporarily on overnight reverse repo operations by a more modest amount from, say, $300 billion to $400 billion.	92	9
201501	953	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	In addition, it would note that it intends to conduct term reverse repo operations in advance of liftoff, to help ensure that the overnight reverse repo cap does not bind at liftoff and thereafter.	92	9
201501	954	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	Option 2 might be attractive to policymakers who were concerned that a sizable increase in the overnight RRP cap, even if only temporary, could present financial stability and “footprint risks” and might also send a signal that the overnight reverse repo facility will remain quite large for an extended period.	92	9
201501	955	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	For policymakers who are confident that term reverse repo can be used to manage the size of the overnight reverse repo program, the advance use of term reverse repo operations envisioned in option 2 might be viewed as an effective way to mitigate such risks.	92	9
201501	956	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	It bears emphasizing that, while term reverse repo operations play an important role in both options 1 and 2, this potential role hinges importantly on an assumption that term reverse repo can substitute for overnight reverse repo to a significant degree.	92	9
201501	957	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	As Lorie noted earlier, it may be useful to conduct additional tests of term reverse repo away from quarter-ends to get a better handle on whether this assumption is correct.	92	9
201501	958	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	As noted in exhibit 3, apart from options 1 and 2, the memo notes some additional steps that policymakers could consider that might help to enhance control over short- term rates at the time of liftoff.	92	9
201501	959	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	These involve marginal adjustments in the spread between the IOER rate and the overnight RRP rate, changes in the level of the IOER and overnight RRP rates relative to the target range for the federal funds rate, and the possible use of term deposits.	92	9
201501	960	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	All of these steps arguably could help put upward pressure on short-term rates, but they have not figured prominently in the Committee’s discussions to date.	92	9
201501	961	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	Whatever operational strategy the Committee chooses to adopt, the memo notes that policymakers may wish to communicate at least some aspects of that strategy in advance to provide greater clarity to market participants and to enhance confidence that the Federal Reserve is well prepared to conduct a smooth liftoff.	92	9
201501	962	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	For example, it might be useful to provide additional information about the likely calibrations of policy tools and the likely ways they would be used in combination.	92	9
201501	963	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	This information, for example, could be provided in the minutes of future meetings, the Chair’s postmeeting press conference remarks, speeches, and testimonies.	92	9
201501	964	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	Shifting gears a bit, exhibit 4 summarizes some key takeaways from a memo that focused on aspects of the payment of interest on excess reserves that could raise some issues at the time of liftoff.	92	9
201501	965	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	Under our current approach, interest payments on excess reserves are based on the 14-day average concept of excess reserve balances.	92	9
201501	966	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	In particular, there is a single interest rate—currently calculated as the arithmetic average interest rate on excess reserves over the maintenance period—that is assumed to apply over the entire reserve maintenance period in computing the payment of interest on excess reserve balances.	92	9
201501	967	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	As noted in the memo, this can create some complications during those reserve maintenance periods in which policymakers may change the interest rate on excess reserves in the middle of the period.	92	9
201501	968	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	The memo offers a couple of possibilities for addressing this issue.	92	9
201501	969	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	In one option, the Federal Reserve could change the length of the reserve maintenance period from 14 days to 7 days.	92	9
201501	970	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	As long as the FOMC continued to announce its policy decisions on Wednesdays, changes in the IOER rate could then be aligned with the beginning of a new reserve maintenance period.	92	9
201501	971	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	This option is attractive in many respects, but it would also require thousands of depository institutions to change their internal systems to incorporate a 7-day maintenance period.	92	9
201501	972	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	Another option noted was to base the effective interest rate on excess reserves for the entire maintenance period on the interest on excess reserves rate at the end of the reserve maintenance period.	92	9
201501	973	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	This would help ensure that an increase in the IOER rate in the middle of a maintenance period fully supports the FOMC’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.	92	9
201501	974	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	However, it could also put upward pressure on the federal funds rate prior to the FOMC announcement if it was at least partly anticipated by market participants.	92	9
201501	975	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	A third option, not discussed in the memo, is to base interest payments more heavily on balances held each day and the interest rate on excess reserves in effect each day.	92	9
201501	976	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	This approach appears promising, and we are investigating the feasibility of that approach further.	92	9
201501	977	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	The final exhibit repeats the questions for discussion during the go-round that were provided to you earlier.	92	9
201501	978	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	In addition, we’ve added a question at the end that seeks your views on the usefulness of additional testing of term reverse repo away from quarter-ends along the lines Lorie described earlier as a way to get a better handle on the degree of substitution between overnight and term reverse repo.	92	9
201501	979	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	Thanks, and we’ll be happy to take your questions.	92	9
201501	980	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	92	9
201501	981	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Now I will ask the question, and President Rosengren may want to piggyback on this as well.	92	9
201501	982	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Jim, getting back to that question that President Rosengren posed earlier, based on what we’ve seen so far and the analysis you’ve been able to do, is there a nontrivial financial-stability benefit of using term RRP as opposed to ON RRP?	92	9
201501	983	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I’ll provide a little bit of context for that question.	92	9
201501	984	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I guess I had implicitly assumed, without thinking too much about it, that there was some benefit, if only because there would be a limitation on the ability to rush for the exits from other investments if it was term, as opposed to overnight.	92	9
201501	985	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	But, further thinking about this matter led me to think that if the terms are short enough to be consistent with SEC rules, then maybe there’s not much benefit after all.	92	9
201501	986	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	One way or another, as long as we’re providing a lot of absorption capacity, concerns about whether we are creating a new model for money market funds or making it easier for them to do this are what they are.	92	9
201501	987	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	But maybe it doesn’t make that much difference whether we use more overnight or term.	92	9
201501	988	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I guess the reason I think this is an important question is, if the answer is, “Yes, there’s not that much difference,” then we can talk about how to minimize financial-stability concerns with respect to a doubling of ON RRP.	92	9
201501	989	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	But at least that’s the only thing to be discussed, as opposed to whether we get a lot of benefit through a mix of the two.	92	9
201501	990	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I’m sorry, Eric.	92	9
201501	991	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Does that fairly capture your point?	92	9
201501	992	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Yes.	92	9
201501	993	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Why don’t I do a follow-on after they address your question?	92	9
201501	994	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Okay.	92	9
201501	995	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	I’ll offer my view, and Lorie and Simon may have others.	92	9
201501	996	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	I should preface my remarks by saying there’s a little bit of murkiness regarding these issues of financial stability, so I should admit that up-front.	92	9
201501	997	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	As you well know, the financial-stability arguments regarding the overnight reverse repo suggested that there’s an option value associated with it.	92	9
201501	998	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	In the case when financial markets are upset, investors can run to it because it’s a standing facility—or, more precisely, a standing facility with a cap that binds only in rare circumstances.	92	9
201501	999	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	For term reverse repo, you might argue that it presents somewhat less of a financial-stability risk, because people can’t go to it as readily.	92	9
201501	1000	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	It would be offered only on particular dates, not every day.	92	9
201501	1001	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	Moreover, we’d be fixing the size that we would be auctioning.	92	9
201501	1002	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	In addition, there is an immediate price response.	92	9
201501	1003	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	If a crisis happened to occur on the day on which we were auctioning term reverse repo, that would drive down the rate that we would get on the term reverse repo.	92	9
201501	1004	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	So I certainly wouldn’t argue that it’s devoid of the financial-stability risks of the type we discussed with regard to overnight reverse repo, but I think you could argue that it’s probably somewhat less.	92	9
201501	1005	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	There may also be another aspect to it.	92	9
201501	1006	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	This has a little bit of the flavor of the types of arguments that Governor Stein made about a crowding-out effect.	92	9
201501	1007	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	Insofar as you were auctioning term reverse repo on a regular basis and putting some upward pressure on term rates, you might induce some investors, like money funds, not to invest in things that they would flee from in a crisis.	92	9
201501	1008	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	That, at the margin, might also reduce financial-stability risks.	92	9
201501	1009	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	It’s very hard to quantify this.	92	9
201501	1010	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	I think that’s a pretty good summary.	92	9
201501	1011	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The other, simple part is that the amount of headroom that might be available in the overnight RRP, which is what people have been concerned about, would probably run a little bit lower if we had the term out there because you still have the overnight RRP at the same time.	92	9
201501	1012	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	And the concern most people expressed around this table is just a big rush, around noon sometime, into the overnight RRP.	92	9
201501	1013	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The idea would be to run with slightly lower headroom, on average, if we have the term than with just the ON RRP by itself.	92	9
201501	1014	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Although this is a slightly different perspective, thinking in terms of stress building as opposed to happening in an instantaneous fashion.	92	9
201501	1015	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	If we’re doing the term RRP, then, as in 2011, when the money market funds began to pull back, they get a couple of weeks to do it?	92	9
201501	1016	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	That’s what I was wondering.	92	9
201501	1017	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	To me, the two situations depend entirely on how stable the overnight RRP take-up is.	92	9
201501	1018	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	As an example, if it was completely stable and the headroom didn’t change, then moving some of it to term doesn’t really add any benefit.	92	9
201501	1019	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	If the overnight RRP take-up is very variable and moves around a lot, then moving some of it to term can improve financial stability because that headroom can fluctuate quite a bit.	92	9
201501	1020	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	So I think it depends on your assumption about the stability of the daily take-up.	92	9
201501	1021	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	But one thing that seems clear from looking at the tables you attached to this January 22 memo is that it is virtually all about money market funds, right?	92	9
201501	1022	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	Well, there’s variability, particularly from the GSEs, which move around a lot because of their payment dates.	92	9
201501	1023	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	But the money funds are fairly stable, except on quarter- end, when you see the prime funds come in and really move around.	92	9
201501	1024	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Right.	92	9
201501	1025	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	But I’m looking at the darkest-colored portion of the bars, which were the “other.”	92	9
201501	1026	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Those are pretty small.	92	9
201501	1027	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	But it could change tremendously when we lift off zero, and the dynamics could be very different.	92	9
201501	1028	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	We don’t know how those dynamics will evolve.	92	9
201501	1029	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I’m not sure where that leaves me, but thank you.	92	9
201501	1030	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	92	9
201501	1031	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	To follow up, on your illustrative option 1 on page 2, the second bullet is assuming that the term reverse repo is the preferred way to snug up the rates.	92	9
201501	1032	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	The other option would be that the interest on excess reserves could be raised at that point.	92	9
201501	1033	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	The memo was looking at the spread prior to liftoff, but I’m thinking more in terms of the situation after liftoff.	92	9
201501	1034	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Rather than using the term, why couldn’t we use IOER if we were finding that it was softer than we expected and make an adjustment at that point?	92	9
201501	1035	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	The memos seem to have a preference for term over adjustments with the IOER.	92	9
201501	1036	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I just wanted to see if that was accurate or not, because I thought our initial high-level position was that we were going to rely primarily on IOER, and this seems to change that a little bit.	92	9
201501	1037	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	No.	92	9
201501	1038	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	I’m sorry if we gave you that impression.	92	9
201501	1039	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	We certainly didn’t mean to suggest that.	92	9
201501	1040	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	We framed these two options because the results are with respect to behavior around the year-end and because of the new potential for possibly some substitution between overnight and reverse repo.	92	9
201501	1041	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	But you’re absolutely right that you would have a number of possible options that you could take after liftoff to snug up rates:  One might be raising the IOER, another might be raising the overnight RRP rate, and still another might be raising them both.	92	9
201501	1042	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	One potential issue you might face that you all have discussed previously relates to the fact that right now, investors seem to anticipate that the IOER would be at the top of the federal funds rate range, and that the overnight RRP rate would be at the bottom of the range.	92	9
201501	1043	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	Most participants seem to have agreed with this, and it’s in the minutes.	92	9
201501	1044	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	So if you’d be moving IOER after liftoff, you would be bumping it up relative to the federal funds target range.	92	9
201501	1045	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	Some people might argue that there could then be some confusion around having multiple rates.	92	9
201501	1046	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	You have a federal funds rate target range and an administered IOER rate that was at 55 basis points instead of 50 basis points, and so there could be a multiplicity of rates there that you might worry about.	92	9
201501	1047	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	But it’s certainly a possibility to do that.	92	9
201501	1048	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	92	9
201501	1049	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there’s another issue, too.	92	9
201501	1050	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s one thing having a system in place that you introduce ex ante, and it works.	92	9
201501	1051	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s another thing having a system that you put in place, and then, ex post, you make adjustments to it.	92	9
201501	1052	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	I think President Rosengren was suggesting that we would stay there.	92	9
201501	1053	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Well—except our rules were focused on the federal funds rate, which wouldn’t have been my preference, actually.	92	9
201501	1054	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	But, given that focus, it seems as though it would be the IOER.	92	9
201501	1055	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Alternatively, you could have had a strategy in which you set the IOER and didn’t make adjustments with the IOER, but that was not the consensus around the table.	92	9
201501	1056	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’m a little puzzled by the discussion.	92	9
201501	1057	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	We’ve said the primary objective is to hit a federal funds rate target in the range, and IOER is our primary tool.	92	9
201501	1058	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	So I would have thought, with those two rules, that I would have actually been moving the IOER for a technical adjustment after the fact, if it turned out that we were using reverses more than we expected.	92	9
201501	1059	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Can I add two things?	92	9
201501	1060	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Because Jim is always saying this to me—that this is what we should be doing.	92	9
201501	1061	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Two of the issues are, if it’s ex ante, that’s fine.	92	9
201501	1062	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	How would you feel if you just moved up the federal funds rate, and you moved up the federal funds rate so that there’s still quite a big wedge, but you got it just inside the target range?	92	9
201501	1063	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	So you’ve got this big gap there between the interest rate on excess reserves, which is generating income for the banks, and federal funds.	92	9
201501	1064	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	That’s one aspect.	92	9
201501	1065	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The other one is, we’re not sure how effective it will be on other money market rates.	92	9
201501	1066	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The normalization principles do start out with that concern with moving up other money market rates.	92	9
201501	1067	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	So there you get a little bit of insurance, on account of the RRPs, that you’re moving up both unsecured and secured rates.	92	9
201501	1068	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	This is a conversation we’ve had many times at this table—about how comfortable you are regarding large spreads between those unsecured and secured rates.	92	9
201501	1069	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	But we chose to use the federal funds rate, instead of short-term rates generally, when we did this.	92	9
201501	1070	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	So we did have that debate.	92	9
201501	1071	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Again, I would have preferred the general level of short-term rates, but that position lost around the table, and we chose the federal funds rate.	92	9
201501	1072	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	The consequence of that action would seem to be that we take no more action even if nothing moves other than the federal funds rate—that was the agreement we made around this table.	92	9
201501	1073	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Now, we could revisit that.	92	9
201501	1074	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	But as long as we have the same operating rules that we set out initially, it seems as though our target has been that we just have to get the federal funds rate in that range.	92	9
201501	1075	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	If nothing else moves relative to it, that is fine—we’ve done what we said we were going to do.	92	9
201501	1076	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Alternatively, we could go back and say we want to move short-term rates and not have the federal funds rate be the principal goal.	92	9
201501	1077	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	But that isn’t where we were when we actually agreed to the principles that we’ve set out to date.	92	9
201501	1078	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	That’s true.	92	9
201501	1079	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	92	9
201501	1080	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1081	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Jim, I’m trying to figure out something on the possibility of paying interest on a daily basis on whatever is held in the term facility.	92	9
201501	1082	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Add to that a statement Simon made somewhere, which is that the holders are very anxious to be able to break out of the term facility if they could get that.	92	9
201501	1083	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Now you’ve got a facility in which you’ve got people receiving the daily rate that we want to hold things more stable, that’s paying, and that’s got some of the funds.	92	9
201501	1084	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	So if there are movements in the daily rate, you may find them breaking unless you have a large penalty associated with going between the two facilities.	92	9
201501	1085	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	Right.	92	9
201501	1086	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	I think you’re speaking of the Term Deposit Facility, with a potential for having a floating rate.	92	9
201501	1087	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	This is actually an issue associated with our plain-vanilla excess reserve calculations, and we apologize for tormenting you with this very technical issue.	92	9
201501	1088	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	We pay interest every maintenance period based on the excess reserves as we calculate them over the reserve maintenance period.	92	9
201501	1089	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	We have a single rate that we apply against those excess reserves, and that has these funny issues arise when there is an anticipated change in the IOER in the middle of the maintenance period.	92	9
201501	1090	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	We’re stuck with that because, historically, interest on reserves had always been tied to reserve concepts—required reserves and excess reserves.	92	9
201501	1091	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	So, to pull this off—to switch to a system in which we’re paying more on daily balances—we actually have to kick off a rather extensive programming effort in the very near future to make this happen.	92	9
201501	1092	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	That’s one of the reasons why I just obliquely referred to a feasibility study.	92	9
201501	1093	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	The proposal that we’re putting forward is only really going to work, probably, for two or three years.	92	9
201501	1094	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	It works best when the interest rate on required and excess reserves are the same.	92	9
201501	1095	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	If the Committee were to get to a point at which you wanted to, again, make a distinction between the interest rate on required and the interest rate on excess, then there are a number of other tortuous complications that we would have to deal with.	92	9
201501	1096	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	But I think it may be a useful thing to do for two or three years until we get to a bit better place.	92	9
201501	1097	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	So we’re looking at that hard.	92	9
201501	1098	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Was the question whether, if you’re in a TDF and the interest on excess reserve rates goes up, you would want to break it and get into a deposit with the Fed?	92	9
201501	1099	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Was that your question?	92	9
201501	1100	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	I think it’s going to float over the IOER rate, so there wouldn’t be an incentive, right?	92	9
201501	1101	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	Well, there might be an incentive—that the breakage fee, of course, on the term deposit is quite rich.	92	9
201501	1102	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	The point I wanted to make is that, if you give them the right to—let’s say at no charge—get out of the term repo, then it’s just a repo with an option.	92	9
201501	1103	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	The bottom line was, there are thousands of programs in which you get paid daily interest, and what you describe is a major programming effort.	92	9
201501	1104	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I’m surprised that that’s a major programming effort.	92	9
201501	1105	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	There are many surprising things about our reserve calculations.	92	9
201501	1106	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	[Laughter]	92	9
201501	1107	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	The issue is that we collect huge amounts of data from thousands of depository institutions.	92	9
201501	1108	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	There are hundreds of thousands of lines of code in this program, and it’s never as easy as you think it should be.	92	9
201501	1109	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	But, having said all of that, we think we can accomplish it.	92	9
201501	1110	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	The other thing is, you can’t get rid of the anticipatory effects.	92	9
201501	1111	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	In any case, if people start expecting rates to go up, you’re going to get those things happening in whatever system you’ve got.	92	9
201501	1112	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	That’s right, but I think this would help because, on each day under this scheme, a bank, if it wants to hold an extra dollar of reserves, wouldn’t be considering the rate that would be in effect at the end of the period or the average rate over the period.	92	9
201501	1113	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	It would be considering the IOER rate that had been set for that day, and that seems like the right concept that you want to have when you’re controlling the federal funds rate on a daily basis.	92	9
201501	1114	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	So that’s the direction in which the staff is leaning right now, but we have some work to do before we can pull that off.	92	9
201501	1115	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	92	9
201501	1116	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I had a quick question of clarification on this.	92	9
201501	1117	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think you mentioned in passing that, in 2008, you solved the reverse problem by just doing the minimum over the time period.	92	9
201501	1118	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Why did you choose to go to the end of the period as one of your options here, rather than just doing the maximum?	92	9
201501	1119	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	Well, in effect, it’s the same thing.	92	9
201501	1120	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	I thought the end of the maintenance period, actually, was a clever idea.	92	9
201501	1121	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	Then you don’t have to specify it as the maximum or the minimum—it’s just the one at the end.	92	9
201501	1122	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	But the idea there is that, during normalization, most of the rate changes would be increases, so the pressure you would see would be primarily in the first week of the maintenance period for any of these cases in which the FOMC meeting was in the middle of the period.	92	9
201501	1123	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	But then, after the FOMC meeting happened, we’d have the full power of the IOER rate-change supporting the level of the federal funds rate.	92	9
201501	1124	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	That was one of the things we discussed in the memo, and it is sort of the symmetric treatment of the way we handled things in 2008.	92	9
201501	1125	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	But I think this third option actually may be a bit better.	92	9
201501	1126	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	92	9
201501	1127	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Jim, is the staff’s preference now the third option?	92	9
201501	1128	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	That’s where we’re leaning at the moment.	92	9
201501	1129	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	We have to do some more analysis.	92	9
201501	1130	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	When I read the memo, it sounded as though you were favoring the interest rate paid at the end of the reserve maintenance period.	92	9
201501	1131	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	That has the problem that it’s going to cause pressure on expectations that could create a lot of noise, especially as you’re going into liftoff, and it seems as though that’s not such an attractive option.	92	9
201501	1132	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	But you haven’t posed in the questions what kind of feedback you want from us on this?	92	9
201501	1133	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	At this stage, we would intend to do some more spade work ourselves and then report back to you, either in the form of a memo or perhaps at a future meeting.	92	9
201501	1134	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	We knew there was going to be a heavy lift to do the reprogramming.	92	9
201501	1135	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	We had thought about this for a while, but we’ve done some more pushing, and we think we could actually get it done by June if everything goes right.	92	9
201501	1136	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Okay.	92	9
201501	1137	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	My own personal preference is, I don’t like the end of the reserve maintenance period, because I think it’s going to just create noise.	92	9
201501	1138	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re doing all of these things to try to prevent noise.	92	9
201501	1139	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	So it seems to me as though this is another area in which you want to try to reduce the level of noise.	92	9
201501	1140	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	This requires a big effort.	92	9
201501	1141	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I know.	92	9
201501	1142	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	So I encourage you.	92	9
201501	1143	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	92	9
201501	1144	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	92	9
201501	1145	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Yes, I commend you for exploring this third option.	92	9
201501	1146	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	When I read the memo, that was the logical way to do it, and I was wondering why it was absent.	92	9
201501	1147	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	So I’m glad you guys have dug in and have found that a little more feasible.	92	9
201501	1148	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I would just point out that, in the period from 2004 to 2006, when we were raising rates—and I know this was a different world—we had a series of meetings at which it was almost certain, just a lock in markets, that we were going to raise rates a quarter point at the next meeting.	92	9
201501	1149	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Then we got upward pressure on the funds rate within the maintenance period a week ahead.	92	9
201501	1150	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Again, it wasn’t viewed as highly problematic for our conduct of monetary policy.	92	9
201501	1151	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	That’s in the spirit of our recommendations for the maximum or the end- of-period options.	92	9
201501	1152	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Right.	92	9
201501	1153	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	You’d get the same pressure ahead of time, but now it’s just part of market expectations because of the ability to arbitrage within the maintenance period.	92	9
201501	1154	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	One of the things that started to give us pause, though, was the possibility that the Committee might choose to raise rates a bit more than 25 basis points—	92	9
201501	1155	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	Then, when you roll into that maintenance period, you could really see quite substantive pressures on the funds rate in advance of that meeting.	92	9
201501	1156	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	But you’d be seeing pressure all along the curve at any rate.	92	9
201501	1157	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	One difference is, we had a point target, and there was some variation in that point target.	92	9
201501	1158	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Right now, it looks as though we’re going to have a range.	92	9
201501	1159	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	That’s what the normalization principles say.	92	9
201501	1160	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Yes, I know.	92	9
201501	1161	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	But this is about IOER, right?	92	9
201501	1162	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	I’m talking about the federal funds rate.	92	9
201501	1163	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The pressure could be reflected in the federal funds market.	92	9
201501	1164	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Right.	92	9
201501	1165	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	If the federal funds rate goes above 25 basis points, the directive says that the Desk has to take actions once that point is reached to try to push the federal funds rate back.	92	9
201501	1166	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Yes, but the same thing was true back then.	92	9
201501	1167	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	I agree, but that was a point target.	92	9
201501	1168	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Even though we’re pretty good at hitting it each day, we’re allowed some variation.	92	9
201501	1169	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The spectacle of going outside the target range is a little bit different.	92	9
201501	1170	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	You don’t think we’d think the same way about it?	92	9
201501	1171	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	I don’t know how you’d feel if it was trading at 35 basis points.	92	9
201501	1172	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Would you be okay if was trading at 35?	92	9
201501	1173	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Well, yes—if it’s for the same reasons and of the same magnitude as we got in 2005.	92	9
201501	1174	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	It makes perfect sense.	92	9
201501	1175	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	And the Committee has told us that you’re going to raise rates—that’s why we’re not doing it?	92	9
201501	1176	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	If it’s the first half of the maintenance period, before an FOMC meeting at which we’re widely expected to increase the IOER by 25 basis points, and the funds rate trades 5 or 10 basis points above range, personally, for me, I’ll pledge to forgive you.	92	9
201501	1177	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	92	9
201501	1178	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	All right.	92	9
201501	1179	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Just as I did in 2005.	92	9
201501	1180	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	President Lacker, it puts the Desk in a difficult position, because they don’t yet know the outcome of the meeting.	92	9
201501	1181	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The funds rate is trading firm relative to the target, and the Desk is supposed to keep it in the range.	92	9
201501	1182	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	They don’t know what the meeting decision is going to be.	92	9
201501	1183	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Just because it’s priced in to some degree doesn’t mean that the Committee is actually going to do it.	92	9
201501	1184	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	We faced the same problem in 2005—it was fine.	92	9
201501	1185	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	We did.	92	9
201501	1186	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	But we’re saying it could be larger this time.	92	9
201501	1187	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	So then you define your tolerance levels.	92	9
201501	1188	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I’ll come back to this, Madam Chair, in my comments.	92	9
201501	1189	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201501	1190	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Any further comments?	92	9
201501	1191	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201501	1192	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1193	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is an idea I have not thought through carefully, and I offer it with that caveat.	92	9
201501	1194	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I listened to some of the comments that President Plosser made and as I heard you express your own desire, Madam Chair, to have, quite naturally, a great deal of confidence about interest rate control, especially at the time of liftoff, I bring up the following possibility:  The timing of the decision by the Committee may not necessarily be the same as the timing of the first move in interest rates.	92	9
201501	1195	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	For example, in June, there’s a decision by the Committee that they want to raise interest rates.	92	9
201501	1196	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But, at the time that’s announced, the statement reads “as of July 2”—I’m making this up—after quarter-end, basically.	92	9
201501	1197	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	“As of July 2” is when the move in the federal funds rate will take place.	92	9
201501	1198	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This would pass you through the quarter-end.	92	9
201501	1199	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You could time it to deal with all of the maintenance-period stuff that Jim has talked through.	92	9
201501	1200	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So you could pick your day.	92	9
201501	1201	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As opposed to timing an interest rate increase on the Wednesday after the meeting, you instead announce in your statement, “Here’s the day it’s going to be coming,” and you’ve chosen it so that you get around all of these problems.	92	9
201501	1202	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The problem, I think, with doing that is, it raises all of these questions about, “Why are you doing it that way?	92	9
201501	1203	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Is there some problem that you have that you can’t do it the normal way?”	92	9
201501	1204	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I agree you could do it that way, but it would raise a lot of questions.	92	9
201501	1205	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Absolutely.	92	9
201501	1206	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The answer to those questions is that we don’t want to conflate the issues of quarter-end pressures with our interest rate increase.	92	9
201501	1207	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Anyway, if that’s the only issue, I think that can be talked through.	92	9
201501	1208	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I was more concerned about technical issues that the staff would be much more in a position to address.	92	9
201501	1209	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	But there are many central banks that operate that way.	92	9
201501	1210	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The Swiss announced the change in their policy rates about six weeks in advance of actually executing them.	92	9
201501	1211	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Well, not all of their policy changes.	92	9
201501	1212	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	92	9
201501	1213	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	I was going to use that as an example of how sometimes that’s not the best environment to be in.	92	9
201501	1214	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The Swiss had a very large effect on global financial markets.	92	9
201501	1215	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The Federal Reserve can have an effect on global financial markets much larger than that.	92	9
201501	1216	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Trying to explain this to international investors in a simple-to-communicate version of why we’re doing that would be difficult, because it would suggest we might be a little bit scared that we can’t actually raise rates before the quarter-end.	92	9
201501	1217	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	No—that’s fine.	92	9
201501	1218	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions?	92	9
201501	1219	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	92	9
201501	1220	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201501	1221	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	My suggestion is that we take a lunch break.	92	9
201501	1222	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Yes.	92	9
201501	1223	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	A breakfast break for me.	92	9
201501	1224	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	We can all second that.	92	9
201501	1225	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And then we will start the go-round on liftoff tools.	92	9
201501	1226	2015-01-28	meeting		[Lunch recess]	92	9
201501	1227	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	We have a lot to do this afternoon.	92	9
201501	1228	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Right now we’re going to have a full go-round on liftoff tools and possible liftoff options.	92	9
201501	1229	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And to start us off, President Evans.	92	9
201501	1230	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1231	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I prefer option 1 in the memo on illustrative approaches.	92	9
201501	1232	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I agree with you, Madam Chair, that when the time comes to raise rates, it’s important that we maintain as much monetary control as possible with regard to market rates.	92	9
201501	1233	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	The test conducted so far suggests that the ON RRP facility is effective in providing a floor for market rates.	92	9
201501	1234	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	The temporary increase in the aggregate cap would strengthen that floor and give market participants some headroom.	92	9
201501	1235	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I also support continued testing, as the Desk has proposed.	92	9
201501	1236	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I guess we still have that on the agenda to deal with.	92	9
201501	1237	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I’m not as concerned about the financial stability implications of such an action as I was in our earlier discussions.	92	9
201501	1238	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I had some more comments, but in the interest of time, I’m going to try to keep this short.	92	9
201501	1239	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	If needed, we can bring the term operations into play after liftoff, but the relative operational and interest cost complexity of the term tools make them better suited for the second line of defense.	92	9
201501	1240	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	We should continue to test the term tools as part of an effective risk-management program, but at this time I don’t see the need to deploy them before liftoff.	92	9
201501	1241	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	That said, I’m open to option 2 if the consensus prefers that route.	92	9
201501	1242	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	The alternatives that make small adjustments to the administered rates can also be used if needed, but the proposed changes by themselves might not be sufficient to pull market rates up.	92	9
201501	1243	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1244	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201501	1245	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	92	9
201501	1246	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1247	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I think we should be confident that increasing the IOER is going to result in a sufficiently smooth rise in short-term market rates when we raise the target range for the funds rate.	92	9
201501	1248	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	That’s my reading of the wide evidence we’ve gotten from the Desk operations and everything we’ve done so far.	92	9
201501	1249	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I think we should stick with our plan to use the overnight RRP program as insurance only against the possibility that there’s more slack, perhaps, in the relationship between IOER and market rates than we’ve seen at any time over the past six years.	92	9
201501	1250	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Using it as a backstop means a relatively wide spread to IOER, so I support the staff’s proposed spread of 25 basis points.	92	9
201501	1251	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	It’s wider than anything we’ve tested so far and, apart from quarter-ends, take-up has not exceeded $300 billion.	92	9
201501	1252	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	With a 25 basis point spread, I’d expect significantly smaller take-up.	92	9
201501	1253	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	But in any event, I’d be comfortable with a large cap at a 25 basis point spread.	92	9
201501	1254	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	So, $600 billion is the size suggested in option 1.	92	9
201501	1255	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I wouldn’t be against $800 billion or $1 trillion, just to be sure.	92	9
201501	1256	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	With such a large cap and a 25 basis point spread, I think we could be very confident that rates will be in that corridor.	92	9
201501	1257	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I think we should just make the cap temporarily as large as it needs to be for us to be comfortable that we’re going to be in that corridor.	92	9
201501	1258	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I think that’s the way to solve our problems.	92	9
201501	1259	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	We’re going to have volatility.	92	9
201501	1260	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	We could well have volatility on quarter-ends.	92	9
201501	1261	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	We always have had volatility on quarter-ends, and there probably always will.	92	9
201501	1262	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	The Desk has historically taken measures over quarter-end, back when we were in the old regime, to try to anticipate the shift in demand for reserves and to counteract that, but everyone recognized that that was a much more uncertain endeavor than off quarter-ends.	92	9
201501	1263	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	So markets realized that volatility—sort of the forecast error of the funds rate—was going to be exceptionally large over quarter-ends and recognized that it didn’t pose a fundamental problem for monetary policy effectiveness.	92	9
201501	1264	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	And I think that’s going to be the case now, even though quarter-end comes a week after one potential prominent liftoff date.	92	9
201501	1265	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	On the strictly macroeconomic side of thinking about liftoff, I agree with others who made the argument that the path for the policy rate we take over time is going to be more important than a particular date at which start raising rates.	92	9
201501	1266	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	For interest rate volatility, I think the behavior that interest rates display over the course of the month after liftoff is going to be much more consequential than what happens on the last day of June, if that’s when we choose to lift off.	92	9
201501	1267	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	So I don’t think one day’s movement a couple of days after our liftoff should concern you.	92	9
201501	1268	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I think simplicity is a virtue, and, as I said, it is clear we can implement monetary policy without a term RRP program.	92	9
201501	1269	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I think a term program might be tricky to introduce before a liftoff meeting without tipping our hand or signaling.	92	9
201501	1270	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I think that’s a delicate problem, but I suppose we could probably figure out a way to do that.	92	9
201501	1271	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I don’t think the alternative of making the program available now on a continuous basis is attractive because it would further encourage markets to believe that our whole RRP machinery, overnight and term, is more of a permanent feature of the financial landscape than I think we’re intending.	92	9
201501	1272	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	And as I said earlier, we face this tension between expectations getting out of control and wanting to learn some things, and I think we’ve learned what we need to learn.	92	9
201501	1273	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	It’s pretty clear that the pressure on rates going into quarter-end is related to the probability that the overnight facility caps out at quarter-end and rates get driven down.	92	9
201501	1274	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	With a large enough cap, that concern should be minimal, and we’re not likely to get any of the downward pressure leading into quarter-end that motivated the term RRP; the staff recognized this before we did the tests over the year-end.	92	9
201501	1275	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	So in the arguments made—why not use the tool just in case, kind of a belt-and-suspenders approach—I think we see and have seen that our rolling out of facilities like this on a sustained basis builds a constituency.	92	9
201501	1276	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Building a constituency for a program makes it difficult or costly for us to contemplate pulling back, and I think we’ve seen that in the primary dealer survey data that I talked about.	92	9
201501	1277	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	So I would favor option 1, and I’d be opposed to any further testing of term RRPs now.	92	9
201501	1278	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I think we know enough about how they work.	92	9
201501	1279	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I think rolling them out, if it seems warranted, in the weeks after we raise rates is the way to keep that extra capability in reserve.	92	9
201501	1280	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1281	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201501	1282	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	92	9
201501	1283	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1284	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Raising rates as announced at the time of liftoff is essential for maintaining our credibility.	92	9
201501	1285	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	In particular, quickly moving the federal funds rate into the range we announce should be our primary operational goal at liftoff.	92	9
201501	1286	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	To enforce the range we set, we need to guarantee a floor.	92	9
201501	1287	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we are using the reverse repo facility to set the floor price, we need to be flexible on the quantity of reverse repos.	92	9
201501	1288	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Hence, setting the floor may require the forceful use of our tools at the time of liftoff.	92	9
201501	1289	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is likely that the more vigorous use of the reverse repo facility will be temporary, so we should be able to quickly reduce it as we better understand the factors that influence the spread between the IOER and the reverse repo rates.	92	9
201501	1290	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	To avoid disruption to financial markets, we should announce our intention to use the reverse repo facility as a temporary measure to ensure a smooth liftoff.	92	9
201501	1291	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Assuming that we announce a target range of 25 to 50 basis points at liftoff, I would set the IOER at a level where we can expect to achieve at least the 25 basis point floor with our usual reverse repo cap.	92	9
201501	1292	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, I would announce no reverse repo cap at first in order to allow the overnight reverse repo to enforce the floor, should our estimates prove wrong.	92	9
201501	1293	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	We have a lot to learn about managing the federal funds rate using a method that we have not used before.	92	9
201501	1294	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	We could then make a technical correction of the IOER, if needed, to maintain the federal funds rate within the 25 to 50 basis point range without needing to rely so heavily on overnight reverse repos.	92	9
201501	1295	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Removing the reverse repo cap during the time of liftoff would convincingly convey our commitment to raise rates, possibly requiring less use of reverse repos.	92	9
201501	1296	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Two financial-stability concerns about the reverse repo facility have been raised.	92	9
201501	1297	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	The first is that use of the facility could alter the structure of the money markets.	92	9
201501	1298	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Announcing the temporary nature of the program should lower this risk.	92	9
201501	1299	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	By keeping the window short when we lift off and making appropriate adjustments without delay, it should be clear through our actions that our thinking on permanence has not changed.	92	9
201501	1300	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	The other financial stability concern is the possible flight to the facility during times of severe stress.	92	9
201501	1301	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, if there is a significant negative shock that results in a substantial flight of funds to the reverse repo program, the appropriate response would be to postpone liftoff until the effects of the negative shock were better understood.	92	9
201501	1302	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Allowing for a significant temporary increase in the overnight reverse repo facility would be advisable.	92	9
201501	1303	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would go one step further and announce no path at the time of liftoff.	92	9
201501	1304	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	In terms of part b of that question, if the Committee is willing to have no reverse repo cap at liftoff, term reverse repos would not be necessary.	92	9
201501	1305	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	The lower the cap, the more we need to use term repos.	92	9
201501	1306	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would note that I do not see a financial-stability preference for term reverse repos over overnight reverse repos.	92	9
201501	1307	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Term reverse repos would also likely be transacted primarily with money market funds.	92	9
201501	1308	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	They do expand our footprint, and they lock us into longer periods than may be advisable.	92	9
201501	1309	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	They will also be more expensive than overnight reverse repos.	92	9
201501	1310	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	The memos seem to imply that caps supplemented with term reverse repos will result in a lower risk of financial stability than a program with only overnight reverse repos.	92	9
201501	1311	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’d like to understand this argument better.	92	9
201501	1312	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Finally, the strategy of using term reverse repos prior to liftoff as a way of smoothing the withdrawal of reserves seems like an unusual strategy, because the higher rate announced on term reverse repos would, in effect, be the action of lifting off.	92	9
201501	1313	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	In terms of part c of the question, if the Committee is willing to proceed without a cap at the outset, then there is not much advantage to making other adjustments.	92	9
201501	1314	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	In contrast, if we are going to cap the reverse repo at liftoff, we will need to make flexible use of term reverse repos.	92	9
201501	1315	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, because I do not find the financial-stability concerns significantly reduced by lengthening the maturity of reverse repos, and because they are more costly, using term reverse repos to enable arbitrarily limiting the cap on overnight reverse repos seems suboptimal.	92	9
201501	1316	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I do not see much benefit in narrowing the IOER–reverse repo spread or using term deposits, at least until we have obtained a better sense of the effectiveness of our initial move to liftoff.	92	9
201501	1317	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	One final point.	92	9
201501	1318	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	There has not been much discussion of how international flows would affect our liftoff.	92	9
201501	1319	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	With bank reserves in many countries receiving a negative interest rate, announcing an increase in our overnight risk-free rates may make reverse repos very attractive to foreign capital.	92	9
201501	1320	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Better understanding that dynamic would be useful.	92	9
201501	1321	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1322	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201501	1323	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	92	9
201501	1324	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1325	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I am prepared to support the use, at liftoff, of an expanded reverse repo program to add some insurance.	92	9
201501	1326	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I expect later today to vote to authorize quarter-end reverse repo testing, indicating—and I’m generally supportive of continuing to investigate the potential of this tool for use during and after liftoff, and that would include staff development of proposals for design and implementation of continuing term repo operations.	92	9
201501	1327	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	When we first discussed the overnight reverse repo proposal at the July meeting, I had more confidence than some others in the power of the interest on excess reserves as a tool of monetary control, much like President Lacker’s sentiments.	92	9
201501	1328	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	The consensus of the Committee has gravitated to the view that a smooth liftoff is paramount, and I accept that and I consider that to be the starting point for discussion of the questions presented for this round.	92	9
201501	1329	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	All things considered, for planning purposes, I think smooth-liftoff considerations trump more speculative concerns about financial stability at the point of implementation of the liftoff decision and the near-term aftermath.	92	9
201501	1330	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	As a practical matter, financial stability concerns are not likely to be center stage at the time we would choose to lift off.	92	9
201501	1331	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Today I am reacting to the questions posed to this go-round in general terms without stating definite preferences regarding configuration details.	92	9
201501	1332	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I want to hear the discussion, but there is a context in my mind for detailed decisions that needs to be fleshed out.	92	9
201501	1333	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Specifically, I would appreciate hearing more about an exit plan for the reverse repo tool.	92	9
201501	1334	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	This would address both the need for reverse repo programs as normalization proceeds and the potential methods of phasing out the programs.	92	9
201501	1335	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	At the back of my mind is the concern that once liftoff has been accomplished with a facility larger, say, than the current $300 billion, it will be difficult to argue that continuing with a large program is not required for exactly the reasons we are considering a larger program now, and that is uncertainty about monetary control with a smaller program.	92	9
201501	1336	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	On the question of other possible adjustments, again, I’d like to hear more discussion, and I could get more comfortable, but at this point I’m disinclined to favor using spread tightening and relative range adjustments unless clearly needed to correct a situation of demonstrated inadequate control.	92	9
201501	1337	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I also think this type of tactical option has to be looked at in light of exit ease or difficulty.	92	9
201501	1338	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	So if I had my druthers, I would use the March meeting to refine and come to closure on the detailed implementation plan and the guidelines for the use of tools informed by more thinking on how reverse repo programs would ultimately be phased out.	92	9
201501	1339	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1340	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	92	9
201501	1341	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	92	9
201501	1342	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1343	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I think it’s very important that at liftoff we demonstrate that we have the necessary tools to move short-term interest rates up and into our target range.	92	9
201501	1344	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Unlike some of the speakers so far, I have a slight preference for using the term RRPs in conjunction with the overnight RRPs rather than raising the size of the overnight facility too high.	92	9
201501	1345	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	At the margin, I prefer a smaller facility to help limit risk to financial stability, and I guess I see the term RRPs as having slightly less risk in that respect.	92	9
201501	1346	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	The memo lays out some caveats about term RRPs, but I think additional tests at the end of March should help alleviate concerns that they are more complicated to implement.	92	9
201501	1347	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I would have some misgivings about extending testing too far into the quarter, though, because I think there is going to be an interaction between our testing schedule and inferences about liftoff.	92	9
201501	1348	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	But other than that, I think testing will help.	92	9
201501	1349	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Despite my slight preference for option 2, if the Committee, on the advice of the Desk, thought it better to rely more heavily on overnight RRPs, option 1 in the memo, I would support it.	92	9
201501	1350	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	In this case, it would be important to be clear that the increase in size was not expected to be permanent and that its purpose was to help ensure a smooth liftoff.	92	9
201501	1351	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Our communications should remain consistent with our normalization principles, which say we intend to phase out the facility, so that market participants don’t establish longer-term business strategies that rely on the facility.	92	9
201501	1352	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	The testing to date has provided some good information suggesting that a $600 billion combined capacity of term and overnight RRPs may give us enough control of interest rates.	92	9
201501	1353	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	But I think we need to remember that what works in a testing environment may not work as well in production.	92	9
201501	1354	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	We need to be prepared to make necessary adjustments along the way and be open to using different combinations of our tools.	92	9
201501	1355	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	We might decide we prefer heavier use of term RRPs rather than an even larger overnight facility.	92	9
201501	1356	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	We are going to gain information as we begin liftoff.	92	9
201501	1357	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I wouldn’t rule out dynamic caps on overnight RRPs, narrowing the spread between the IOER and the overnight RRP rate, or using term deposits, although I don’t see a need to start there.	92	9
201501	1358	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	No matter what approach we take, the communication explaining what we’re doing and why we’re doing it is going to be, perhaps, nearly as important as the actual approach.	92	9
201501	1359	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	We should give the markets and the public an outline of the approach we’re using, but be clear that some things are unknowable in advance and that aspects may very well need to be adjusted as we go.	92	9
201501	1360	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	We said this in our normalization principles, and it is probably worth reiterating at liftoff.	92	9
201501	1361	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1362	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201501	1363	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	92	9
201501	1364	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1365	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	A smooth liftoff is desirable for establishing confidence in the ability of the FOMC to normalize the conduct of monetary policy.	92	9
201501	1366	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I think we all agree with that.	92	9
201501	1367	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	By smooth, I mean a liftoff in which the funds rate trades somewhere between IOER and the ON RRP rate on a fairly consistent basis.	92	9
201501	1368	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	That does not mean every moment of every day.	92	9
201501	1369	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Whether those trades are near the midpoint or not of the range is also not important, as far as I’m concerned, and we should not suggest that that’s part of our objective.	92	9
201501	1370	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	In this regard, I would be comfortable starting off with a somewhat generous cap and a spread of 25 basis points between the IOER rate and the ON RRP.	92	9
201501	1371	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	However, I also would be comfortable with a smaller cap and a larger spread or range.	92	9
201501	1372	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	This is a tradeoff along these dimensions of program design that really exists, but it depends on the Committee’s tolerance for volatility of the effective funds rate.	92	9
201501	1373	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I probably have a greater tolerance for that volatility than some in this regard, but I think it’s a discussion worth continuing to have.	92	9
201501	1374	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Regarding cap size, research done by my staff indicates that the $400 billion cap would probably be sufficient.	92	9
201501	1375	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	As rates rise, the federal funds market should be able to absorb a substantial portion of any increase in the supply of funds.	92	9
201501	1376	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I would also note that in our experiments to date, even at the quarter-ends, the $400 billion cap has been pretty close to being sufficient, and those are pretty good experiments.	92	9
201501	1377	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	But I also wouldn’t mind a $600 billion cap.	92	9
201501	1378	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	However, accompanying the announcement of whatever the size of our cap is, I believe it is crucial for us to reemphasize that the ON RRP facility is intended to be temporary and that we will reduce its size if circumstances allow.	92	9
201501	1379	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Indeed, perhaps by starting with the somewhat larger cap, say the $600 billion, like in option 1, we could get through quarter-end in June, and maybe for a few weeks, and then actually announce that it’s going to be smaller because it doesn’t need to be.	92	9
201501	1380	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	And so that first directional change in the size of the cap might be useful and important to get us started and to signal to the market that we really do intend to shrink this facility.	92	9
201501	1381	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I also agree with the Chair that we should keep things as simple as possible.	92	9
201501	1382	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	In particular, operating with two instruments, the IOER and the ON RRP, should be sufficient for normalization.	92	9
201501	1383	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m leery of the complexity of other policy tools, particularly the term RRPs.	92	9
201501	1384	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Term RRPs have more moving parts; we are less certain of their effectiveness and the substitutability they have with the overnight RRPs.	92	9
201501	1385	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I do not favor us getting into the business of complicated financial engineering.	92	9
201501	1386	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Too many policy tools that operate along too many different margins are liable to confuse us as well as the markets, with relatively little benefit.	92	9
201501	1387	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Dealing with more margins also opens the door for a wide range of unintended consequences when it comes to the longer-term ramifications for market structure, something this Committee has expressed concern about.	92	9
201501	1388	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	While I could imagine a term RRP facility that would primarily serve to help smooth window-dressing-induced funds volatility at the end of quarters, I’m dubious of this benefit and would be inclined to oppose it.	92	9
201501	1389	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	In other words, doing something separate at the end of quarters seems to me to draw attention to it rather than just making the cap on overnight RRPs large enough to accommodate at least in the first instance.	92	9
201501	1390	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	This type of year-end or quarter-end volatility is self-induced by reporting practices and the efforts of firms to report balance sheets that may not truly be representative of their average positions.	92	9
201501	1391	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I see no reason for us to care or to be complicit in subsidizing this behavior.	92	9
201501	1392	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Let the firms pay the price for this practice if they are inclined to do so.	92	9
201501	1393	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	It is unlikely to have any material effect on macroeconomic performance or our goals and objectives.	92	9
201501	1394	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	It is just too transitory.	92	9
201501	1395	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	It would serve us well at the outset to be explicit about this perspective up front to avoid having market participants expect us to intervene on these occasions.	92	9
201501	1396	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	And once we set up separate term RRPs just for the quarter-end—once we do that once—the expectation is going to be set and it’s going to be hard to unwind from that.	92	9
201501	1397	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	More generally, I’m simply not concerned about infrequent or occasional volatility that leads the funds rate to trade above or below our target range.	92	9
201501	1398	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	We were asked about what things could help during this normalization.	92	9
201501	1399	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I would remind us that we are facing these operational issues surrounding liftoff because we have a very large balance sheet.	92	9
201501	1400	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	In view of the uncertainty we face going forward during normalization, I think it would be helpful if we would begin reducing the size of the balance sheet and, thus, the quantity of excess reserves that we have to deal with in these circumstances.	92	9
201501	1401	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	We could easily begin by immediately ceasing to reinvest maturing principal payments.	92	9
201501	1402	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	And as we saw in the Desk report, the prospects for ever-larger purchases of MBS just to solve our reinvestment problem is going to get bigger rather than smaller over time.	92	9
201501	1403	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	So I see now might be a good time to stop that, so that we don’t have to intervene even more.	92	9
201501	1404	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I see very little cost or risk in taking such a step.	92	9
201501	1405	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	The sooner we start, the sooner we’ll arrive at a situation in which we can start reducing the size of the ON RRP facility and return to business as usual.	92	9
201501	1406	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Only then will we achieve full normalization.	92	9
201501	1407	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1408	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201501	1409	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	92	9
201501	1410	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1411	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I have three remarks and a general conclusion.	92	9
201501	1412	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	The general conclusion is that I support the use of a temporarily larger cap on the overnight reverse repo program at the time of liftoff, along the lines of option 1.	92	9
201501	1413	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I also support the use of term repos in sizes viewed as helpful during this period.	92	9
201501	1414	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	My three remarks concern the following areas.	92	9
201501	1415	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	One, the likely timing and source of possible market volatility impinging on federal funds rate control.	92	9
201501	1416	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Two, the risk of financial instability associated with a larger overnight reverse repo program than presently contemplated.	92	9
201501	1417	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	And, three, the size of the Federal Reserve footprint in financial markets.	92	9
201501	1418	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Considering the first area, the likely timing and source of possible market volatility, the memoranda for this meeting touching on this subject seemed to suggest that the date of liftoff is special with respect to the possible implications for market volatility, and, therefore, for control of the federal funds rate.	92	9
201501	1419	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	It is possible, however, that market volatility may not be especially high at liftoff versus other times.	92	9
201501	1420	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	This may be especially true if we telegraph our date of liftoff fairly accurately, as we seem destined to do.	92	9
201501	1421	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	The memo on initialization of normalization cycles in foreign countries suggested that the liftoff itself was often not a moment of confusion and volatility in financial markets, but that when such moments occurred they were often at some other critical juncture in the normalization process.	92	9
201501	1422	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Indeed, financial market volatility is more likely to be caused by a violent reconciliation of a mismatch between financial market expectations of monetary policy and Committee intentions.	92	9
201501	1423	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	We have a grand example of such a reconciliation in the so-called taper tantrum during the summer of 2013.	92	9
201501	1424	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	That episode did not involve raising rates, nor did it even involve any actual change in the pace of excess purchases.	92	9
201501	1425	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	We do have considerable mismatch today, arguably, based on differences in the Committee intentions as suggested by the SEP versus market expectations as suggested by futures markets trading, as outlined in the staff memo relating to this subject.	92	9
201501	1426	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	When and how this mismatch will be resolved remains an open question at this point, but potentially any reconciliation could involve substantial market volatility and could occur at a point in the normalization cycle other than the liftoff date itself.	92	9
201501	1427	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	These considerations suggest that use of a higher cap or other method to mitigate any risk should not be confined only to the time period around liftoff.	92	9
201501	1428	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	For this reason, I would advocate expanding the notion of “temporary” to include most of the normalization period and not just the time around liftoff.	92	9
201501	1429	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	The second area I wish to address is the nexus between the size of the overnight reverse repo program and the risks of financial instability.	92	9
201501	1430	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	In discussions with my staff, I have concluded that I simply do not think we have a credible and compelling story concerning the nature of this risk sufficient to suggest that a $600 billion program is more risky than a $300 billion program in a meaningful way.	92	9
201501	1431	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	For this reason, I lean toward a larger program and the tangible benefits that that may bring with respect to our normalization policy.	92	9
201501	1432	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	The third area I wanted to comment on concerns the Federal Reserve’s footprint in financial markets, which some wish to keep to a minimum.	92	9
201501	1433	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Normally, I would find this a reasonable goal, but in the current situation I think we are already such a large player in financial markets that we may be better advised to manage our risk carefully rather than to try to keep our interventions to a minimum.	92	9
201501	1434	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	For this reason, I again come down on the side of using available tools to our advantage in securing a successful liftoff.	92	9
201501	1435	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1436	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201501	1437	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	92	9
201501	1438	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1439	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	As I weigh these issues, I view a lack of control over short-term rates at liftoff as an unlikely but a very costly event and one to be avoided.	92	9
201501	1440	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	So I, too, favor option 1, as outlined by the staff.	92	9
201501	1441	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	The testing experience of the overnight RRP and our communication of policy normalization principles and plans give me confidence that the overnight RRP, on a temporary basis, can be an effective way to support rates at liftoff, if necessary, but also to temper the financial stability issues associated with its use.	92	9
201501	1442	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	If needed, I would also support the use of term RRPs after liftoff to ensure the funds rate trades in our targeted range.	92	9
201501	1443	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of the other possible adjustments that were outlined in the memo, I support maintaining a wide spread between IOER and the ON RRP rate, along with a sufficiently large cap that rarely binds, as well as using term deposits.	92	9
201501	1444	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	I’d prefer keeping the option of adjusting the IOER and the ON RRP band or narrowing the spread between these two rates.	92	9
201501	1445	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	This approach is to be used only after liftoff and only in the event that the federal funds rate fails to trade within our targeted range.	92	9
201501	1446	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	92	9
201501	1447	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201501	1448	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	92	9
201501	1449	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1450	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	To best achieve our mandated goals, it is crucial that we’re able to maintain effective monetary control at the time of liftoff and throughout the normalization process.	92	9
201501	1451	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Equally important, we must leave no doubt in the public’s mind that we have effective control over interest rates during this period when all eyes will be on the Federal Reserve.	92	9
201501	1452	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’ve been taking notes to see if I’ve got the whole list right, but basically my remaining comments echo very much those of Presidents Evans, Lacker, Rosengren, and Bullard, which is for sure the first time I’ve ever said that.	92	9
201501	1453	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	92	9
201501	1454	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	And President George, too, actually.	92	9
201501	1455	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Our communications regarding policy normalization or testing of different facilities have helped prepare market participants.	92	9
201501	1456	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ve consistently assured the public that we have the tools to raise rates when needed.	92	9
201501	1457	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ve explained the broad outlines of how we will use these tools.	92	9
201501	1458	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	In looking ahead, we really need to minimize the risk of any missteps coming out of the gate that could raise concerns about the effectiveness of our tools to keep the funds rate in its target range.	92	9
201501	1459	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, demonstrating monetary control when we start normalization will increase market confidence in our ability to steer the economy, reduce market volatility, and facilitate the pursuit of our objectives.	92	9
201501	1460	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I view the approach described in option 1 as most likely to achieve this outcome.	92	9
201501	1461	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I want to remind everyone that we made clear in our policy principles and plans back in September that we will primarily use the IOER rate to move the federal funds rate into the relative target range, and the overnight reverse repo facility supplements it as needed to increase monetary control.	92	9
201501	1462	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Importantly, we also indicated that the reverse repo facility will be phased out when it’s no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate.	92	9
201501	1463	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	So we’ve already told everybody that this will be temporary and will only be used as needed.	92	9
201501	1464	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I therefore view option 1 as entirely consistent with the strategy that we’ve laid out.	92	9
201501	1465	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	It keeps the approach as clear and simple as possible.	92	9
201501	1466	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	And one issue, of course, is the size of the cap on the repo facility, and I, like many of the others, have difficulty in saying, you know, it’s $400, $600, $800, $1 trillion.	92	9
201501	1467	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	What are the costs in terms of financial stability and the benefits there?	92	9
201501	1468	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think it’s really impossible to judge ex ante the optimal size of the facility and the tradeoffs between financial stability, footprint issues, and effectiveness.	92	9
201501	1469	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I do think that the analysis that’s been done so far suggests that what is really important is that we have sufficient headroom for this to be effective, and in my own view it would be prudent to set a cap that’s significantly high.	92	9
201501	1470	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I thought the $600 billion would be viewed by this group as already pretty high, but clearly people have suggested even higher might be optimal.	92	9
201501	1471	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I’m going to make kind of a nuanced point.	92	9
201501	1472	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t see this as raising the cap—and this actually gets back to President Lacker’s point earlier.	92	9
201501	1473	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	When we did the testing of $300 billion, that was clearly stated not to be our policy decision of how big the overnight reverse repo facility was going to be.	92	9
201501	1474	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is not raising it from $300 billion to $600 billion.	92	9
201501	1475	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is just setting what it will be initially, whatever that number is.	92	9
201501	1476	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I would prefer not to communicate this as saying that we’re raising this in some way.	92	9
201501	1477	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’re setting the cap at the level that is the most appropriate to achieve monetary control, and, of course, as time goes on and we learn more, we can reduce the cap as appropriate.	92	9
201501	1478	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, again, I don’t see the risk to financial stability or regarding footprint issues to be that significant.	92	9
201501	1479	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is a temporary program.	92	9
201501	1480	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ve indicated that, and we will reduce it and phase it out as appropriate.	92	9
201501	1481	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m confident that, under option 1, we have the necessary tools to maintain monetary control during the normalization period.	92	9
201501	1482	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I really think that this is an appropriate option when viewed in terms of our basic strategy.	92	9
201501	1483	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s simple, and I think it follows the plans and principles we laid out.	92	9
201501	1484	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	On the other issues, in terms of spreads, I agree, like others, that with a wide spread initially, as we discussed, I would only see adjusting the spread of the IOER and the overnight reverse repo rates as something you would only do if it was necessary, if the other tools that we were using weren’t working.	92	9
201501	1485	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I see the TDF as always a backup facility—again, there to support if needed.	92	9
201501	1486	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of testing the term reverse repo facility, I am in favor of continuing the test for March.	92	9
201501	1487	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that there is an open question about the value of further testing of a daily or a regular term reverse repo facility as, again, another backstop.	92	9
201501	1488	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	So we’re now talking about belts and suspenders, more belts, more suspenders.	92	9
201501	1489	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do think if you were to test it too extensively, it would lead people to think this is something we were going to use, and something to think about, although I don’t see any problems with the testing around the quarter-end because I think that, to me, would be limited.	92	9
201501	1490	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do think I’m not opposed to the further testing of the term reverse repo, but again, I think it just creates some additional communication challenges for us.	92	9
201501	1491	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think IOER is our first line of defense.	92	9
201501	1492	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Overnight reverse repo with a sizable cap is the support, and then we have these other tools behind.	92	9
201501	1493	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	It is already pretty complicated.	92	9
201501	1494	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	We don’t want to make it too complicated.	92	9
201501	1495	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	92	9
201501	1496	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201501	1497	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201501	1498	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1499	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m happy to go along with the consensus of the room on the questions being posed by the staff.	92	9
201501	1500	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It sounded to me like the consensus is building in support of option 1, with possibly even a higher cap, if needed.	92	9
201501	1501	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m comfortable going along with that.	92	9
201501	1502	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I wanted to highlight some of the comments that I heard around the table as being ones that I felt particularly resonated with me.	92	9
201501	1503	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought President Rosengren’s question about international cash flows is one that I had not thought about and would be useful for the Committee to explore further.	92	9
201501	1504	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought President Mester’s comment about emphasizing the temporary nature of what we’re doing is really critical.	92	9
201501	1505	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	President Williams is right to highlight that we’ve already made reference to the fact that we intend this facility to be temporary.	92	9
201501	1506	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On the other hand, that September 2014 communication replaced a June 2011 communication.	92	9
201501	1507	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I think it would be useful for us to cement what we said in September in an ongoing fashion, especially if we go larger, because there might be a temptation to think that’s going to mean we’re going to go longer as well.	92	9
201501	1508	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we just have to be clear in our communications, on an ongoing basis, that we intend this to be a temporary facility.	92	9
201501	1509	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	A tension I heard along those lines is President Bullard’s comment about timing: is liftoff really going to be special in some of the considerations we heard?	92	9
201501	1510	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Are we not always going to be concerned about, well, we’ve got to get the interest rate in the range?	92	9
201501	1511	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And that led me to be very sympathetic to President Lockhart’s question or suggestion that we explore and communicate clearly what we have in mind about an exit plan from this facility.	92	9
201501	1512	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that would help bring clarity to our commitment to having this be a temporary facility.	92	9
201501	1513	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Overall, as I said, I’m willing to be supportive of whatever consensus emerges from our discussion.	92	9
201501	1514	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I guess the one point I’ll close with, Madam Chair, is that in my own thinking, this conversation is premature.	92	9
201501	1515	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The time is simply not right for liftoff.	92	9
201501	1516	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I’ll explain in later go- rounds, the evolution of the data in the past six months means we should be discussing how to solidify the credibility of our inflation target.	92	9
201501	1517	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We’ve heard a lot of conversations about credibility already today.	92	9
201501	1518	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll be talking about credibility as well, about the credibility of that 2 percent goal, and that means providing more accommodation, not less.	92	9
201501	1519	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So our topic, I think, should be turning more to how we can use tools to ease financial market conditions and bolster the credibility of that inflation target and less about how we plan to tighten in the near term.	92	9
201501	1520	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1521	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201501	1522	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	92	9
201501	1523	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Well, assuming that we will tighten at one point and we will have liftoff at some point, Madam Chair, I want to make a few comments here.	92	9
201501	1524	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Obviously, we all want to maximize the odds that liftoff will be smooth.	92	9
201501	1525	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Governor Brainard underscored the precious nature of the current circumstance.	92	9
201501	1526	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Simon pointed out we haven’t done this before.	92	9
201501	1527	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I think the markets understand, to a degree, that we’re feeling our way.	92	9
201501	1528	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	For me, provided that yields on securities that have maturities of a few weeks and longer respond appropriately, some initial temporary departure of overnight rates from the intended target range at liftoff would be inconsequential.	92	9
201501	1529	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I think President Lacker has made that point.	92	9
201501	1530	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I agree.	92	9
201501	1531	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I don’t think they have a material effect on the real economy.	92	9
201501	1532	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	It’s important, of course, that we do, however, have fallback plans.	92	9
201501	1533	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	One thing I didn’t see in the papers—I may not have read them thoroughly— were I the New York Desk and explaining this to the Committee, I’d want to see some alternative scenario planning, some decision tree analysis, and some definition of our tolerance limits.	92	9
201501	1534	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	That would make sense to me.	92	9
201501	1535	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	So it’s a respectful suggestion.	92	9
201501	1536	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I think that’s the way I would approach it.	92	9
201501	1537	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	We have, as many have pointed out, promised that the ON RRP would be temporary and used only as necessary to maintain control of monetary policy during normalization.	92	9
201501	1538	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	That promise was made for good reasons.	92	9
201501	1539	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	We shouldn’t take lightly actions that might lead the public and financial institutions to doubt our intention to honor it.	92	9
201501	1540	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I believe under the previous Chairman I actually quoted my mother—who I think stole it from Kierkegaard or maybe Santayana, and certainly not from the Kardashians—on the following:  “Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and it needs to be carefully guarded before it’s surrendered.”	92	9
201501	1541	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	[Laughter]	92	9
201501	1542	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1543	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I won’t tell you what she said after that, but—okay, after that she said, “And then have a lot of fun,” but that’s a separate thing.	92	9
201501	1544	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I do think there is some skepticism in the marketplace about the temporary nature of this facility, and here’s why I mention this.	92	9
201501	1545	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	We can throw out numbers like $1 trillion or $600 billion.	92	9
201501	1546	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	However, I think we have to be very careful about whatever number we choose and not be indiscriminate with a large number because it might undermine the confidence that this is a temporary facility and, again, indicate that we’re not so chaste in the use of this facility.	92	9
201501	1547	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I would be very, very careful about throwing out numbers.	92	9
201501	1548	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	My second point is—I think President Lockhart makes an excellent suggestion—I don’t know how we do it, but we should at least have in our own mind what the exit strategy should be for using the program.	92	9
201501	1549	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	In summary, I would prefer to start with an ON RRP program, maybe $600 billion but no larger.	92	9
201501	1550	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I’d supplement with term RRPs at quarter-ends, perhaps term deposits, and only move to a more aggressive use of RRPs if it’s critical to maintain the floor.	92	9
201501	1551	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	And I’d be very careful in using it in any way that would undermine the confidence of the markets that this is a temporary facility.	92	9
201501	1552	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	With regard to term RRPs, I understand from our discussion today that there are pros and cons, but they could be close substitutes, and we have established a precedent of engaging in term RRP operations at times when there is predictable temporary increase in demand for safe short-term assets.	92	9
201501	1553	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	If liftoff occurs near the quarter-end, as seems likely, it would be perfectly natural for us to auction term RRPs coincident with liftoff and spanning the quarter-end.	92	9
201501	1554	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	If the maturity dates on term RRPs are staggered, we’ll have a chance to see how overnight rates respond as the term RRPs roll off, and we can decide, depending on that response, whether the current cap on ON RRP operations are too small, additional RRPs need to be auctioned, or term deposits should be offered at a premium over the IOER rate.	92	9
201501	1555	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	One of the things that caught my eye in the memo was a suggestion of a 5 basis point increase in the ON RRP rate relative to the lower end of the target range for the federal funds rate.	92	9
201501	1556	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I was discussing this with Governor Brainard.	92	9
201501	1557	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I understand that might be a short-term tactic, but I feel pretty strongly that we should maintain the 25 basis point spread between ON RRP and the IOER rates—and we should be careful that, as we go through time, I would suggest we perhaps use that spread as a way to limit demand for RRP.	92	9
201501	1558	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	So I can see widening it.	92	9
201501	1559	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I don’t like the idea of temporarily shortening it, because I think it may undermine our commitment to widening it over time.	92	9
201501	1560	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I may be wrong.	92	9
201501	1561	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	And then last, with regard to term RRPs, again, I mentioned that I think it would be a useful tool at quarter-end.	92	9
201501	1562	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	There was a number of $200 billion somewhere.	92	9
201501	1563	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Why not do $300 billion?	92	9
201501	1564	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	In other words, why not keep an extra $100 billion on hand in case we need to have it?	92	9
201501	1565	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	And then finally, I would be in favor in terms of the question that was in red in the presentation of testing RRP apart from quarter-end dates.	92	9
201501	1566	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Why not?	92	9
201501	1567	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I think we should.	92	9
201501	1568	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1569	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201501	1570	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman Dudley.	92	9
201501	1571	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1572	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	For me, just like everybody else, having a smooth liftoff is my top priority.	92	9
201501	1573	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s more important than the size of the facility or the potential financial stability concerns.	92	9
201501	1574	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	First of all, over a very short period of time, when our credibility with respect to liftoff will either be won or lost, the financial-stability risks are pretty small.	92	9
201501	1575	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, I think we can address the issue of footprint by making it clear that this overnight RRP facility will be used only to the extent needed to maintain monetary policy control, and when it’s not needed, it will be phased out.	92	9
201501	1576	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s temporary, not permanent.	92	9
201501	1577	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the options in the memo, I think it’s essential that we have sufficient headroom, and I think there’s a lot of ways to generate sufficient headroom.	92	9
201501	1578	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	You can have a very large overnight RRP facility or you can have a somewhat smaller overnight RRP facility supplemented by term RRP.	92	9
201501	1579	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	As long as there’s sufficient headroom and this expectation is realized, then I think the facilities are likely to be effective in putting a floor under short-term rates.	92	9
201501	1580	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	We have been talking about a lot of details over the past couple of hours, but I think we should get some confidence from the tests that we’ve done.	92	9
201501	1581	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I mean, the tests do seem to suggest that these facilities actually do work in terms of putting a floor under short-term rates.	92	9
201501	1582	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the split between overnight RRP and term RRP, I think the simplest solution is just to go with option 1 and have a high cap initially on the overnight RRP facility or no cap at all.	92	9
201501	1583	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The advantage of having a high cap, a cap that they are not going to reach, is to signal that this is not unlimited, and it allows you then to move the cap down as you see that you have a lot of extra headroom.	92	9
201501	1584	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	You can then move that cap down in order to reinforce the message that this thing is going to go away over time.	92	9
201501	1585	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If you decided that you wanted to have term RRPs, I think the way I would do it is I would have term RRPs that just address quarter-end, and I would have a testing program for term RRPs in place for the June quarter and the September quarter.	92	9
201501	1586	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	So if you lifted off in June or you lifted off in September, you wouldn’t even really have to announce the term RRPs.	92	9
201501	1587	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	They are to be tested.	92	9
201501	1588	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The tested RRPs would just turn into the actual term RRPs.	92	9
201501	1589	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	In looking at the increase in demand over quarter-end, what you see is about a $200 billion increase in demand over quarter-end.	92	9
201501	1590	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	So that would suggest that if you had a term RRP program of $200 billion, you could have that tested in June, September, et cetera.	92	9
201501	1591	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	You could just roll right into it if you actually happened to lift off in the quarter, and if you didn’t lift off in the quarter, you’re just doing another test.	92	9
201501	1592	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	That, to me, has the advantage of it all being announced ex ante.	92	9
201501	1593	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s no surprises to the market in terms of what you’re going to do.	92	9
201501	1594	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If you roll it out after the fact, you’re just inserting more noise into the market that you’re going to have to communicate about.	92	9
201501	1595	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of other steps to ensure a smooth liftoff, I think that we all agree that good communication is important.	92	9
201501	1596	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think what I would hope that we could do is reach a consensus in March about how this is all going to work and then have the Chair communicate that to the markets or communicate that in speeches or the minutes.	92	9
201501	1597	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there is broad enough consensus here that I think we could get to something in March where we could sort of tell the markets what we’re doing prior to liftoff.	92	9
201501	1598	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Regarding term RRP testing away from quarter-end, I’m fine with it if we’re actually going to do it.	92	9
201501	1599	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	But if the sense of the Committee is that we’re not going to do term RRP away from quarter-end, then I sort of ask myself the question, why are we testing it?	92	9
201501	1600	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we just have to ask ourselves.	92	9
201501	1601	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think we should test things that we’re not going to do because I think that just confuses markets and starts to influence their expectations.	92	9
201501	1602	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1603	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201501	1604	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	92	9
201501	1605	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1606	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I think it’s totally agreed that we have to do this successfully to retain our credibility as people who can control the interest rate, which we’d better be able to do.	92	9
201501	1607	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	And almost everything I have to say has been said already, so I’ll say it quickly.	92	9
201501	1608	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Overnight RRP at somewhere around $600 billion seems right.	92	9
201501	1609	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I like Vice Chairman Dudley’s statement that we should have a term RRP in place when we plan on doing this.	92	9
201501	1610	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	The tradeoff between having the term RRPs and not is that you can make the overnight RRP facility smaller as a signal of not wanting to have a big footprint.	92	9
201501	1611	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I had thought, listening to discussion in three or four previous Federal Open Market Committee meetings, that it was a big factor in everyone’s mind, but it seems to have shrunk a little bit now, and the $600 billion is probably more convenient in the hope that you might not need the term RRP.	92	9
201501	1612	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	The reason I say that is because I don’t know whether this is just reacting to words, but I’m not sure we should be encouraging firms to window-dress by making it cheaper for them to window-dress, and that’s what the term RRP does.	92	9
201501	1613	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I’m interested in when we are going to become independent of the ON RRP, and I think we’re very optimistic if we think we can describe the scenarios under which we are going to exit.	92	9
201501	1614	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	It is going to take a while until we get the balance sheet down to $1 trillion, at which point I guess we’ll start possibly becoming able to see an end to this program, unless there is something we’re missing about President Lacker’s position—namely, that we could do it all by IOER.	92	9
201501	1615	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	And maybe there is something that says: that’s not true at $4 trillion, but it is true at $3½ trillion.	92	9
201501	1616	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	If so, then we can stage an early exit.	92	9
201501	1617	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	But I very much doubt that we can do that.	92	9
201501	1618	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We need to think about how we’re going to exit, but that shouldn’t be high on our list.	92	9
201501	1619	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	It would be nice if it was high on our list of priorities, but I don’t think it will be.	92	9
201501	1620	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	The last point, again, is just to support the need for explaining what we’re going to do— preparing answers to frequently asked questions, et cetera—so that even people who are not engaged in buying and selling these things know what it is that we’re going to do.	92	9
201501	1621	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	There are probably tens of millions of American citizens who learned about open market operations in their economics textbooks and have trouble figuring out what on earth all this is about.	92	9
201501	1622	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Why don’t you just do it in a good, old-fashioned way?	92	9
201501	1623	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I think we have to worry about explaining ourselves even more than usual.	92	9
201501	1624	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	92	9
201501	1625	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201501	1626	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	92	9
201501	1627	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1628	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I began this exercise, whenever we started talking about it months ago, with a strong set of financial stability concerns, which, unlike many of you, have not abated during the course of these discussions.	92	9
201501	1629	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	But it has become apparent to me over time—and I think part of today’s discussion was a reaffirmation of this point—that the financial-stability difference between just ON RRP and a mix of ON RRP and term RRP is probably not that great relative to my source of concerns.	92	9
201501	1630	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	And I think President Lockhart and President Kocherlakota have put their finger on the source of my concerns, which is, as President Lockhart put it, an exit plan.	92	9
201501	1631	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	And I guess I disagree with Governor Fischer.	92	9
201501	1632	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I think we’d better think about an exit plan for a reason I’ll explain in a minute.	92	9
201501	1633	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	There are two ways that things could go here.	92	9
201501	1634	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	One, with a large-ish ON RRP, we begin liftoff at some point in the future, and it turns out that things go pretty smoothly, and the take-up is nowhere near the cap—if there is a cap—that we’ve put in place.	92	9
201501	1635	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	And as President Plosser suggested, at the next meeting we can reduce the cap without any concerns about what happens.	92	9
201501	1636	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	A powerful message will be sent to the money market fund industry and, indeed, to everybody else.	92	9
201501	1637	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	The other scenario is one in which it turns out that there is substantial take-up.	92	9
201501	1638	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	And in subsequent meetings, there is still concern that—as Narayana was suggesting—in the absence of the continued use of a very large ON RRP, there may be some difficulty in getting within the target range, or at least in having confidence that we’ll be within the target range.	92	9
201501	1639	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	It seems to me that this is the scenario to worry about.	92	9
201501	1640	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t know what the probabilities are regarding that scenario.	92	9
201501	1641	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t know that anybody could say with any great assurance even the order of magnitude for what the probabilities are, but I think they’re nontrivial.	92	9
201501	1642	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	And here is where the question of, as Dennis put it, the exit plan comes into play, because I think what we confront is a variant of a time-consistency problem: That is, at any given meeting, it always seems like the best thing is to make sure you hit the range with confidence with a big ON RRP facility, and any financial stability issue is speculative.	92	9
201501	1643	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	It’s not around right now, of course, and is probably for tomorrow’s Committee, not even the members who are on the Committee right now.	92	9
201501	1644	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	This is precisely why, in general, policymakers pay more attention to short-term issues and why long-term problems often don’t get addressed—because of the decision pressures that we all face.	92	9
201501	1645	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	So I think, under those circumstances, there are two ways to deal with those longer-range contingencies.	92	9
201501	1646	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	One, which I’m going to come back to in a second, is some variant on a commitment device—that is, sort of an ex ante approach.	92	9
201501	1647	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	The second is having more options as you go forward, a kind of ex post approach.	92	9
201501	1648	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Several people have already stated why, notwithstanding their preference for option 1, they think it might be a good idea to continue to investigate, through testing and otherwise, other tools that may be available, and I would agree with them.	92	9
201501	1649	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	So my instinct would be to let the Desk test anything it thinks might be useful at some point to give us as an option.	92	9
201501	1650	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to the first way—that is, the commitment device—the only thing I have heard, and I have heard it from almost everybody who has spoken to this point, “Well, we said it’s temporary.”	92	9
201501	1651	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Well, you know, this is what a time-consistency problem is defined by.	92	9
201501	1652	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	You have a stated policy, which of course is the preference.	92	9
201501	1653	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	But when you come to the point of making the decision, it turns out that that gets trumped by the shorter-term considerations, and that at some point other actors begin to figure out that that’s the circumstance you’re in.	92	9
201501	1654	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	So stating that something is temporary, I don’t think, in and of itself, can be hugely reassuring, even though it helps, and there is no question that it is better to say it and to say it repeatedly than not to say it.	92	9
201501	1655	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	But I do think that other kinds of commitment devices should at least be thought about: for example, whether there is some way to tie the maximum size of an ON RRP over time, even to the balance sheet, which may not change for quite some time, so that at least there would be a clear ending point.	92	9
201501	1656	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t know what other ideas there are, and I think Governor Fischer is right in suggesting it’s going to be hard to come up with them.	92	9
201501	1657	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	But I’m left quite uncomfortable just relying on our saying, “Well, it’s temporary.”	92	9
201501	1658	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	And I heard many people say, “As appropriate, we would bring it down,” or “As possible, we would bring it down.”	92	9
201501	1659	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Well, what if that decision still seems a hard one?	92	9
201501	1660	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	It then becomes hard to bring it down.	92	9
201501	1661	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	The problem with a commitment device is that, of course, it puts a constraint on discretion.	92	9
201501	1662	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	That’s the definition of a commitment device.	92	9
201501	1663	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	But you’ve got to do it.	92	9
201501	1664	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	If you don’t do it, and you’re not willing to do it ex ante to some degree, then it suggests to me that we’re not putting any value on financial stability considerations, which I think is different from saying we put dominant value on the precision of the monetary policy execution but are still placing some value on financial stability considerations.	92	9
201501	1665	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	As I say, I can’t value it, but it does seem to me that we don’t want to have our children or somebody looking back at some point and saying, “You know, the Fed just slipped into this.	92	9
201501	1666	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	At every point, it was easier to make that decision.	92	9
201501	1667	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	They allowed this industry to get started, and then what happened?	92	9
201501	1668	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	There was a major run circumstance in which everybody ran to the Fed, and their successors were sitting there saying, ‘We’d better increase the ON RRP.	92	9
201501	1669	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Otherwise, there’s financial instability.’”	92	9
201501	1670	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	So that’s why, whether you call it a decision tree as President Fisher suggests, or President Lockhart’s exit plan, or just gaming it through—I think which was what Narayana was suggesting—I do hope that we can think more about this between now and March and see whether we can get beyond mere words with something ex ante, then allow Simon and Lorie to test a bunch of stuff that may help us develop some ex post options as needed later on.	92	9
201501	1671	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1672	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201501	1673	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I had a two-hander.	92	9
201501	1674	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I actually feel that you left out of your comments many of the things that were said that would actually deal with this very issue.	92	9
201501	1675	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think the points you made are excellent.	92	9
201501	1676	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I view adjusting the IOER to be above the range as exactly the kind of tool that we could use so that we didn’t have to rely on the overnight reverse repo so much.	92	9
201501	1677	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Let me go through that scenario.	92	9
201501	1678	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s what I meant when I said we have these other backstop policies—like TDF, changing the spread, or raising the overnight IOER, and things like that.	92	9
201501	1679	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I think term reverse repo also is like that.	92	9
201501	1680	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s what I meant when I said we should keep these in reserve so that if we find that to hit our range or, say, to keep the federal funds rate in the range, we need to have a $1 trillion overnight reverse repo and we don’t want to keep it there, we can use the other tools to avoid that.	92	9
201501	1681	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that, actually, I agree with the points you’re making, but I do think that that’s what I and maybe others mean when we said, “Well, you should use these other steps as backup.”	92	9
201501	1682	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I hope that’s right, John.	92	9
201501	1683	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s what I meant.	92	9
201501	1684	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I hope that’s right, and I think the things you suggested would fall into the category of ex post other options, which I identified.	92	9
201501	1685	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	But I also heard you say that it was already pretty complicated, and I’ve heard a number of other people talk about the virtue of simplicity in execution.	92	9
201501	1686	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	So I don’t discount the possibility that when, at some future meeting, rates are already—I can’t even remember what our ranges are now.	92	9
201501	1687	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	You can’t say 75 basis points anymore.	92	9
201501	1688	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	You have to think, 12½ less than, 12½ more—up somewhat and we have this discussion and people say, “Oh, gee, it would make it complicated to try to introduce a different IOER spread or term RRPs.”	92	9
201501	1689	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Again, if it’s thought through a bit beforehand, and it’s communicated, including to the public, you then begin to alter the lay of the land, and maybe you are creating a soft commitment device.	92	9
201501	1690	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	But that’s really what I’m calling for, not just relying on the fact that at some point in the future we’ll think better of it.	92	9
201501	1691	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	92	9
201501	1692	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	My conception is very similar to that of President Williams in terms of having these other tools.	92	9
201501	1693	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	And if you don’t like the tradeoff that you find after liftoff, you can adjust these other tools in a way to achieve a better tradeoff.	92	9
201501	1694	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think in terms of the simplicity/complexity argument, simplicity at liftoff is particularly important.	92	9
201501	1695	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	And after liftoff, I think you can introduce more complexity if you want to set the tradeoffs at a different place than you do in liftoff.	92	9
201501	1696	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	So I would distinguish liftoff, in terms of the need for simplicity at liftoff, from later, when I think you could have different tradeoffs.	92	9
201501	1697	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I know everybody has done that, Vice Chairman Dudley, but I don’t quite understand why that’s so—why I should believe or why any of us should believe that we are really going to feel that way.	92	9
201501	1698	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I mean, maybe we will, but—	92	9
201501	1699	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If we truly don’t like the tradeoffs, why wouldn’t we pick some other parameters to adjust to get to a better place?	92	9
201501	1700	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	What I was suggesting is the calculus of a tradeoff at any given moment will weigh heavily toward as precise an execution of one’s monetary policy objectives as one can achieve.	92	9
201501	1701	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	And, thus, other norms, just as now I think they are being pushed—not obliterated, and nobody denies them—but I think they are being downplayed now.	92	9
201501	1702	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I think the same dynamic, psychological and otherwise, takes effect at any given point along the way.	92	9
201501	1703	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	And there is a very rational, logical reason why you should be right, which is to say that credibility having been established initially, we would all be more comfortable with more softness.	92	9
201501	1704	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	But I don’t know that that’s the way everyone, or even the majority, of the Committee, or some future Chair will feel about it.	92	9
201501	1705	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	So that’s why I think talking it through first and communicating upfront the way we’re thinking about it does, as I say, serve as a form of soft commitment device—not as hard of one as I would like, but at least a soft commitment device—as opposed to just telling ourselves, if we don’t like the tradeoff later, we can do it differently, but not getting beyond that.	92	9
201501	1706	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think there is any disagreement conceptually with what the options are.	92	9
201501	1707	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I’m just thinking in terms of institutional dynamics.	92	9
201501	1708	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	92	9
201501	1709	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I want to come back to a point I made before, and I think Governor Tarullo was endorsing it—that old quip, “Trust in Allah, but tie your camel.”	92	9
201501	1710	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I just want to make sure we have simplicity of liftoff, but that in our back pocket, we have done the studies.	92	9
201501	1711	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	And if it doesn’t work the way we want it to work, we pull out these different tools, and that’s what I call decision tree management.	92	9
201501	1712	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	That was one point I was trying to make.	92	9
201501	1713	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I think you agreed, Dan.	92	9
201501	1714	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	That the main thing we can do is sell assets, and we know how to sell the Treasuries pretty easily.	92	9
201501	1715	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	So, again, I won’t be here, but I hope you develop these alternatives, and explain at least to the Committee some of the thinking.	92	9
201501	1716	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I’m not sure we should explain it to the public.	92	9
201501	1717	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I’m not saying that.	92	9
201501	1718	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I mean, we do have to have something in our pocket, and we have to tie our camel.	92	9
201501	1719	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	That’s the point I was making.	92	9
201501	1720	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201501	1721	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1722	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	President Fisher is proving, with his colorful metaphors, why he’ll be missed so much.	92	9
201501	1723	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	92	9
201501	1724	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But in a serious vein, I think Governor Tarullo has hit the nail on the head here—that at any given moment in time, there is a tendency to focus on the short-term needs and the short-term actions and the short-term dynamics.	92	9
201501	1725	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I think it will be useful to provide underpinnings to the public regarding what we mean by “temporary,” and why we feel comfortable with it being temporary, not only in terms of having a plan in our heads, but also having a plan that we communicate to the public that will make it clear that we know how we’re going to be temporary about this.	92	9
201501	1726	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201501	1727	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	92	9
201501	1728	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	It has been a very interesting discussion.	92	9
201501	1729	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I was tempted to two-hand myself there.	92	9
201501	1730	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	[Laughter]	92	9
201501	1731	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I’m not sure if that’s a legal move.	92	9
201501	1732	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ll take care of that.	92	9
201501	1733	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Anyway, I’m going to start in the short term and then come back to the excellent questions that Governor Tarullo and others have discussed here.	92	9
201501	1734	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I think we have, for the purposes of the short term, established that we want the reverse repo facilities to be temporary in time and as limited in size as they can be, consistent with an appropriate degree of control over monetary policy.	92	9
201501	1735	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I think with that established, we can, should, and must use our tools aggressively to achieve that level of control.	92	9
201501	1736	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	And based on what market participants are telling us and what the tests seem to show, if the market perceives that the cap is unlikely to be binding, then RRP will provide a good floor for our target range and rates will be close to the middle of the range.	92	9
201501	1737	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I think that’s a great place to start.	92	9
201501	1738	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	So my prior is:  At liftoff, we should have not overwhelming force but overwhelming headroom.	92	9
201501	1739	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	And, looking at the options, I guess I’m somewhere around “option 1½.”	92	9
201501	1740	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	By that I mean where I would be is, $400 billion or $500 billion overnight repo and term.	92	9
201501	1741	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I would do term at quarter-end, every quarter-end for a while, at around $200 billion.	92	9
201501	1742	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	That’s the way I would do it.	92	9
201501	1743	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I would say, in terms of the control point, it’s one thing if rates plunge below the overnight rate in June 2017, and it’s another thing if they do that right after liftoff.	92	9
201501	1744	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I think it’s one thing if the Fed chooses to allow, and is seen to choose to allow, rates to go out of our range.	92	9
201501	1745	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	It’s another for people to see that the Federal Reserve doesn’t have the tools or doesn’t use its tools well enough to keep rates in the range.	92	9
201501	1746	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	So I think that it really is important to do what we’re all suggesting, which is to have a pretty substantial degree of control at the beginning.	92	9
201501	1747	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	As far as the other tools are concerned, I start with the idea that the IOER rate ought to be at the top of the range and the ON RRP rate ought to be at the bottom of the range.	92	9
201501	1748	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I think moving them both around at the same time is confusing.	92	9
201501	1749	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I think my first tool off the bench, if you will, if we need it, would be to move the ON RRP rate up 5 basis points.	92	9
201501	1750	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	That seemed to do the trick.	92	9
201501	1751	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	That moved up the federal funds rate almost basis point for basis point.	92	9
201501	1752	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	So that could be a tool, but I would hold that in abeyance.	92	9
201501	1753	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	That does go to the point of using not so much the size.	92	9
201501	1754	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Coming back to the medium-term and longer-term issues, these are great points.	92	9
201501	1755	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I think President Lockhart’s idea of an exit plan or at least further consideration of the conditions under which we would exit is well worth exploring, and if there are other commitment technologies out there, they would be worth exploring as well to deal with the time-consistency problem.	92	9
201501	1756	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	It seems to me we’ve learned a great deal in the testing, and testing has in a way performed just as we hoped it would.	92	9
201501	1757	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	And the possibility of sending negative signals really hasn’t happened except, I think, with the segregated balance accounts.	92	9
201501	1758	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	That takes me to considering the point: “Let’s not test something that we’re probably not going to use, because if we test it, people are really going to expect us to use it.	92	9
201501	1759	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	So let’s not do that.”	92	9
201501	1760	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I would certainly be comfortable with testing term RRP over the March quarter-end.	92	9
201501	1761	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I guess I wouldn’t test off quarter-ends if we’re not going to use it, and it doesn’t seem like to me we’re going to use it.	92	9
201501	1762	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	On TDF, it seems to be kind of a peripheral tool, but I guess the chances are that we may well use it.	92	9
201501	1763	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	So I’d be okay with further testing.	92	9
201501	1764	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Generally speaking, I would default in the direction of more testing except where I think it’s sending a signal that we’re testing a tool that we’re not going to use.	92	9
201501	1765	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	We should look like, if you will, an army that’s doing a lot of drilling and practicing and marching and committed to using our tools well and achieving a good level of control.	92	9
201501	1766	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I think that’s exactly what we’re starting to look like, and, again, aside from that one negative signal, I don’t see that the possibility of other negative signals has materialized.	92	9
201501	1767	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1768	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201501	1769	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	92	9
201501	1770	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	1771	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	We are in quite unique circumstances.	92	9
201501	1772	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Monetary policy has now been at the lower bound for about six years, and we have excess reserves at a level that we have never dealt with before.	92	9
201501	1773	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	So at this very unique moment, it’s of paramount importance to demonstrate decisively that we can maintain the federal funds rate within the range that we target.	92	9
201501	1774	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think the failure to do so could potentially have long-term corrosive effects on the efficacy of our monetary policy.	92	9
201501	1775	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Any initial inability to move the rate within its desired range, particularly if it persists for any period of time, would call into question that we have the tools or the will.	92	9
201501	1776	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	And the risk is amplified by the slight awkwardness of the timing.	92	9
201501	1777	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The likeliest meetings for liftoff, which are those that coincide with a press conference, all happen to take place very close to quarter-end.	92	9
201501	1778	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	And they raise a specter of the liftoff announcement being followed immediately by a downward drift and a possible breach in the new floor.	92	9
201501	1779	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Fortunately, we have already seen that we can have pretty strong confidence that we have the necessary tools well within our authority.	92	9
201501	1780	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The use of the IOER in tandem with the reverse repo facility should provide the requisite monetary control if we set the cap on the reverse repo at a sufficient level to have high confidence in achieving that target.	92	9
201501	1781	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Our experience so far with using that facility to impose a soft floor has been limited to periods in which the federal funds rate has been close to zero and, therefore, likely receiving some support from that threshold.	92	9
201501	1782	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	As rates move away from the zero bound, we should be prepared for the possibility that the amount of reverse repos that are needed to support that floor initially might increase temporarily.	92	9
201501	1783	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	We should also be prepared, as was suggested in the memo, to temporarily narrow the spread between the IOER and the RRP rates at the outset with a view that it will increase over time.	92	9
201501	1784	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I agree with those who have said that they are less worried about the exact size of the increment in the cap.	92	9
201501	1785	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The cap itself is less important as a safeguard against risks from the ON RRP to financial stability and changes to market structure than the perceived impermanence of this facility.	92	9
201501	1786	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	In terms of making sure that we don’t lead to a permanent change in market structure or introduce some risk of a flight to this market during periods of elevated stress, it is very important that we firmly commit that this facility will be temporary and used only for the extent and duration necessary.	92	9
201501	1787	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think apart from stating that very clearly at the outset, there are a number of ways that we talked about doing that around the table.	92	9
201501	1788	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	We will not be in these unique circumstances for very long, and we should see over time that the IOER rate starts to exert more of a pull on the federal funds rate and that it trades closer to IOER rate.	92	9
201501	1789	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	At that juncture, we’ll have the option to widen the spread and make the RRP rate much less attractive.	92	9
201501	1790	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	So there’s a natural potential exit path that I think we have talked about using, and I hope we will, in fact, use that along with some of the other tools.	92	9
201501	1791	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	So with those strong reservations about making sure that we are clear that this not a permanent addition to the structure of the short-term money market, I very much support option 1.	92	9
201501	1792	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Well, I think we’ve had a great round of discussion, and we agreed earlier that we would come back to the testing resolutions after we had this discussion.	92	9
201501	1793	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	What I’d like to suggest is that we do that first thing in the morning.	92	9
201501	1794	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The staff can give us some proposals for testing in light of the discussion, and we would take it up, if that’s acceptable, before we go into policy discussions tomorrow morning.	92	9
201501	1795	2015-01-28	meeting	CLOUSE	There was one outstanding question of whether you would like to see two proposals, one for just quarter-end testing or another one for the limited testing that Simon has already talked about.	92	9
201501	1796	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we try to get a sense of that?	92	9
201501	1797	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I mean, most people have addressed that, and a variety of views were expressed.	92	9
201501	1798	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	In terms of the quarter-end testing, although there was a diversity of views, what I heard was that most people were supportive of quarter-end testing.	92	9
201501	1799	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Could I see a show of hands on how many people would be supportive of quarter-end testing of the term RRPs?	92	9
201501	1800	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	You mean extra?	92	9
201501	1801	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	No, just the testing at quarter-end, not outside quarter-end.	92	9
201501	1802	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I’ll take that separately.	92	9
201501	1803	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	92	9
201501	1804	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201501	1805	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And who would be opposed to the quarter-end testing?	92	9
201501	1806	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	92	9
201501	1807	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201501	1808	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Although we don’t have unanimity, I think coming back to us with that proposal is appropriate.	92	9
201501	1809	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Now let’s take, I think, the more controversial piece, which would be testing of term RRPs over the next month or two?	92	9
201501	1810	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	We could do some testing from late February to early March.	92	9
201501	1811	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Right.	92	9
201501	1812	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	So making it a relatively small scale, not at quarter-end, and I think a number of people felt this shouldn’t be part of our liftoff toolkit.	92	9
201501	1813	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	In fact, I heard pretty broad support for the view that we shouldn’t use that tool at liftoff.	92	9
201501	1814	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Nevertheless, I did hear a number of you say that, ultimately, as we may want to reduce the cap over time on the overnight RRP facility, this is something that we might potentially want to use.	92	9
201501	1815	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	It’s not clear we would use it, but if we did, it might be useful to test it to see.	92	9
201501	1816	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	92	9
201501	1817	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I thought we should ask for that to be done because there was a lot of interest in the morning about the extent to which the term RRPs are a substitute for overnight RRPs.	92	9
201501	1818	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We didn’t get an answer yet, and doing it away from the quarter-end would give us some information about that.	92	9
201501	1819	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	So it would be useful, I think.	92	9
201501	1820	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let me ask for just a general show of hands, as I think we heard considerable support for something along the lines of option 1 as a way to go into liftoff.	92	9
201501	1821	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Nevertheless, there remain some reasons that we might want to understand more about the substitutability of non-quarter-end term RRPs for overnight.	92	9
201501	1822	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	How many people would be in favor of, I think we’re talking about a modest testing program?	92	9
201501	1823	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	It would be small.	92	9
201501	1824	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	A small testing program that maybe would end at the beginning of March.	92	9
201501	1825	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	How many people would be interested in seeing a proposal along those lines?	92	9
201501	1826	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	92	9
201501	1827	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201501	1828	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And how many people would feel really opposed to doing that?	92	9
201501	1829	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	92	9
201501	1830	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201501	1831	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think my suggestion, seeing that, would be that maybe you come back tomorrow morning with two proposals.	92	9
201501	1832	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	People, of course, can sleep on it, and we’re not forced to go ahead with both things, but I think I see enough support for the testing of non-quarter-end term, especially a small-scale test, that maybe we should see a proposal.	92	9
201501	1833	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	92	9
201501	1834	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Yes, I’d like to suggest that the staff give some thought to this—and maybe this is just terminology.	92	9
201501	1835	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	You know, the Desk brings us a proposal for, say, the next round of testing, and I’m continually asking about, all right, what’s on the horizon after that?	92	9
201501	1836	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	On the horizon after that is the next quarter-end, which could be the consequential one.	92	9
201501	1837	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Now, a couple of people around the table spoke of quarter-end term RRPs as something they want to initiate and just carry right through to liftoff, right?	92	9
201501	1838	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	So they want to have it in place and keep going.	92	9
201501	1839	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Well, that suggests we’re not really testing.	92	9
201501	1840	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I mean, no one spoke about how compelling these research questions in the memo were.	92	9
201501	1841	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Basically, people were thinking about whether they want term RRP to be in place from now until we lift off.	92	9
201501	1842	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	So this should raise in our minds the question of, when is it not testing and when is it a program?	92	9
201501	1843	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	When is it official that it’s not a test?	92	9
201501	1844	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	We may want to just hold in our minds that, all right, it’s official, but we’re going to call it testing until we lift off.	92	9
201501	1845	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I don’t know, but I think it would be worthwhile for us to think about that before June, when it’s upon us, or April, when we have to think about June testing.	92	9
201501	1846	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think that’s correct.	92	9
201501	1847	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Madam Chair, may I ask a question just to help answer this tomorrow?	92	9
201501	1848	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	When you say “a small amount,” what do we mean?	92	9
201501	1849	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	I think up to $50 billion would be the amount we would ask for.	92	9
201501	1850	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Whether or not we would get to that in any single operation, I’m not sure.	92	9
201501	1851	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	This is one on which you would start very small because we’re not doing this over quarter-end, and you don’t want to do anything in a test that could have adverse consequences.	92	9
201501	1852	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Thank you.	92	9
201501	1853	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	There the issue for us is that at quarter-end we have a very good feeling for the quantity that might be demanded.	92	9
201501	1854	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Because we haven’t used this tool away from quarter- end, we don’t have that kind of knowledge.	92	9
201501	1855	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	So if you agree to do something like this, it would be very small at first, and we’d have to interact back with the Chair after the first one to understand whether we wanted to go any bigger than that.	92	9
201501	1856	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	And it does have some issues related to how we describe it, as Governor Powell suggested, that there is some risk that people will take more signal from doing a test like this than we’d like.	92	9
201501	1857	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	That also suggests keeping it quite small.	92	9
201501	1858	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Madam Chair, I just want to clarify my hand-raising here.	92	9
201501	1859	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I’m not against testing things, because I want to have the best toolkit that we can possibly have, as long as it doesn’t send the wrong signal.	92	9
201501	1860	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Right, and that’s exactly what Simon is concerned with.	92	9
201501	1861	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	We have had an experience recently with that, which wasn’t very pleasant.	92	9
201501	1862	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Yes.	92	9
201501	1863	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Thank you very much.	92	9
201501	1864	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201501	1865	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	If you think you would be able to provide a concrete proposal tomorrow, I think we can do that first thing.	92	9
201501	1866	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201501	1867	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201501	1868	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’ve had a very thorough and very useful discussion of these operational issues.	92	9
201501	1869	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The Board meeting is now concluded.	92	9
201501	1870	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	So let us now proceed to the economic and financial situation.	11	1
201501	1871	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I’m going to first turn things over to Steve.	11	1
201501	1872	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Yes, switching things up.	11	1
201501	1873	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Because some of the key influences on the US economy’s prospects—especially oil prices and the dollar—are indeed emanating from the international sphere, David and I thought we would switch our usual order, with me going first.	11	1
201501	1874	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	I will be referring to the materials that are labeled “The Foreign Outlook.”	11	1
201501	1875	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Before getting to oil prices and the dollar, I will address our forecast for foreign economic growth, shown as the black solid line in panel 1.	11	1
201501	1876	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	In putting together this forecast, we steered a middle course between giving in to the anxiety about prospects abroad evidenced in financial markets and succumbing to excessive enthusiasm about the positive effects of lower oil prices, weaker currencies, and more accommodative monetary policy.	11	1
201501	1877	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	As before, our forecast of foreign growth strengthening to its potential pace of about 3 percent rests on a number of difficult judgment calls.	11	1
201501	1878	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	First, in our projection, China’s economic growth declines only gradually in the next few years, from 7¼ percent in 2014 to 6¾ percent in 2017, and the country avoids sharp disruptions associated with the ongoing correction of its housing market.	11	1
201501	1879	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Fourth-quarter GDP came in at 7 percent, a touch lower than our projection in December, and we marked down our outlook going forward by about ¼ percentage point, in part reflecting the appreciation of the renminbi that has occurred as the currency followed the dollar up.	11	1
201501	1880	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Second, in our forecast, Brazil and other ailing economies in South America pull out of their recessions and eventually regain near-trend rates of growth.	11	1
201501	1881	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	The appointment by reelected Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff of a new, market- friendly economic team is encouraging, but the region faces critical challenges, and we’ve marked down the pace of the projected recovery.	11	1
201501	1882	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Finally, our forecast of quickening growth depends on the euro-area economy shaking off its malaise.	11	1
201501	1883	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Despite the doom and gloom of much commentary, a number of recent indicators came in stronger than expected, and we’ve marked up our fourth- quarter GDP estimate to 1 percent, roughly its current rate of potential growth.	11	1
201501	1884	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Going forward, as shown by the solid black line in panel 2, GDP growth picks up to 2½ percent by 2017, driven, among other things, by the substantial monetary stimulus announced by the ECB last Thursday and described by Simon earlier today.	11	1
201501	1885	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	By our reckoning, the ECB’s prospective purchases of €300 billion in private assets and about €900 billion in public bonds—carried out through September 2016—should raise the level of euro-area GDP by more than 1 percent.	11	1
201501	1886	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Some of these purchases were already anticipated in our December forecast (the dashed red line) and much of them were built into our January forecast (the dashed blue line), but the announcement on the following day nevertheless surprised us on the upside, and over the weekend we boosted our euro-area projection a bit further.	11	1
201501	1887	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	To be sure, there are many downside risks to the euro-area outlook, including those posed by Greece.	11	1
201501	1888	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	The far-left and anti-austerity Syriza party won nearly a majority of seats in Sunday’s parliamentary election and will form a coalition government with another populist party.	11	1
201501	1889	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	We expect contentious negotiations between the new government and its official creditors, the IMF and EU, on the terms of new lending, and difficulties in these talks will likely create financial stresses that spill over into the rest of Europe.	11	1
201501	1890	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	However, as failure of these talks could lead to Greece defaulting and exiting the euro area, our best guess is that agreement will ultimately be reached, with only limited damage to the euro-area recovery.	11	1
201501	1891	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Returning to panel 1, our forecast for total growth (the black solid line) is nearly unchanged from the December forecast (the dashed red line).	11	1
201501	1892	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	As I noted earlier, we revised down the projections for China and South America.	11	1
201501	1893	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	However, other developments have boosted the outlook and largely offset these downward revisions.	11	1
201501	1894	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	First, as shown in panel 3, oil prices are down further since the time of the December Tealbook, and we estimate this should add about 0.1 percentage point to overall foreign growth.	11	1
201501	1895	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	The boost would be bigger, except that lower oil prices led us to mark down the outlook for Mexico and Canada, oil exporters that account for a large share of our trade-weighted aggregate for foreign growth.	11	1
201501	1896	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Second, the broad dollar is up another 3 percent (panel 4), which adds another 0.1 percentage point to foreign economic growth.	11	1
201501	1897	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Finally, monetary policy is more accommodative than in the December Tealbook not only in the euro area, but also in Canada, where the policy rate was cut to ¾ percent, and in the United Kingdom, where we now see liftoff being delayed to the end of this year.	11	1
201501	1898	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	If these easing actions were in response to a weakening of economic activity that was not already anticipated in our outlook, they would not necessarily boost our economic growth forecast.	11	1
201501	1899	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	But, especially in the euro area, monetary loosening appears to be importantly motivated by risks that falling oil prices may push down headline inflation (panel 5), so far as to unhinge inflation expectations.	11	1
201501	1900	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Much the same considerations led the BOJ to amp up its QQE program late last year.	11	1
201501	1901	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Thus, all told, these monetary easings are a plus for global economic growth.	11	1
201501	1902	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	As Simon has described, financial markets are evidencing some gloom about the global outlook, and there is certainly no shortage of downside risks.	11	1
201501	1903	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Nevertheless, it is worth noting some risks on the upside as well.	11	1
201501	1904	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	For starters, we’ve built a reasonably limited boost from falling oil prices into our forecast for foreign economic growth, and taking into account the uncertainty attending estimates of these effects, we would not be surprised if lower energy costs triggered stronger improvements in confidence and spending than we’ve written down.	11	1
201501	1905	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Additionally, the decline in oil prices may have further to go.	11	1
201501	1906	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	As shown in panel 3, our projection regarding oil prices, based on futures markets, turns back up over the forecast period.	11	1
201501	1907	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	This partly reflects expected increases in the demand for oil as global economic growth picks up and users respond to lower oil prices.	11	1
201501	1908	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	In addition, lower oil prices are expected to damp oil production in higher-cost producers such as the United States.	11	1
201501	1909	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	But the extent to which US oil production will fall off in response to lower prices is quite uncertain.	11	1
201501	1910	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Although rig counts are down and oil investment projects are being scaled back, future extraction will be concentrated in the most productive wells.	11	1
201501	1911	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	The Department of Energy is projecting that US oil production will still move up through the early part of the year.	11	1
201501	1912	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	We would not be greatly surprised if oil supply held up well enough to push oil prices below levels called for by futures markets.	11	1
201501	1913	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	This would likely push US and foreign growth up further, although it is possible that as oil prices fall to very low levels, some financial vulnerabilities—especially in EMEs most dependent on oil revenues—might be exacerbated.	11	1
201501	1914	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Finally, I’d like to turn to the dollar, shown in panel 4.	11	1
201501	1915	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Since your December meeting, the dollar has risen further as expectations mounted for additional monetary easing abroad, mainly in the euro area.	11	1
201501	1916	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Looking ahead, we expect the broad real dollar to move sideways as our monetary tightening boosts the dollar a bit further against other industrial-country currencies, while the dollar depreciates a touch against EME currencies.	11	1
201501	1917	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Since last summer, we have been regularly underpredicting the rise in the dollar, and we could certainly be doing so again.	11	1
201501	1918	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	But as the dollar gets higher, the chances that it could surprise us on the downside have also grown.	11	1
201501	1919	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	The dollar’s current valuation partly reflects material probabilities of very adverse developments abroad, such as renewed crisis in the euro area or a hard landing in China.	11	1
201501	1920	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	If these downside risks do not materialize and confidence in the global outlook improves, much of the dollar’s recent run-up could be reversed, as shown by the red line in panel 1 of your next exhibit and as we discussed in the alternative scenarios in the Risks and Uncertainty section of the Tealbook.	11	1
201501	1921	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	As well, oil prices, in panel 2, might rise more steeply than in our baseline forecast.	11	1
201501	1922	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Panels 3 and 4 show the effect of these developments in our general equilibrium model SIGMA, whose results may differ from those encompassed in the staff’s judgmental projection.	11	1
201501	1923	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	The decline of the dollar in this scenario leads to a rise in GDP above its baseline path, which is only partially offset by the effect of the higher oil price, while these developments work together to deliver a large but transitory run-up in inflation.	11	1
201501	1924	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	David will now continue our briefing.	11	1
201501	1925	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	I will be referring to the packet titled “Material for the US Outlook.”	11	1
201501	1926	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	I’d like to begin by providing just a word of background for those who did not grow up immersed in baseball culture:  Most of the time, one baseball game per day is considered quite enough, but a few times each season, opposing teams will play two games in one day, and this is referred to as a “double-header.”	11	1
201501	1927	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	In view of the length of today’s meeting, the question obviously arises as to whether there has ever been a “triple-header.”	11	1
201501	1928	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	[Laughter]	11	1
201501	1929	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Indeed, according to Wikipedia, “there are three recorded instances of a triple-header in Major League Baseball....	11	1
201501	1930	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	These occurred between the Brooklyn Bridegrooms and Pittsburgh Innocents ...	11	1
201501	1931	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	1890 (Brooklyn won all three); between the Baltimore Orioles and Louisville Colonels ...	11	1
201501	1932	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	1896 (Baltimore won all three); and between the Pittsburgh Pirates and Cincinnati Reds ...	11	1
201501	1933	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	1920 (Cincinnati won two of the three).	11	1
201501	1934	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Triple-headers are now prohibited under the current collective bargaining agreement.”	11	1
201501	1935	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	[Laughter]	11	1
201501	1936	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	I trust that the Committee will seek counsel’s advice as to whether the remainder of today’s triple-header will have to be played under protest.	11	1
201501	1937	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	The latest tranche of data suggests that real activity here at home was on a somewhat stronger footing during the second half of last year than we thought at the time of the December Tealbook.	11	1
201501	1938	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	For example, as shown in panel 1, real GDP is now estimated to have increased at an annual rate of 5 percent in the third quarter.	11	1
201501	1939	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	While we do not think that it maintained that torrid pace, we did also nudge up our estimate of GDP growth in the fourth quarter.	11	1
201501	1940	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	The greater-than-expected strength in second- half spending was concentrated in personal consumption expenditures, and as you may recall, most of that good news was already in hand by the time of the December FOMC meeting.	11	1
201501	1941	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	This morning we received the advance report on durable goods orders and shipments in December.	11	1
201501	1942	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	This release was just a shade weaker than we’d been looking for, but the broad contour of our near-term outlook remains very much intact.	11	1
201501	1943	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	The incoming news about labor market conditions was also somewhat better than we had anticipated.	11	1
201501	1944	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	The level of total payrolls in December was about 50,000 higher than we had expected, and the unemployment rate—shown in panel 2—was 5.6 percent last month, 0.1 percentage point below our December forecast.	11	1
201501	1945	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Panel 3 shows our labor market conditions index, or LMCI, which attempts to extract a common signal from 19 indicators of labor market conditions.	11	1
201501	1946	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	In the inset box, the red bars show the monthly change in the LMCI based on the information available at the time of the December Tealbook, while the gray bars show the latest estimates.	11	1
201501	1947	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Viewed through this lens, labor market conditions have improved noticeably during the past six weeks.	11	1
201501	1948	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	A key question for your deliberation now, as always, is where the real side of the economy stands relative to its sustainable position.	11	1
201501	1949	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Panel 4 provides three perspectives on that issue.	11	1
201501	1950	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	The dotted blue line shows the traditional Tealbook method for assessing this question—namely, the percentage difference between actual and potential GDP.	11	1
201501	1951	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	The red line shows the “production function” version of the output gap as estimated in EDO, one of the DSGE models that we maintain at the Board.	11	1
201501	1952	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	The black line—labeled FRB/US—provides an early-stage report on a different approach, one that we aim to build on during the next couple of years.	11	1
201501	1953	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	This measure is based on work done by Charles Fleischman and John Roberts.	11	1
201501	1954	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	It has the virtue of attempting to combine the information from a variety of production, income, labor market, and price indicators while also explicitly allowing for measurement error.	11	1
201501	1955	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	According to all three measures, considerable progress has been made in closing the gap in resource utilization in recent years.	11	1
201501	1956	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Indeed, by any reasonable standard of precision, the economy now is operating at or near its sustainable position.	11	1
201501	1957	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	I would note that the confidence interval shown around the FRB/US estimate ignores both coefficient uncertainty and model uncertainty, and so it surely understates the true level of imprecision.	11	1
201501	1958	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	I look forward to updating you on our progress as we pursue an ambitious line of work to refine this measure and put it more at the center of our macroanalysis.	11	1
201501	1959	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Turning from the “nowcast” to the forecast for real activity, three main considerations are relevant.	11	1
201501	1960	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	First, the greater-than-expected strength in spending and the labor market during the second half of last year implies some greater momentum in real activity coming into the first half of this year than we previously believed.	11	1
201501	1961	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Second, the stronger exchange value of the dollar that Steve discussed implies some restraint on spending and employment.	11	1
201501	1962	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	By the end of 2017, the stronger dollar relative to the path in the December Tealbook would subtract 0.4 percent from the level of real GDP and would, taken alone, add about 0.2 percentage point to the unemployment rate, all else being equal.	11	1
201501	1963	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Third, the further plunge in oil prices that Steve also mentioned provides, on balance, a countervailing boost to aggregate demand.	11	1
201501	1964	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	To be sure, not all of the effects of the decline in oil prices on the US economy will be positive.	11	1
201501	1965	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	In particular, we anticipate some considerable reductions in drilling and mining investment in the next few quarters.	11	1
201501	1966	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	As well, if oil prices stay low, oil production should level off this year and then edge lower, in contrast to the steep uptrend of the past few years.	11	1
201501	1967	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	And, as suggested by work, authored jointly by our Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas colleague Mine Yücel, states, large fossil fuel sectors will take some sizable hits to employment relative to what they would have experienced otherwise.	11	1
201501	1968	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	All that said, we continue to see the drop in oil prices as a plus for the US economy, but the question remains as to how much of a plus.	11	1
201501	1969	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	During the intermeeting period, we spent some time digging into this question.	11	1
201501	1970	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	As Hess Chung summarized in his briefing to the Board yesterday, there simply is no way to know with any precision.	11	1
201501	1971	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Absent any add-factoring, the FRB/US and SIGMA models both predict that a persistent decline in oil prices similar to what we’ve seen since the middle of last year should boost the level of real GDP by roughly 0.4 percent after two years.	11	1
201501	1972	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	However, the median estimate reported in an internal BIS review implies a boost to the level of GDP of 0.7 percent, and a VAR model that Board staff maintain implies an output dividend of 1 percent.	11	1
201501	1973	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	But the range of uncertainty surrounding all of these estimates is wide.	11	1
201501	1974	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	To illustrate, I would simply note that the estimates surveyed by the BIS ranged from 0.3 to 1.5 percent.	11	1
201501	1975	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Moreover, last week’s staff memo to the FOMC discussed a number of relevant risks, including ones coming from the financial side of the economy.	11	1
201501	1976	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	On balance, though, we judged our previous FRB/US-based rule of thumb to have been a little on the slim side, and so, in preparing our latest forecast, we adopted an elasticity in line with the median from the BIS review.	11	1
201501	1977	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Even so, the further drop in oil prices since the December Tealbook adds only about 0.3 percent to the level of real GDP in the baseline forecast by the end of 2017.	11	1
201501	1978	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	On net, the three factors that I’ve cited—stronger incoming data, a stronger exchange value of the dollar, and lower oil prices—were roughly a wash, leaving our medium-term projection for GDP growth little changed from December.	11	1
201501	1979	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Or, putting the point somewhat differently, the upward revision to the level of activity in the near term carries forward through much of the projection period, yielding a slightly higher degree of resource utilization in this forecast than in the previous one.	11	1
201501	1980	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	One other important endeavor during the intermeeting period was to provide you with another installment in our series of memos laying out various aspects of our forecast methodology—this installment covering the methods we use to set the main financial variables in the projection.	11	1
201501	1981	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	The last two panels of your exhibit summarize the inflation outlook.	11	1
201501	1982	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	As shown in panel 5, the near-term outlook for headline PCE inflation now looks much more negative than before, mainly on account of the further plunge in energy prices.	11	1
201501	1983	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	In addition, as you can see from panel 6, core PCE inflation also appears to be on a softer trajectory over the near term.	11	1
201501	1984	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Most of this latter revision reflects incoming data, including our translation of the December CPI and PPI.	11	1
201501	1985	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Over the medium term, however, the inflation forecast is little revised, as the slightly tighter margin of resource utilization in this projection has only a minimal effect on our inflation forecast.	11	1
201501	1986	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	As in previous Tealbooks, we expect core inflation to increase slowly over the forecast period, reaching 1.6 percent next year and 1.8 percent in 2017.	11	1
201501	1987	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	I would close by noting that in the Tealbook, we assessed the downside risks to inflation as having intensified somewhat since your previous meeting.	11	1
201501	1988	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	A fairly lengthy list of factors weigh in my thinking in that regard, including two consecutive CPI reports that were softer than we had expected, the further plunge in oil prices and the risk that may cause inflation expectations to come unglued to the downside, the further rise in the dollar, the continued weakness in wages, and the continued downtrend in TIPS-based inflation compensation.	11	1
201501	1989	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	For now, we continue to judge a “steady as she goes” inflation forecast as the best base case for your deliberations, but we perceive the odds of a shortfall as having risen.	11	1
201501	1990	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	I’ll be referring to the handout labeled “Financial Stability Developments.”	11	1
201501	1991	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	My remarks draw on our recent QS financial stability report.	11	1
201501	1992	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Focusing first on our topline assessment, we continue to judge overall vulnerabilities in the financial system as moderate, as highlighted in the box at the top left of your first exhibit.	11	1
201501	1993	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	This assessment reflects the interaction of three key factors.	11	1
201501	1994	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Specifically, while we judge valuation pressures, on balance, across a range of markets, to be notable, the degree of leverage and maturity transformation in the financial system is low to moderate, and the level of borrowing by the nonfinancial sector has not picked up appreciably.	11	1
201501	1995	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	The remainder of the exhibit focuses on developments in key asset markets.	11	1
201501	1996	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Since the start of the fall, volatility in a number of asset markets (some examples of which are plotted to the right) has edged up, with modest spikes in October and recently.	11	1
201501	1997	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	On balance, valuation pressures have perhaps eased modestly over this period.	11	1
201501	1998	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Our review of valuations across a range of markets highlighted continued or building valuation pressures in corporate debt markets and the commercial real estate area.	11	1
201501	1999	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Focusing first on commercial real estate, CMBS issuance (the blue bars at the middle left) approached $100 billion in 2014.	11	1
201501	2000	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	At the same time, CMBS spreads (the black line) fell to post-crisis lows over 2014.	11	1
201501	2001	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	More accommodative underwriting in this market is apparent in rising loan-to-value ratios and increases in interest-only loans in CMBS pools, as well as in the continued easing in lending standards on commercial real estate loans reported in the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices.	11	1
201501	2002	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	The remaining exhibits focus on corporate debt markets.	11	1
201501	2003	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	As shown in the middle- right panel, yields on high-yield bonds, the orange line, are up modestly since the last assessment in October.	11	1
201501	2004	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Yields on investment-grade bonds, the green line, are little changed, on net, since the October assessment.	11	1
201501	2005	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	That said, the yield on the 10-year Treasury is down notably over the same period, so spreads on both high-yield and investment-grade bonds have widened, on net, over the past several months.	11	1
201501	2006	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	This widening appears to reflect both some increased concerns about near-term credit risk and some reduction in risk appetite.	11	1
201501	2007	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	A contributor to the increase in high-yield spreads is pessimism about the outlook for credit quality in the energy sector: As indicated by the teal line, yields on high-yield bonds of the energy sector have jumped up.	11	1
201501	2008	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	As discussed in a box in our report, we do not anticipate significant strains on the broader financial system due to the drop in oil prices because leveraged positions related to oil appear limited and the degree of loss-absorbing capital at large banks is much increased.	11	1
201501	2009	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Still, some regional and small banks with concentrated exposures could face notable strains related to loans that are likely to default at the current level of the price of oil.	11	1
201501	2010	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	The widening in spreads in the riskier segment of the corporate debt market has been accompanied by a slowing in issuance, as shown in the bottom-left panel.	11	1
201501	2011	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	The combination of junk bond and leveraged loan issuance slowed in the fourth quarter, largely reflecting a slowing in leveraged loans due to reduced refinancing activity as financial conditions tightened.	11	1
201501	2012	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	The level of outstanding debt in these segments (the black line) has advanced rapidly over the past few years, and it remains to be seen whether recent developments represent a sustained softening in growth.	11	1
201501	2013	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	We have received hints that underwriting quality for leveraged loans may have improved late last year.	11	1
201501	2014	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Average debt multiples (the bottom-right panel), which are one measure of underwriting quality, declined slightly in the fourth quarter for large LBO loans and middle-market loans, perhaps reflecting some response to the intensified supervisory message following the 2013 leveraged lending guidance.	11	1
201501	2015	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Possibly also in response to the guidance, there have been indications that underwriting of deals by smaller broker-dealers or private equity firms has picked up.	11	1
201501	2016	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Your second exhibit looks at broad measures of leverage and maturity transformation.	11	1
201501	2017	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	The rapid growth in riskier corporate debt has boosted net leverage among speculative-grade corporations (the black line in the upper-left chart).	11	1
201501	2018	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	The debt burden, as measured by the interest expense ratio (the red line), has stayed low, but rapid growth of the type seen in recent years has, in the past, presaged elevated defaults in subsequent years.	11	1
201501	2019	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	In the aggregate, business debt relative to nominal GDP (the lower-shaded portion in the exhibit on the right) has increased only modestly, while household credit relative to nominal GDP has moved sideways through the third quarter.	11	1
201501	2020	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	We have yet to see a detectable turn in the credit cycle, and the reduction in private nonfinancial debt relative to overall income seen over the past five years is an important contributor to our assessment that overall financial stability risks are moderate.	11	1
201501	2021	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Nonetheless, we are attuned to the fact that private nonfinancial debt relative to GDP remains above levels seen prior to the mid-2000s.	11	1
201501	2022	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	A range of indicators suggests that the degree of maturity transformation and liquidity risks in the financial sector remain moderate.	11	1
201501	2023	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	For example, the ratio of net short-term wholesale funding of the broad financial sector to nominal GDP, shown in the middle-left panel, remains subdued.	11	1
201501	2024	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	We also have seen a sizable increase in the liquidity buffers at large banks, presumably reflecting the phase-in of the Basel III liquidity-coverage ratio.	11	1
201501	2025	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Nonetheless, we highlighted in our assessment the possibility that the large increase in the role of bond and loan mutual funds promising daily liquidity when the liquidity of the assets held by such funds is uncertain could produce strains if flows out of such funds were to surge.	11	1
201501	2026	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Leverage in the financial sector also appears low.	11	1
201501	2027	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Much of this assessment stems from the increase in loss-absorbing capital within the banking sector:  As reported in the middle-right panel, the leverage ratio (the blue line) has continued to edge up at CCAR banks, while their Tier 1 ratio (the black line) has remained at a level much above pre-crisis levels, reflecting the combination of Basel III requirements and the resilience required in the annual stress test exercises.	11	1
201501	2028	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	The current DFAST and CCAR exercises are under way and will be concluded in early March.	11	1
201501	2029	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Outside the banking sector, pockets of the financial system continue to use high degrees of leverage to boost returns.	11	1
201501	2030	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Hedge fund leverage, shown at the bottom left, remains near post-crisis highs.	11	1
201501	2031	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Recently, several hedge funds active in foreign exchange trades made headlines by reporting significant losses in relation to the sudden appreciation of the Swiss franc.	11	1
201501	2032	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	As highlighted in the first bullet to the right, we expect the effects on the financial system of the sharp appreciation of the Swiss franc earlier this month to be limited.	11	1
201501	2033	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	At the moment, no significant counterparty issues have emerged.	11	1
201501	2034	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Some large US banks experienced trading losses, but these appear modest.	11	1
201501	2035	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	As discussed in the second bullet, one source of volatility since October has been a rekindling of concerns related to Greece and peripheral euro-zone economies, and the potential for surprises remains palpable.	11	1
201501	2036	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Direct exposures of the US financial system to proximate flashpoints appear notably lower than those seen two to three years ago.	11	1
201501	2037	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	We also continue to investigate, as highlighted in the final bullet, the factors that contributed to the volatility in the Treasury market on October 15.	11	1
201501	2038	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	The staff has been coordinating with the CFTC to share data and analyses, but work remains ongoing.	11	1
201501	2039	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	We have also included, on the last page of your handout, our overall stability dashboard for your reference.	11	1
201501	2040	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	This dashboard summarizes our assessment and provides a comparison of conditions today with our current assessment of conditions in 2004 and 2007.	11	1
201501	2041	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	That concludes our set of remarks.	11	1
201501	2042	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The floor is open for questions to any of our briefers.	12	1
201501	2043	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	12	1
201501	2044	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	The only little point I’d like to make on financial stability is that I would suggest that we keep our eye on subprime auto loans.	12	1
201501	2045	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Auto loans now are approaching $1 trillion.	12	1
201501	2046	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	We talk a lot about student debt loans, but if you look at what has happened in terms of used cars this past year, at least according to Morgan, it strikes me that it’s a vulnerable area.	12	1
201501	2047	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I did note on January 20 the lead fellow for Honda at the auto show said that auto lenders are doing “stupid things.	12	1
201501	2048	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	We’ve seen this movie before.	12	1
201501	2049	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	We know how it ends, and it’s not pretty.”	12	1
201501	2050	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I had the staff look into that a little bit.	12	1
201501	2051	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	They found that used cars accounted for 73 percent of subprime auto ABS last year, with terms out to eight years.	12	1
201501	2052	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	It’s just a small fact in the overall credit picture, but you might just want to keep your eye on it.	12	1
201501	2053	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201501	2054	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	12	1
201501	2055	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	12	1
201501	2056	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Yes, thanks.	12	1
201501	2057	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I’d like to ask both David Wilcox and Michael Kiley a question.	12	1
201501	2058	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	David, you showed us PCE, and I was wondering whether anything is happening to real wages in your forecast.	12	1
201501	2059	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	We have real compensation picking up over the course of the next couple of years to, in real terms, about 1½ percent by 2017.	12	1
201501	2060	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	12	1
201501	2061	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks.	12	1
201501	2062	2015-01-28	meeting	WASCHER	In Q4, it’s plus 2¼ percent, which reflects the sharp decline in oil prices in the near term.	12	1
201501	2063	2015-01-28	meeting	WASCHER	And it’s then plus 7 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter.	12	1
201501	2064	2015-01-28	meeting	WASCHER	But, again, that’s mainly due to the big decline in consumer energy prices.	12	1
201501	2065	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	12	1
201501	2066	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Nominal compensation gains have been running in the neighborhood of around 2 percent, so if you smooth through the employment and PCE prices, real compensation gains have been quite meager.	12	1
201501	2067	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks.	12	1
201501	2068	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Michael, I’m just trying to figure out, even with this higher leverage and higher debt and all that, I take it that interest burdens may well be significantly down.	12	1
201501	2069	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	You can see that in the top-left chart in exhibit 2, as an example.	12	1
201501	2070	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t know how general that is, but I assume it’s pretty general?	12	1
201501	2071	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	As you can see on the right, for the business sector as a whole, debt growth really hasn’t looked like that in the speculative-grade portion.	12	1
201501	2072	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	So it is the case that the trend you’ve seen on the upper left is steeper for leverage than it would be for the overall business sector.	12	1
201501	2073	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	That’s reflective of the fact that it has been an area in which there has been a lot of growth—more than 10 percent each year for three years.	12	1
201501	2074	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	It certainly is the case that the interest expense ratio is depressed by the low level of interest rates today, so one might have concerns that that would reverse when the interest rate rises.	12	1
201501	2075	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Certainly we would expect that to happen somewhat.	12	1
201501	2076	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	While leveraged loans tend to be floating rate, it is the case that even speculative-grade firms also issue high-yield bonds.	12	1
201501	2077	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	We have seen a lengthening in the maturity of their debt obligations, and they have the ability to hedge some of their interest rate exposure in various ways.	12	1
201501	2078	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	I wouldn’t take as much solace in the low interest rate expense ratio as might be seen by the quite low recent reading of the red line.	12	1
201501	2079	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Nonetheless, we do think that the debt burden is not as high as would be expected by the high leverage ratio, because interest rates are expected to stay low and the term has been lengthened these liabilities.	12	1
201501	2080	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks.	12	1
201501	2081	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201501	2082	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	12	1
201501	2083	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201501	2084	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I have a couple of questions for Steve.	12	1
201501	2085	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In exhibit 2, you display the behavior of PCE price inflation in this alternative scenario.	12	1
201501	2086	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I first had a question about core price inflation.	12	1
201501	2087	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And my other question tries to tie this back to the scenario in Tealbook A, which had a faster recovery with higher inflation.	12	1
201501	2088	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That scenario seemed to rely on a steeper Phillips curve than is usually used in the Tealbook, and I was wondering what assumption was being used about the slope of the Phillips curve in exhibit 2.	12	1
201501	2089	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	On exhibit 2, that’s total PCE prices.	12	1
201501	2090	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	And for core, the effect would definitely be much more muted, because there is an awful lot of kick in the total happening from the rise in oil prices.	12	1
201501	2091	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	The total increment here to headline inflation is about 1 percentage point, and it’s more like ½ or ¼ percentage point for the core prices.	12	1
201501	2092	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	And your other question, I think, is referring to the alternative scenario that pertains to the domestic economy.	12	1
201501	2093	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	No, I’m sorry.	12	1
201501	2094	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I complicated things.	12	1
201501	2095	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	This one uses our standard SIGMA model, for which we have not altered the Phillips-curve assumptions that we used in previous runs.	12	1
201501	2096	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Okay.	12	1
201501	2097	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	12	1
201501	2098	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Just to be clear, think of a two-by-two matrix in which the columns are different models and the rows are different assumptions about the Phillips curve.	12	1
201501	2099	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Steve’s presentation is in some diagonal that’s different from the one that generated the alternative simulation in Tealbook A.	12	1
201501	2100	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	What we used was the FRB/US model with a juiced-up Phillips curve.	12	1
201501	2101	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	What he used was SIGMA with SIGMA’s standard Phillips curve.	12	1
201501	2102	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And SIGMA’s standard Phillips curve is juiced up or not juiced up relative to FRB/US?	12	1
201501	2103	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	I would answer, definitely juiced up.	12	1
201501	2104	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	It’s much more price-responsive.	12	1
201501	2105	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Well, that’s its normal state.	12	1
201501	2106	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s its normal state, yes.	12	1
201501	2107	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	That’s probably truest in the dynamics, right?	12	1
201501	2108	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	You know, the “impact effects” of shocks.	12	1
201501	2109	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	That’s right.	12	1
201501	2110	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Partly, I think, the assumption of perfect foresight and partly other aspects of the model definitely juice it up.	12	1
201501	2111	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	What I would do is, I would take a look at panel 3, if you’re interested, to get the message that the fall in the dollar and the rise in oil prices would certainly lead to a faster rebound in inflation, but not necessarily take the actual magnitude to the bank.	12	1
201501	2112	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Steve.	12	1
201501	2113	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	12	1
201501	2114	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201501	2115	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I was a little distracted, because President Williams just reminded me that it has been 20 years since he developed—	12	1
201501	2116	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I helped work on—	12	1
201501	2117	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	—helped work on the FRB/US model.	12	1
201501	2118	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	It’s quite an old—	12	1
201501	2119	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	12	1
201501	2120	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Back when he was—	12	1
201501	2121	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Six years old.	12	1
201501	2122	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	12	1
201501	2123	2015-01-28	meeting	MR FISHER	And Al Gore was running the Internet.	12	1
201501	2124	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	More seriously, I’d like to ask David if he could make a few comments on a couple of the alternative scenarios.	12	1
201501	2125	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Picking up on Governor Fischer’s question about wages, I couldn’t help but notice the “Weaker Wage Growth” simulations and how, when wage increases are assumed to stay at their current low of 2 percent rate instead of picking up to that 3½ percent rate, total PCE inflation just goes to 0.9 percent in 2018.	12	1
201501	2126	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	What’s really interesting, of course, is that the federal funds rate over this period is lifting off and going up to 3 percent.	12	1
201501	2127	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	During that period, the economy is doing quite well, but there is a disengagement between economic activity and inflation.	12	1
201501	2128	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	So a few comments on that would be good.	12	1
201501	2129	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Also, against that, there is the “Faster Recovery with Higher Inflation” scenario.	12	1
201501	2130	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I confess I didn’t read that very carefully, but I did notice that the numbers are quite different.	12	1
201501	2131	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	The funds rate is much higher at the end point, and inflation only is at 2½ percent at the end of the simulation period.	12	1
201501	2132	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	It looks to me like this analysis is another piece of evidence that shows it’s a lot easier to deal with rising inflationary pressures because we can increase the funds rate, but we have trouble with these disinflationary periods in which—well, in this case, the funds rate is going up, so I’m not quite sure as to what is going on—it’s more difficult to get inflation up to target.	12	1
201501	2133	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	If you could comment along those lines, that would be helpful.	12	1
201501	2134	2015-01-28	meeting	WASCHER	In the “Weaker Wage Growth” one, the weaker nominal wage growth flows through into lower inflation, and, as you noted, real activity isn’t really affected very much.	12	1
201501	2135	2015-01-28	meeting	WASCHER	In a way—when we run these simulations, we basically turn on the inertial version of the Taylor rule at liftoff.	12	1
201501	2136	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	It doesn’t seem to be very effective, does it?	12	1
201501	2137	2015-01-28	meeting	WASCHER	And it is the inertial part of it.	12	1
201501	2138	2015-01-28	meeting	WASCHER	In general, it lifts off, but it’s not very effective at bringing inflation up.	12	1
201501	2139	2015-01-28	meeting	WASCHER	The responsiveness of inflation in the model to activity isn’t very big, and I think that’s what you’re seeing there.	12	1
201501	2140	2015-01-28	meeting	WASCHER	We did run an alternative scenario in which we implemented the policy rule with an inflation floor included, and that’s noted in a footnote in the text.	12	1
201501	2141	2015-01-28	meeting	WASCHER	That one still lifts off at the same time, but the increase in the funds rate is much more gradual in that version of the policy.	12	1
201501	2142	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	That seems in keeping with my thinking that, when inflation is at these relatively low levels because of something that is difficult to deal with, it requires a more extraordinary use of accommodation—in this case, a “flatter”	12	1
201501	2143	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Taylor rule.	12	1
201501	2144	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	That’s what the inflation floor is doing, relative to what we would normally think.	12	1
201501	2145	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	There is a lot of model uncertainty surrounding this question, apropos of the comment earlier about the SIGMA model.	12	1
201501	2146	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	But I’m just trying to get at the characteristics of the analysis.	12	1
201501	2147	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Monetary policy is much more powerful in the SIGMA model in boosting inflation than it is in the FRB/US model.	12	1
201501	2148	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	So monetary policy in FRB/US has a really hard time getting inflation up to the 2 percent objective.	12	1
201501	2149	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	We do some apples and oranges in presenting to you some scenarios in this section of the Tealbook, some that are generated using the FRB/US model, others that are generated using the SIGMA model.	12	1
201501	2150	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	We think that’s a virtue, to demonstrate for you the fact that one can develop different results using different models.	12	1
201501	2151	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	I think it’s a useful reminder that this is an area where there is a lot of uncertainty and some pretty heated debate about what the right response is.	12	1
201501	2152	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	That’s fine.	12	1
201501	2153	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	The more damaging response that I was hoping I wouldn’t get back from you, which I didn’t yet, is that, except for the 2018 time frame, that inflation rate is actually still going up.	12	1
201501	2154	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I would have guessed that it’s the inertia in inflation, so it’s actually much worse.	12	1
201501	2155	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I’m pointing to this and thinking, “That faster inflation, it’s really not that bad of an outcome, because inflation is at 2½ percent.”	12	1
201501	2156	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	But if you told me that that was on its way to 3 percent, then I would say, “Okay, that’s more of a ‘symmetry of distaste’ across these simulations.”	12	1
201501	2157	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	But your comment about uncertainty as to the mechanisms here also suggests we’re in a different situation.	12	1
201501	2158	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	We’re in a situation right now in which inflation is below our target, so something that lifts up inflation just isn’t that bad at the moment, because we need it to go up anyway.	12	1
201501	2159	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	That’s how I come out from that.	12	1
201501	2160	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	12	1
201501	2161	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	12	1
201501	2162	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201501	2163	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	I have two questions on the financial stability report.	12	1
201501	2164	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	One is on the capital ratios that you show on page 2.	12	1
201501	2165	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	How much different does the leverage ratio look when you use GAAP and net derivatives versus if you use international accounting?	12	1
201501	2166	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Is it a significant difference on that leverage ratio measurement?	12	1
201501	2167	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	For the US banks, I’m not actually sure of the answer to that.	12	1
201501	2168	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	I know that’s a large issue when we make international comparisons.	12	1
201501	2169	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	I assume it would be less, though, under those.	12	1
201501	2170	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	My other question is on the conclusions that the report draws.	12	1
201501	2171	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	The measures of cyclical vulnerabilities look fairly reassuring.	12	1
201501	2172	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	But it’s not as clear to me how I should think about the state of structural vulnerabilities and how you evaluate those relative to those conclusions in there.	12	1
201501	2173	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	And in the report, it talks about that as being an important limitation of your ability to quantitatively measure risk to the financial system.	12	1
201501	2174	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	So my question is, really, how do you incorporate those here?	12	1
201501	2175	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	In view of all of the reforms and changes that may be under way, where do you gauge structural vulnerability, or how should I think about it in relation to the conclusions that you’ve drawn here?	12	1
201501	2176	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Just to provide a little more context for your question, because your question did reference our additional chapter in our assessment in which we did a purely quantitative approach to developing the dashboard that’s shown on your left page, that more or less basically compares a set of numbers with their historical perspective and uses historical ranges as the benchmark.	12	1
201501	2177	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	That is purely a cyclical perspective.	12	1
201501	2178	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	So, for example, if something historically looks very low right now, but very low is still a terrible position, our quantitative folks would say, “Oh, that’s fine, but structurally there may be a problem.”	12	1
201501	2179	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	That supplemental report looks at many of the same factors that we looked at here.	12	1
201501	2180	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Our judgmental report looks at many others, but it faces the same set of challenges.	12	1
201501	2181	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	We try to say, “How do conditions look today relative to history?”	12	1
201501	2182	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	And that’s easy, because in the case of those indicators for which we have some history, we can say, “Well, things are high or low, and high is good or low is bad,” and put together an assessment.	12	1
201501	2183	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	The more difficult challenge is that, historically, there may be indicators—for example, like the historical amount of leverage of banking organizations—for which our assessment now is that it always was too low.	12	1
201501	2184	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	And so, of course, it’s high now, but the question is:  Is it high enough?	12	1
201501	2185	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	If you look at the quantitative indicators, various categories are not green or yellow as they are in our judgmental assessment, but are ice-blue cold.	12	1
201501	2186	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	So, for example, if you look at the picture for capitalization in the bank sector, all of the numbers are much higher than before, much higher than at any other time for the data that we have.	12	1
201501	2187	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Our judgmental assessment is, indeed, capital positions of banking organizations are much improved, that we’ve put in place new requirements.	12	1
201501	2188	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	The banks have transitioned to them.	12	1
201501	2189	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Indeed, they have in most cases already exceeded things like the leverage ratio under the proposed US G-SIB surcharge.	12	1
201501	2190	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Our assessment there would be that if things are actually much improved, they may be green or something.	12	1
201501	2191	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	I don’t know about ice-blue cold, like in the pure quantitative approach.	12	1
201501	2192	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	And then if we were to look elsewhere, there really haven’t been changes.	12	1
201501	2193	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	So that’s why we have a green for financial-sector leverage and not a blue.	12	1
201501	2194	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	For example, on maturity transformation, if you look at the chart I showed you, net short- term funding is much reduced from a cyclical perspective.	12	1
201501	2195	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	In other charts that are in our report, high-quality liquid assets are up within the banking sector.	12	1
201501	2196	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	So there seems to be a reduction in maturity transformation and in liquidity risk in the banking sector.	12	1
201501	2197	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Nonetheless, if we think of leverage or maturity transformation outside the banking sector through securitization or other vehicles, those are much reduced, but some of that reflects more cyclical positions, and there haven’t been as many structural reforms on the shadow banking side.	12	1
201501	2198	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	There we would still note that we have yet to see what the effects of money market reform will be.	12	1
201501	2199	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	Those proposals are only coming into effect next year.	12	1
201501	2200	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	We note increased liquidity transformation in mutual funds.	12	1
201501	2201	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	I highlighted bond and loan funds, but there may be other cases as well.	12	1
201501	2202	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	I think we do see the structural vulnerability as still being important, and that’s why we have a much more yellow assessment than the sort of blue thing.	12	1
201501	2203	2015-01-28	meeting	KILEY	I mean, the cyclical position looks weaker than what our judgmental assessment would be, and that reflects the structural factors.	12	1
201501	2204	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thomas.	12	1
201501	2205	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	My apologies, Madam Chair.	12	1
201501	2206	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	I just want to quickly add one little bit to David’s and Steve’s responses to President Evans’s earlier question.	12	1
201501	2207	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	I think for the “Weaker Wage Growth” scenario, one thing to keep in mind is that, from the perspective of not the inertial Taylor rule but the Taylor (1999) rule, right now the funds rate is surprisingly depressed, as you may remember from Tealbook B.	12	1
201501	2208	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Taylor (1999) would say it already would be at 2 percent now.	12	1
201501	2209	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	And I think one thing that’s going away in that simulation is, effectively, this factor that is keeping the funds rate depressed.	12	1
201501	2210	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	So even though inflation is running so low, it’s appropriate under that rule that policymakers gradually bring the funds rate back up.	12	1
201501	2211	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	I think the peculiar thing is in that scenario, even though inflation is so low from a real-activity perspective, the economy looks reasonably healthy because the unemployment rate is running relatively low.	12	1
201501	2212	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	So the rule looks at it as though the economy is actually strong.	12	1
201501	2213	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Now, this is how the scenario is being constructed, and you might, of course, ask yourself, if you find yourself in such a situation, whether you then might want to reassess what, for example, the level of the natural rate is, but that is outside the scope of this scenario.	12	1
201501	2214	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Right.	12	1
201501	2215	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	12	1
201501	2216	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I think that’s an example of why these simple rules can often keep us well away from our goals because we’re holding to a rule like that, when all of a sudden there’s something else going on that’s unusual historically.	12	1
201501	2217	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	We ought to offer some additional accommodation; or that’s my interpretation of that.	12	1
201501	2218	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Thanks.	12	1
201501	2219	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	12	1
201501	2220	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201501	2221	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I have two questions for David Wilcox and one for Steve Kamin.	12	1
201501	2222	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I’m looking at the forecast summary, panel 5, PCE prices.	12	1
201501	2223	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	When you’re talking about output gap estimates, and we’ve talked about this issue before, you say, “Well, there’s a lot of model uncertainty as well and other types of uncertainty,” so the shaded region is really understating the amount of uncertainty associated with this estimate.	12	1
201501	2224	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Then I go look at the PCE prices, let’s say, for the fourth quarter of 2015, and I wonder if something similar applies so that this confidence region is actually much wider than it appears.	12	1
201501	2225	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	And what always gets me in looking at these pictures is, it looks to me like half the probability is above 2 percent and half the probability is below 2 percent.	12	1
201501	2226	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	So, really, insofar as we can learn something informative from this model about inflation in the fourth quarter of 2015, it is that it’s a coin flip whether headline inflation will be above or below 2 percent at that point.	12	1
201501	2227	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Is that a fair assessment or is that an overstatement?	12	1
201501	2228	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Well, let me clarify first.	12	1
201501	2229	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	My comments about the confidence interval being understated pertained to panel 4, which comes out of the state-based model.	12	1
201501	2230	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Now, with regard to panel 5, I think it’s less obvious that the confidence interval there understates the true uncertainty.	12	1
201501	2231	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	For one thing, while we use FRB/US-based stochastic simulations to generate the confidence intervals in this panel, we also benchmark those against the actual track record of the staff in real-time forecasting, and we get confidence intervals that are a little narrower for the FRB/US model than for the staff real-time track record.	12	1
201501	2232	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	But the two are broadly consistent.	12	1
201501	2233	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	That said, I think there are some important aspects of those confidence intervals that we’ve been digging into deeper lately, pertaining to issues like the ones that you raised about symmetry, for example.	12	1
201501	2234	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	And my expectation is that, over the course of the next six months or so, we’re going to be trying out some new products in the Tealbook that attempt to address those kinds of issues.	12	1
201501	2235	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	For now, I take these confidence intervals as helpful, indicative, but even we don’t confuse them with the gospel truth or anything like that.	12	1
201501	2236	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12	1
201501	2237	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Let me turn to panel 6, then, which is core inflation.	12	1
201501	2238	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Because it’s President Fisher’s final meeting, I’ll ask you whether it would be possible to do some of the analysis in the future based on the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’s trimmed mean of PCE price index as possibly a more rigorous way to think about a smooth measure of inflation instead of core inflation.	12	1
201501	2239	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Well, I hate to send President Fisher out on a disappointing note, but I’m a little skeptical about our ability to do that.	12	1
201501	2240	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	That would be a pretty thoroughgoing exercise because we’d have to recalibrate our models.	12	1
201501	2241	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	This would not be a simple undertaking.	12	1
201501	2242	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	The implications of that, I think, would run fairly deep through the structure of the model.	12	1
201501	2243	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t want to be encouraging about that.	12	1
201501	2244	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	You’re saying you’re going to use an inferior measure permanently.	12	1
201501	2245	2015-01-28	meeting		[Laughter]	12	1
201501	2246	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	We’re going to use the measure that the Committee had indicated that it is focusing on as their objective for monetary policy.	12	1
201501	2247	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	No, headline inflation is the objective.	12	1
201501	2248	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Yes, and the one that is most closely related to that.	12	1
201501	2249	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Also, I’m making a cost-benefit judgment that, in terms of the priority of some of our modeling projects that we have in the pipeline—as helpful as that one might be—I can’t really process in real time what that would be.	12	1
201501	2250	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Some of the other projects that we have in mind for analytical development, I think, will pay very big dividends.	12	1
201501	2251	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12	1
201501	2252	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I’m going to interpret that to mean you think it wouldn’t make that much difference relative to the time cost that would be involved.	12	1
201501	2253	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Correct, yes.	12	1
201501	2254	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12	1
201501	2255	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Madam Chair, let it be recorded, I appreciate being fought over.	12	1
201501	2256	2015-01-28	meeting		[Laughter]	12	1
201501	2257	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12	1
201501	2258	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Let me turn to the presentation “The Foreign Outlook,” exhibit 1, panel 1, “Foreign GDP.”	12	1
201501	2259	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I’m interpreting what you said was, you turned something in to the Tealbook, but then the ECB surprised you to the positive side.	12	1
201501	2260	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	You upgraded the forecast, which is in panel 2, and now it looks like you’re really not changing your world GDP outlook appreciably, according to my reading of panel 1.	12	1
201501	2261	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	That’s essentially correct, although the unexpected part of the increment to euro-area GDP growth that we have built in, in response to the announcement, was in the neighborhood of ¼ percentage point per year for all of the next few years.	12	1
201501	2262	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	With the euro area in general having a weight in our foreign aggregate that’s less than 20 percent, or in that neighborhood, it didn’t end up changing the foreign GDP line that much.	12	1
201501	2263	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	So before the announcement, our current forecast, that black solid color line, was just a teeny bit below where it is now.	12	1
201501	2264	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	I think the story both before and after the announcement was pretty much the same, which is that our outlook was broadly unchanged.	12	1
201501	2265	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Well, I think one of the things that the Committee is going to debate is uncertainty surrounding that outlook.	12	1
201501	2266	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	According to you all, has uncertainty associated with that outlook changed, or is it about the same?	12	1
201501	2267	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Well, okay.	12	1
201501	2268	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	So it’s good to focus on the difference between the change in the modal outlook and the increment to the confidence interval.	12	1
201501	2269	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	There are plenty of uncertainties in the outlook, both on the upside and the downside, and arguably some of those have gotten wider over the past few months.	12	1
201501	2270	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	But I think you could argue that the ECB announcement, representing this forceful action by the ECB, might have diminished the downside risks for the euro area in addition to boosting the modal outlook for the euro area a bit, because all the additional asset purchases probably provide some cushion against financial downside risks, particularly those, for example, that might emanate from Greece.	12	1
201501	2271	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12	1
201501	2272	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	12	1
201501	2273	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	12	1
201501	2274	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201501	2275	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I wanted to follow up on President Bullard’s conversation with David about chart 5 on the forecast summary.	12	1
201501	2276	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Are these numbers quarterly or are they 12-month averages?	12	1
201501	2277	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	No, these are quarterly.	12	1
201501	2278	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I see.	12	1
201501	2279	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Okay.	12	1
201501	2280	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Jeremy, these are quarterly changes?	12	1
201501	2281	2015-01-28	meeting	RUDD	Yes.	12	1
201501	2282	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Okay.	12	1
201501	2283	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s helpful to know when I look at Tealbook A.	12	1
201501	2284	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On page 72 there’s a report on probability of inflation events, and the probability of inflation being below 1 percent over the course of 2015 is reported to be 74 percent.	12	1
201501	2285	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The probability of being below 2 percent is pretty high.	12	1
201501	2286	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	So what should we believe?	12	1
201501	2287	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I’m looking at the fourth quarter on the chart.	12	1
201501	2288	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This chart is going quarter by quarter, and not showing changes over the full year backwards.	12	1
201501	2289	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Sure, okay.	12	1
201501	2290	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12	1
201501	2291	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	So next we have an opportunity to make comments on financial stability, and I have, I believe, three people who have asked to be recognized.	12	1
201501	2292	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I’ll start with President Rosengren.	12	1
201501	2293	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’ll be pretty quick.	12	1
201501	2294	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I just want to follow up on President George’s comment.	12	1
201501	2295	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	She used the word “reassuring,” and, I guess, when I look at the global context for financial stability, “reassuring” would probably not be how I would characterize it, and it gets to her comment on structural vulnerabilities.	12	1
201501	2296	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	So while the overall forecast for Europe seems like it’s improved with the policy change, the risk of a pretty bad outcome, that tail risk, probably has gone up with the Greek election and other things going on with Russia and Ukraine.	12	1
201501	2297	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	And when I think about whether the domestic characterization of asset valuation, leverage, and maturity would pick up the global financial shocks, I’m not sure.	12	1
201501	2298	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	We’ve kind of structured our monitoring, which I think is very useful, to a domestic shock that occurred last time.	12	1
201501	2299	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	And if I think about importing a financial shock from abroad, that might be a different transmission mechanism.	12	1
201501	2300	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	The report highlights, for example, the money market funds’ holdings of European securities.	12	1
201501	2301	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	But during the fall of 2011, it seemed like the broker-dealers were actually one of the major transmission mechanisms, in two respects.	12	1
201501	2302	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	One is, our monoline broker-dealers got very elevated credit default swap rates, which started to create financial vulnerabilities potentially in the United States, and we started to get worried about some of the monoline investment banks.	12	1
201501	2303	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	And going the other way, European banks are still very large in terms of their very large broker-dealers in the United States.	12	1
201501	2304	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	So a serious problem in Europe on transmission mechanisms would be through the broker-dealers.	12	1
201501	2305	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	It’s just a comment about maybe thinking about financial stability shocks that are not domestically oriented.	12	1
201501	2306	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Emerging markets and Europe right now would strike me as two areas.	12	1
201501	2307	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	We talk about the exchange rate and net exports, the financial transmission mechanism separate from those two might be an area to think about at future times.	12	1
201501	2308	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	So that’s just an observation that follows up on President George’s.	12	1
201501	2309	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	12	1
201501	2310	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	12	1
201501	2311	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	I’m not going to make any further comments.	12	1
201501	2312	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	I think Michael answered my question on structural issues.	12	1
201501	2313	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12	1
201501	2314	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And, last, I have President Fisher’s name, with a question mark.	12	1
201501	2315	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	No, ma’am.	12	1
201501	2316	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12	1
201501	2317	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And is there anybody else who would like to comment.	12	1
201501	2318	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chair.	12	1
201501	2319	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	One thing I worry about, and I guess I’d encourage the staff to look at, is that, in Germany and Japan right now, we have 10-year interest rates that are extraordinarily low.	12	1
201501	2320	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	And if central banks actually do achieve their objective of getting back to 2 percent inflation, it would seem that those bond yields are going to move pretty substantially.	12	1
201501	2321	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think it would be useful to understand what the consequences of that type of bond market revaluation might be, because it could be several hundred basis points in a fairly short period of time if they actually are successful in what they are trying to engineer.	12	1
201501	2322	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I just think that would be worth taking a look at.	12	1
201501	2323	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	12	1
201501	2324	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Others?	12	1
201501	2325	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Nellie.	12	1
201501	2326	2015-01-28	meeting	LIANG	Madam Chair, may I respond to one comment by President Rosengren?	12	1
201501	2327	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, of course.	12	1
201501	2328	2015-01-28	meeting	LIANG	We have in the past year looked at transmission channels to the United States from both the EMEs and China through—besides oil and the economy—financial- institution channels.	12	1
201501	2329	2015-01-28	meeting	LIANG	And that would include, first and foremost, through the large banks, including broker-dealers and the trading books and the loan exposures, et cetera.	12	1
201501	2330	2015-01-28	meeting	LIANG	So we have tried to trace that, and in the end, at least over the past year or so, we feel that most of the transmission will be through the economy, through real activity, and that the financial sectors themselves don’t have the direct exposures.	12	1
201501	2331	2015-01-28	meeting	LIANG	That’s not to say there can’t be a lot of indirect exposures, because some of the European banks could have large exposures to the EMEs.	12	1
201501	2332	2015-01-28	meeting	LIANG	Almost certainly they have bigger exposures than banks do in the United States.	12	1
201501	2333	2015-01-28	meeting	LIANG	But, first order, we have been looking at it.	12	1
201501	2334	2015-01-28	meeting	LIANG	I think we’ve gotten a little bit of comfort.	12	1
201501	2335	2015-01-28	meeting	LIANG	I don’t know if “reassuring” is the right word.	12	1
201501	2336	2015-01-28	meeting	LIANG	I don’t think we used “reassuring,” but we’ve gotten some comfort from the fact that institutions recognize these channels and have been taking steps to reduce their exposures, especially to Europe, in the past couple of years.	12	1
201501	2337	2015-01-28	meeting	LIANG	So it’s a trend.	12	1
201501	2338	2015-01-28	meeting	LIANG	We did, I think, evaluate shocks from the EMEs and from China recently, in the past six months or year.	12	1
201501	2339	2015-01-28	meeting	LIANG	We’ve looked at them closely.	12	1
201501	2340	2015-01-28	meeting	LIANG	We’d be happy to send that to you if you haven’t seen it.	12	1
201501	2341	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	And I would add that in the case of our deep dives in the QS report, both on China’s financial system and on emerging market turbulence, we looked very carefully not just at the possibility of these instabilities abroad, but also the channels by which they might affect the US financial system.	12	1
201501	2342	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	And our plans are to work more on this to formalize our analysis of the financial-stability issues abroad and bring them into the overall picture of US financial stability.	12	1
201501	2343	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	12	1
201501	2344	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	On the international front, obviously, the things that we have been most focused on are risks in Europe, Japan, and China.	12	1
201501	2345	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	But as we think about the combination of continued dollar strengthening and a potential interest rate change, there is going to be a different set of countries and financial markets and corporate sectors that have some exposures there.	12	1
201501	2346	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	And we’re probably not that exposed in concentrated ways, but we should certainly be monitoring that.	12	1
201501	2347	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	We are, certainly.	12	1
201501	2348	2015-01-28	meeting	LIANG	We are, absolutely.	12	1
201501	2349	2015-01-28	meeting	LIANG	We think we will have that in two meetings from now.	12	1
201501	2350	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	12	1
201501	2351	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Any further comment?	12	1
201501	2352	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	All right.	12	1
201501	2353	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	After looking very carefully, I see none.	12	1
201501	2354	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	So what I’m going to suggest is that we begin our economic go-round and maybe go for 20 or 25 minutes, and then have a coffee break.	13	1
201501	2355	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And to start us off, President Fisher.	13	1
201501	2356	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2357	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I want to thank President Bullard for his strong endorsement of the trimmed mean measure of inflation that the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas produces.	13	1
201501	2358	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I do wish that the various trimmed mean measures would be discussed—not just ours, but others too—more frequently at this table.	13	1
201501	2359	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I’m going to talk about my District first, Madam Chair, because of the intensity of coverage given to it recently in the media, especially in light of the energy price developments.	13	1
201501	2360	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Then I’m going to talk about oil and gas and its effect on the US economy, something you and I spoke about on the phone and that you asked me to expand on.	13	1
201501	2361	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	And I’m then going to conclude with some general impressions of US economic activity, drawing upon inputs from my CEO contacts.	13	1
201501	2362	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	This being my last FOMC meeting, I felt that you should hear at least one more reference to my interlocutors, having been subjected to them for the past decade.	13	1
201501	2363	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	First, with regard to my District—and I remind you, 98 percent of the output of my District is generated by one state, the state of Texas—labor market data released on Friday were in keeping with what we at the Dallas Fed had forecast and I had reported to this Committee over the past several months.	13	1
201501	2364	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Despite the precipitous declines in oil prices since June, and particularly since November, payroll activity in Texas increased at a 3.67 percent annual pace in December, spot-on to our forecast of 3.6 percent.	13	1
201501	2365	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Employment growth did fall by at least 1 percentage point in the energy-intensive areas of Houston, Midland, and Odessa, but expanded in the technology-intensive areas of Dallas, Arlington, Fort Worth, and places like College Station and Austin.	13	1
201501	2366	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	And, thus, the state unemployment rate fell 0.3 percentage point in December to 4.6 percent.	13	1
201501	2367	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	There is no question that sustained lower energy prices affect Texas.	13	1
201501	2368	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	We produce 37 percent of the nation’s crude oil and one-fourth of its natural gas.	13	1
201501	2369	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	That said, and I think this is the tendency of J.P.	13	1
201501	2370	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Morgan and others who have looked at us, this is not the 1980s all over again.	13	1
201501	2371	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	First, our economy is far better diversified than it was.	13	1
201501	2372	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Oil and gas and mining and all of the support services for those three sectors account for 2.6 percent of total nonfarm employment in Texas.	13	1
201501	2373	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	The share of oil and gas in Texas’s nominal GDP or the state equivalent is 13 percent.	13	1
201501	2374	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Those shares, however, are well below their peaks in the early 1980s, when oil and gas accounted for 5 percent of employment, almost one-fifth of our output, and 17.7 percent of Texas state government revenues.	13	1
201501	2375	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Today, because of a diversified economy and a diversified tax base, oil and gas accounts, as of the end of 2014, were only 4.1 percent of the total state revenue.	13	1
201501	2376	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Second, thus far, the oil price decline is less than that experienced in the 1986 crash, although it may approach the same.	13	1
201501	2377	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Prices fell 63 percent in that period, from November 1985 to July 1986.	13	1
201501	2378	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	And from June 2014 to now, prices have declined 53 percent, although I used the number 55 percent in the presentation earlier.	13	1
201501	2379	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Third, simultaneous with the oil price debacle of the mid-1980s, we did have the US Tax Reform Act of 1986, which changed how commercial real estate was taxed.	13	1
201501	2380	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	It crimped CRE profitability and compounded the severe downturn in commercial real estate in Texas and the banks that loaned to commercial real estate investors.	13	1
201501	2381	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	And, while we do have some small banks in the panhandle, in the Permian Basin, where activity is related to oil and gas indirectly—and almost everything they do is related to oil and gas—most of the middle to larger-sized banks we have contacted say their energy customers are hedged, and that they were hedged before they made their E&P loans to them.	13	1
201501	2382	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I also note that large banks and other investors generally do not have highly leveraged positions related to oil.	13	1
201501	2383	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Across the LISCC and community banks, outstanding oil and gas loans are, at most, 15 percent or, at the highest that we can see, 40 percent of Tier 1 capital.	13	1
201501	2384	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Fourth, it’s important to note that in the mid-1980s, the oil futures trading market was in its nascent stages.	13	1
201501	2385	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	It was not very deep, like it is today.	13	1
201501	2386	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Of course, before 1982, basically there was a fix for oil prices kind of like the gold market spot fix.	13	1
201501	2387	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	But if you look at charts of spot WTI, as we have done, or, most importantly, refined petroleum products going back to 1954, you will notice that before 1986, there was very little short-term volatility, whereas post-1986, as trading markets developed, there are significant price movements in both directions.	13	1
201501	2388	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	That shift in volatility has had an effect on the way bankers and Texas investors finance projects, the success of which depends on the price of oil and gas.	13	1
201501	2389	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Now, having said all of that, we do expect that if prices remain where they are for a prolonged period—remember, I have argued, based on my contacts, that we believe that we are in a price-discovery process led by the Saudis, the Kuwaitis, and the Emirati.	13	1
201501	2390	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	If this were to last more than a year or even two, we at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas expect that, on net, the growth of nonfarm employment will be crimped by job losses in this sector and in related sectors.	13	1
201501	2391	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	And the widely quoted model by two of our economists, Mine Yücel and Michael Plante, indicates a loss of 140,000 or so jobs both directly in this sector and due to knock-on effects.	13	1
201501	2392	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Netting out the benefits to consumers and business users of energy, the bottom line for my District, for Texas, is that we presently expect job growth of 2 to 2½ percent in 2015.	13	1
201501	2393	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Being half-Norwegian, I’ll say that this is not Edvard Munch’s portrait of The Scream as JP Morgan and others have forecast.	13	1
201501	2394	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	We are, however, going to see a slowdown in our employment growth rate, but to the pace of the rest of the United States.	13	1
201501	2395	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	So we will have weaker but still positive employment growth.	13	1
201501	2396	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Let me just add that we have released our manufacturing index on Monday.	13	1
201501	2397	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	We’re soon to release our service index and our retail index, and this is reflected in those numbers, particularly the new orders index, which, to me, is the most important component.	13	1
201501	2398	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	With regard to the nation as a whole, and returning to oil and gas and energy, I think it’s very important for those who are looking at this and its effects to realize that the share of employment for the nation as a whole of this sector is 0.4 percent.	13	1
201501	2399	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	It’s half of what it was at its peak in 1982, when it was 0.8 percent.	13	1
201501	2400	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	The nominal share of the oil and gas sector in US GDP is 2.2 percent.	13	1
201501	2401	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I would add, parenthetically, excluding Texas, it’s 1 percent.	13	1
201501	2402	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Now, that 2.2 percent is down from its peak of 4.3 percent in 1981.	13	1
201501	2403	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	And, finally, cap-ex spending on structures and equipment in the oil and gas sector, important as it is, and having increased in recent years, was 1.2 percent of US GDP.	13	1
201501	2404	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	So we concur at the Dallas Reserve Bank with the summary of the Board memo on oil prices in the Tealbook forecast.	13	1
201501	2405	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	For the United States as a whole, supply- induced lower oil prices are a net benefit to the US economy, and I would say, as I said to you on the phone, Madam Chair, especially for the two lowest-income quartiles.	13	1
201501	2406	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	With regard to the effects of oil and gas price declines on inflation, lower prices temporarily reduce headline inflation but do not, we believe, have a sustained appreciable effect on core inflation—of course, depending on longer-term inflation expectations being well anchored and on an indication that we at the central bank do not indicate that we are responding directly to movements in retail fuel prices.	13	1
201501	2407	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	With regard to the broader economy, on Friday we received the December Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago national activity index.	13	1
201501	2408	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	It summarizes the information, as everybody, especially President Evans, knows, in 85 different indicators of real activity.	13	1
201501	2409	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	We at the the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas combine the three-month moving average index of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago with the ISM manufacturing new orders sub-index to get what we feel is a real-time forecast of annualized current-quarter real GDP growth.	13	1
201501	2410	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	For the fourth quarter of 2014, that forecast was 3.2 percent, the same as Macroeconomic Advisers.	13	1
201501	2411	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	The Tealbook is, I think, considerably lower than that.	13	1
201501	2412	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	To be sure, GDP growth is noisy from quarter to quarter and very difficult to predict, but I think the appropriate inferences are that, one, the economy stayed on a solidly above-trend growth path in the final quarter of 2014, and, two, the risk to the Tealbook forecast, in our opinion, is tilted to the upside.	13	1
201501	2413	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I am hearing this from my CEO contacts and my corporate interlocutors.	13	1
201501	2414	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	As one of them summarized, “It’s not bending the mast, but we have a good deal of wind in our sails.”	13	1
201501	2415	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	For example, of the 22 sectors serviced by the nation’s largest railroad, 18 are performing strongly and only 4 are weak.	13	1
201501	2416	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	The telephone companies that I speak to, particularly the two largest, report that their large enterprise business is booming, something they haven’t seen for many years, while small business spending continues to chug along.	13	1
201501	2417	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Now, to quote Randall Stevenson, the CEO of AT&T and Chairman of the Business Roundtable, he is “as bullish as I have been since the year 2007.”	13	1
201501	2418	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	This may have to do with the resurgence of confidence among US manufacturers.	13	1
201501	2419	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	An example is that we know that today, anything that uses electricity has a semiconductor component.	13	1
201501	2420	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	And while business for Texas Instruments has expanded handsomely internationally over the past several years, for 2015 it expects 15 percent of its sales to come from within the United States.	13	1
201501	2421	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	That’s versus 10 percent only four years ago.	13	1
201501	2422	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	The retailers I talked to, which ranged from Walmart to 7-Eleven to the casual diners— my favorite term—to J.C.	13	1
201501	2423	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Penney and others, as well as the airlines and broadcasters and hoteliers, all of them reported a surge in demand at year-end, and especially in the first three weeks of January, except in the sales of apparel.	13	1
201501	2424	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	An example:  Disney’s theme parks “broke every record in the book,” according to their CEO.	13	1
201501	2425	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	They are running 96 percent occupancy in their 40,000 hotel rooms despite the measles outbreak in Los Angeles.	13	1
201501	2426	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, reported a surge in spending in what he calls discretionary spending apps, things that people—he wouldn’t say this publicly, by the way—really don’t need but they’re spending money on.	13	1
201501	2427	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Some of the telephone retailers report that their discretionary items, like power boosters for cell phones, sold strongly after the Christmas holiday and have done so for the first three weeks of January.	13	1
201501	2428	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Consumer electronics, TVs, et cetera, ended the year strongly.	13	1
201501	2429	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Overall, according to MasterCard’s SpendingPulse program—which I like to study the entrails of—retail sales, ex auto, ex gas were up 4 percent in December, closing the year at plus 3.9 percent for 2014.	13	1
201501	2430	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	And in January, according to the CEO of MasterCard, it was “a bit stronger than that.”	13	1
201501	2431	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	If you look at the Conference Board’s report that was released today and you look at the NBER survey that was released yesterday, the reports of my interlocutors seem to confirm what we saw from the combination of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago’s National Activity Index and our own bank’s read of the ISM entrails.	13	1
201501	2432	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	So I judge the economy to be in a position to continue to see a reduction in unemployment, increasing confidence, and maintenance of price stability, albeit lower than 2 percent.	13	1
201501	2433	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I judge the risk to the Tealbook forecast as tilted to the upside.	13	1
201501	2434	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I believe the United States, absent some exogenous shock, to be in a very sweet spot.	13	1
201501	2435	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	And as to the output gap, as indicated by David Wilcox, I believe it is close to being closed.	13	1
201501	2436	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	And I will close by reminding you that we are mindful, especially at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, of the nonlinearity or the convex nature of the Phillips curve.	13	1
201501	2437	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2438	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, President Fisher.	13	1
201501	2439	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13	1
201501	2440	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2441	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	In recent weeks, our anecdotal reports have become noticeably more optimistic on balance.	13	1
201501	2442	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	For example, a bank CEO from South Carolina said “Fear has subsided,” and that loan demand and credit quality are now better than at any time since 2007.	13	1
201501	2443	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	He also added that an increase in the funds rate would be no event, in his view, because borrowing costs would still be quite low.	13	1
201501	2444	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Our other bankers are reporting good growth in pipelines as well and are using excess liquidity to support new lending.	13	1
201501	2445	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Both our composite manufacturing index and our services revenue index, released just this morning, indicated continuing broad expansion in our District in January, and expectations for six months ahead are remarkably high in both surveys as well.	13	1
201501	2446	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I will add that our retail services sector index rebounded significantly after dropping from November to December.	13	1
201501	2447	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	In housing, the continuing themes and reports in the Fifth District are strength in multifamilies and sluggishness in single- family housing.	13	1
201501	2448	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	A comment from one of our directors, the CEO of a bank with an active mortgage servicing business, was typical of what we are hearing.	13	1
201501	2449	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	He said that he doubts that first-time homeowners are coming back anytime soon.	13	1
201501	2450	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	With regard to national conditions, the key element in the Tealbook forecast is the trajectory of consumer spending.	13	1
201501	2451	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	The spending data we’ve received in the past few months of 2014 were quite strong on the whole, and the Tealbook has revised its projections of consumer spending growth markedly higher.	13	1
201501	2452	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	The staff now expects consumption growth at about 4 percent this year and 3½ percent for next year.	13	1
201501	2453	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Compared with the 2¼ percent consumption growth we saw for most of this expansion, this represents a noteworthy pickup, and I’m now convinced that this is likely to persist.	13	1
201501	2454	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Falling gasoline prices have no doubt provided a significant boost to real income and real spending, but this is a one-time level effect, and the growth effect is likely to dissipate in a couple of quarters.	13	1
201501	2455	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	The strength in consumer spending has also been driven, I think, by improving labor markets and higher net worth.	13	1
201501	2456	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	My sense is that these will leave a more lasting imprint on consumer spending growth after the one-time level effect of the decline in oil prices has played out.	13	1
201501	2457	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	So I think consumer spending growth this year is likely to start out strong but tail off perhaps a little earlier than in the Tealbook.	13	1
201501	2458	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I also concur with several other elements of the Tealbook forecast.	13	1
201501	2459	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Nonresidential investment looks positive, with an improved outlook for equipment and tangibles offsetting weakness in oil and gas exploration.	13	1
201501	2460	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Government spending will be flat, and net exports are likely to be a drag on economic growth, because of the strength in the dollar.	13	1
201501	2461	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	On housing I’m not nearly as optimistic as the Tealbook, though, because I think the shift in housing preferences that we’ve seen is likely to be more persistent.	13	1
201501	2462	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	The bottom line is, my GDP forecast would be somewhat below Tealbook for this year and next but still stronger than it was in recent meetings.	13	1
201501	2463	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Turning to inflation, I’d like to thank the staff for their extensive and very timely analysis of inflation expectations.	13	1
201501	2464	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	The TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation have been grinding lower over the past several months, and it’s natural to worry about whether that reflects an erosion in credibility of our commitment to 2 percent inflation.	13	1
201501	2465	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	It’s striking that, as documented in the Tealbook and the accompanying memo, an array of approaches using different methods and different data all indicate that longer-run inflation expectations—as opposed to compensation—have been quite stable, even as headline and core inflation have fallen in recent months.	13	1
201501	2466	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	If oil prices were to decline further, it would put further downward pressure on headline inflation and might yet pose a risk to inflation expectations.	13	1
201501	2467	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	However, if oil prices have reached bottom for this cycle, as it appears may be the case, then the stability thus far of measures of expected inflation would make me fairly confident that we will emerge with inflation expectations well anchored near our target, and that core inflation will move back to 2 percent.	13	1
201501	2468	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Barring further shocks, I would expect that to occur somewhat more rapidly than at the glacial pace shown in the Tealbook.	13	1
201501	2469	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	The striking divergence between inflation compensation and inflation expectations over the past few months highlights the importance of the distinction between the two.	13	1
201501	2470	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	At times it’s easy to treat compensation and expectations as synonymous, but I’m afraid that we are not always careful enough about this difference in our external communications.	13	1
201501	2471	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	We have been careful with the literal wording of our statement.	13	1
201501	2472	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	The last sentence in the first paragraph says, “Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined somewhat further; survey- based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.”	13	1
201501	2473	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	That’s the sentence in the first paragraph.	13	1
201501	2474	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	But this may place too much emphasis on measures that we know are flawed as indicators of expected inflation.	13	1
201501	2475	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	It leaves out the fact that market-based measures of inflation expectations have also remained stable.	13	1
201501	2476	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I think we should be quite mindful, as we go forward, of that distinction between inflation expectations and compensation, and in future communications I think we should try to find a way to deemphasize inflation compensation and draw more attention to market-based measures of expected inflation.	13	1
201501	2477	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	One final thought:  The economic outlook has improved significantly in the past six months.	13	1
201501	2478	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I think the inflation outlook could also change significantly over a short period as well.	13	1
201501	2479	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Thank you very much, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2480	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201501	2481	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13	1
201501	2482	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2483	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	The economy is showing solid momentum, with positive news from nearly every sector.	13	1
201501	2484	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Given continued exceptional job growth and steady declines in unemployment and other measures of slack, I expect our full employment goal will be reached by the end of this year, if not sooner.	13	1
201501	2485	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	The improving labor market along with the plunge in energy prices have also brightened prospects for households.	13	1
201501	2486	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Consumer sentiment and consumer expectations of future income growth have jumped sharply.	13	1
201501	2487	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	While our economic recovery from the Great Recession is nearing completion, the opposite is true abroad, where progress has been halting.	13	1
201501	2488	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	The strong global cross-currents that are present in the outlook require special attention, and in this regard the recent announcement of further quantitative easing by the ECB is very welcome news for economic growth prospects.	13	1
201501	2489	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	The various global factors, including the plunge in oil prices, the stronger dollar, and the bond rally, appear largely offsetting, and these developments seem to be a modest boost for US growth this year and a modest negative in 2016.	13	1
201501	2490	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Specifically, since our previous meeting, like the Tealbook, I have edged up my forecast for US real GDP growth this year to nearly 3 percent, and based on the maximum employment mandate alone, we should be in the process of normalizing policy already.	13	1
201501	2491	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, the big question mark is the outlook for inflation.	13	1
201501	2492	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Actually, for a brief moment there were some disturbing developments in the intermeeting period.	13	1
201501	2493	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	You know, being at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, we look at a lot of high-tech measures of economic and financial conditions and use Google Trends, and we noticed a lot of discussion of deflation.	13	1
201501	2494	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	But then, of course, we found it was another one of these New England Patriots activities.	13	1
201501	2495	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13	1
201501	2496	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Undocumented.	13	1
201501	2497	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Well, 11 out of 12 were deflated.	13	1
201501	2498	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	That’s not documented?	13	1
201501	2499	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	13	1
201501	2500	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do know that the defense in Seattle are buying many air pumps so they’ll make sure that the balls are properly inflated for the Super Bowl.	13	1
201501	2501	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of the underlying trend in inflation, we’re only about ½ percentage point below our objective, but our continued progress toward that objective remains a forecast.	13	1
201501	2502	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	And like any forecast, it is subject to uncertainty and risks.	13	1
201501	2503	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, the drop in energy prices has pushed down headline year-over-year inflation numbers to zero and even into negative territory.	13	1
201501	2504	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even for core inflation, I expect the downward price pressures from a stronger dollar and the path to a lower energy price will offset for a time the upward pressure arising from reduced slack.	13	1
201501	2505	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Based on the experience of the past two decades, these transitory influences should not have persistently depressing effects on inflation, and I continue to expect a gradual move back of inflation toward our 2 percent objective over the next two years.	13	1
201501	2506	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I find some support for this view when I look at disaggregated PCE price data.	13	1
201501	2507	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	First, and I actually have this written down, the trimmed mean PCE price index—which I do refer to quite often here and in the public, because I do find it a useful measure of underlying inflation—shows little sign of deceleration.	13	1
201501	2508	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Second, my staff finds that, at least so far, the disinflationary pressures seen in overall PCE prices are driven by a relatively narrow set of items.	13	1
201501	2509	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	That is, the current downward price movements are not nearly as broad based as they were, for example, during the 2009 to 2010 episode, when expenditure-weighted diffusion indexes showed the price declines distributed across a wide swath of categories.	13	1
201501	2510	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	A key driver of my expectation that inflation will gradually return to our objective is the reduction in economic slack, but there is some uncertainty about the strength of this linkage, and a Phillips curve, broadly interpreted, can be formulated in many different ways.	13	1
201501	2511	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	In this regard, I too appreciated the Tealbook’s special “Alternative View” box that examined a nonlinear version of the Phillips curve as a substitute for the Tealbook’s baseline specification.	13	1
201501	2512	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	More generally, I think such alternative perspectives are really valuable and helpful, and I applaud each and every one of them for helping us avoid the trap of groupthink and really helping us think through some of these important issues.	13	1
201501	2513	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, theoretical support for a nonlinear Phillips curve can be found in the downward rigidity of nominal wages.	13	1
201501	2514	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	As the Tealbook showed, the problem faced by standard Phillips curve models is that, despite the substantial fall in unemployment over the past several years, nominal compensation growth has remained tepid.	13	1
201501	2515	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	As I described last April, my staff has found that this pattern of weak nominal wage growth during the early and middle parts of the economic recovery is not unique to this episode.	13	1
201501	2516	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, in the recoveries of the early 1990s and the early 2000s, we saw a very similar pattern in which wage gains lagged the cycle.	13	1
201501	2517	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	In each episode, unemployment gaps narrowed significantly before nominal wage growth picked up from low levels.	13	1
201501	2518	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	To explain this lag in wage acceleration, my staff focused on difficulties in cutting nominal wages.	13	1
201501	2519	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	The constraint on wage cuts was particularly binding after the Great Recession, due to the severity of economic shocks along with the low inflation rate.	13	1
201501	2520	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	As a result, a very high share of workers reported that they earned the same wage as they had a year earlier.	13	1
201501	2521	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, in a flexible market, many of these workers would receive wage cuts during the recession.	13	1
201501	2522	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	So wage growth fell, in fact, by less during the recession than it would have otherwise.	13	1
201501	2523	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	As a result, once the economy starts to recover, there is a stock of past-deferred wage cuts that need to be slowly overcome as inflation and productivity growth bring real wages back into the balance before nominal wage growth can return to normal.	13	1
201501	2524	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Additional recent work by my staff finds further support for this mechanism by looking at cross-industry comparisons.	13	1
201501	2525	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	They show that this stock of pent-up wage cuts that needs to be worked off is bigger in those industries for which the downward nominal wage rigidity appears to be most prevalent.	13	1
201501	2526	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	These are the industries in which nominal wage growth has been slow relative to declines in unemployment.	13	1
201501	2527	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	In industries for which rigidities are less widespread, nominal wage growth has returned to levels more consistent with the current labor market conditions.	13	1
201501	2528	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	The key takeaway from all of this work is that the recent tepid wage growth is, in fact, entirely consistent with an improving labor market in a low-inflation environment.	13	1
201501	2529	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	As we close in on full employment over the next year, the return to more normal patterns of wage growth should reemerge.	13	1
201501	2530	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, we are seeing incipient signs of this normalization already with the share of workers experiencing zero wage adjustments starting to come down.	13	1
201501	2531	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, all told, this process should help inflation move back to target.	13	1
201501	2532	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13	1
201501	2533	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	May I ask a question?	13	1
201501	2534	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	13	1
201501	2535	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	One of the things that I thought was that unemployment is usually the lagging indicator, and it seems to be well ahead of wages and prices at the moment.	13	1
201501	2536	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Is that unusual?	13	1
201501	2537	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think my view is that unemployment is a lagging indicator relative to, say, GDP.	13	1
201501	2538	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	But in terms of wage growth, I think the typical pattern is a slower response of wages relative to unemployment or output gaps.	13	1
201501	2539	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	At least that’s my view of what we usually find in these Phillips curves.	13	1
201501	2540	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	13	1
201501	2541	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Governor Fischer, we wrote an economic letter on this subject that goes into some detail on what President Williams just mentioned in terms of the lag between unemployment and wage acceleration.	13	1
201501	2542	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I’d be happy to share it with you.	13	1
201501	2543	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Could you get it into the mail tonight?	13	1
201501	2544	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I’ll have it to you by coffee break, all right?	13	1
201501	2545	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	You have to get access to your BlackBerry.	13	1
201501	2546	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	We don’t want to flood you, however, with memos.	13	1
201501	2547	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	[Laughter]	13	1
201501	2548	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	A blizzard of memos.	13	1
201501	2549	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I know how productive the Dallas bank is, but we’re not flooded yet from Dallas.	13	1
201501	2550	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	13	1
201501	2551	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2552	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m going to respond briefly to some of the comments that President Lacker made about inflation compensation versus expectations.	13	1
201501	2553	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You know, as the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis has exposited in a recent memo, there is a distinction.	13	1
201501	2554	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We actually think that that distinction favors the usage of compensation as opposed to trying to tease out some magical expectation measure, one that I’m not sure exactly where it comes from, as opposed to actually relying on the hard data on compensation.	13	1
201501	2555	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, why do I say that?	13	1
201501	2556	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s because of the fact that compensation measures are compounding two different things: one, where inflation is going to be going on an average basis going forward, and, two, in terms of what the real outcomes are that are going to be associated with the average for inflation.	13	1
201501	2557	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	When compensation declines, it could be either because the average inflation rate that people are expecting going forward is going down, or because they’re associating that expectation with a very poor outcome in terms of real activity.	13	1
201501	2558	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think both of those should lead us to be more concerned about a low inflation outcome than we would be otherwise.	13	1
201501	2559	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I think there’s an argument to be made, that we’ve made in the past, for focusing on compensation measures as opposed to what’s a much more arduous measure of teasing out expectations.	13	1
201501	2560	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	With all of that said, I think there’s room for rich debate on those topics.	13	1
201501	2561	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’d be very opposed to removing references to market-based compensation from the statement.	13	1
201501	2562	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we should, first, stick as much as possible to the factual statements in the first paragraph and, second, removing that just because those are moving downward at this current moment in time does not send the right kind of message about data dependence and transparency on the part of this Committee.	13	1
201501	2563	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me turn now to briefly discussing conditions in the Ninth District before returning to the national inflation picture.	13	1
201501	2564	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	President Fisher did a great job of talking through the oil picture in Texas, and the lower oil prices are also going to be affecting my District through the Bakken region of western North Dakota and eastern Montana, which has fewer people living in it than Texas.	13	1
201501	2565	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We expect that the effects on investment and employment within western North Dakota and eastern Montana will become more noticeable as we move through 2015.	13	1
201501	2566	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But the Ninth District economy remains strong.	13	1
201501	2567	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Right now the unemployment rate in Minnesota has fallen to 3.6 percent.	13	1
201501	2568	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It is about 0.5 percentage point below its pre-recession low in 2006.	13	1
201501	2569	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Interestingly, at the same time, wage pressures remain moderate, even in low- unemployment locales like the Twin Cities, whose unemployment rate is 3.2 percent.	13	1
201501	2570	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	These observations are consistent with a number of different hypotheses.	13	1
201501	2571	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One is that the natural rate of unemployment in Minnesota may be no higher, or may even be lower, than it was prior to the Great Recession.	13	1
201501	2572	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Another alternative is, as President Williams was making reference to, that wage rigidities were more significant in the wake of this particular recessionary episode.	13	1
201501	2573	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And another possibility is that inflation expectations have declined.	13	1
201501	2574	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	They would all push in the same direction of constraining wage growth.	13	1
201501	2575	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This brings me to the national economy.	13	1
201501	2576	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As many of you have noted in past meetings, 2014 was an outstanding year in terms of improvements in the labor market.	13	1
201501	2577	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Despite those improvements, however, the inflation outlook did not improve, and by some measures deteriorated significantly.	13	1
201501	2578	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m not talking here about the near-term outlook, which is naturally being dragged down by the unexpected decline in the prices of energy goods and services.	13	1
201501	2579	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The issue is that well after those oil price effects wane, Tealbook A, projects that inflation will still rise very slowly, not returning to target until 2019.	13	1
201501	2580	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Furthermore, as the minutes from our previous meeting note, the key assumption in the inflation forecast in Tealbook A, is that long- run inflation expectations, which the staff currently estimate to be 1¾ percent, will rise back to the Committee’s goal of 2 percent.	13	1
201501	2581	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So a key underlying aspect of the staff’s forecast right now is that longer-run inflation expectations are at 1¾ percent, but they will rise back to the Committee’s goal of 2 percent over time.	13	1
201501	2582	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is a fine benchmark assumption, and I don’t quarrel with it, but I don’t think we can take this assumption for granted.	13	1
201501	2583	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Except for a couple of months in early 2012, PCE core inflation has been below 2 percent for more than six years.	13	1
201501	2584	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Headline inflation has been below 2 percent for more than two and a half years, and here I’m referring to the 12-month trailing moving average.	13	1
201501	2585	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Elsewhere around the world, disinflationary trends seem strong.	13	1
201501	2586	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	All of these observations have the potential to create downside risk to the credibility of our inflation target—that is, doubts in the mind of the public about the inflation rate we will actually achieve in the longer run.	13	1
201501	2587	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In my view, we cannot be confident about the staff’s assumption with regard to inflation expectations unless our actions display a clear desire to return inflation to target.	13	1
201501	2588	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The behavior of financial market prices over the past six months and, really, especially over the past month reinforces these credibility concerns.	13	1
201501	2589	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In particular, market-based five-year, five-year-ahead inflation expectations or compensation fell further to new lows over the intermeeting period.	13	1
201501	2590	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The premiums that option traders are paying to insure themselves against low inflation have also risen.	13	1
201501	2591	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It is true that survey measures of long-term inflation expectations remain within their historical ranges, and that is comforting.	13	1
201501	2592	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But if we think about this as a signal extraction problem, the overall signal about the credibility of our inflation target from both kinds of measures of longer-term inflation expectations has to be seen as sobering.	13	1
201501	2593	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Many of you have suggested that the recent gratifying improvement in labor market performance justifies further tightening of monetary policy even though inflation has remained muted.	13	1
201501	2594	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I see credibility risks in basing our monetary policy choices too much on the evolution of the real economy.	13	1
201501	2595	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One way to interpret the monetary policy events of the 1960s and the 1970s is that the public became convinced that the FOMC was basing its policy choices largely on the evolution of employment rather than on the evolution of inflation.	13	1
201501	2596	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As a result, the public lost confidence in the FOMC’s willingness to take systematic actions to keep inflation low, and inflation expectations became unanchored to the upside.	13	1
201501	2597	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Fast forward to 2015, and the FOMC is contemplating tightening policy in the absence of inflationary pressures simply because employment has risen, quite smartly, for the past year.	13	1
201501	2598	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Such a decision may suggest to the public that the FOMC is, again, basing its decision primarily on the real economy, as opposed to nominal measures.	13	1
201501	2599	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And, just as in the 1960s and 1970s, this focus on the real side creates a risk of unanchoring inflation expectations, but this time to the downside as opposed to the upside.	13	1
201501	2600	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll have more to say about our policy choices tomorrow, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2601	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	13	1
201501	2602	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2603	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	13	1
201501	2604	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	If I could just offer a brief and friendly rejoinder to my friend from Minneapolis.	13	1
201501	2605	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	The first thing to say is that I don’t feel that the inflation-expectations measure is any more magical than things like underutilization of labor or maximum employment or the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.	13	1
201501	2606	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	But on a more serious note, I commend the Minneapolis Fed for putting in print a very clear explanation for both a broad audience and a technical audience of the relationship between inflation compensation and inflation expectations.	13	1
201501	2607	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I thought it was a great contribution.	13	1
201501	2608	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	It makes clear that inflation expectations are a simple weighted average where the weights are probabilities of future possible inflation rates.	13	1
201501	2609	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Inflation compensation is the same thing, one in which the weights combine both the probability and the margin of utility or a version of the states of the world in which particular inflation rates take place.	13	1
201501	2610	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I’m very sympathetic to the notion that deriving our behavior from the fundamentals of individuals’ welfare would lead us to take very seriously those margin utilities.	13	1
201501	2611	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	On the other hand, I view our consensus statement as basically making a statement about expected inflation, about what inflation itself is supposed to average, not the combination of inflation and a marginal utility.	13	1
201501	2612	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I think it’s a little easier to picture, a little easier for people to imagine, easier for people to think about.	13	1
201501	2613	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	And to use an analogy I’ve used several times before, it’s easier to put into your retirement-planning software than it is to put in inflation compensation.	13	1
201501	2614	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	That motivates my focus on this.	13	1
201501	2615	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	But I just wanted to acknowledge, first of all, the contribution of the exposition and, in addition, the worthy point that the preferences of the people that make up our economy are important to take into account.	13	1
201501	2616	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I will forgo the opportunity of offering a further rejoinder to the rejoinder.	13	1
201501	2617	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	13	1
201501	2618	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And I will take this opportunity to suggest that we have a break for about 15 minutes to grab some coffee.	13	1
201501	2619	2015-01-28	meeting		[Coffee break]	13	1
201501	2620	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s get going.	13	1
201501	2621	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	13	1
201501	2622	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2623	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Deflation has been in the headlines of the leading New England papers all week, although rather than focusing on the general price level, they have focused on 12 footballs used in the Patriots game.	13	1
201501	2624	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	[Laughter]	13	1
201501	2625	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	So I didn’t ignore President Williams’s observation.	13	1
201501	2626	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Interestingly, taking credit for deflation seems no more popular for football players than it is for central bankers.	13	1
201501	2627	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	My own view of recent data is that we should be particularly humble about future inflation trends and be sure that we learn from the mistakes of our Japanese and European colleagues to ensure that we do not allow inflation to drift significantly below our inflation goal.	13	1
201501	2628	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Reconciling the message from the real economy with readings on inflation is a bit complicated at this point.	13	1
201501	2629	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	There has been a clear improvement in labor markets, reflected by the 5.6 percent U-3 measure of unemployment.	13	1
201501	2630	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, the ultimate success of policy should not be judged by how much improvement has occurred from a truly horrific outcome, but how long it will take to achieve our dual goals.	13	1
201501	2631	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	For unemployment, that is complicated by the lack of precision in measuring full employment.	13	1
201501	2632	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	In light of the absence of wage and price pressures in aggregate or disaggregated data, and the fact that since 2007 the workforce has become more educated and older, I’ve reduced my estimate of the full-employment unemployment rate to 5 percent, and it’s quite possible that evidence over the next year may convince me to move it even lower.	13	1
201501	2633	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, unlike our unemployment goal, our inflation goal is absolutely precise.	13	1
201501	2634	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	We have a 2 percent PCE inflation goal.	13	1
201501	2635	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	In the presence of the oil shock, focus on core inflation seems justified.	13	1
201501	2636	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	In fact, for this very reason, I would have preferred to focus on core inflation as our target when we chose the target.	13	1
201501	2637	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	My forecast for core inflation for 2015 is below the Tealbook forecast and much below our 2 percent target.	13	1
201501	2638	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	My low inflation forecast is unfortunately consistent with the growing evidence in financial market prices of the loss in confidence that we will attain our inflation goal any time soon.	13	1
201501	2639	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	The 10-year Treasury rate is below 2 percent, and a variety of forward spreads that embed inflation expectations are at lows last seen during the financial crisis.	13	1
201501	2640	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	These financial signals are concerning and should make us less confident that we will reach our inflation goal within a reasonable time.	13	1
201501	2641	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	While we can parse the data to downplay its importance, in view of the forceful monetary actions being taken in Europe and Japan to reverse their historically low inflation rates, we should be quite sure we are not repeating their mistakes.	13	1
201501	2642	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	In both Europe and Japan, large inflation misses have proved to be quite difficult to reverse.	13	1
201501	2643	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I take little comfort in stable survey measures.	13	1
201501	2644	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	In Japan, longer-run survey-based inflation expectations were surprisingly stable even after the data had made it quite clear that Japan had a deflation problem.	13	1
201501	2645	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Nor do I take comfort in inflation equations that have been adjusted over the years to reflect a “well-anchored” assumption, because most of these models are used to replace inflation models that failed to reflect changes in expectation settings since the mid-1980s.	13	1
201501	2646	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	We may once again be missing how expectations are formed at a time when central banks in developed countries globally are having difficulty reaching their inflation goals.	13	1
201501	2647	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Finally, the risks to even our good news on the real side of the economy seem skewed to the downside.	13	1
201501	2648	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Actions by Russian dissidents in Ukraine and the potential for Greek political upheaval are both troubling.	13	1
201501	2649	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	The likelihood of significant negative shocks is too high, in view of our inability to offset their effects completely.	13	1
201501	2650	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I am a patient person.	13	1
201501	2651	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I hope patience is sufficient.	13	1
201501	2652	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	13	1
201501	2653	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201501	2654	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13	1
201501	2655	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2656	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	The anecdotal reports we received in the cycle of District contracts ending last week broadly line up with the incoming data.	13	1
201501	2657	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard positive and optimistic characterizations of demand and hiring needs side by side with decidedly cool descriptions of business expectations for input cost inflation, wage pressures, and pricing power.	13	1
201501	2658	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Oil and gas exploration spending is being curtailed, and some layoffs in that sector are occurring.	13	1
201501	2659	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Otherwise our contacts generally confirm a continuing, rather robust pace of business activity.	13	1
201501	2660	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Labor demand is reasonably strong and consistent with sustained payroll jobs growth, similar to that which we’ve seen in recent months.	13	1
201501	2661	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	The wages picture really hasn’t changed substantively.	13	1
201501	2662	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Firms report an intent to give raises of 2 to 3 percent on average.	13	1
201501	2663	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	There seems to be growing anticipation of wage pressure, but this hasn’t yet translated into broad compensation pressure and action in response.	13	1
201501	2664	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Finally, the improving tenor of business sentiment seems to be generating greater appetite for business investment.	13	1
201501	2665	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Capital expenditures for expansion are being mentioned across a broad swath of industries, most notably in the transportation sector.	13	1
201501	2666	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	My outlook is little changed from the December meeting and pretty much in line with the Tealbook.	13	1
201501	2667	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	With the strength evident in the second half of 2014, I’m assuming a GDP growth run rate of around 3 percent.	13	1
201501	2668	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Both the recent incoming data and anecdotal reports have increased my confidence in that view.	13	1
201501	2669	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Associated with this optimism about economic growth, I expect continuing payroll job strength and declining headline unemployment.	13	1
201501	2670	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I continue to project the U-3 unemployment rate to reach 5.3 percent by year-end, consistent with the December SEP central tendency, and I would not be surprised if a U-3 reading at this level came earlier.	13	1
201501	2671	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	My outlook for prices has year-over-year headline PCE near zero at midyear.	13	1
201501	2672	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m not expecting much of a pass-through of lower crude oil prices and declining gasoline and refined product prices on core inflation numbers.	13	1
201501	2673	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	But at the same time, I expect no real firming of core inflation readings over the coming months, and I am increasingly apprehensive about dismissing the behavior of market-based inflation expectations measures.	13	1
201501	2674	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	It’s evident to me that the discussion of the timing of liftoff in the go-round following this one reflects some sentiment in the Committee favoring June liftoff.	13	1
201501	2675	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	A projected June liftoff could imply the signaling of that potentiality in March.	13	1
201501	2676	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m not very comfortable with that prospect given the Committee’s repeated promulgation of data dependency as our guiding light.	13	1
201501	2677	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Between now and our March FOMC meeting, we will get really only one incremental monthly retail price report, the January CPI and PCE reports.	13	1
201501	2678	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m not hopeful that this January data will clarify matters and bolster confidence that the inflation trend is soon to turn in the direction of our target.	13	1
201501	2679	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	So any forecast-based signals sent in March that start a two-meeting countdown to liftoff will rely on rather light evidence, in my view.	13	1
201501	2680	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I think there is a good chance that it will feel more like a leap of faith than a data-informed forecast.	13	1
201501	2681	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Let me end on what, for me, is a discomfiting thought.	13	1
201501	2682	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m finding it difficult to reconcile the data on growth in employment with the data on wages and prices.	13	1
201501	2683	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	To say this differently, I see a puzzling and confusing disconnect between the strong real economy performance represented by top-line GDP growth and labor market data, on the one hand, and wage and price trends on the other.	13	1
201501	2684	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I don’t think we can entirely rule out the possibility that an unusual and persistent state of the world is developing.	13	1
201501	2685	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	This is a legitimate question.	13	1
201501	2686	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	It’s not going to be resolved in any serious way by the next meeting.	13	1
201501	2687	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2688	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201501	2689	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	13	1
201501	2690	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2691	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	The Third District economy continues to grow modestly and is improving in all three of our states, and our coincident indexes are showing growth in line with the nation.	13	1
201501	2692	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Notable progress is occurring in the areas of commercial construction, and the value of contracts is now stronger than any time since 2001.	13	1
201501	2693	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Job growth has been rather robust, with the overall District unemployment rate falling by 0.7 percentage point over the three months ending in December to 5.4 percent.	13	1
201501	2694	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate is now down to 4.8 percent, and initial claims in the region are at their lowest level since 2001.	13	1
201501	2695	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Bank lending on C&I loans was particularly robust in December, increasing 22 percent, and is up 10 percent year over year.	13	1
201501	2696	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Credit card usage was also higher in December than a year ago, reflecting a holiday season that was better than last year’s.	13	1
201501	2697	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Our manufacturing sector, however, seems to have experienced some loss of momentum similar to that experienced in the nation as a whole.	13	1
201501	2698	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Because of some abnormal seasonal behavior, it’s probably best to average through December and January’s general activity indexes.	13	1
201501	2699	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	That average yields a value of 15.3, a number that’s consistent with continued moderate growth, but is off the peaks we saw earlier in the fall.	13	1
201501	2700	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Also, the unemployment index nudged into negative territory in the most recent survey.	13	1
201501	2701	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	However, the respondents still appear optimistic.	13	1
201501	2702	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	The future activity index came in at 50.9, and the future employment index remains at a high level.	13	1
201501	2703	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Thus, it appears that our manufacturers are regarding the current lull as largely transitory.	13	1
201501	2704	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	The pace of activity in our nonmanufacturing business index also witnessed a noticeable decline, and our housing sector continues to be weak with little signs of strong renewal.	13	1
201501	2705	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	However, I think we have to recall that in the second and third quarters of this past year, we witnessed real GDP growth of 4.6 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively.	13	1
201501	2706	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	It should not be surprising that the fourth quarter has not kept up such a torrid pace.	13	1
201501	2707	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	That’s consistent with the weakening numbers, and it suggests growth, but at a somewhat slower pace.	13	1
201501	2708	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Even with the softer fourth quarter, we are likely to observe the last three quarters of 2014 as showing above 4 percent GDP growth.	13	1
201501	2709	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Regarding the national outlook, I’m still fairly confident that the economy will grow above trend in 2014 at about 3 percent.	13	1
201501	2710	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	A good deal of my optimism revolves around continued increasing strength in the labor market that’s reflected in almost all of the labor market data we have seen.	13	1
201501	2711	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	The strength in the labor markets, along with improved household access to credit and falling prices at the pump, imply that consumer spending will support somewhat above-trend growth.	13	1
201501	2712	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	There are, of course, some risks.	13	1
201501	2713	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	The likely suspects are weakening conditions in Europe and China and the effects of a stronger dollar.	13	1
201501	2714	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Yet overall lower oil prices are also a positive for Japan, China, India, and Europe.	13	1
201501	2715	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	And while the stronger dollar may weaken exports, the overall magnitude of such trade channel effects within the US economy remains modest.	13	1
201501	2716	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	While headline inflation, as expected, has been pushed down by falling oil prices, we should look through such relative price movements in this regard as we’ve done in the past.	13	1
201501	2717	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m comforted by the fact that alternative metrics of underlying inflation, which have already been mentioned—such as medians, trimmed means, and other statistics—have remained remarkably stable over this period.	13	1
201501	2718	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	That should be encouraging to us about what the future may hold.	13	1
201501	2719	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	And as has been pointed out by President Lacker, the decline in oil prices may be near the low point for this cycle and, therefore, inflation should begin to strengthen and perhaps may strengthen much faster than the Tealbook anticipates.	13	1
201501	2720	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2721	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201501	2722	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	13	1
201501	2723	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2724	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Business conditions in the Fourth District are little changed since our December meeting, with contacts reporting continued moderate expansion.	13	1
201501	2725	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Nearly half of our Beige Book contacts reported an improvement in business conditions over the past six to eight weeks, but some firms have been negatively affected by the decline in oil prices.	13	1
201501	2726	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Some firms expect reductions in energy investment plans to come later this year, although there hasn’t been much change yet.	13	1
201501	2727	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	The four large banking organizations in the District have some exposure to the oil and gas extraction industry, but it is relatively modest.	13	1
201501	2728	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	On the plus side, many contacts noted benefits of a strong decline in oil prices on input costs.	13	1
201501	2729	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Retailers and manufacturers in the motor vehicle industry are optimistic.	13	1
201501	2730	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Some auto parts suppliers now report that they are considering investment in new production lines as auto demand continues to increase.	13	1
201501	2731	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	In fact, across Beige Book contacts in all sectors, capital expenditure plans continue to rise.	13	1
201501	2732	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Conditions in District labor markets continue to improve.	13	1
201501	2733	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Employment growth picked up last year, and the District unemployment rate is nearing 5 percent.	13	1
201501	2734	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	So far, wage pressures remain limited to occupations where there have been labor shortages for some time, such as trucking.	13	1
201501	2735	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	In general, prices for finished goods remain stable, but a slightly higher percentage of contacts reported higher prices compared with a month ago.	13	1
201501	2736	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	My view of the national economy has changed little since our previous meeting.	13	1
201501	2737	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	The incoming data on output and employment indicate underlying momentum is increasing despite a weakening export sector.	13	1
201501	2738	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Employment gains accelerated in the fourth quarter.	13	1
201501	2739	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Measures of unemployment and underemployment continue to decline.	13	1
201501	2740	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Economic fundamentals have improved.	13	1
201501	2741	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Headwinds, such as the needed deleveraging of household and business balance sheets and the recapitalization of banks, may have damped the effect of highly accommodative monetary policy on the economy earlier in the expansion, but these headwinds have substantially dissipated.	13	1
201501	2742	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	The January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey shows that credit standards are easing and credit demand is rising.	13	1
201501	2743	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	At the same time, we have a tailwind in the form of lower oil prices, which will support faster household and business spending even as it leads to some retrenchment and dislocation in parts of the domestic energy sector.	13	1
201501	2744	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	For the US economy, the decline in oil prices will be a net positive and offset the negative effect of dollar appreciation on our exports.	13	1
201501	2745	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	My modal forecast continues to be for output to grow about 3 percent, which is somewhat above trend, over the next two years.	13	1
201501	2746	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	While the weaker foreign economic outlook is a downside risk, European policy action is welcome.	13	1
201501	2747	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I see stronger economic growth as a result of the oil price decline as an upside risk to my forecast.	13	1
201501	2748	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I expect continued improvement in labor markets.	13	1
201501	2749	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	As economic growth and employment continue to expand, I expect some acceleration in wages.	13	1
201501	2750	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	This is consistent with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s staff research that finds that while there hasn’t been a stable Phillips curve relationship between unemployment gaps and price inflation since the 1980s, there does seem to be a more stable Phillips curve relationship linking unemployment gaps and nominal wage growth.	13	1
201501	2751	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	If the unemployment rate falls more sharply than I currently anticipate and wage growth remains modest, perhaps I’ll need to rethink my estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate, which I have at 5½ percent.	13	1
201501	2752	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	But for now that seems premature, and in light of the very large error bands around point forecasts of the natural unemployment rate, I don’t feel compelled to make a change at this point.	13	1
201501	2753	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	The sharp drop in oil prices is showing up in much lower headline inflation numbers.	13	1
201501	2754	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	The appreciation of the dollar is showing up in lower input prices.	13	1
201501	2755	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	So far, there has been only modest pass-through to core measures.	13	1
201501	2756	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s median CPI inflation measure has remained near 2¼ percent since April of last year.	13	1
201501	2757	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I note that research by my staff finds that the Cleveland measure appears to have some predictive power for headline inflation over the medium term.	13	1
201501	2758	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	My expectation is that inflation will gradually move back up to 2 percent as economic activity continues to strengthen and oil prices stabilize.	13	1
201501	2759	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	This assumes longer-run inflation expectations remain anchored.	13	1
201501	2760	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Based on the survey measures, inflation expectations have been stable.	13	1
201501	2761	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s 10-year expected inflation rate did slip from 1.85 percent in December to 1.66 percent in January.	13	1
201501	2762	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Despite this slippage, this reading is essentially in the middle of the range of readings we have seen since the financial crisis.	13	1
201501	2763	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	The market-based measures of inflation compensation have continued to decline.	13	1
201501	2764	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	The chart on page 26 of the Tealbook Data Sheets gives a longer history of inflation compensation measures, which helps put things into perspective.	13	1
201501	2765	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Now, it’s difficult to ascertain how much of the decline reflects liquidity effects and inflation risk premiums rather than a change in inflation expectations, especially in times of increased market volatility and flight-to-quality flows into US markets.	13	1
201501	2766	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	But as the Tealbook notes, models that sort through these measures suggest that inflation expectations have remained largely stable, and the recent MarketSource analysis suggests that the sharp drop in oil prices may also be having a larger-than-expected effect on breakeven inflation rates.	13	1
201501	2767	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	So at this point, I don’t view the decline in measures of inflation compensation as indicating an unanchoring of longer-term inflation expectation.	13	1
201501	2768	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	That said, these inflation developments bear close monitoring.	13	1
201501	2769	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I see quite a bit of difference between the situation in Europe, where inflation is falling and economic growth is very weak, and the situation in the United States, where an oil price shock is driving down measures of headline inflation and economic growth is increasing.	13	1
201501	2770	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	As long as inflation expectations remain anchored and economic growth continues to be at or above trend, I’m comfortable with it taking a while for inflation to return to our target.	13	1
201501	2771	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I’m much less comfortable with the outcomes in the Tealbook forecast, which has us undershooting the staff’s estimated natural rate of unemployment for at least the next five years with only a gradual pickup in inflation.	13	1
201501	2772	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I think there’s considerable risk in trying to engineer such a feat.	13	1
201501	2773	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2774	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201501	2775	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13	1
201501	2776	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2777	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I continue to interpret data on the US economy as well as anecdotal reports from contacts in the Eighth District as consistent with above-trend growth in output and robust improvement in labor markets.	13	1
201501	2778	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I continue to view the Eighth District as lagging slightly the nation as a whole, in terms of economic growth.	13	1
201501	2779	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	The District unemployment rate has fallen to 5.9 percent, the first reading below 6 percent since 2008, and just 0.3 percentage point higher than the national level of 5.6 percent.	13	1
201501	2780	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Many District contacts reported robust sales during the holiday season, driven in part by improved consumer confidence and lower gasoline prices.	13	1
201501	2781	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	District firms that have an international presence generally indicated that the US portion of their businesses remained robust, while reports on the international portion were mixed.	13	1
201501	2782	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	My view on the national economy has not changed.	13	1
201501	2783	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I continue to expect that GDP growth will exceed 3 percent for all of 2015 and that job gains and unemployment declines will build on the banner year we had in 2014.	13	1
201501	2784	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I now project that the unemployment rate will fall below 5 percent in the third quarter of 2015.	13	1
201501	2785	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I note that the Committee has generally tended to be too pessimistic with regard to labor market improvements over the past two years.	13	1
201501	2786	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	In a recent speech titled “Ghosts and Forecasts,”	13	1
201501	2787	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I evaluated Committee forecasts in recent years.	13	1
201501	2788	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	This evaluation covered projections made in June for the entire subsequent January to December period—so, for instance, June 2013 for January to December 2014—this is all bad news, by the way.	13	1
201501	2789	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee’s entire forecast range often does not encompass the actual outcome.	13	1
201501	2790	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	So while you may think there’s a lot of disagreement on the Committee, there’s evidently not enough disagreement.	13	1
201501	2791	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee’s central tendency is rarely wide enough to capture the actual outcome.	13	1
201501	2792	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	In each of the past two years, the Committee has missed in the same way.	13	1
201501	2793	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Forecasts of economic growth are relatively accurate, at least if you average over the two years.	13	1
201501	2794	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Unemployment rate forecasts are too high.	13	1
201501	2795	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee forecast higher unemployment than what actually occurred, and inflation forecasts were also too high.	13	1
201501	2796	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee tended to forecast higher inflation than what actually occurred.	13	1
201501	2797	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	The pleasantly surprising readings on labor market outcomes during the past two years would, under conventional monetary policy logic, be thought to have moved the Committee toward a more aggressive path regarding the policy rate normalization.	13	1
201501	2798	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	However, a look at the data for June 2012 versus today suggests that this is not so.	13	1
201501	2799	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Today’s market expectation of the policy rate path is everywhere below the market expectation as of June 2012.	13	1
201501	2800	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	In other words, labor markets packed a powerful positive surprise over the past two years and yet actual policy expectations have moved in a dovish direction.	13	1
201501	2801	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	In my mind, this raises serious questions about the nature of the Committee’s reaction function to incoming data.	13	1
201501	2802	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Of course, the inflation forecast was also inaccurate, but in my view, the extent of that surprise was insufficiently large to rationalize the move toward a more dovish stance in the face of substantial labor market improvement.	13	1
201501	2803	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	It may help us to be clearer in our own discussions, as well as with those outside the Committee, why policy has evolved as it has over the past two years.	13	1
201501	2804	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	One of the biggest surprises of 2014 was the global market bond rally.	13	1
201501	2805	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	My preferred interpretation is that the rally was driven to a large extent by the specter of ECB quantitative easing.	13	1
201501	2806	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	One year ago, it was still considered unlikely that the ECB would ever adopt unconventional monetary policy action on the same basis as the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom.	13	1
201501	2807	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	However, continued declines in euro-area inflation and inflation expectations raised the probability of major ECB action throughout the year, culminating in last week’s landmark decision by the Governing Council.	13	1
201501	2808	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	While QE is certainly not a panacea, I do think it is generally welcome news for the euro-area economy.	13	1
201501	2809	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	As a byproduct of this process, US longer-term yields generally declined all during 2014.	13	1
201501	2810	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	This is a bullish factor for US growth prospects in 2015.	13	1
201501	2811	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Coupled with the substantial decline in oil prices, I see two powerful tailwinds for the United States as we enter 2015 on the top of considerable momentum in the last three quarters of 2014.	13	1
201501	2812	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	One aspect of ECB QE bears watching.	13	1
201501	2813	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	For the US experience with QE2, in particular, many of the effects were anticipated by financial markets ahead of actual asset purchases.	13	1
201501	2814	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	During the autumn of 2010 in the United States, for example, real yields declined, equity prices rose, inflation expectations increased, and the dollar weakened.	13	1
201501	2815	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	However, once purchases actually began in November of that year, these effects were much less obvious.	13	1
201501	2816	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Something similar could occur with regard to ECB quantitative easing.	13	1
201501	2817	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	If so, any further bond rally on a global basis or currency effects may be much more muted in the period ahead than it has been during 2014.	13	1
201501	2818	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2819	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201501	2820	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13	1
201501	2821	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2822	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	For the most part, my directors and other business “interlocutors”—	13	1
201501	2823	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I’m going to miss being able to say that with a chuckle [laughter]— indicated a similar outlook as at the time of our December meeting.	13	1
201501	2824	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Most reports continue to be positive about both current activity and the prospects for economic growth going forward.	13	1
201501	2825	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Automakers, for example, enjoyed strong end-of-year sales.	13	1
201501	2826	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	For 2015, Ford told us that its official forecast is for sales to continue near last year’s second-half pace of 16¾ million, but it sees some upside to this number.	13	1
201501	2827	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Of course, there are some sector-specific challenges.	13	1
201501	2828	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Orders have dropped for construction equipment used in preparing fracking sites and for steel used in drilling wells.	13	1
201501	2829	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Farm machinery sales and orders also are down considerably, because of lower crop prices.	13	1
201501	2830	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Our new Chicago director, who is the CEO of Discover Financial Services, said that lower gas prices are not yet showing through to higher retail sales to the extent that Discover had expected.	13	1
201501	2831	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	My own outlook for the real economy continues to project real GDP growth averaging about 3 percent over the next two years.	13	1
201501	2832	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	That should be enough to bring the unemployment rate down to around 5 percent by the end of 2016.	13	1
201501	2833	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I must point out that my forecast is based on an assessment of appropriate monetary policy that is not very different from current market expectations regarding the federal funds rate; that is, it is lower than the Tealbook projection, and lower than the assessments of most people around the table.	13	1
201501	2834	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Regarding my projection of a 5 percent unemployment rate in 2016, my staff has done a good deal of research on changes in labor force participation and its composition that suggests the natural rate of unemployment could easily be as low as 5 percent.	13	1
201501	2835	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	The current anemic wage growth and low inflation pressures reinforce this inference.	13	1
201501	2836	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	It seems evident to me that labor slack, as many have said, is notably larger than many infer simply from the unemployment rate being 5.6 percent.	13	1
201501	2837	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	So I don’t see my unemployment rate forecast as undershooting the natural rate over the projection period as much as the Tealbook does.	13	1
201501	2838	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	With regard more directly to pricing pressures, inflation developments since December have not been supportive of the assessment that inflation is headed back to 2 percent within an acceptable period of time.	13	1
201501	2839	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	My last SEP submission had inflation only slowly crawling back up to 2 percent sometime in 2018, and my inclination today would be to nudge that path down just a touch further.	13	1
201501	2840	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Recent data on core inflation have been soft, and there is a good chance they are going to soften even further, because of the appreciation of the dollar and the prospect of some pass-through from energy prices.	13	1
201501	2841	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, all else being equal—that’s a strong statement—the dollar’s appreciation delivers an extra degree of financial restrictiveness that acts as if monetary policy has already tightened a bit.	13	1
201501	2842	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	And as I already mentioned, nominal wage growth is far below where it should be if we were hitting our inflation target.	13	1
201501	2843	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I find recent financial market signals to be especially worrisome.	13	1
201501	2844	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	And let me take this opportunity to thank the staff for putting together a very nice collection of memos on how the projections of financial market variables are put together in the Tealbook and the other analyses that they have done, in addition to all of the special memos about the policy tools and liftoff.	13	1
201501	2845	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	It’s a lot for all of us to go through, but it’s really valuable information, and I appreciate it.	13	1
201501	2846	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Now, on financial markets, the Board’s measure of TIPS five-year, five-year-forward breakeven rates has declined to 1.8 percent.	13	1
201501	2847	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	And this is on a CPI basis, so on a PCE basis, it is more like 1.5 percent.	13	1
201501	2848	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	And this is for inflation 6 to 10 years ahead, so it’s not good news for a longer-run period beyond the medium term.	13	1
201501	2849	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I agree strongly with President Kocherlakota’s decidedly mainstream analysis in terms of risk-neutral pricing.	13	1
201501	2850	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I was on a panel three weeks ago at the Becker Friedman Institute, and it was a conversation in which Nobel Prize winner Lars Hansen was asking me questions.	13	1
201501	2851	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	He went out of his way to pick up on Narayana’s comments on risk-neutral pricing, and it was very interesting.	13	1
201501	2852	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Either inflation expectations have dropped much lower or investors are viewing low inflation as being associated with dramatically more costly economic outcomes.	13	1
201501	2853	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Either way, these data are flashing red.	13	1
201501	2854	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Our recent FOMC statements seem to downweight these observations, and President Lacker was suggesting just a few minutes ago that we should weight them even lower in the statement.	13	1
201501	2855	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Why should we ignore these signals?	13	1
201501	2856	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I have several comments on this.	13	1
201501	2857	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Let me start with a benign alternative, which I have to say I don’t particularly find compelling—namely, that these movements in breakeven rates could be just noise that we can safely ignore.	13	1
201501	2858	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	As I understand the Board model—and one of the contributors to it is now a staff member at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago—the liquidity premium between nominal and indexed Treasuries is a key part of the decline in breakevens.	13	1
201501	2859	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	But liquidity is just a convenient label for a latent variable in this analysis.	13	1
201501	2860	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	It sounds relatively benign with that type of label, but it could include other unknown or unmodeled factors.	13	1
201501	2861	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	And, in fact, looking at the way the Board staff described it, they used the term “term premiums,” which, as I understand it, also includes liquidity premiums.	13	1
201501	2862	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Few models actually attempt to identify liquidity effects from changes in bid–ask spreads, market transaction data, or the like.	13	1
201501	2863	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	One model that does is the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s term structure model, and it attributes very little of the recent declines in breakevens to its liquidity adjustment factor.	13	1
201501	2864	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	So there is a good chance that what the Board model and some other models benignly label as liquidity or other premiums are really something that could be a cause for concern.	13	1
201501	2865	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Whatever its interpretation, the time-series properties of these estimated liquidity premiums suggest the effects on breakevens should be relatively transitory.	13	1
201501	2866	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	That is, the underlying assumption that is used to estimate these finds that they ought to be relatively transitory, and this is something that we can monitor.	13	1
201501	2867	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	It’s a positive, not a normative, statement.	13	1
201501	2868	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	So if we don’t see breakevens mean reverting over the next few meetings, we should rethink the role of such temporary factors and the weight we put on this benign interpretation of the decline in breakevens.	13	1
201501	2869	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	And, furthermore, there is a more problematic interpretation of these so-called liquidity premium developments, and one that could be persistent, namely that they could reflect a more persistent increased preference for safe assets.	13	1
201501	2870	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	This would be consistent with President Kocherlakota’s worrisome analysis, as I interpret it.	13	1
201501	2871	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I think these are reasons not to downplay this data, but to understand them much more than we do.	13	1
201501	2872	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Another not-so-benign possibility is that market inflation expectations actually are too low, and, indeed, some affine term structure models do project low inflation.	13	1
201501	2873	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Term structure models require a number of assumptions to identify the pricing kernels.	13	1
201501	2874	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Alternative implementations can give, and do give, different answers.	13	1
201501	2875	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	As I already mentioned, the Board analysis seems to be consistent with stable inflation expectations.	13	1
201501	2876	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Another approach is the term structure model developed by Luca Benzoni at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.	13	1
201501	2877	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	This analysis doesn’t make reference to the TIPS data at all.	13	1
201501	2878	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	It uses other assumptions and modeling to examine the same issues.	13	1
201501	2879	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	To assess inflation pressures more directly, this analysis relies more on the breakdown of inflation among food, energy, and core inflation to better capture the dynamic relationships between interest rates and inflation.	13	1
201501	2880	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	These model forecasts for five-year, five-year-forward inflation also have come down about 20 basis points over the past year.	13	1
201501	2881	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	More important, the model is projecting very low inflation for quite some time.	13	1
201501	2882	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	The three-year-ahead average PCE inflation forecast for December 2017 is 1.62 percent.	13	1
201501	2883	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	This is average inflation from December 2017 to December 2019.	13	1
201501	2884	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	That’s too low.	13	1
201501	2885	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Our Chicago model also does not use surveys of longer-run inflation expectations in order to assess stability of inflation expectations.	13	1
201501	2886	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	In contrast, some analyses appeal to the stability of survey measures of inflation at longer horizons to achieve reasonably stable longer- run inflation projections.	13	1
201501	2887	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I worry that survey measures of longer-horizon inflation expectations are like looking at a stopped clock.	13	1
201501	2888	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Longer-run measures don’t move much, and I’m skeptical as to whether survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations move meaningfully at times of great risk, and that’s something that President Rosengren was mentioning with regard to Japan.	13	1
201501	2889	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Or is it the case that the survey respondents see a looming risk, but they are confident that we, the FOMC, will act appropriately?	13	1
201501	2890	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Do we even agree among ourselves on what these appropriate actions should be?	13	1
201501	2891	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	The divergence between market and survey measures gives me great concern.	13	1
201501	2892	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Now, putting all of these models aside, no matter how you view the breakevens, we still need to grapple with the signal content simply coming from the very low level of the 10-year Treasury rate.	13	1
201501	2893	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	If real rates are low, then markets are expecting poorer economic outcomes over a longer term than our SEP paths likely embody.	13	1
201501	2894	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	If inflation expectations are low, then we likely have inadequate accommodation in place, and our SEP numbers are too optimistic on that score.	13	1
201501	2895	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	If it’s noise, well, okay, no worries, and I guess we can go ahead with planning policy normalization sooner rather than later.	13	1
201501	2896	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	But in my book, this adds up to only one out of three possibilities being acceptable.	13	1
201501	2897	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	And I just don’t like those odds.	13	1
201501	2898	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	To conclude, I think we’re most likely finally on a path to achieving the employment part of our mandate in a reasonable amount of time, but my outlook for inflation is nowhere near satisfactory.	13	1
201501	2899	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	From a risk-management standpoint, I just can’t see the argument for hurrying.	13	1
201501	2900	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2901	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201501	2902	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13	1
201501	2903	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2904	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	The 10th District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.	13	1
201501	2905	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	The effects of the decline in oil prices have, on net, been favorable, with nearly 50 percent of firms in our manufacturing and services surveys reporting a positive effect on their business, while around 20 percent report a negative effect.	13	1
201501	2906	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Of course, District states that are most dependent on energy production—Wyoming, Oklahoma, and New Mexico— face a somewhat less favorable outlook.	13	1
201501	2907	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Oil rig counts have started to decline rapidly, and capital spending is expected to be down considerably in 2015.	13	1
201501	2908	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Based on our quarterly energy survey, nearly half of respondents expect more than a 20 percent reduction in capital spending this year.	13	1
201501	2909	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Significant layoffs are already being announced at some District energy firms, and more are expected.	13	1
201501	2910	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Analysis of hedging and debt positions shows that firms headquartered in the 10th District, which account for about one- third of all large independents, are comparable to other US shale oil firms but with sizable differences across those firms.	13	1
201501	2911	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	In general, the smaller firms are more highly leveraged, but also better hedged, than the large firms.	13	1
201501	2912	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Although most states now rely considerably less on the oil and gas extraction sector than 30 years ago, it is possible that energy-dependent states like Oklahoma could experience double-digit percentage declines in energy sector jobs, and perhaps slight declines in overall employment.	13	1
201501	2913	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	For the nation as a whole, my outlook for economic activity is little changed from the previous meeting.	13	1
201501	2914	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Weaker foreign economic growth and a stronger dollar may weigh on GDP, but lower energy prices, on net, should provide a boost.	13	1
201501	2915	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	As a result, I continue to anticipate moderate growth of around 3 percent this year.	13	1
201501	2916	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Consumer spending was strong in the second half of last year, and consumers’ assessments of current economic and labor market conditions have brightened.	13	1
201501	2917	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	I expect low oil prices and further labor market improvements to provide ongoing support to household spending.	13	1
201501	2918	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	The labor market has maintained its momentum, and my outlook for further improvement is optimistic based on the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s labor market conditions indicators, which showed that the level of activity improved again in December, and its momentum rose to its highest level over the past two decades.	13	1
201501	2919	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Of particular note, among the 24 labor market variables that are used to construct this index, the five strongest contributors to improvement over the past six months are predominantly leading indicators—a rise in the quits rate, a decline in those working part time for economic reasons, improved job flows from unemployment to employment, an increase in the percent of firms planning to increase employment, and a shift downward in the Blue Chip unemployment rate forecast.	13	1
201501	2920	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	In an environment of above-trend economic growth and falling unemployment, of course, inflation remains low.	13	1
201501	2921	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Clearly, lower oil prices and the stronger dollar will exert some downward pressure in the near term, but these are relative-price movements that should prove temporary and not affect the longer-term inflation outlook.	13	1
201501	2922	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	For this reason, the recent decline in market-based measures looks puzzling, as others have discussed, and I agree that this is a development that we will need to watch.	13	1
201501	2923	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	While inflation is running below our stated quantitative objective, it is less clear to me at this point that the goal of price stability over the longer run is at risk.	13	1
201501	2924	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Furthermore, I do not think we can judge the cost of low inflation in isolation from other economic developments.	13	1
201501	2925	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Inflation below target in an environment of above-trend economic growth and falling unemployment seems less of a concern to me than low inflation combined with slowing economic growth and rising unemployment.	13	1
201501	2926	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	As oil prices and the dollar stabilize, my forecast implies that inflation will move upward, and spare capacity and tightening of labor markets will gradually lift inflation back toward target.	13	1
201501	2927	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	So unless signs emerge that the economy’s performance is faltering, I see no need to delay normalization for the purpose of accelerating a return to 2 percent.	13	1
201501	2928	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2929	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201501	2930	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13	1
201501	2931	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2932	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	My views on the economy haven’t changed much since the previous FOMC meeting.	13	1
201501	2933	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I view the incoming data as consistent with an economy that continues to grow at an above-trend pace, marked by rising household and business confidence.	13	1
201501	2934	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	While it’s true there have been some data points that have raised some questions—for example, for December, we had a weak retail sales report and a decline in average hourly earnings—I view these as likely to be anomalies that will be reversed in the coming months.	13	1
201501	2935	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	One question I have been wondering about is the timing of the effect of the decline on oil prices on US economic activity.	13	1
201501	2936	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	We have the positive benefit of lower oil prices boosting real income, and this factor appears to be supporting consumer spending.	13	1
201501	2937	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	But, against this, we have the prospect for a significant decline in oil and gas investment.	13	1
201501	2938	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Although I agree with the conclusion that the net effect is a positive, I wonder about the timing in which these effects fall.	13	1
201501	2939	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Does the boost in consumer spending happen first, followed by the drop in investment, or not?	13	1
201501	2940	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think understanding the likely timing here will help us better assess the trajectory of economic growth.	13	1
201501	2941	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If it is consumption first as a positive, and investment later as a negative, which would be my own expectation in terms of relative timing, that suggests that there is a risk that the momentum to economic growth fades as we get deeper into the year.	13	1
201501	2942	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I raise this issue as it might be relevant to thinking about the appropriate timing of monetary policy liftoff.	13	1
201501	2943	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Another key issue for me is the trend in wages and labor compensation.	13	1
201501	2944	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If growth of nominal wages and labor compensation stays steady or firms in the face of declining headline inflation, then this implies more real income growth, all else being equal.	13	1
201501	2945	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	And it also implies that the lower headline inflation rate or the drop in market-based measures of inflation compensation are not having strong depressing effects on the wage-setting process.	13	1
201501	2946	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of labor compensation, some of the survey measures I have seen recently imply strengthening rather than weakening.	13	1
201501	2947	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s consumer expectations survey indicates a generally firming trend for one year ahead in terms of household income growth expectations.	13	1
201501	2948	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	And in the same vein, the most recent National Federation of Independent Business survey showed a firming compensation trend, with a net 25 percent of firms reporting paying higher compensation—that’s an increase of 4 points from their prior monthly survey— and a net 17 percent planning to raise compensation in coming months.	13	1
201501	2949	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s up 2 points over the prior survey.	13	1
201501	2950	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The second issue that I’m focused on is the level of full employment.	13	1
201501	2951	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	In the last SEP round, I lowered my estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate to 5 percent.	13	1
201501	2952	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there is some risk that this estimate is still too high.	13	1
201501	2953	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	There are several reasons why my estimate is coming down.	13	1
201501	2954	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	First, demographic trends in the workforce are consistent with a lower longer-run unemployment rate.	13	1
201501	2955	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The composition of the workforce is getting older, and this should be pushing down the longer-run unemployment rate because older age cohorts typically have lower unemployment rates.	13	1
201501	2956	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I asked my staff to isolate how much lower the current full-employment unemployment rate would be, compared with its value in earlier periods, if the only thing that had changed was the age composition of the labor force.	13	1
201501	2957	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If we go all the way back to 1980, the net effect of the changing age composition of the labor force is worth nearly a full percentage point in the longer-run unemployment rate.	13	1
201501	2958	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Nearer at hand, comparing the situation with 2004, which was when in that cycle the unemployment rate first reached 5.6 percent, the same level as it is now, the shift is worth about 0.2 percentage point.	13	1
201501	2959	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, the national full-employment unemployment rate depends on what is happening in the labor markets in different regions.	13	1
201501	2960	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If there’s a lot of dispersion in labor markets, some very tight and others very loose, then this should lead to a higher national full-employment unemployment rate, all else being equal.	13	1
201501	2961	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	With the drop in oil prices likely to hurt disproportionately those states that have higher labor demand and lower unemployment rates, I would expect the dispersion of labor market conditions across the country should lessen, and this should directionally lower the longer-run unemployment rate a bit.	13	1
201501	2962	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	We tried to estimate how much this might be worth, and it turns out this effect is likely to be quite small—no more than 0.1 percentage point.	13	1
201501	2963	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Third, as we all know, the unemployment rate is not a sufficient statistic of labor market slack.	13	1
201501	2964	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	To the extent that the current unemployment rate understates the degree of slack in the labor market, it also understates the degree of slack relative to the full-employment unemployment rate.	13	1
201501	2965	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this is very much the case today.	13	1
201501	2966	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	To assess this effect, one can measure the degree to which there is underutilization of the labor force—for example, part-time workers who want to work full time—relative to the unemployment rate.	13	1
201501	2967	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	In this cycle, the unemployment rate is unusually low compared with the amount of slack measured by those who want to work more hours.	13	1
201501	2968	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If we normalize the underutilization of hours in relation to past cycles, this would imply an unemployment rate of about 6.1 percent currently, so that’s a gap of 0.5 percentage point.	13	1
201501	2969	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The final factor that might be relevant is the fact that labor compensation and inflation trends are unusually low at the current unemployment rate.	13	1
201501	2970	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Real total compensation based on the core PCE inflation rate and the employment cost index is only running at about an annual rate of ½ percent.	13	1
201501	2971	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, I’m not sure what this precisely means in terms of how much slack we have and what that means for the full-employment unemployment rate, but when the labor compensation trends are this low, it would seem to allow us the ability to be somewhat more patient.	13	1
201501	2972	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	A third issue that I’ve been thinking a lot about is the outlook for foreign economic growth and the dollar.	13	1
201501	2973	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Here I have a mixed view.	13	1
201501	2974	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	On the one hand, and I think this is consistent with Steve Kamin’s briefing, the pessimism about the outlook for growth abroad looks a bit overdone, especially with respect to Europe and Japan.	13	1
201501	2975	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	When I look at both Europe and Japan, while I see plenty of problems, I also see a number of positives, including lower oil prices, weaker currencies, more expansive monetary policies, and less fiscal drag.	13	1
201501	2976	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The ECB’s QE initiative has gotten good reviews so far.	13	1
201501	2977	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	And most noteworthy to me was Mario Draghi’s comment that the program will continue until the ECB expects its inflation objectives to be achieved.	13	1
201501	2978	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The fact that it’s open ended is, I think, very, very important.	13	1
201501	2979	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	On the other hand, I am worried that the dollar’s strength will not just persist but intensify.	13	1
201501	2980	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	QE in both Japan and Europe certainly would seem to push in this direction.	13	1
201501	2981	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I understand the reasons for the Tealbook’s forecast for the dollar.	13	1
201501	2982	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If it was obvious that the dollar would continue to appreciate, then it would already have happened.	13	1
201501	2983	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Nevertheless, I view the risk of a much stronger dollar as the biggest risk to my forecast of above-trend economic growth and rising inflation.	13	1
201501	2984	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	So that’s the biggest risk to what forms the foundation of my expectations that we can safely lift off with respect to monetary policy later this year.	13	1
201501	2985	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	A firmer dollar is something I am definitely concerned about as a risk to our forecast.	13	1
201501	2986	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2987	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201501	2988	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13	1
201501	2989	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	2990	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I’ll be saying a lot of what has been said before, but I guess we’re taking a consensus.	13	1
201501	2991	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	It won’t be entirely in the consensus, though.	13	1
201501	2992	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	What has been happening to activity is very impressive.	13	1
201501	2993	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Economic growth forecasts of most people around the table are around 3 percent.	13	1
201501	2994	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	The Tealbook has 2.8 percent, essentially, for 2015 and 2016.	13	1
201501	2995	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	And, of course, the unemployment rate is now very close to our estimates of the natural rate.	13	1
201501	2996	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We have consumer sentiment doing very well.	13	1
201501	2997	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We have low oil prices, which almost everyone sees as positive for the economy.	13	1
201501	2998	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	This, includes President Fisher, who sees the negative side of low oil prices as well, but he came out in favor of a net positive effect.	13	1
201501	2999	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	It will have an effect on investment, but housing is beginning to show some signs of growth—it’s nice having a sector that you expected to grow and doesn’t grow, because you know one day it will grow, and then it will contribute to economic growth.	13	1
201501	3000	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I want to say a word about our estimates of the natural rate of unemployment.	13	1
201501	3001	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I’m going to say something I’ve said here before, and I apologize, but I think it happens to be true, so I’ll keep saying it.	13	1
201501	3002	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	If you look at what economists say the natural rate of unemployment is and run a regression on it—and when I say “economists,”	13	1
201501	3003	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I’m usually talking about Bob Gordon, who at some stage used to produce an estimate of the natural rate of unemployment with sufficient frequency that you could run regressions on it—what you find is that the stated natural rate is 4.5 percent plus half the gap between the actual unemployment rate and 4.5 percent.	13	1
201501	3004	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	So poor Vice Chairman Dudley worked very hard to come to roughly—[laughter]—that estimate.	13	1
201501	3005	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Could have saved a lot of work.	13	1
201501	3006	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	13	1
201501	3007	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	There is a tendency to reduce our estimate of the natural rate as the unemployment rate comes down, but at some point that stops.	13	1
201501	3008	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	It will be at 4.5 percent, 4.8 percent maybe.	13	1
201501	3009	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Bill is right that it’s now about 5 percent.	13	1
201501	3010	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I want to talk next about foreign activity and how to think about that.	13	1
201501	3011	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	China has slowed down.	13	1
201501	3012	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	That has a much bigger effect on the world than you might have guessed.	13	1
201501	3013	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	It’s affecting Australia, it’s affecting Latin America, and if you go down the list of countries that produce metals and other commodities—Brazil, Chile, and all the others—you’ll find they’re all being hit by the slowdown in China.	13	1
201501	3014	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Now, you know, it is a slowdown from 10 percent to 7 percent, and it seems funny to call it a slowdown, but that’s what it is.	13	1
201501	3015	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We’ve also got to worry about Greece because we’re certainly going to get a lot of alarm bells ringing about Greece, even if the likelihood is that it turns out to stay in Europe.	13	1
201501	3016	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We’ve got Ukraine, and that one is really a potentially huge mess, and we’ve got a war in the Middle East, which is getting very ugly.	13	1
201501	3017	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	But we do now have the ECB having undertaken this very brave and very difficult set of measures, which Mario Draghi managed to get through his executive board.	13	1
201501	3018	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	And we’ve also got the Japanese trying to restore their economic growth.	13	1
201501	3019	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	If you ask what is happening in our capital markets, I think it’s that interest rates are very low everywhere else, and people don’t know about covered interest arbitrage or they don’t believe in it, one or the other.	13	1
201501	3020	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	So they’re coming here, because exchange rates apparently never change in their minds.	13	1
201501	3021	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	And that’s, I think, an element that is driving our rates down.	13	1
201501	3022	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	The major problem for us is the appreciation.	13	1
201501	3023	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	As we saw in the Tealbook, its effects about two years out outweigh the effects of the benefit from oil, assuming the exchange rate stays roughly where it is now and oil prices stay roughly where they are.	13	1
201501	3024	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	They probably won’t.	13	1
201501	3025	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	They’ll probably go up some.	13	1
201501	3026	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	So now, having talked about lower interest rates, we need to go to inflation.	13	1
201501	3027	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Well, what are we looking at?	13	1
201501	3028	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	According to the Tealbook, core inflation was 1 percent last quarter and will be 1.8 percent in the second half of 2015.	13	1
201501	3029	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	They have it at 1.7 percent at the end of 2016 and 1.9 percent at the end of 2017.	13	1
201501	3030	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	So what do we do, and how do we think about that?	13	1
201501	3031	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I have to think about the consensus statement all the time, and that tells us what we should do.	13	1
201501	3032	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We should have a balanced approach.	13	1
201501	3033	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	The balanced approach is essentially summarized by the utility function, which weights losses, the square of the divergence between inflation and target inflation squared and unemployment and the natural rate squared.	13	1
201501	3034	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	That has a nice, smooth tradeoff, and it will give you something like the Taylor rule when combined with a model.	13	1
201501	3035	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	It has inflation with a positive sign on the interest rate and unemployment with a negative sign on the interest rate, and you trade the two of them off.	13	1
201501	3036	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Now, what I’ve been listening to for some time is a different utility function.	13	1
201501	3037	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	It’s called the Leontief utility function, which says that our utility is the minimum of the difference between inflation and expected inflation and unemployment and the natural rate—that is, if unemployment is at the natural rate, we can’t move until the inflation rate gets to the target rate of 2 percent.	13	1
201501	3038	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	That’s how the conversation is going, but, in fact, our consensus statement says we trade things off.	13	1
201501	3039	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	In reading through all the material that came through, I noticed, quite a few times, more implicit acceptance of the view that we’re going to have to push unemployment below the natural rate in order to get inflation up.	13	1
201501	3040	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	And that seems to be something that changed—and I’ll ask the staff afterward to explain how that happened—because a few months ago several people here were dead-set against that possibility.	13	1
201501	3041	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	But I think there’s a tradeoff that what we say in the consensus statement would require us to take into account, and it wouldn’t necessarily say you can’t do anything about the interest rate at this point.	13	1
201501	3042	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	In fact, that tradeoff says it will give more weight to the unemployment rate.	13	1
201501	3043	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	At some point when we see any signs of progress, when the unemployment rate is going down below the natural rate, we will be beginning to look at raising the interest rate.	13	1
201501	3044	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	So what are we going to do?	13	1
201501	3045	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Well, we’re faced with a very tough choice, but I don’t think we should proceed on the basis of thinking we can’t move at all until the inflation rate hits 2 percent, which is roughly what I’ve been hearing.	13	1
201501	3046	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	And I know that this is unpopular, but I think we do not know the difference between 1.8 percent and 2 percent inflation in terms of its effect on the welfare of the representative consumer in the United States.	13	1
201501	3047	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	And it’s true we wrote down 2 percent.	13	1
201501	3048	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I would have been more comfortable working with a range of the inflation rate, because I think our lack of knowledge of what precisely is the relationship between the inflation rate and utility of ordinary individuals is quite considerable.	13	1
201501	3049	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We will make those decisions.	13	1
201501	3050	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We will discuss those tradeoffs further tomorrow.	13	1
201501	3051	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	And I do want to add one thing.	13	1
201501	3052	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I’m very uncomfortable working at the effective lower bound.	13	1
201501	3053	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I know that everybody says we can’t move from here, but my guess is we can move from here.	13	1
201501	3054	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	And you say, “We’ll go back to the effective lower bound with high probability.”	13	1
201501	3055	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	First of all, it’s not high probability in the very excellent analytic work we’ve been given, and using the FRB/US model to run stochastic simulations tells us that it doesn’t make much difference if you go sooner or go later.	13	1
201501	3056	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We’ll have to discuss this tomorrow, but I suggest we don’t discuss it in terms of the idea that there is no tradeoff until you’re right at the point of inflation at 2 percent and unemployment at the natural rate.	13	1
201501	3057	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	13	1
201501	3058	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201501	3059	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	13	1
201501	3060	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Governor Fischer, I want to follow up on what you’ve said, just to understand better.	13	1
201501	3061	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So the costs of our current policy of remaining accommodative, maybe for a longer time than is envisioned in the Tealbook, for example, are that interest rates would remain unnaturally low, artificially low, and that unemployment would fall below U*.	13	1
201501	3062	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Is that an accurate summary of what you were saying?	13	1
201501	3063	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	That’s part of what I was saying, yes.	13	1
201501	3064	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	That’s not the whole story.	13	1
201501	3065	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And that there’s a de minimis loss associated with having inflation run at 1.8 percent as opposed to 2 percent?	13	1
201501	3066	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	A de minimis loss for two reasons.	13	1
201501	3067	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Number one, those utility functions have very little cost to being 0.1 percentage point or 0.2 percentage point away from target.	13	1
201501	3068	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	So just by the nature of what we assume about the tradeoffs, of course, they are not very large.	13	1
201501	3069	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	And, second, I think there is substantial uncertainty about this.	13	1
201501	3070	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I promise you—and I have the data to prove it—that I wouldn’t worry about 2.4 percent inflation either, and I didn’t.	13	1
201501	3071	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We were allowed between 1 and 3 percent, and being between 1 and 3 percent meant that when you got to 2.6 percent, you started saying, “Shucks, if we get above 3, we’re going to be in trouble.”	13	1
201501	3072	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	So then you’d start doing things.	13	1
201501	3073	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	But there’s a lot of bumping around.	13	1
201501	3074	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I think about what you’ve said, the observations about inflation are helpful, but they are not necessarily a guidepost in and of themselves.	13	1
201501	3075	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	No, they’re not.	13	1
201501	3076	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Simply saying 1.8 percent is close to 2 percent, well, 2.2 percent could also be close to 2 percent.	13	1
201501	3077	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We could wait until we get to 2.2 percent.	13	1
201501	3078	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The cost side is very helpful for me in understanding your perspectives.	13	1
201501	3079	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	13	1
201501	3080	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	13	1
201501	3081	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201501	3082	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13	1
201501	3083	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	3084	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	This will be fairly easy for me, because a number of people have already said most of what I wanted to say.	13	1
201501	3085	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I’ll just make a few points.	13	1
201501	3086	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	One, I obviously agree with everybody that general improvement has continued since the previous meeting.	13	1
201501	3087	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I’d just observe in passing that it was a very damaged economy that needed a lot of improvement.	13	1
201501	3088	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	And because, with the exception of a couple of quarters, the pace of that improvement has never been all that rapid, I, again, don’t think it proves too much to say we’re continuing to improve.	13	1
201501	3089	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Second, and I did check with President Kocherlakota over the weekend to make sure he was going to address inflation so that I’d be able to piggyback on his comments, but happily I can now piggyback on what Presidents Rosengren and Evans said as well.	13	1
201501	3090	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I guess I’m probably slightly different—although maybe not too different from where President Evans is—in saying I regard this as a downside risk rather than as a modal expectation.	13	1
201501	3091	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	But it’s a very troubling one, if it were to be realized.	13	1
201501	3092	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	And, again, as a noncentral banker and a nonmacroeconomist by training in most of my professional life, I continue to be bemused by the concept of anchored inflation expectations.	13	1
201501	3093	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I mean, it does seem to me that an awful lot depends on anchored inflation expectations.	13	1
201501	3094	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I notice in the current Tealbook, for example, that the staff models downplay the decline in TIPS compensation precisely because the surveys suggest that expectations remain anchored, therefore it all must be okay.	13	1
201501	3095	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	An awful lot of work is being required of a factor that, so far as I can tell, is still not particularly well understood—that is, where it comes from and how it actually functions.	13	1
201501	3096	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	That just makes me slightly nervous, but it doesn’t seem to make most of you nervous.	13	1
201501	3097	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	So I don’t know what to make of that.	13	1
201501	3098	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	And then, finally, on labor markets, I want to pick up on something a couple of people alluded to, and then Bill elaborated and actually began to try to quantify some, which is the possibility that the natural rate is lower than the estimates most of us, including the Tealbook, have.	13	1
201501	3099	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	And this is obviously really important, because, as I understand it, any significant difference in the natural rate plugged into any one of the various models that are used results in a quite different timing of liftoff and differences in what you do with regard to monetary policy thereafter.	13	1
201501	3100	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I’m not about to argue something that I necessarily believe to be the case, but I just want to supplement some of the things Bill mentioned as potential points that may argue for the possibility that the natural rate is lower.	13	1
201501	3101	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	To some degree, the possibility that the natural rate is lower is the flip side of the low labor force participation rate relative to what we would have expected with demographic trends, which is to say, lower, but not as low as it has been.	13	1
201501	3102	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	That is, people who are currently categorized as unemployed may be more attached to the workforce and more skilled than the norm for unemployed workers historically.	13	1
201501	3103	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	In addition, a lot of people who would have formerly been listed as unemployed, but who are actually less tied to or qualified for work, may now be listed as out of the labor force.	13	1
201501	3104	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	And, by the way, there are a bunch of younger people who have parked themselves in school somewhere, waiting for things to improve.	13	1
201501	3105	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Now, that’s an intuition to some degree, or a theoretical possibility, but it is buttressed by the fact that, contrary to expectations, the exit rate from unemployment to out of the labor force has actually fallen relative to what it was pre-crisis, and entry into the labor force—again, taking demographics into account—has been low.	13	1
201501	3106	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	So all of that would at least suggest, though not prove, that the quality, if you will, of those currently listed as unemployed is higher than the group historically included in that category of unemployment, and, therefore—no pun intended—naturally, there would be a lower natural rate.	13	1
201501	3107	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Maybe that’s not true, but here, as with so many things with respect to labor markets I’ve been noticing for the past several years, every argument on one side, like on the issue of whether wages are about to rise, almost always has an equally good argument on the other.	13	1
201501	3108	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	The NFIB thing is my latest example.	13	1
201501	3109	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	The NFIB survey predicts wages are going to rise.	13	1
201501	3110	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	It has been doing so for the past two years.	13	1
201501	3111	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Someday it’s going to be right.	13	1
201501	3112	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	But it hasn’t been to date, and so to me it doesn’t actually mean all that much.	13	1
201501	3113	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Again, things like the quits rate—yes, the quits rate has improved, but (a) it improved really only modestly, (b) it is still not where it was pre-crisis, and (c) it actually dipped back down a little bit during Q4.	13	1
201501	3114	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	So, again, let’s not make too much out of things until we actually see something a bit more tangible, which I would come back to and say would be wages again.	13	1
201501	3115	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	And I’m not going to discuss the implications of this, Madam Chair, because I think that’s what the next go-round is about.	13	1
201501	3116	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	13	1
201501	3117	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I believe you’re right.	13	1
201501	3118	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201501	3119	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13	1
201501	3120	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	3121	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	This seems like a good opportunity to be succinct, so I will try to take advantage of that.	13	1
201501	3122	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	On the real economy, as we all know, we have been through what are two pretty strong years, and I would also say that there has been apparently quite a meaningful gain in momentum in the second half of last year.	13	1
201501	3123	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	And we are seeing numbers that seemed out of reach for many years after the crisis.	13	1
201501	3124	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	The Tealbook forecast is that we will continue on that path and continue to eliminate slack at a rapid pace, fully admitting that we don’t know the value of the natural rate.	13	1
201501	3125	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	And I’m comfortable with that forecast.	13	1
201501	3126	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	In particular, the Tealbook points out that PDFP has been even stronger than GDP against a background of strong job growth, lower energy prices, and higher consumer confidence.	13	1
201501	3127	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	That dynamic seems to me very likely to continue, and I think there is every reason to expect the real economy to continue on that path.	13	1
201501	3128	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	The big issue that we’ve been over and over is the risk of weakness abroad.	13	1
201501	3129	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	It’s worth pointing out that those effects are already incorporated in the Tealbook to a significant extent through the strong dollar.	13	1
201501	3130	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Of course, the dollar can still go higher.	13	1
201501	3131	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	There can be bad geopolitical events.	13	1
201501	3132	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	On the other hand, we have perhaps some hope in Europe as a result of lower oil prices and much better financial conditions with a lower euro and other effects of QE.	13	1
201501	3133	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	So I wouldn’t say those risks are at all currently balanced, but I would say they are coming closer to being balanced.	13	1
201501	3134	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	And that leaves you with what President Lockhart referred to as the “big disconnect” between the real economy and wages and prices, and interest rates as well, and how to think about that.	13	1
201501	3135	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	And it’s very discomfiting, and we’re just not going to know with any confidence for a while.	13	1
201501	3136	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	But what I would expect is that the effects of both the oil shock and the increase in the dollar—assuming the dollar flattens out in trade-weighted terms—will pass, and, indeed, we will see much more comfortable readings on both headline and core inflation rates in the second half of next year.	13	1
201501	3137	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	But we won’t know that, I think, for a while.	13	1
201501	3138	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	On market readings on inflation compensation, I talked about it at the previous meeting at some length, and I won’t go over it again, but I do continue to think that much of that is not really expectations.	13	1
201501	3139	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	On the other hand, I profess no certainty on that, and I think President Evans made a great point that if it’s not representative of expectations, then at some point it should be transient.	13	1
201501	3140	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	With every meeting it loses its status as temporary or transient and becomes more concerning.	13	1
201501	3141	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Like Governor Tarullo, I will wait until the next go-round.	13	1
201501	3142	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I think those issues do raise significant issues for policy, and I will address them in upcoming rounds—possibly, Madam Chair, round 14 on day 6 of this meeting.	13	1
201501	3143	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	[Laughter]	13	1
201501	3144	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201501	3145	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13	1
201501	3146	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	13	1
201501	3147	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The data that we have seen since December reinforce this pattern of divergence.	13	1
201501	3148	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	On the one hand, we see domestic activity continuing to strengthen, and on the other hand, we see price pressures continuing to soften.	13	1
201501	3149	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	In characterizing domestic activity, I thought a banker in President Lacker’s District summed it up very nicely when he remarked that business conditions are as normal as any time he has seen in the past six years.	13	1
201501	3150	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	And I think “normal” is good.	13	1
201501	3151	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Job growth in December, at about 250,000, was similar to the average for the year as a whole.	13	1
201501	3152	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	And with initial claims remaining at a low level and job openings remaining elevated, it seems likely that we are going to continue to see gains close to this magnitude in the first part of this year.	13	1
201501	3153	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	That should continue to push the unemployment rate down and should continue to put enough upward pressure on the participation rate to keep it from falling despite the downward structural trend.	13	1
201501	3154	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think recent indicators of aggregate spending also support that growth in labor demand despite the surprising drop in December retail sales.	13	1
201501	3155	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The data on consumer spending has been, on balance, positive, and further declines in energy prices, along with a substantial step-up in consumer sentiment, should support continued strong consumer spending, enough to more than compensate for the drop that President Fisher talked about earlier in drilling and mining investment.	13	1
201501	3156	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Investment spending is a little bit more of a mixed picture, but December’s data on housing starts were the most favorable we have seen in some time.	13	1
201501	3157	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Despite that improvement, particularly in the labor market, we have seen no broad-based acceleration of wages, and that is a puzzle.	13	1
201501	3158	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The news on inflation has also been dominated by continued declines, particularly from oil prices.	13	1
201501	3159	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	While I think we should expect to see the effect of these declines to be temporary, I am concerned about the possibility that deflationary shocks may continue for some time and eventually feed through to expectations.	13	1
201501	3160	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The news on core inflation was a bit softer than expected, and the annualized three-month change in core PCE prices is likely to be below 1 percent in December.	13	1
201501	3161	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Survey-based measures, as many have pointed out, have held steady, a development that holds out the hope that, when the effect of oil and dollar shocks subside, and as resource slack continues to diminish, inflation should move up toward 2 percent.	13	1
201501	3162	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	But while I am mostly comfortable looking through the sharp decline in oil prices, I am increasingly uncomfortable doing the same with regard to market-based measures of inflation compensation, which have continued to decline.	13	1
201501	3163	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Because those measures are likely more forward looking than survey-based measures, I don’t think we can dismiss the possibility that the risks to inflation and inflation expectations are on the downside.	13	1
201501	3164	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Related to that, I have been somewhat preoccupied with the significant decline in longer- term nominal interest rates, which is striking at a time when this Committee is signaling the approach of liftoff.	13	1
201501	3165	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, the 10-year Treasury has declined close to 1 percentage point over the past year.	13	1
201501	3166	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Two aspects of that decline are noteworthy.	13	1
201501	3167	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	First, it’s concentrated farther out along the yield curve, and, second, changes in the expected path of short-term rates do not appear to account for much of the change—or, put differently, it has been concentrated in the term premium.	13	1
201501	3168	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think understanding why this decline is happening is important for our policy deliberations tomorrow, and in this regard I think two explanations merit particular attention.	13	1
201501	3169	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	First, the one that has been cited here:  Extremely low longer-term interest rates in advanced foreign economies and concerns about a weaker global economic outlook may be exerting downward pressure on yields.	13	1
201501	3170	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	That one, I think, is a slightly easier scenario to deal with.	13	1
201501	3171	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	But the second is that there is some evidence that market participants may have materially altered the probability they assign to low inflation outcomes and weak economic conditions.	13	1
201501	3172	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Previously, when market participants appeared to be most concerned about the risk of higher inflation coinciding with unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, nominal Treasury securities had to yield more in order for investors to hold them.	13	1
201501	3173	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	More recently, this concern appears to have been replaced by the concern that low inflation will coincide with unfavorable macroeconomic conditions.	13	1
201501	3174	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	In these states, nominal Treasury securities have attractive returns.	13	1
201501	3175	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	This consideration could explain why the term premium has declined.	13	1
201501	3176	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	This scenario was laid out very nicely for us in an earlier memo from President Kocherlakota, and it is given some weight in the chart in the Tealbook that shows a striking shift in market-based measures toward a higher probability being placed on low inflation outcomes.	13	1
201501	3177	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Finally and related again, there is something that many have commented on, the strong activity domestically comes against a divergent backdrop of weak foreign economic growth and deflationary pressures from abroad.	13	1
201501	3178	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Indeed, the one sector of the US economy other than oil exploration in which prospects remain distinctly unfavorable is net exports.	13	1
201501	3179	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Since last summer, the dollar has increased about 10 percent.	13	1
201501	3180	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Staff models suggest such an increase will eventually subtract nearly 2 percent from the level of GDP, and the contribution of net exports to GDP growth in the Tealbook averages a subtraction of about ½ percentage point over the next few years.	13	1
201501	3181	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The size and the open-ended nature of the ECB’s policy announcement on purchases of sovereigns surprised markets and sent a definitive signal that the ECB is prepared to take the necessary action to prevent deflation in the euro area, which is welcome.	13	1
201501	3182	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	But challenges remain.	13	1
201501	3183	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The extent to which this recent action coincides with a stronger recovery in euro-area economic growth will depend on strengthening confidence about the outlook for activity and inflation, the emergence of stronger domestic demand, and the absence of further threats to the cohesion of the euro area.	13	1
201501	3184	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Upcoming negotiations between Greece and its creditors following the Syriza victory on Sunday will test the last of these.	13	1
201501	3185	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	And, more generally, continued disagreement among euro- area members about the extent of needed structural reforms and fiscal support are likely to continue to weigh on the recovery.	13	1
201501	3186	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Developments beyond Europe are also not hugely encouraging.	13	1
201501	3187	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Even if a deceleration in China’s economic growth occurs smoothly, the deceleration itself is likely to contribute to continued global deflationary pressures for some time.	13	1
201501	3188	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The Tealbook projection, I think, involves an assumption that the dollar does not move further.	13	1
201501	3189	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	My own assessment is that the risks associated with that forecast are in the direction of further dollar appreciation.	13	1
201501	3190	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Indeed, as we have seen, in response to last Thursday’s ECB action, the dollar has already appreciated since the Tealbook was finalized.	13	1
201501	3191	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	So, in sum, I think we can expect some persistence in deflationary pressures from abroad with dollar strength outweighing possible improvements in foreign economic growth.	13	1
201501	3192	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201501	3193	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201501	3194	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Well, let me thank everyone for another very thoughtful round of observations on the outlook.	13	1
201501	3195	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I will, as usual, try to summarize a few of the main themes in your remarks, especially as they relate to actual progress we have made in achieving our dual objectives and the likely pace of progress going forward.	13	1
201501	3196	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I apologize in advance that I won’t do justice to all of the interesting and detailed analysis that some of you have presented.	13	1
201501	3197	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And then I’d like to add a couple of remarks of my own.	13	1
201501	3198	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Starting with the labor market, I think we all agree that labor market conditions continue to improve, and most of us seem optimistic that further improvement is likely in the period ahead.	13	1
201501	3199	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The labor market report for December may not have quite lived up to the sizzling standards of November, but it certainly provided further evidence that the recent trend in employment has become stronger, appreciably stronger, than it was earlier in the year.	13	1
201501	3200	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The unemployment rate fell a further 0.2 percentage point, which is more than we expected, and broader measures of utilization have similarly moved down.	13	1
201501	3201	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Both the Board and the Kansas City indexes of labor market conditions have picked up.	13	1
201501	3202	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Even so, a number of you noted that there likely remains an appreciable margin of slack in the labor market despite these recent gains.	13	1
201501	3203	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The Tealbook, for example, emphasizes that the unemployment gap at this point appears to understate the true amount of labor market slack, in the sense that the output gap is currently estimated to be significantly larger than that consistent with Okun’s law, reflecting the cyclical shortfall in labor force participation and involuntary part-time employment.	13	1
201501	3204	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, the behavior of labor compensation also provides some information on labor market slack.	13	1
201501	3205	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And as David noted in his presentation and as shown in the Tealbook simulation, it has important implications for inflation.	13	1
201501	3206	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Most measures of labor compensation still haven’t moved upward in any convincing way.	13	1
201501	3207	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The average hourly earnings number moved in the wrong direction.	13	1
201501	3208	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And while that may be noise, we still really haven’t seen any meaningful pickup in wage growth.	13	1
201501	3209	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Several of you noted that surveys hint that wage growth is about to pick up, but that’s something we haven’t yet seen.	13	1
201501	3210	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I suppose one response to this that I heard from several of you around the table is that you are beginning to revise down your estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate.	13	1
201501	3211	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	This is something, as Governor Tarullo mentioned, that also is perhaps a logical reaction to the notion that at this point more slack may be showing up in other forms, whether it’s part-time employment or individuals who are not working but not actively looking and are, therefore, counted as out of the labor force.	13	1
201501	3212	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	That may be another factor that has led to a downward revision to estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate, and I would add that I also am in the camp of those who, for all these reasons, have recently revised down my own estimate.	13	1
201501	3213	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, it’s also important to remember, as President Williams emphasized in his comments, that the behavior of wages may continue to be influenced by downward nominal wage rigidity.	13	1
201501	3214	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	If firms were constrained from cutting wages during the recession, they may face less pressure to raise them now than would be expected on the basis of the existing degree of labor market slack.	13	1
201501	3215	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	In other words, a stock of pent-up wage deflation may currently be holding wage increases down.	13	1
201501	3216	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	But as this source of restraint erodes, we could see nonlinearities emerge in the behavior of nominal wage growth and price inflation, and this is something that President Fisher has emphasized.	13	1
201501	3217	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I thought the Tealbook had an interesting box this time that discussed the implications of this type of view.	13	1
201501	3218	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Turning to recent developments in the broader economy, most of you seem reasonably confident that real GDP will continue expanding at a solid pace, thereby enabling further improvements in the labor market.	13	1
201501	3219	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	You noted that real GDP likely expanded at a rapid pace, maybe about 3¾ percent or so, in the second half of last year, and that the growth of consumer spending was quite brisk.	13	1
201501	3220	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And many of you expect this strength in domestic spending to continue this year, with household purchasing power having been markedly boosted by declining gasoline prices.	13	1
201501	3221	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Several of you also noted a significant improvement in consumer confidence.	13	1
201501	3222	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	But, as President Lacker noted, while the boost to consumer spending from declining gasoline prices should prove transitory, employment growth and the associated income growth and gains in wealth are ongoing factors supporting consumer spending.	13	1
201501	3223	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Business confidence also seems quite strong.	13	1
201501	3224	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	We had a good discussion around the table of the effect of lower oil prices.	13	1
201501	3225	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think there was general agreement that, on balance, it should be positive, but it’s really difficult to figure out exactly what effect it is likely to have with respect to capital spending and employment in the energy sector.	13	1
201501	3226	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	It was good to hear from Presidents Fisher and Kocherlakota that they see less likelihood than was the case in the 1980s that these declines will have very serious negative effects on their regions and on, for example, banking conditions.	13	1
201501	3227	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	But as Vice Chairman Dudley pointed out, the timing with regard to when we see effects on investment spending and employment in the energy sector relative to the boost to spending is really a significant factor for the forecast going forward.	13	1
201501	3228	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Many of you discussed foreign economic developments in the outlook.	13	1
201501	3229	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think there was broad agreement that the actions by the ECB are a positive and surprise to the upside.	13	1
201501	3230	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Nevertheless, there remain significant concerns associated with developments in Greece and with future developments in the euro area, Russia, Ukraine, China, the Middle East, and other areas.	13	1
201501	3231	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Many of you mentioned that the steep appreciation we have seen in the dollar is likely to weaken net exports in the years ahead by exerting a larger influence over time than the positive effects on spending from lower oil prices.	13	1
201501	3232	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And as some of you noted, further appreciation of the dollar is certainly possible and such an eventuality presents a downside risk to the forecast.	13	1
201501	3233	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to financial conditions, we had some discussion of why longer-term interest rates are so low.	13	1
201501	3234	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	That’s something I’ll turn to in my own comments as well, but clearly there are a variety of scenarios with different policy implications.	13	1
201501	3235	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	One possibility is that we are simply seeing spillovers from the rest of the world, which has seen an expectation of quantitative easing and has had weak economic conditions.	13	1
201501	3236	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And if that’s the main scenario, that would seem to be a positive factor for our national forecast.	13	1
201501	3237	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	But as several of you noted, other scenarios or explanations are also possible, in particular that the low level of rates may reflect low inflation expectations or expectations of weak economic growth.	13	1
201501	3238	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	On the inflation front, incoming data suggest that we are making somewhat slower progress towards our 2 percent goal than previously anticipated.	13	1
201501	3239	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The core CPI inflation rate in December was unchanged.	13	1
201501	3240	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The staff has revised down its core PCE inflation estimate in the fourth quarter to 1.1 percent from 1.6 percent at the time of the previous meeting.	13	1
201501	3241	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The staff currently anticipates that core PCE inflation will continue to run close to 1 percent during the winter but pick up a bit in the spring, and that’s a downward revision.	13	1
201501	3242	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And some of you noted in your own discussions that you have also adjusted downward your forecast of PCE inflation and are increasingly worried that inflation may remain below 2 percent for some time.	13	1
201501	3243	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Some of you noted that the rise of the dollar since our previous meeting will put additional downward pressure on prices of imported goods and other commodities—and thereby lower readings on inflation during the first half of this year by more than you previously expected—and that the further decline we have seen in oil prices may also spill over into lower core inflation.	13	1
201501	3244	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think it’s fair to say that most of you emphasized that you don’t expect these disinflationary forces to have a persistent effect on inflation beyond 2015, particularly in light of the continued stability of survey measures of long-run inflation.	13	1
201501	3245	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	But a number of you certainly expressed concern that inflation expectations may move down, and that we are likely to see little or no evidence in the next several months that will improve our confidence that inflation is going to move back to 2 percent.	13	1
201501	3246	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I did hear some general concern about the continued decline of five-year, five-year-ahead inflation compensation and the risk it signals that longer-run inflation expectations could be starting to drift.	13	1
201501	3247	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, as many of you noted, statistical models we look at suggest that the downdrift mainly reflects a decline in the inflation risk premiums or liquidity premiums.	13	1
201501	3248	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	But as a number of you noted, it is not obvious, for reasons that Presidents Kocherlakota and Evans discussed, that this is an entirely comforting interpretation.	13	1
201501	3249	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And I also noted comments that, while survey measures may be stable, this is not entirely reassuring, as we saw stability of longer-run inflation expectations in Japan as well.	13	1
201501	3250	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	So, clearly, this is something that needs close monitoring.	13	1
201501	3251	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there by way of summary.	13	1
201501	3252	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Would anybody like to comment or add anything?	13	1
201501	3253	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	13	1
201501	3254	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	13	1
201501	3255	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Then I’d like to add just a couple of comments of my own.	13	1
201501	3256	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I certainly agree with everyone that incoming data provide confirmation that the labor market is making good progress toward a more normal state.	13	1
201501	3257	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And, knock on wood, I am optimistic that we will see continued progress toward fulfilling the employment leg of our dual mandate.	13	1
201501	3258	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And I find it reassuring that job growth actually could slow appreciably from its recent pace and still be well above staff estimates of the rate of job creation that is consistent with an unchanged unemployment rate.	13	1
201501	3259	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think this is fortunate, because I am in the camp that thinks we still have some ways to go before we are back to maximum employment.	13	1
201501	3260	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, when measured on a cyclically adjusted basis, the number of long-term unemployed workers and the percentage of involuntary part-time workers remains elevated, while the labor force participation rate remains low.	13	1
201501	3261	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	That suggests to me that the unemployment gap in the staff estimate understates the true degree of slack in the labor market.	13	1
201501	3262	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And, as I mentioned, I have also revised down my estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate.	13	1
201501	3263	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, I think a tighter labor market would have other advantages with respect to the inflation leg of our mandate, as it would presumably speed up the return to our 2 percent inflation objective.	13	1
201501	3264	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	In contrast, incoming data—particularly the lower-than-expected core CPI inflation reading for December, the continued decline in oil prices, and continued upward pressure on the dollar—have, to my mind, made the outlook for inflation somewhat less satisfactory.	13	1
201501	3265	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The surprisingly steep decline we saw in the growth of average hourly earnings may well prove an aberration.	13	1
201501	3266	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	But like many of you, I see little sign yet of any upward pressure on nominal wage growth, and that matters not only for the inflation outlook, but also for the strength of consumer spending.	13	1
201501	3267	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I worry that if wage growth doesn’t pick up, and it does pick up in the staff forecast, that the strength of consumer spending we have assumed may not materialize.	13	1
201501	3268	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I certainly haven’t given up on my forecast that, in an environment of diminishing slack, inflation will move back to our 2 percent goal over the next two or three years.	13	1
201501	3269	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	But I am concerned that, at midyear, PCE inflation will be running below 1½ percent on a 12-month basis, and that’s a fact we need to take into account when we consider the appropriate time to begin tightening.	13	1
201501	3270	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The stability of survey measures continues to reassure me that longer-run inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored, but I, too, am increasingly disturbed by the marked decline we have seen in far-dated measures of inflation compensation in recent months.	13	1
201501	3271	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I also would note that financial market data indicate an increased desire on the part of investors to insure against very low inflation, and that worries me—that there is increased concern on the part of investors that the economy may fall into a state of very low inflation or even deflation in some regions.	13	1
201501	3272	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Like many of you, I, too, am perplexed by the remarkably low level of long-term interest rates, which I find hard to square with our December SEP assessments of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate.	13	1
201501	3273	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	One possible explanation is that while we and the market have similar views of the modal path for domestic short-term interest rates, investors perceive a distribution of possible outcomes that places significant probability on low interest rate scenarios.	13	1
201501	3274	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	For example, investors may see a high risk that poor economic performance abroad will result in a persistent glut of foreign savings, resulting in a chronically strong dollar, a growing US current account deficit, a low equilibrium real funds rate, and subdued inflation.	13	1
201501	3275	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	If investors prove to be right, we’re apt to boost the funds rate much less than we envision in the SEP forecasts, but in this low r* world, the zero lower bound and “reach-for-yield” investor behavior will continue to be policy concerns for us for the foreseeable future.	13	1
201501	3276	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	On the other hand, investors may be too pessimistic about global risks, and they may alter their views over time.	13	1
201501	3277	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	And if that’s the case, I worry we could be in for quite a bumpy ride.	13	1
201501	3278	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Increased investor optimism about the global outlook could prompt a significant fall in the dollar and rise in longer-term interest rates.	13	1
201501	3279	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	If such adjustments occur quickly, we could see significant disruptions in financial markets.	13	1
201501	3280	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, it could be that the very low level of long-term interest rates simply reflects a decline in term premiums abroad in response to foreign monetary policy easing that, in turn, has led to lower longer-term yields domestically as market participants worldwide apparently reach for higher-yielding safe investments without overly worrying about exchange rate risk.	13	1
201501	3281	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The same mechanism may also be a factor boosting equity prices.	13	1
201501	3282	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	In this case, absent a steeper path for policy rates than we anticipate, financial conditions may remain more accommodative than we intend, although the strength of the dollar provides at least a partial offset.	13	1
201501	3283	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The persistence of such a conundrum will also likely have policy consequences.	13	1
201501	3284	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	These scenarios hardly exhaust the set of possible explanations for the current constellation of financial market prices, but I think they highlight some of the risks that are present in the current situation.	13	1
201501	3285	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there.	13	1
201501	3286	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The next topic is the timing of liftoff and the pace of tightening.	13	1
201501	3287	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	If you want, we can quit now for the day, or if you would like to stay for another 10 or 15 minutes, we could have Ed Nelson give us his briefing and then start off tomorrow with the go-round.	2	2
201501	3288	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	So I leave it up to you.	2	2
201501	3289	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think we have time tomorrow, if you want to defer until tomorrow.	2	2
201501	3290	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	2	2
201501	3291	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll express my own perspective that I think it would be preferable to defer it, just so that people are fresh to take on this important new topic.	2	2
201501	3292	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	2	2
201501	3293	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Is that the general view?	2	2
201501	3294	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	We will begin tomorrow, then, at 9:00 am, and we will discuss policy options concerning the timing of liftoff and the pace of tightening.	2	2
201501	3295	2015-01-28	meeting		[Meeting recessed]	2	2
201501	3296	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	January 28 Session .	2	2
201501	3297	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	2	2
201501	3298	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	We are going to start things off this morning by coming back to the testing proposals, and I’m going to turn things over to Josh Frost.	92	9
201501	3299	2015-01-28	meeting	FROST	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	3300	2015-01-28	meeting	FROST	In yesterday’s discussion, the Committee expressed interest in having the staff put forward two proposals for testing term RRPs—one that includes further testing of term RRPs over the March quarter- end only and one that includes the March quarter-end tests and a series of small-term RRP tests in February and early March.	92	9
201501	3301	2015-01-28	meeting	FROST	The first option—further testing of term RRPs over the March quarter-end— would include the four operational refinements that Lorie mentioned yesterday.	92	9
201501	3302	2015-01-28	meeting	FROST	These refinements are based on lessons learned from the tests over year-end and are outlined in the top panel of exhibit 1.	92	9
201501	3303	2015-01-28	meeting	FROST	To reiterate, the four refinements are:  one, reduce the amount of term RRP offered to $200 billion to improve our understanding of the effect of decreased capacity; two, have the term RRPs mature across multiple days in early April to avoid operational risks associated with having all of the operations mature on the same day; three, make modest changes to the frequency and tenor of term RRP operations, resulting in fewer operations and shorter maturities; and four, express the maximum bid rate as a spread above the ON RRP rate on the day of the operation to better allow for the possibility of a change in the target for the federal funds rate following the announcement of the term RRP offerings but before the actual operations commence.	92	9
201501	3304	2015-01-28	meeting	FROST	The second option includes a series of small tests of term RRPs in February and early March, in addition to the March quarter-end tests that I just discussed.	92	9
201501	3305	2015-01-28	meeting	FROST	A possible structure of these non-quarter-end tests is outlined in the bottom panel of exhibit 1.	92	9
201501	3306	2015-01-28	meeting	FROST	If the Committee wanted to pursue these tests, it could authorize the Desk to offer a series of relatively short-term RRPs in modest sizes to learn more about the degree of substitutability between overnight and term RRPs, and to get more insight into the rate the market requires on term RRPs to induce such substitution.	92	9
201501	3307	2015-01-28	meeting	FROST	To best balance the desire to learn about these issues with an inclination to keep the size of such tests relatively small, the Committee might want to instruct the staff to conduct a series of term RRP operations in February and March with a size limit of $50 billion outstanding at any one time.	92	9
201501	3308	2015-01-28	meeting	FROST	As is the case with the quarter-end term RRP testing, this limit would be in addition to the $300 billion daily limit on the overnight RRP.	92	9
201501	3309	2015-01-28	meeting	FROST	These operations could be conducted beginning on Thursday, February 12, and all mature by Thursday, March 12.	92	9
201501	3310	2015-01-28	meeting	FROST	These dates would ensure that these operations do not conflict with the March quarter-end term RRP testing, and all of these operations would all mature prior to the Committee’s March meeting.	92	9
201501	3311	2015-01-28	meeting	FROST	The operations could also be subject to a maximum bid rate of the prevailing ON RRP rate plus 5 basis points, and be awarded via a single-price auction.	92	9
201501	3312	2015-01-28	meeting	FROST	While the exact terms of these tests would be determined in the coming days, it is likely that we would plan to start relatively small at around $10 billion and utilize a maximum bid rate of the prevailing ON RRP rate plus 5 basis points, and conduct a series of four one-week operations every Thursday from February 12 through March 5.	92	9
201501	3313	2015-01-28	meeting	FROST	In the coming days, Simon Potter would inform the Committee of the detailed terms of the first of the planned operations after obtaining the Chair’s approval.	92	9
201501	3314	2015-01-28	meeting	FROST	Depending on which option the Committee chooses, the Desk could release a statement following this meeting, with more operational details announced through a future Desk statement.	92	9
201501	3315	2015-01-28	meeting	FROST	Draft resolutions authorizing each type of term RRP testing are provided in your handout as exhibit 2.	92	9
201501	3316	2015-01-28	meeting	FROST	We will have copies of the Desk statement associated with each of the options in case you would like to review.	92	9
201501	3317	2015-01-28	meeting	FROST	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	3318	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201501	3319	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Josh?	92	9
201501	3320	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	92	9
201501	3321	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I just have a question about option 1.	92	9
201501	3322	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Looking forward, what would be our plan about the June quarter-end, abstracting from what monetary policy will or will not do?	92	9
201501	3323	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	As Vice Chairman Dudley discussed, I think we will recommend testing over the June quarter-end if we go ahead with this test over Q1.	92	9
201501	3324	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	I think the appropriate way to do that as a test would be to have a Desk statement come out at the April meeting, or it’s possible we could do that at the March meeting.	92	9
201501	3325	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	But it’s important that we have some interval in order to show it is testing and it’s not an indication of any change in the policy statement.	92	9
201501	3326	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	The idea, if I may, would be that if we were to use this on a permanent basis, we would announce it at what point?	92	9
201501	3327	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	The main option you have is the directive to the Desk, and you could put this into the directive that you vote on at each meeting.	92	9
201501	3328	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	If, for example, at the June meeting you voted to increase the federal funds rate target range, you could take the testing that we’re doing and you could increase the limit on it, if you wanted more comfort.	92	9
201501	3329	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	We would probably recommend to go with the $200 billion, so there is no signal.	92	9
201501	3330	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	If at that meeting you decided that you wanted to raise rates, you could then direct the Desk to have more capacity than that $200 billion.	92	9
201501	3331	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	But would we be announcing that for the foreseeable future we plan to do quarter-end?	92	9
201501	3332	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s what I was asking about.	92	9
201501	3333	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I mean, we would be out of the testing stage.	92	9
201501	3334	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	At the moment it’s in the directive, it will be out of the testing stage.	92	9
201501	3335	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	But the directive is just for the period through the next meeting.	92	9
201501	3336	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	It would just be a statement about the period through the next meeting, and we would repeat that as long as we were using term RRPs.	92	9
201501	3337	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	92	9
201501	3338	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	But there might be some more communication to help the market understand the regime that we would be operating in.	92	9
201501	3339	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	92	9
201501	3340	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201501	3341	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	92	9
201501	3342	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	92	9
201501	3343	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Josh, on option 2, about the testing small operations in February and March, I want to understand more about the value you folks see in this.	92	9
201501	3344	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I believe I heard you say that it would be informative about the rate at which term substitutes for overnight.	92	9
201501	3345	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	A general expectation is that it would be higher than the rate on overnight, but now I’m trying to think about what difference it would make to me as a Committee member to know what that rate is.	92	9
201501	3346	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Do you have a sense of what value it would be to the Committee?	92	9
201501	3347	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Or do you have some other purpose in mind for this test?	92	9
201501	3348	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	If it’s 8 or 10 or 15, what difference is it going to make to the Committee to know what that rate is?	92	9
201501	3349	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Madam Chair, may I augment that question, please?	92	9
201501	3350	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	92	9
201501	3351	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I’d like to also know in answer to the question, from the Desk’s standpoint, would these smaller tests be a useful exercise just in terms of getting better muscle tone?	92	9
201501	3352	2015-01-28	meeting	FROST	I think in terms of what you would learn from the rate information, just suppose for argument’s sake that the first few operations clear at a rate of 6 basis points, so 1 above.	92	9
201501	3353	2015-01-28	meeting	FROST	That might suggest that there is relatively little premium that would need to be offered to have people move from overnight into term.	92	9
201501	3354	2015-01-28	meeting	FROST	Instead, suppose it was 10, 15.	92	9
201501	3355	2015-01-28	meeting	FROST	I would think that it would be useful for the Committee to have some understanding of just how much of a premium would need to be paid in order to induce switching between the two.	92	9
201501	3356	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I really can’t see why, though.	92	9
201501	3357	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I mean, we set overnight rates, and we’ve done this for decades.	92	9
201501	3358	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	The term structure of interest rates—the one-month, the three- month commercial paper rate—is what it is.	92	9
201501	3359	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Why would it matter?	92	9
201501	3360	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	From the discussion yesterday, if we decided to lift the overnight RRP cap to a larger size, you wouldn’t necessarily need that substitution.	92	9
201501	3361	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	But there was also a discussion to the effect that you would want that cap to be temporarily increased, and afterward you may decide you want to bring that down and move some of that overnight into term.	92	9
201501	3362	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	It may be useful to know what premium you would need to pay for that substitution.	92	9
201501	3363	2015-01-28	meeting	LOGAN	If it was very low, that might affect the exit strategy that Governor Tarullo discussed yesterday, and I think we would come back with other exit strategies.	92	9
201501	3364	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Is it a matter of our budgetary cost for this that might affect our choice here?	92	9
201501	3365	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	That seems second order for monetary policy.	92	9
201501	3366	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	President Lacker, I think my sense of it is that if you thought that term RRPs had a somewhat lower financial-stability risk than that associated with overnight RRPs—so let’s posit that—then you’d want to know how much that benefit cost you in terms of paying a higher premium.	92	9
201501	3367	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, if you don’t accept the premise that term RRPs have a lower financial-stability cost than overnight RRPs, then that sort of argument is moot.	92	9
201501	3368	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Well, I would question that.	92	9
201501	3369	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	But even if you grant that, it seems hard to swallow that the difference in monetary cost between a few basis points is going to be material to the Committee in that situation, given what we’re thinking about.	92	9
201501	3370	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	President Lacker, maybe we can flip it a little bit.	92	9
201501	3371	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	If we can get a lot of substitution at or just a little bit above the overnight RRP rate, then we’re not really disturbing the term rates that you’re talking about.	92	9
201501	3372	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	If, to get that substitution, we really have to jack it up over the overnight RRP rate, then we are affecting other term markets indirectly.	92	9
201501	3373	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	But how do you know that?	92	9
201501	3374	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	That depends on what those other term markets are, not where the one-week is relative to the overnight.	92	9
201501	3375	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	That depends on how other term rates move, right?	92	9
201501	3376	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	It does, and we would expect in the configuration rates that we have that they would be quite a bit above the overnight RRP rate, because we are setting that at the bottom of the range.	92	9
201501	3377	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	That’s unpersuasive.	92	9
201501	3378	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	92	9
201501	3379	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I don’t want to belabor this point, but, again, just thinking as a practitioner, and given the fact that we want to have as many “bullets in our holster” as possible, if this helps inform the Desk and helps them, as I said earlier, “get their muscle tone,” these are small exercises.	92	9
201501	3380	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I don’t see why we would not—it’s really a question of, is this a useful exercise from the standpoint of a practitioner?	92	9
201501	3381	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	We don’t want to muck this thing up.	92	9
201501	3382	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	You can debate this from that standpoint, President Lacker, I’m sympathetic, but it’s really giving them the tools that they need to execute the policy this Committee instructs them to do.	92	9
201501	3383	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	That’s the way I would look at it.	92	9
201501	3384	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Now, if I could, Madam Chair, I respectfully disagree.	92	9
201501	3385	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	They have testing platforms.	92	9
201501	3386	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	They can run their own auctions internally; they can run their own simulated auctions.	92	9
201501	3387	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I’ve seen them do this.	92	9
201501	3388	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I’ve participated in things like this.	92	9
201501	3389	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	They’ve got plenty of muscle tone.	92	9
201501	3390	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	They are a well-exercised crew, a very professional crew.	92	9
201501	3391	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	They do an excellent job of executing on these things.	92	9
201501	3392	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	They know what they’re doing.	92	9
201501	3393	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I’m highly confident they don’t need more market practice.	92	9
201501	3394	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	The broad concern here, I think, ought to be that we have seen that the more testing we do, the more market participants think these are going to be permanent features of the financial landscape.	92	9
201501	3395	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	As well as we try to communicate that these are only tests, for some reason market expectations run ahead of the Committee’s intended communication that these are just temporary tests of a facility.	92	9
201501	3396	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	The financial-stability concern has always struck me as baffling.	92	9
201501	3397	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	The idea is that there are runs out there that are being prevented now only because of a lack of an overnight RRP facility that people would be attracted to putting their money into.	92	9
201501	3398	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	We would have had more runs in 2008 if we had an overnight RRP facility available for people to run to.	92	9
201501	3399	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think that’s the argument.	92	9
201501	3400	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Well, then, explain it to me.	92	9
201501	3401	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the argument is more that if you have a facility that is an elastic facility, it can cause private-sector rates to go up by more.	92	9
201501	3402	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	In the old regime, you had a fixed supply of the safe asset.	92	9
201501	3403	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	When the demand for that asset increased, that caused the rate on that asset to fall dramatically.	92	9
201501	3404	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If you have an elastic facility, the price doesn’t fall, and that pushes up private-sector yields by more.	92	9
201501	3405	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think there is a fundamental difference in terms of having an elastic facility.	92	9
201501	3406	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	I think it’s not the probability of the run.	92	9
201501	3407	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	It’s if a run starts, if you have something like this imperfectly elastic supply, it can make the effect of that run on the real economy worse.	92	9
201501	3408	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	That’s why we really were trying to be careful in considering the cap and other issues.	92	9
201501	3409	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	But there are certain events that could happen in which you do get a run, and the existence of the overnight RRP facility would make the outcome worse for the real economy.	92	9
201501	3410	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s not the probability of the run that’s changing, it’s the consequence of the run.	92	9
201501	3411	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of financial market conditions, that’s the difference.	92	9
201501	3412	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	We’re talking about the interval of time between such a run and the time that the Federal Open Market Committee, using modern communications, is able to convene and execute an offsetting change in interest rate policy, which we generally do.	92	9
201501	3413	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	That seems, to me, like a fairly minor consideration.	92	9
201501	3414	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I think you’ve heard point and counterpoint, Madam Chair.	92	9
201501	3415	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201501	3416	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	We did have a show of hands on this yesterday, and the takeaway for me was that most people actually favor both kinds of testing.	92	9
201501	3417	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, there is no commitment at this point, President Lacker, to use term RRPs outside quarter-end as part of our program.	92	9
201501	3418	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	That’s certainly not something we have decided at all.	92	9
201501	3419	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	We are just looking to test it.	92	9
201501	3420	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	We need votes on both of these.	92	9
201501	3421	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest we start with a vote on option 1, to test term RRPs over March quarter-end.	92	9
201501	3422	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	All in favor, say “Aye.”	92	9
201501	3423	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[Chorus of ayes]	92	9
201501	3424	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Any opposed?	92	9
201501	3425	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Yes, I’m opposed.	92	9
201501	3426	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	For the March quarter-end?	92	9
201501	3427	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	92	9
201501	3428	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	This is versus option 2?	92	9
201501	3429	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	We’re going to take both separately.	92	9
201501	3430	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	We just voted on option 1.	92	9
201501	3431	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I add my vote to option 1.	92	9
201501	3432	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I apologize.	92	9
201501	3433	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201501	3434	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s go to option 2 now, which is to test the term RRPs in small operations in February and March.	92	9
201501	3435	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	All in favor?	92	9
201501	3436	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	92	9
201501	3437	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Any opposed?	92	9
201501	3438	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I’m opposed.	92	9
201501	3439	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I’m opposed.	92	9
201501	3440	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201501	3441	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think the Desk has authorization.	92	9
201501	3442	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I guess what you call option 2 includes both of these things, and we’ve approved both of them.	92	9
201501	3443	2015-01-28	meeting	LUECKE	Just to be clear, among voters it would be nine-to-one in favor of both.	92	9
201501	3444	2015-01-28	meeting	POTTER	We’ll have copies of the Desk’s statement available if you want to look at it.	92	9
201501	3445	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201501	3446	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Now we have got a lot of business to do this morning.	2	2
201501	3447	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Our next topic is timing of liftoff and pace of tightening, and I do think we’ll be talking really about the policy decisions we face in this round.	2	2
201501	3448	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	You remember we will also have to discuss our actual statement, but my guess and hope is that that discussion can be reasonably short because we’ll cover quite a bit of policy-related comments in this go-round.	2	2
201501	3449	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	2	2
201501	3450	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	If I can just ask a procedural question, in terms of how the minutes get constructed, in the past it’s been based on the discussion that takes place with regard to the alternatives.	2	2
201501	3451	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Is it possible that the policy discussion for the minutes would also be based on the liftoff discussion, and we wouldn’t have to repeat the same arguments?	2	2
201501	3452	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think so.	2	2
201501	3453	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	The plan is that, as has been the case on occasion in prior meetings, that there would be a separate summary of this coming go-round perhaps under a heading like “Policy Planning,” and that will, of course, summarize comments from participants.	2	2
201501	3454	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Yes, but in the paragraph that talks about how the Committee discussed the policy options in the past, as I understand the rules of the game, unless you actually made the argument during that commentary, it doesn’t necessarily get captured in the count.	2	2
201501	3455	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	You couldn’t simply say, “As I alluded to in the other discussion, there’s no need for me to repeat that.”	2	2
201501	3456	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	We’re doctrinaire, but we’re not that doctrinaire.	2	2
201501	3457	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	[Laughter]	2	2
201501	3458	2015-01-28	meeting	ENGLISH	If you say something for this go-round, we will include that in the summary of the policy discussion, as appropriate.	2	2
201501	3459	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Excellent.	2	2
201501	3460	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I can see great economies being achieved by that.	2	2
201501	3461	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Good question.	2	2
201501	3462	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I heard former Vice Chairman Don Kohn one time mention, “Well, one reason why I mention this laundry list here is because you have to say it.”	2	2
201501	3463	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to call on Ed Nelson to get us started off—to introduce this topic.	21	2
201501	3464	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21	2
201501	3465	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for Briefing on the Timing of Liftoff and the Pace of Tightening.”	21	2
201501	3466	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	Earlier this month, the staff distributed a packet of five memos that detailed how considerations related to monetary policy strategy might figure into policymakers’ decisions about the timing and pace of policy firming.	21	2
201501	3467	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	My remarks will distill some key messages from this material.	21	2
201501	3468	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	The first memo, by Mike Kiley, Dave Reifschneider, and myself, discusses various considerations that could influence your decisions regarding the timing and pace of adjustments to the policy stance in the period ahead.	21	2
201501	3469	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	As you know from Tealbook B, many simple interest rate rules, as well as optimal-control policy, call for an immediate policy firming.	21	2
201501	3470	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	However, research suggests that the overall trajectory of the federal funds rate expected by market participants is much more important for the behavior of real activity and inflation than is the precise choice of date at which to commence policy firming.	21	2
201501	3471	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	As the memo noted, alternative benchmark policies that incorporate inertia, such as the inertial Taylor (1999) rule and the optimal-control policy, imply a smaller initial tightening and a more gradual subsequent pace of tightening than do the noninertial Taylor (1993 and 1999) rules.	21	2
201501	3472	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	In simulations of the FRB/US model conditioned on the staff forecast, this gradual pace facilitates a more rapid return of inflation toward the 2 percent objective, in part because the policy allows the unemployment rate to run below the natural rate of unemployment for a time.	21	2
201501	3473	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	Another point highlighted in the memo is that your December SEP paths for the federal funds rate differ appreciably from the path implied by the noninertial Taylor (1999) rule.	21	2
201501	3474	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	These deviations, which diminish notably over the projection period, may suggest that you have a preference for interest rate smoothing.	21	2
201501	3475	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	Alternatively, they may indicate that your views concerning appropriate policy are influenced by factors that incline you to take a cautious approach to normalizing the stance of monetary policy.	21	2
201501	3476	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	For example, some of you may worry that the economy remains somewhat fragile, on the grounds that the pickup in economic growth is so recent, or you may fear that an adverse shock could prompt serious retrenchments in spending and hiring, with attendant financial instability.	21	2
201501	3477	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	Containing these risks might be a particular concern for the Committee because the effective lower bound on policy rates and the already-elevated size of the balance sheet could limit the Federal Reserve’s flexibility in responding to negative shocks.	21	2
201501	3478	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	In addition, some of you may see potential advantages to allowing the unemployment rate to undershoot estimates of the natural rate for a time; these advantages might include speeding the return to 2 percent inflation, or the opportunity to explore whether some portion of the recent supply-side damage can be reversed.	21	2
201501	3479	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	As the memo also notes, however, adopting a cautious approach to tightening could be costly if taken too far, because it could generate an undesirably large increase in inflation or undermine financial stability.	21	2
201501	3480	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	Another memo to the Committee, from de Groot, Gagnon, and Tetlow, considers evidence from stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model of two alternative policy strategies:  an “earlier and gradual” firming strategy and a “later and steep” strategy.	21	2
201501	3481	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	The authors find that—provided that the data-dependent nature of Federal Reserve policy is well understood by the private sector—the choice between the two strategies is not of crucial importance, as measured by a policymaker loss function, under most scenarios.	21	2
201501	3482	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	Each strategy is associated with prospective costs: An earlier-and-gradual strategy entails a higher probability of returning to the effective lower bound, while a later-and-steep strategy raises the probability that policymakers might have to raise the federal funds rate very rapidly.	21	2
201501	3483	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	Two staff memos discuss what can be learned from prior tightening episodes.	21	2
201501	3484	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	One of these memos, by Meade, Nozawa, Petrasek, and Zickler, discusses FOMC deliberations that occurred around the initial tightening of monetary policy in 1994, 1999, and 2004.	21	2
201501	3485	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	It shows that, in all cases, the decisions to tighten monetary policy were data dependent and forward looking.	21	2
201501	3486	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	Expansion of the Federal Reserve’s communications tools likely left financial markets better prepared for policy firming in 1999 and 2004 than they were in 1994, when the market reaction to the initial tightening was sizable.	21	2
201501	3487	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	The second of these memos, by De Michelis, De Pooter, and Wood, reviews the international experience with raising policy rates from the effective lower bound.	21	2
201501	3488	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	Central banks differed in the precise manner in which they signaled their intention to transition from the effective-lower-bound policy; however, a common feature was that they provided broad guidance about the time frame or economic conditions in which policy firming would commence.	21	2
201501	3489	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	In all cases, regardless of communications strategy, policy firming did not prove disruptive to financial markets.	21	2
201501	3490	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	In addition, no case was found in which policy firming was too late or otherwise insufficient.	21	2
201501	3491	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	Among the episodes considered, Japan in 2000 and Sweden in 2010 provide possible instances in which the tightening was premature or excessive, perhaps because policymakers gave undue weight to factors other than inflation and economic activity when making their decisions to raise rates.	21	2
201501	3492	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	In both of these instances, policy firming was subsequently reversed and the policy rate returned to the effective lower bound.	21	2
201501	3493	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	Canada, in contrast, had a more orderly experience when it tightened policy starting in 2010, perhaps because the firming was gradual and was closely keyed to macroeconomic conditions.	21	2
201501	3494	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	Focusing specifically on communications, the memo by English, Laubach, and Reeve offers language—reproduced on the third and fourth pages of your handout— that the Committee might consider employing in policy statements as it approaches and reaches the time at which policy firming is commenced.	21	2
201501	3495	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	In addition, the final section of my memo with Kiley and Reifschneider noted two points that the Committee might wish to highlight in speeches, testimony, and other forums: One:  Once firming commences, the federal funds rate will not follow a predetermined trajectory; instead, all adjustments will be data dependent.	21	2
201501	3496	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	Two:  Real activity could turn out to be stronger and inflation higher than expected, implying that policy would need to tighten more rapidly than envisioned in the SEP paths.	21	2
201501	3497	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	Conversely, conditions could turn out to be weaker, making it appropriate to tighten more slowly or even to reverse course.	21	2
201501	3498	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	Furthermore, policymakers might come to a consensus that special considerations—for example, a desire to lower the likelihood that the Committee would need to return to the effective lower bound—were playing an important role in its deliberations.	21	2
201501	3499	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	If so, the Committee might wish to describe these considerations in its policy communications.	21	2
201501	3500	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	Along with the memos, the staff distributed a few questions that you may wish to address in your comments during today’s go-round.	21	2
201501	3501	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	For your convenience, these questions are repeated on the last page of your handout.	21	2
201501	3502	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	Thank you, and I would be happy to take any questions you might have.	21	2
201501	3503	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions?	22	2
201501	3504	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	22	2
201501	3505	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	3506	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	These memos are excellent, and I enjoyed reading them and found them very interesting.	22	2
201501	3507	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	One of the things that I think is important about the set of the memos is it begins to talk about monetary policy as a path, and that’s the way it affects the economy.	22	2
201501	3508	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I applaud that.	22	2
201501	3509	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	One of the things that we do in our current statement is to repeat over and over again the fact that we believe that our large balance sheet continues to provide accommodation to the economy in one form or another, and that, in particular, it’s presumably keeping financial conditions or interest rates at the longer term lower than they might otherwise be.	22	2
201501	3510	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	If I think about accommodation and I think about calibrating the stance of policy going forward, how do I take into account, or how should the Committee think about, the existence of a large balance sheet and the way it perhaps—may or may not, depending on the staff’s views—influences how we calibrate the pace of tightening or the level of tightening at any point in time?	22	2
201501	3511	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	How do these two things interact, and how should we think about them?	22	2
201501	3512	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	Well, the elevated balance sheet, by providing stimulus, makes conditions more favorable for economic expansion and for inflation to return to 2 percent than otherwise, and in that sense it’s a conditioning factor in the decisions concerning the target range for the federal funds rate.	22	2
201501	3513	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	That’s one way of thinking about how that separate monetary policy instrument fits into the overall strategy.	22	2
201501	3514	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	That means we should think about a policy path that looks higher or lower or unchanged, depending on the size of the balance sheet?	22	2
201501	3515	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	If I may, for just a second, one way that we tried to reflect that in the baseline projection is that we built in an assessment of the influence of the portfolio on the term premium of longer-term interest rates.	22	2
201501	3516	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Eric Engstrom and his colleagues attempt to calibrate the effect of the size of the portfolio on the time profile of longer-term interest rates, and that’s providing a separate influence on financial conditions aside from the funds rate.	22	2
201501	3517	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	In the baseline projection, we treat the funds rate as the active tool of monetary policy that’s governed by the monetary policy rule, but in the background, under the set of conditions that are specified in Tealbook B, the size of the portfolio is evolving, is melting away, and with that the downward pressure on term premiums is diminishing as well.	22	2
201501	3518	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	That may go part way toward providing some help on the question.	22	2
201501	3519	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	But if I, as a policymaker, were trying to think about how do I set the right level of the interest rate path—steeper, higher, lower—I’m a little bit confused about how I think about the effect of the balance sheet.	22	2
201501	3520	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Unless I’m just going to follow a rule and we’re going be done with it, we’re going to make some arguments about why we think the path ought to be lower or higher than it otherwise might choose to be.	22	2
201501	3521	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m trying to figure out how I think about that as a policymaker to determine whether I like one path versus another.	22	2
201501	3522	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	I can’t answer that because I don’t know your preferences, but the way in which we tried to lay it out for you is to give you a prospective view of how we think resource utilization is going to evolve and how inflation will evolve conditioned on both dimensions of monetary policy.	22	2
201501	3523	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	You say the balance sheet is given.	22	2
201501	3524	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Its effect on the economy is given, predetermined in your baseline.	22	2
201501	3525	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Sure, it’s given in the same sense that the funds rate trajectory is given.	22	2
201501	3526	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	We’re trying to give you something that’s internally consistent in a sort of general-equilibrium sense, in which the economy, the portfolio, and the funds rate path all go together, and you ultimately need to make the judgment about whether you prefer a more accommodative stance relative to that benchmark that we try to give.	22	2
201501	3527	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Could I choose something different that said maybe the balance sheet goes down faster?	22	2
201501	3528	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Sure.	22	2
201501	3529	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	My choice of the funds rate in that equilibrium would go up less?	22	2
201501	3530	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Absolutely.	22	2
201501	3531	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	But we don’t really know, at the margin, how much difference that would make.	22	2
201501	3532	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I guess that’s kind of where I was coming from.	22	2
201501	3533	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	22	2
201501	3534	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	22	2
201501	3535	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	3536	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I apologize to President Plosser, but I felt that over the years he’s made his positions on policy quite clear.	22	2
201501	3537	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	22	2
201501	3538	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I didn’t realize that David was confused by that, but that’s okay.	22	2
201501	3539	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m going to pick up on the same line of questioning as President Plosser.	22	2
201501	3540	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I find that I understand the treatment of asset purchases, as David Wilcox and Ed Nelson have explained, in the optimal-control exercises.	22	2
201501	3541	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I find it more difficult to understand in the Taylor rule formulations.	22	2
201501	3542	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It would seem to me that the rule is supposed to be dictating where the level of policy is relative to some kind of steady-state normal, and that should include asset purchases as being part of that abnormal provision of stimulus.	22	2
201501	3543	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	When I read the memos and was remarking on, “Boy, we’re more accommodative than noninertial Taylor (1999) rule,”	22	2
201501	3544	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought, well, we’re actually a lot more accommodative because we’ve got all these asset purchases in there as well providing stimulus.	22	2
201501	3545	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I didn’t find the framing of the policy decisions of the Committee in terms of noninertial Taylor (1999) rule as compelling because I just think that we’re much more accommodative because of the inclusion of asset purchases.	22	2
201501	3546	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think Thomas has something he wants to say, but, first, I have one small point on the financial-stability issue.	22	2
201501	3547	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it’s right to be thinking about how accommodative policy can lead to the risk of financial instability, and I encourage us to be doing that.	22	2
201501	3548	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It is also important, though, to keep in mind, as the memos point out, that tightening too early can also lead to financial instability, and there are the risks associated with that as well.	22	2
201501	3549	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The memos are very clear on that.	22	2
201501	3550	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it’s important for us as a Committee to keep that in mind.	22	2
201501	3551	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	May I quickly respond to President Kocherlakota?	22	2
201501	3552	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	I’m a little afraid that what you laid out might sound a little bit like double counting.	22	2
201501	3553	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	The way that monetary policy transmission largely works both in the staff projection and in the FRB/US model is through longer-term interest rates.	22	2
201501	3554	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Now, that’s how the term-premium effects that we are still assuming, and that are shown toward the end of Tealbook B, figure in.	22	2
201501	3555	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	For any given path for the federal funds rate, current and future, longer-term interest rates do reflect these term premiums.	22	2
201501	3556	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Insofar as the rule mechanically responds to current conditions, these current conditions will be stronger simply because longer-term interest rates are lower than they would be for the same path of the short-term rate if the balance sheet didn’t continue to exert downward pressure on term premiums.	22	2
201501	3557	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	One way of putting it is, the right-hand side of the Taylor rule includes variables that respond to the LSAPs because of the endogeneity of output and inflation.	22	2
201501	3558	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	In a sense, it’s allowing for the presence of an elevated balance sheet.	22	2
201501	3559	2015-01-28	meeting	NELSON	This is an issue that was covered at great length in staff memos a few years ago in response to your input.	22	2
201501	3560	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I feel we are retracing ground that we covered at that time.	22	2
201501	3561	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I am not sure we will make much progress in convincing each other of our views.	22	2
201501	3562	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	22	2
201501	3563	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	22	2
201501	3564	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	3565	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	On this topic, there’s a completely different way to characterize accommodative policy.	22	2
201501	3566	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	You can do it with regard to whether we’re achieving our goals in an environment in which the unemployment rate is still higher than the natural rate and inflation over the forecast is underrunning our goal.	22	2
201501	3567	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	You could say it’s not really accommodative enough.	22	2
201501	3568	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	But at any rate, I have a question about the proposed statement on page 2.	22	2
201501	3569	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	The proposed paragraph 3 includes the phrase:  “Based on its current assessment, the Committee judges that economic conditions,” et cetera, et cetera.	22	2
201501	3570	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	My question basically is whether this an unusual usage of this phrase because it’s singular, as if there’s only one assessment of the Committee.	22	2
201501	3571	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	It strikes me that that’s not unusual at a point when we are making a decision to change policy, like taking an action to change the funds rate.	22	2
201501	3572	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	But when we’re contemplating a future action in a couple of meetings and we say “the Committee’s assessment,”	22	2
201501	3573	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I’m wondering, how narrow this is?	22	2
201501	3574	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	If you don’t quite agree with that assessment, then you’re going to get into discussions about the appropriate conditionality.	22	2
201501	3575	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	But it strikes me that, because of the future aspect of this, it would be better to somehow try to characterize the likelihood of that assessment or to use something slightly more probabilistic, the central tendency of that.	22	2
201501	3576	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I guess my question is, doesn’t this sound a little unusual in its current usage?	22	2
201501	3577	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	It led me to add a different modifier in my own formulation.	22	2
201501	3578	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	I think the probabilistic aspect of this judgment of a couple of meetings or possibly more ahead is intended to be conveyed through the “may” or “could potentially.”	22	2
201501	3579	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	But I will make no bones about the fact that we struggled long and hard to convey just the right sense of the probabilistic nature of the assessment.	22	2
201501	3580	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Obviously, it would be great to have a better way of doing it.	22	2
201501	3581	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I know it’s wordy, but if you were to say “median assessment” or “central forecast of the Committee,” or something that indicates there’s some element of a range, however narrow that may be.	22	2
201501	3582	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	It seems to me that would augment the ability to achieve a stronger consensus at an early stage of our planning.	22	2
201501	3583	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	That’s very useful.	22	2
201501	3584	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks.	22	2
201501	3585	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer, did you have a comment?	22	2
201501	3586	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Yes, just two small points.	22	2
201501	3587	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I think that the Swedes raised the interest rate in 2010 primarily for financial-stability reasons—they were scared about what was happening to housing prices—and they had to backtrack from that later.	22	2
201501	3588	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t know if there’s a lesson there, because we don’t have a large sample.	22	2
201501	3589	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	David, a question.	22	2
201501	3590	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	If the place in which we reflect the size of the balance sheet, which is an issue we’re going to talk about at great length during the next couple of years, is all reflected in the term premium, can’t you do simulations with the premium effect and without the premium effect and with a smaller premium effect and tell us what the effect of reducing the size of the balance sheet would be at given policy interest rates?	22	2
201501	3591	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	I can’t think of a reason why not, off the top of my head.	22	2
201501	3592	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	We ought to be able to do that.	22	2
201501	3593	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	It’s very closely related to the studies concerning the efficacy of asset purchases that we’ve done in the past because, in effective, those memos also contemplated the macroeconomic effects of varying the size of the balance sheet.	22	2
201501	3594	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t think that’s a controversial proposition, and I guess I’d like to just be absolutely clear that I think what Thomas was saying was entirely consistent.	22	2
201501	3595	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t know whether you meant to be making a different point than I did.	22	2
201501	3596	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	No, no.	22	2
201501	3597	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	I think Thomas’s views and mine, as just articulated, are exactly in alignment about the role that the SOMA portfolio plays, through the size of the term premium effect, and how that wears away in the projection.	22	2
201501	3598	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks.	22	2
201501	3599	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	22	2
201501	3600	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Two things related to Governor Fischer’s comments.	22	2
201501	3601	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	First, if you do that and if you devote any effort to measures of uncertainty surrounding those projections, I’d urge you to take seriously uncertainty about the marginal effect of our balance sheet on the term premium.	22	2
201501	3602	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I think in the current circumstances, for the issues President Plosser and Governor Fischer discussed, if we’re thinking about the effect of the balance sheet, it strikes me that the uncertainty about that is far larger than our uncertainty about other aspects of your policy framework on the effect of short-term interest rates on the economy.	22	2
201501	3603	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Yes.	22	2
201501	3604	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Let me venture a hypothesis, which is a bit risky.	22	2
201501	3605	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	One limit on our ability to perform this kind of analysis is that our structure is maybe not literally linear, but is pretty close to linear, and, for example, in optimal control, the preferences are literally quadratic.	22	2
201501	3606	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	The size of the portfolio and the funds rate—and I’m going to look around the room hoping for some confirmation or contradiction—are going to act as if they’re policy substitutes in your portfolio.	22	2
201501	3607	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Because of this way in which we put the projection together, you could get roughly—I don’t know whether this would be literally true down to the basis point—the same economic outcome by having a smaller portfolio and a more accommodative trajectory for the funds rate path in a way that would be designed to generate, roughly speaking, the same trajectory for longer-term interest rates.	22	2
201501	3608	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Now, that won’t be literally true, because I suspect there are some corners of the projection in which short-term interest rates matter separately, but those two instruments are going to be substitutes for policy tools.	22	2
201501	3609	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	So it’s been our view that, just for simplicity, we’d reduce a two-dimensional situation down to one and give you the choice laid out on the funds-rate dimension alone, given an approach that we thought featured a relatively passive stance with respect to the way that the portfolio would be run off.	22	2
201501	3610	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Would the terms of trade in that substitution—	22	2
201501	3611	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Would be linear.	22	2
201501	3612	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	But it would depend critically on the marginal effect of a given balance sheet on the term premium, right?	22	2
201501	3613	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Correct.	22	2
201501	3614	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	If that was like an order of magnitude smaller than sort of your standard workforce estimate, that could change the terms of trade fairly dramatically.	22	2
201501	3615	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Yes.	22	2
201501	3616	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I would suspect.	22	2
201501	3617	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	I would suspect so, too.	22	2
201501	3618	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Right.	22	2
201501	3619	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I’m saying if you undertake any efforts to provide estimates of uncertainty surrounding your estimates of the effect of policy on different simulations, include this source of uncertainty because it strikes me as consequential.	22	2
201501	3620	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	Dave Reifschneider, I don’t know if you want to add something.	22	2
201501	3621	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	Thomas is gesturing to me.	22	2
201501	3622	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	I’m not quite sure what he wants me to say here.	22	2
201501	3623	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	[Laughter]	22	2
201501	3624	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	A plea for help.	22	2
201501	3625	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Something supportive.	22	2
201501	3626	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	I would say two things.	22	2
201501	3627	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	First of all, the assumptions on the term-premium effects and, more generally, what will be done to the portfolio in the future are based on your actions.	22	2
201501	3628	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	You released guidance about what you intend to do with the portfolio, and basically the forecast of its effects on term premiums is just taken from that statement from the Committee.	22	2
201501	3629	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Wait, wait.	22	2
201501	3630	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Did we make a statement about the effects on term premiums?	22	2
201501	3631	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	No.	22	2
201501	3632	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	You made a statement about what the plan was for the portfolio.	22	2
201501	3633	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Right.	22	2
201501	3634	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	The analysis of the term premium effects that the staff has done is printed in the back of Tealbook B.	22	2
201501	3635	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	As David said, that basically predetermined path of the effect on term premiums on the portfolio is rolled through the forecasting apparatus and treated as what I’ll call it a passive policy lever to get the forecast.	22	2
201501	3636	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	Now, if, as Governor Fischer was suggesting, the Committee wants to explore alternative paths, you can apply different term premiums to the portfolio, and then we would run the forecasting machinery again.	22	2
201501	3637	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	In addition to that, which I think maybe is why Thomas was gesturing at me, there’s a paper that he and I recently coauthored—	22	2
201501	3638	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Why didn’t he talk?	22	2
201501	3639	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	I don’t know.	22	2
201501	3640	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	[Laughter]	22	2
201501	3641	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	—with Eric Engen, in which we looked at the effectiveness of the Committee’s forward guidance and the asset purchases taken together.	22	2
201501	3642	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	One of the things we did in that paper was to explore a range of possibilities for the effectiveness of the policies, and it ranges from having moderate effects—that’s our baseline estimate—to having more substantial effects and to having quite small effects.	22	2
201501	3643	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	If the Committee wants, we could do different assumptions that show how much uncertainty they could have on the outlook.	22	2
201501	3644	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Great.	22	2
201501	3645	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	But I should say that we did the analysis looking back.	22	2
201501	3646	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	To go ahead and do it in terms of what these alternative assumptions would mean for future conditions is starting the exercise up again, and it would not be a simple undertaking.	22	2
201501	3647	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	To do what we did in the paper, we would need to decide what signal the market takes from your changes in the portfolio for your overall stance of policy, including the funds rate, as you go forward, and that decision would have a major effect on what the potential macroeconomic implications would be.	22	2
201501	3648	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	In our study, we were able to use Blue Chip survey data and other things like that to get an estimate of what the market reaction actually was.	22	2
201501	3649	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	With regard to future actions, assessing what the market reaction would be pure speculation—well, maybe not pure; I mean, the Desk would have opinions about how it might go.	22	2
201501	3650	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	But we wouldn’t know with any certainty whatsoever what those market expectations would be.	22	2
201501	3651	2015-01-28	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	Having to talk about what it might be in the future, as opposed to analyzing what it appears to have been over the past six years, makes it a much, much more difficult project.	22	2
201501	3652	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Got it.	22	2
201501	3653	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	The second thing, very briefly, about Sweden.	22	2
201501	3654	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I took the juxtaposition of what you described about Canada and Sweden to mean that the criticism you raised about Sweden is that they continued to raise rates after they lifted off, not that they lifted off at all.	22	2
201501	3655	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Is that correct?	22	2
201501	3656	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Yes, that’s right.	22	2
201501	3657	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	If you take a look at various considerations that were present in Sweden around the time of their liftoff in 2010, GDP growth was picking up, and inflation was near the measure that they looked at.	22	2
201501	3658	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	The Taylor rule was starting to move up.	22	2
201501	3659	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	Reasonable people could differ, but it seemed like it wasn’t a terrible time to lift off.	22	2
201501	3660	2015-01-28	meeting	KAMIN	I think the issue was that they kept on boosting the rate even as the euro crisis started to get worse and core inflation started to fall.	22	2
201501	3661	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	22	2
201501	3662	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	This is just an obvious “connect the dots,” but it would be useful to see an analysis of the extent to which we think we actually do have two separate instruments, especially in view this potential conundrum that we might see out there in which we’re talking about raising short-term rates but we’re not seeing corresponding moves in the long end of the yield curve.	22	2
201501	3663	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I don’t know where it would lead us, and I say this with some trepidation, but I think it’s worth having some analysis of this question.	22	2
201501	3664	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	We’ll take a look at that.	22	2
201501	3665	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	I fear that, due to the limits of our knowledge, we’re not going to be able to give you an interesting answer because, for example, coming back to Jeff’s question, if the size of the portfolio has a smaller effect on the term premium, and the policymaker recognizes that, the policymaker is going to say, “Gee, with a stronger portfolio effect, I need to run a more accommodative funds rate policy in order to get the kind of real economic outcomes and inflation outcomes that I have in mind.”	22	2
201501	3666	2015-01-28	meeting	WILCOX	That’s the sense in which we treat these two policy instruments as linearly substitutable.	22	2
201501	3667	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	But, David, it might be interesting to look at how a different shape of the yield curve affects the economy, because you could have the same stance with regard to financial-market conditions but with different yield curves under the two regimes.	22	2
201501	3668	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	It would just be interesting to know what it would mean to have a lower funds rate and a steeper yield curve versus a higher funds rate a flatter yield curve.	22	2
201501	3669	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that would just be sort of interesting to look at.	22	2
201501	3670	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	If the marginal effect is much smaller, one must reinterpret history.	22	2
201501	3671	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	You appreciate that, I’m sure.	22	2
201501	3672	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	Perhaps just one small point on this.	22	2
201501	3673	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	As David highlighted, from the perspective of our models, these tools are very close substitutes.	22	2
201501	3674	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	But you might look at, for example, the taper tantrum as an episode in which actually market participants may have not understood them to be that way, but in which they thought that they were complements to the extent that they thought that the communications about asset purchases actually also conveyed information about the path for the short-term interest rates.	22	2
201501	3675	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	That’s hard for us to do.	22	2
201501	3676	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	I mean, we can make ad hoc illustrative assumptions, but that’s basically all we can do.	22	2
201501	3677	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	22	2
201501	3678	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s begin the go-round.	22	2
201501	3679	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	We have quite a bit of time pressure, so I think we should get started.	22	2
201501	3680	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let me call on President Lockhart.	22	2
201501	3681	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	3682	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I expect conditions will make liftoff in 2015 appropriate.	22	2
201501	3683	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	But, in that context, I have a strong preference for erring on the side of waiting a little longer rather than taking the risks of moving prematurely.	22	2
201501	3684	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I am assuming that the sequence of actions will be a signaling decision two, possibly one, meeting ahead of liftoff involving a change of statement language, an intervening meeting statement in the case of two meetings ahead that reinforces the high likelihood of a liftoff decision at the next meeting, and then the decision.	22	2
201501	3685	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m comfortable with this approach.	22	2
201501	3686	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I do not have great confidence that the Committee can preserve a lot of flexibility once the signaling decision has been made and communicated, unless there is a development that is obvious justification for pushing the pause button.	22	2
201501	3687	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I view liftoff as close to a fait accompli once the signal is given.	22	2
201501	3688	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Therefore, from a timing standpoint, I think the right question is how to weigh the risks of signaling liftoff prematurely versus the risks of waiting.	22	2
201501	3689	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I think an earlier signal would entail significant risks if the context of that decision is one of little or no evidence of inflation moving back to target, accompanied by a mixed data picture and higher-than-normal uncertainty.	22	2
201501	3690	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I would also adjust the second question to, what developments do I need to see in the data in order to be willing to signal that a liftoff decision is coming in, say, 90 days?	22	2
201501	3691	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I am prepared to take the first liftoff step in the absence of clearly affirmative evidence on inflation, as long as there is not a troubling accumulation of contrary evidence.	22	2
201501	3692	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	While that is a minimalist take on data dependency, I am comfortable with this approach, in light of the current apparent strength of the real economy.	22	2
201501	3693	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	But I can imagine a framework of affirmative evidence—call this my ideal framework.	22	2
201501	3694	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Ideally, I’d like to see core inflation readings moving above 1½ percent.	22	2
201501	3695	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I don’t think a “run rate” of core inflation below 1½ percent is confidence-inspiring.	22	2
201501	3696	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Ideally, I’d like to see nominal wage growth increasing according to most measures of labor compensation.	22	2
201501	3697	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	And, ideally, I’d like to see clearly anchored inflation expectations.	22	2
201501	3698	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I would characterize those criteria as affirmative evidence.	22	2
201501	3699	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	As I said, I won’t hold out for that degree of data dependency.	22	2
201501	3700	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	At a minimum, I’d like to see evidence that the transitory effect of energy-related prices is dissipating.	22	2
201501	3701	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m concerned that it would be bad “optics” to signal rate increases in the midst of a string of headline inflation reports that are moving away from our longer-term objective.	22	2
201501	3702	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I’d like to see evidence of a reversal of the recent disinflation trend seen in core inflation and less ambiguous readings on inflation expectations.	22	2
201501	3703	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Now, I can imagine real-economy developments that might substantially mitigate my concerns about incoming inflation data.	22	2
201501	3704	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Data that indicate significant overshoot of my baseline expectations for GDP and jobs growth would bolster my confidence that inflation is very likely to move in the desired direction.	22	2
201501	3705	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	But I emphasize the word “significant” in that qualification.	22	2
201501	3706	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	As regards the evolution of statement language, I support the general approach suggested in the staff memo.	22	2
201501	3707	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	However, I view the phrase “couple of meetings” as a bit clunky, because it’s open to loose or strict interpretation when it’s first used.	22	2
201501	3708	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Even if in casual usage the expression can mean an indefinite small number, I think it will be taken to mean two meetings.	22	2
201501	3709	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I think the bar for not following through once we make the language change should, and will, be very high.	22	2
201501	3710	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	If we want the signaling statement to preserve flexibility and remain true to data dependence, I’d prefer something like “economic conditions might” or “could soon warrant” or “may” or “could warrant an increase in one of the coming meetings.”	22	2
201501	3711	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	If that’s too coy, and the Committee wants to signal the next meeting or the following, I’d prefer saying, “Economic conditions are likely to warrant a target change at one of the next couple of meetings.”	22	2
201501	3712	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	In that case, keeping “couple of meetings”	22	2
201501	3713	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I would view is okay.	22	2
201501	3714	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Finally, I do not favor dropping the “balanced approach” language in our statements.	22	2
201501	3715	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Concerns about the combination of high unemployment and high inflation have diminished, but that concern has been replaced, in my thinking, with a significant concern about a combination of unemployment below its full-employment rate and inflation well below target.	22	2
201501	3716	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I think it’s quite possible we will still face some tension in our dual mandate, so I would keep the “balanced approach” language.	22	2
201501	3717	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	3718	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	22	2
201501	3719	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	22	2
201501	3720	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	3721	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	My comments are quite consistent with President Lockhart’s.	22	2
201501	3722	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’m going to answer each of the three questions that was posed to us.	22	2
201501	3723	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	For question 1, the risks at liftoff remain asymmetric.	22	2
201501	3724	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	We have the ability to raise short- term rates more quickly, but we do not have the ability to reduce short-term rates below the zero bound.	22	2
201501	3725	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, as long as we are limited in our ability to offset negative shocks, and given my view that the risks of negative shocks from abroad are elevated, I would rather wait longer and, if needed, tighten faster should we have underestimated how quickly we would reach both elements of our dual mandate.	22	2
201501	3726	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	The global disinflation in developed economies adds further to the risks of significantly undershooting our inflation goal—the one goal for which we set an explicit target.	22	2
201501	3727	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	In terms of question 2, I agree with the Chair’s assessment that, before we lift off, we need to be reasonably confident that inflation will be moving up over time.	22	2
201501	3728	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Being reasonably confident would require that we have tangible evidence that wages and/or prices are moving in a way to ensure reaching our 2 percent goal for inflation within a reasonable horizon.	22	2
201501	3729	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, I would be careful not to rely too much on forecasts based on models that have been consistently overly optimistic about our return to our inflation goal, nor am I comforted that inflation surveys are not falling when a wide variety of market indicators are signaling disinflationary concerns and have been doing so since October despite tightening labor markets.	22	2
201501	3730	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would be uncomfortable removing accommodation before we see core inflation rising rather than falling, or strong evidence in disaggregated wage and price data that tighter labor markets are starting to move wages and prices in a way consistent with reaching our inflation goal within a two-year time frame.	22	2
201501	3731	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	In terms of question 3, given the uncertainty about both global markets and the uncertainty surrounding our inflation forecast, I would not constrain the Committee to provide a two-meeting warning prior to our liftoff.	22	2
201501	3732	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	We have already telegraphed that liftoff is quite possible this year.	22	2
201501	3733	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	My preference would be to drop the “patient” language the meeting before we expect to liftoff, and to say, “An increase in the federal funds target will likely be warranted soon, if economic conditions continue to improve.”	22	2
201501	3734	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I agree with President Lockhart that we should not try to overcalibrate our communication strategy.	22	2
201501	3735	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	3736	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	22	2
201501	3737	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	22	2
201501	3738	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Thank you.	22	2
201501	3739	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I guess, as Monty Python would say, “And now for something completely different.”	22	2
201501	3740	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	[Laughter]	22	2
201501	3741	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I’m going to address each of the questions posed to the Committee.	22	2
201501	3742	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Regarding how the FOMC should weigh the risk of lifting off too soon versus the risk of waiting too long, with economic growth strengthening, full employment approaching, inflation expected to move gradually back to target, and our policy rate at zero, I believe we may be underestimating the costs of moving too slowly.	22	2
201501	3743	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	The analysis in one of the staff memos that uses the FRB/US model indicates that there are similar macroeconomic outcomes associated with following either an early gradual policy path or a later steep path.	22	2
201501	3744	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I’m a firm proponent of using models to inform our policy decisions.	22	2
201501	3745	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	But while our typical models may give us a reasonably accurate sense of the costs of lifting off too soon, they may not accurately reflect all the costs of waiting too long.	22	2
201501	3746	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	If we lift off too soon, we’ll encounter employment and inflation costs that standard models reasonably capture.	22	2
201501	3747	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Although the zero lower bound may exacerbate these costs, our models are sophisticated enough to provide some help in judging these costs.	22	2
201501	3748	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	If we wait too long to lift off, there may be benefits from avoiding future episodes of the zero lower bound—benefits that the model captures.	22	2
201501	3749	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	But there are other potential costs, including the risks to financial stability of holding rates at zero for a long time.	22	2
201501	3750	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Our models aren’t sophisticated enough to allow us to calibrate those costs and risks, yet we know from the crisis that the costs can be severe.	22	2
201501	3751	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	In addition, there may be value in initially moving rates up gradually.	22	2
201501	3752	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Although we believe we have the tools, we have not yet raised rates from the zero lower bound with a large balance sheet.	22	2
201501	3753	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I would like to gain some experience when we are in a position to raise rates gradually rather than when we feel compelled to move rates up quickly.	22	2
201501	3754	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Although the Committee has been appropriately cautious up to now, I’m less concerned, in view of the strength of the economy, that the start of liftoff will negatively affect the expansion.	22	2
201501	3755	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Monetary policy will still be highly accommodative after the first rate increase.	22	2
201501	3756	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	That’s not to say that after we start raising rates we will necessarily continue on a predetermined path up.	22	2
201501	3757	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	The future is always uncertain; negative shocks can hit the economy at any time.	22	2
201501	3758	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	If incoming economic information materially changes our outlook, we would change our policy.	22	2
201501	3759	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	We may want to slow down the path of rate increases; we may want to reverse course.	22	2
201501	3760	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	But that’s what a data-dependent central banker is supposed to do.	22	2
201501	3761	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I don’t see that as a problem.	22	2
201501	3762	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Regarding what developments I would need to see to be more or less confident that inflation would move back to 2 percent over time, first, economic research shows that it is very difficult to forecast inflation.	22	2
201501	3763	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Even in normal times, our inflation forecasts aren’t very precise.	22	2
201501	3764	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	The confidence bands around the forecast are wide.	22	2
201501	3765	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Under today’s unusual circumstances, I don’t think it’s appropriate to require a higher-than-normal degree of precision regarding the forecast.	22	2
201501	3766	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I am reasonably comfortable with the forecast that inflation will gradually move back up to 2 percent.	22	2
201501	3767	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Continued strong economic growth, and gains in the labor market, and longer- term inflation expectations remaining stable will buoy confidence in that forecast.	22	2
201501	3768	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Historically, economic recoveries have been associated with gradual increases in underlying inflation.	22	2
201501	3769	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Should economic growth falter or survey measures of inflation expectations begin to trend downward, I’d be less confident in the forecast.	22	2
201501	3770	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I want to note that I do not need to see wages accelerate to convince me that inflation will rise.	22	2
201501	3771	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland staff analysis that examined several measures of wages and broader labor compensation found that the lead-lag relationship between nominal wage growth and price inflation is tenuous.	22	2
201501	3772	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	The strongest correlations are contemporaneous ones, especially since the mid-1980s, and my staff found no evidence that wages and labor compensation help to predict price inflation out of sample.	22	2
201501	3773	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Finally, regarding statement language, I do think the suggestions in the staff memo for how the language might evolve in advance of liftoff provide a useful approach.	22	2
201501	3774	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	However, as I indicated in the memo I circulated to the FOMC last week, I believe we could take the opportunity to simplify the statement’s organization in an effective way.	22	2
201501	3775	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	3776	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	22	2
201501	3777	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	22	2
201501	3778	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	3779	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	As I said earlier, I thought the memo regarding the risks associated with lifting off too soon versus too late is very helpful and useful.	22	2
201501	3780	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	The risks highlighted in the comparison between an earlier, gradual liftoff as opposed to a later and steeper liftoff indicate that those risks are not particularly substantial and are of similar magnitudes in either case.	22	2
201501	3781	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	The results depend, of course, on the types of shocks that affect the economy in the future, which, thus, makes it very difficult to rank these options with any certainty to speak of.	22	2
201501	3782	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Given my view of the underlying strength of the US economy and the greater stability of our financial system currently, I find the earlier and gradual policy more appealing.	22	2
201501	3783	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	However, the memo on foreign experiences point out it is particularly important, as exhibited in Canada, that the policy be data driven, as President Mester was suggesting.	22	2
201501	3784	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Further, the models do not point to any serious economic consequences in the event that the policy rate needs to return to the zero bound.	22	2
201501	3785	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	With a policy that is data driven, as indicated by the staff’s consideration of both various rules and historical experience, we should be lifting off immediately, as has been pointed out earlier.	22	2
201501	3786	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	More immediate liftoff also indicates that there will be less of a need to raise the funds rate aggressively in the future.	22	2
201501	3787	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Indeed, an earlier liftoff does more to ensure that we can be patient after liftoff than does continued delay.	22	2
201501	3788	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	The fly in the ointment, of course, is the rapid decline in oil prices and the subsequent effects they will have on headline and, to some extent, core inflation in the months to come.	22	2
201501	3789	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	These effects will make policy deliberations unusually challenging for the Committee, and I think it increases the danger that we will fail to see an underlying firming in inflation, and in so doing delay normalization by more than would occur absent the oil price decline.	22	2
201501	3790	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	It is true that by waiting until the smoke clears, the Committee can offset nominal pressures by raising interest rates at a faster pace.	22	2
201501	3791	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	That is easy for us to say now.	22	2
201501	3792	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	When the time comes, doing so could be politically difficult and far from a certain outcome of policy deliberations.	22	2
201501	3793	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Governor Tarullo gave a great case for this in the financial-stability go-round yesterday.	22	2
201501	3794	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	This risk, I fear, concerns me and is one that is not captured in the model exercises.	22	2
201501	3795	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	As to what conditions I would like to see at liftoff, my short answer is they are staring us in the face today.	22	2
201501	3796	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	As I have argued many times, and as Governor Fischer noted yesterday, being data dependent, according to most data rules and historical experience, the assessment is that the current low inflation and its expected gradual move up is not sufficient to justify or continue with zero rates.	22	2
201501	3797	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	It only justifies more accommodative rates than usual.	22	2
201501	3798	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Unfortunately, the fall in oil prices is masking, to some extent, any potential increase in underlying inflationary price pressures.	22	2
201501	3799	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	For that reason, I would place more weight, as I said yesterday, on things like trimmed means or medians, and they are not showing any appreciable declines in inflationary pressures.	22	2
201501	3800	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	In particular, if falling oil prices were to have little appreciable effect on those data, I’d have greater confidence that the inflation would return to target once the oil prices stabilize.	22	2
201501	3801	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Witnessing consistent declines in those types of measures, however, would lead me to undermine that confidence.	22	2
201501	3802	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	As to statement language, I have been concerned for some time that our statement should concisely articulate the economic factors that are governing both the current setting and future path of policy.	22	2
201501	3803	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Policy should be data driven.	22	2
201501	3804	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Forward guidance directly relating the path of policy and its link to forecasts of relevant data should be made as explicit as possible.	22	2
201501	3805	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	To indicate that data dependence and uncertainty surrounding the path, the Committee may also wish to contain relevant ranges of alternative paths that could occur if the economy were to evolve somewhat differently.	22	2
201501	3806	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	That is, look for alternative robustness of some kind.	22	2
201501	3807	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	To that end, I believe paragraph 4 of the pre-liftoff statement—it becomes paragraph 3 of the liftoff statement—could actually be made more precise.	22	2
201501	3808	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	It should indicate what the anticipated trajectory of the relevant variables are forecast to be and why those trajectories would call for a gradual approach to tightening.	22	2
201501	3809	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Or, if those variables would not call for a gradual approach, the specific economic factors that are leading to deviations from normal policy should be stated.	22	2
201501	3810	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	By doing this, financial market participants, firms, and households can better gauge when and how future policy will evolve.	22	2
201501	3811	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I do like the general direction that the statement language is headed.	22	2
201501	3812	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	It appears to be headed, in my view, to a more data-dependent reaction function.	22	2
201501	3813	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Having said that, the devil will be in the details.	22	2
201501	3814	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	For example, I would caution the Committee to be careful about the formulation so as to be consistent with our longer-term strategies.	22	2
201501	3815	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	We are fairly clear there that we do not have an explicit employment target, and we explain why.	22	2
201501	3816	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	We don’t want to have a statement that will corner us into creating an explicit employment target in order to define one of the metrics for policy.	22	2
201501	3817	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I think the language in alternative C and in the pre-liftoff statement that refers to “deviations of employment and inflation from its objectives” may trigger questions and pressure on the Committee about those objectives or goals, and perhaps calls for more specificity on employment than we might be comfortable providing.	22	2
201501	3818	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I think we have to be very careful about how we set that up.	22	2
201501	3819	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I would also draw attention to the language in paragraph 4 regarding the funds rate being below some normal level for some period of time.	22	2
201501	3820	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I never liked this language.	22	2
201501	3821	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	It remains confusing to the public, and they don’t know what it means or what, indeed, we intend.	22	2
201501	3822	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I think different people on the Committee may interpret it differently.	22	2
201501	3823	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Some may view this as a lower neutral rate, others may view it as simply a slower adjustment to a neutral rate, and others may mean both.	22	2
201501	3824	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	That’s fine.	22	2
201501	3825	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	But I think this paragraph needs to be rethought or allowed to disappear so that the infamous dot charts could provide more guidance.	22	2
201501	3826	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Perhaps even a better way would be to adopt a monetary policy report in which such discussions could be elaborated on and dealt with in a more fulsome and transparent manner.	22	2
201501	3827	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	3828	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	22	2
201501	3829	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	22	2
201501	3830	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	 Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	3831	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	If I could build on President Mester’s analogy, I feel a little bit like I got up to go to the kitchen, make a snack, and somebody changed the channel on me.	22	2
201501	3832	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I’ve got to do some more channel surfing back to where we were before.	22	2
201501	3833	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	For several meetings, I have already voiced my position regarding the first question on weighing the risks of lifting off prematurely versus waiting too long to raise rates.	22	2
201501	3834	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	For me, prudent risk management dictates that we should remain patient for some time before initiating our policy liftoff.	22	2
201501	3835	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	One of the biggest risks we face today is a premature policy tightening.	22	2
201501	3836	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	If the Committee misjudges the strength of current conditions and then the economy is hit with a disinflationary shock soon after liftoff, we could find ourselves in the extremely uncomfortable position of being forced back to the zero lower bound.	22	2
201501	3837	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	We would again have to turn to second- best unconventional policies, but this time it would be in the context of a policy reversal.	22	2
201501	3838	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	The most powerful of these unconventional policies is our credible expression in support of policy actions that we will do what it takes to achieve maximum employment and price stability.	22	2
201501	3839	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Returning to the zero lower bound would be a large blow to our credibility.	22	2
201501	3840	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	This would reduce our future ability to provide stimulus through such guidance.	22	2
201501	3841	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	In contrast, what if we wait too long and inflation picks up faster than we expect?	22	2
201501	3842	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I don’t see a high cost to this scenario.	22	2
201501	3843	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	We have far to go to reach our inflation target.	22	2
201501	3844	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Some greater- than-expected pickup in inflation would be welcomed to speed this policy achievement.	22	2
201501	3845	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Furthermore, there is no great cost if we end up, for a period of time, with inflation running moderately above 2 percent.	22	2
201501	3846	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	If inflation did overshoot our target by an uncomfortable margin, we know how to address this problem with moderate increases in interest rates.	22	2
201501	3847	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Our tools are powerful instruments in that event.	22	2
201501	3848	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	The alternative scenarios in the Tealbook showed that.	22	2
201501	3849	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Now let me turn to the economic conditions I would have to see to justify liftoff.	22	2
201501	3850	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I mentioned these in December, too.	22	2
201501	3851	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I have tried to capture these with some suggested language that I circulated earlier.	22	2
201501	3852	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I think if you look at that, it shows a great deal of data dependence, which is something that we all talk quite a lot about desiring.	22	2
201501	3853	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	First, economic growth would have to continue to run at a solid pace.	22	2
201501	3854	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	On the inflation side, I would need to have good confidence not only in a point forecast that inflation would get back up to 2 percent within two years, but also that once inflation rose to 2 percent, the odds of inflation running modestly above or modestly below 2 percent were equal.	22	2
201501	3855	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	That is, I want to be confident that we have put a policy in place that is designed to achieve our target in a sustainable and symmetric fashion.	22	2
201501	3856	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Notably, it seems to me much too timid if we adopt an assessment that is hoping to thread the needle and bring inflation up to 2 percent from below without ever risking crossing over 2 percent.	22	2
201501	3857	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	In addition, at the time of liftoff, I would like to see clear signs that nominal wages are beginning to increase toward the 3 to 4 percent growth range that I associate with neutral cost pressures—that is, cost increases that would be more consistent with an underlying inflation rate of 2 percent.	22	2
201501	3858	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I would also expect to see at least the beginnings of an increase in year-over-year core inflation.	22	2
201501	3859	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I agree quite a lot with President Lockhart’s suggestion that if we’re below 1½ percent on core that is not encouraging.	22	2
201501	3860	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I know this is difficult for many, but as raw forecasting tools go, current core inflation is at the top of the list of useful inflation indicators.	22	2
201501	3861	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Regarding yield-curve data, I would have to see one of the following two developments:  some upward movement in nominal 10-year Treasury rates and inflation breakevens and other market- based measures of inflation compensation, or I would need a lot more confidence than I have today that the declines in these measures over the past year are due to relatively innocuous factors and are not reflecting lower inflation expectations, nor elevated risk premiums associated with unfavorable inflation outcomes.	22	2
201501	3862	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Those are key data that I’m monitoring.	22	2
201501	3863	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Now, let me turn to the suggested language.	22	2
201501	3864	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I look at the “in a couple of meetings” wording in the proposed pre-liftoff statement and ask myself, is it plausible to have this language in place and then not raise rates in two meetings?	22	2
201501	3865	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	As it stands, I think the answer is, “Not really.”	22	2
201501	3866	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	That would present a high hurdle for my agreement to adopt such language.	22	2
201501	3867	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I was disappointed that the suggested language didn’t make more reference to these data issues directly.	22	2
201501	3868	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I find only small comfort in the language that allows for a delay in the rate hike if we see slower-than-currently-expected progress on inflation.	22	2
201501	3869	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	This puts an ill-defined marker down today, and then, to trigger a delay, it assigns the task of proving that the outlook has turned worse than this marker.	22	2
201501	3870	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Instead, the onus should be on proving that we have enough growing confidence in our forecast of increasing inflation to justify the rate increase.	22	2
201501	3871	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I circulated suggested language that provides a more explicit conditional set of inflation indicators.	22	2
201501	3872	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	It seems important for us to affirm the need for the policy tightening, not just to say we don’t have enough evidence for a delay.	22	2
201501	3873	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Being confident that inflation is sustainably headed back to 2 percent just seems to be good policymaking under uncertainty.	22	2
201501	3874	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	We are highly uncertain about the path for inflation, and we currently are well below our inflation target.	22	2
201501	3875	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Continuing a patient monitoring for signs that inflation will increase over the next two years still seems prudent.	22	2
201501	3876	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Finally, with regard to the pace of firming after liftoff, I think the language in the proposed statement, in conjunction with the SEPs, will work adequately to convey the slow pace of rate increases just about all of us have in our assumptions regarding appropriate policy.	22	2
201501	3877	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	3878	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	22	2
201501	3879	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	22	2
201501	3880	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	3881	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Well, I thought long and hard about this issue of whether we should be earlier and gradual versus later and steeper.	22	2
201501	3882	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	After careful consideration, I came to the conclusion that it would actually be best to be on time and on track.	22	2
201501	3883	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	22	2
201501	3884	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I realize as soon as I say that, the Board staff is going to start working on a memo that discusses the pros and cons of that approach, and probably it’s going to find some arguments why that’s not the optimal approach to take.	22	2
201501	3885	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, anyway, that’s my view.	22	2
201501	3886	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Really, what we’re talking about is the challenge of delivering on this on time and on track in the current circumstances.	22	2
201501	3887	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’ve actually found the discussion already this morning to be really excellent in addressing a lot of these issues.	22	2
201501	3888	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, as suggested by my own research earlier with Dave Reifschneider, there are conditions that warrant a lower-for-longer stance for policy.	22	2
201501	3889	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, given the evolution of the economy, it’s clear that we have been more patient than suggested by many simple monetary policy rules, and even the optimal-control simulation reported in the Tealbook.	22	2
201501	3890	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	That patience has been partly guided by several factors that are not directly taken into account by these approaches, especially the possible future downside risks associated with the zero lower bound.	22	2
201501	3891	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yet I think it’s important to remember that “lower for longer” does not mean forever.	22	2
201501	3892	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even accounting for the reasons to be very patient, we are nearing conditions that would warrant the start of normalization of our policy, in my view.	22	2
201501	3893	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	In weighing when to lift off, obviously, the first task is to assess the distance from our goals.	22	2
201501	3894	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	If we lift off later this year, which is what I currently view as appropriate, the full employment part of our mandate would essentially be fulfilled.	22	2
201501	3895	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	But inflation would still be well below our 2 percent goal.	22	2
201501	3896	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even after liftoff, we can manage the pace of normalization to make sure that inflation moves back to target.	22	2
201501	3897	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Our continuing extraordinarily accommodative policy stance, coupled with a solid and strengthening labor market, overall stable longer-run inflation expectations, and the time-honored lags in monetary policy, make it likely that inflation will return to our 2 percent objective over the medium term.	22	2
201501	3898	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, events may play out differently, but to lose confidence in that basic forecast, I would need to see a serious slowdown in economic growth or clear signs that underlying inflation is falling.	22	2
201501	3899	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, I think it’s important in thinking about liftoff just to remind ourselves how extraordinarily accommodative the stance on monetary policy is today.	22	2
201501	3900	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m just basically going to repeat what President Kocherlakota said earlier this morning.	22	2
201501	3901	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Not only do we have very low interest rates, but also a balance sheet of more than $4 trillion that is providing substantial stimulus, at least based on the best estimates we have on the effects of LSAPs.	22	2
201501	3902	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Before I turn to the evolution of our statement language, there have been a couple of comments on our inflation target, and President Evans made a comment about how overshooting inflation would not be that problematic.	22	2
201501	3903	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with the point that we’re under our target, and if we overshot the inflation target modestly or moderately, that wouldn’t be a problem.	22	2
201501	3904	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with that.	22	2
201501	3905	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I believe in the symmetry.	22	2
201501	3906	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think we agree on all these issues.	22	2
201501	3907	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, I did go back and look at a past episode to show how quickly things actually can turn.	22	2
201501	3908	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Let me go through some data.	22	2
201501	3909	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, these are the current data I pulled off Haver, but I’ve done a research paper on this topic with Athanasios Orphanides using real-time data, and the point is the same.	22	2
201501	3910	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	At this point in time—and I’ll tell you what the point is in a moment—core PCE inflation on a four-quarter change basis was 1¼ percent.	22	2
201501	3911	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Unemployment was 0.6 percentage point above the prevailing view of natural rate.	22	2
201501	3912	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Unit labor costs were growing at about a 1 percent rate.	22	2
201501	3913	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Looks pretty good to me.	22	2
201501	3914	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Eighteen months later, core inflation is 3.1 percent; unemployment now is well below the natural rate, at 3.8 percent; unit labor costs are rising at a 4½ percent rate.	22	2
201501	3915	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s the difference between June 1965, when the debate about tightening in that cycle was really starting to happen, and December 1966.	22	2
201501	3916	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s just a reminder that our ability to forecast is not that good.	22	2
201501	3917	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	The second is that wages can lag the cycle, as President Mester said and I argued yesterday.	22	2
201501	3918	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, I think that the history on this is maybe not as reassuring about how quickly things can change when monetary policy is very accommodative.	22	2
201501	3919	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now I’ll turn to the evolution of the statement language.	22	2
201501	3920	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s obviously crucial that we communicate our intentions to the public as well as we can, especially given how low market expectations of future rates are right now.	22	2
201501	3921	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	We need to provide clear guidance about liftoff and the pace of normalization to avoid adding noise to an already uncertain environment.	22	2
201501	3922	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	At the same time, we don’t want to tie ourselves to a particular liftoff date, as events may unfold differently than we anticipate.	22	2
201501	3923	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I want the best of both worlds.	22	2
201501	3924	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I want clarity, but also to recognize the uncertainty.	22	2
201501	3925	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	One possible evolution of our forward guidance is reflected in the handout, and in alternative C, and refers in paragraph 3 to a potential increase in the target rate in a couple of meetings.	22	2
201501	3926	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	One advantage of this approach that I see is it clearly communicates our intentions.	22	2
201501	3927	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I actually think it’s extremely clear in what we’re going to do.	22	2
201501	3928	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’re going to raise rates in a couple meetings.	22	2
201501	3929	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	The flip side of this clarity is, I think, that it’s a negative—it makes a June rate hike seem like it’s baked in the cake.	22	2
201501	3930	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Let me suggest a possible alternative approach that both signals that liftoff is approaching but leaves open options regarding the precise timing of liftoff.	22	2
201501	3931	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Specifically, we could say, “Based on its current assessment of economic conditions and the outlook, the Committee judges that in the months ahead the economy will likely be moving closer to conditions warranting an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.”	22	2
201501	3932	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Going back to President Evans’s comment earlier, it does have both “likely” and “moving closer,” which leaves a lot of optionality—something that I think is appropriate, given where we are and where we are likely to be in the next few meetings.	22	2
201501	3933	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	At least as a basis for thinking about future language, I think this language conveys the view that depending on the data, liftoff is possible two, three, or four meetings ahead.	22	2
201501	3934	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Such language also has the advantage of being applicable for multiple statements and could be modified relatively easy with minor adjustments.	22	2
201501	3935	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ll also start the process of weaning financial markets and other Fed watchers off the belief that we will always be telling them exactly what we plan to do and when.	22	2
201501	3936	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Precision in our forward guidance was a very useful approach under the extraordinary conditions of recent years, but something that I hope we eliminate as part of the normalization process.	22	2
201501	3937	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Finally, let me pick up on another theme that President Mester has raised both this morning and in her earlier memo on statement language.	22	2
201501	3938	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do see this as a time of opportunity to review our FOMC statements.	22	2
201501	3939	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	With QE and forward guidance, our statements necessarily became very long and complex.	22	2
201501	3940	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	We had to describe novel and complicated policies, and that was appropriate.	22	2
201501	3941	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	But we still carry much of this baggage in our statements today.	22	2
201501	3942	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	As we contemplate the normalization of our policy stance, I think this is as good an opportunity as any we will get to take a fresh start, think about simplifying and restructuring our statements to make them more effective for a more normalized environment.	22	2
201501	3943	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ll continue to emphasize, obviously, the data dependence of our policy choices.	22	2
201501	3944	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s an issue I think we need to start discussing now, so that we can embark on the normalization process with an improved statement structure.	22	2
201501	3945	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s actually rare that we have an opportunity to start with a clean slate, and I think this might be exactly the time for that.	22	2
201501	3946	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	22	2
201501	3947	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	22	2
201501	3948	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	22	2
201501	3949	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	3950	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Though the discussion about moving sooner or later is about balancing risk, I see it as somewhat neglecting that we have already built risk- management considerations into our decision about liftoff.	22	2
201501	3951	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	As the Board memos discuss, nearly all of the standard rules we use to evaluate policy have already called for liftoff.	22	2
201501	3952	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, the real federal funds rate has been below the Tealbook-consistent measure of r* for about a year.	22	2
201501	3953	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Analysis by my staff also assesses to what extent the period in which policy was constrained from being sufficiently accommodative due to the zero lower bound has been offset during the recent period when the funds rate has been held below prescriptions from an estimated policy rule.	22	2
201501	3954	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	They find the cumulative shortfall of accommodation earlier in the recovery has been more than offset by the subsequent cumulative excess accommodation.	22	2
201501	3955	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	These factors suggest to me that the Committee has effectively already made a decision to move later and assume the associated risk rather than move in line with prescribed policy rules.	22	2
201501	3956	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of the specific questions, I see liftoff in the middle of this year, which is in line with current expectations, and at a gradual pace consistent with a data-dependent approach and one that balances risks.	22	2
201501	3957	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Waiting for liftoff until we reach full employment and inflation of 2 percent does not seem appropriate, particularly with an elevated balance sheet that continues to provide accommodation.	22	2
201501	3958	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	The temptation to see one more data point will always be present.	22	2
201501	3959	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	History shows this can lead central banks to move too late.	22	2
201501	3960	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Because of the lags we face in monetary policy, we likely will need to move before full attainment of our objectives.	22	2
201501	3961	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Alternatively, the risk of moving even later than in the middle of the year is that we may fall behind the curve and would need to move rates up more quickly.	22	2
201501	3962	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Of course, a rapid increase in rates could surprise financial markets and pose risks to financial stability.	22	2
201501	3963	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Along these lines, I found the Board staff memo assessing the likelihood of these various events useful, though as the memo itself points out, the scenarios do not take into account reputation risk or financial-stability concerns.	22	2
201501	3964	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Still, the combined likelihood of one of the adverse scenarios occurring was higher in the later and steep scenario than under the early and gradual scenario.	22	2
201501	3965	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Also according to the simulations, the early and gradual approach effectively takes off the table a scenario in which we would have to raise rates aggressively.	22	2
201501	3966	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of what developments I’d like to see, I’m a bit hesitant about drawing any bright lines regarding conditions that I’d have to see before liftoff, and I thought the Chair’s set of criteria from the December press conference was reasonable in that regard.	22	2
201501	3967	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Further progress in labor market conditions along with confidence that inflation would be moving back to target are sufficient in my mind to consider liftoff.	22	2
201501	3968	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	I’m also willing to look through some soft readings on near-term inflation rates.	22	2
201501	3969	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Of course, I’ll also be listening to anecdotes received from business contacts to confirm or contradict issues of wage and price pressures and stability in the price of oil.	22	2
201501	3970	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Appreciation of the dollar and five-year, five-year-ahead inflation breakevens will also be important to that confidence.	22	2
201501	3971	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Regarding statement language, I’m generally comfortable with the suggested language in the Board staff memo.	22	2
201501	3972	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	It highlights that March is going to be an important decision point, and if I look at my current outlook, removing “patient” would be appropriate in March.	22	2
201501	3973	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Given the emphasis on data dependence, we will clearly calibrate those first paragraphs of the statement to reflect any change in the outlook.	22	2
201501	3974	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	If the data soften, these paragraphs can convey a shift in the outlook, which will presumably cause expectations to adjust, but overall I see removing “patient” as giving us flexibility around the timing of liftoff.	22	2
201501	3975	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Alternatively, if we keep it in this March statement it will most like push expectations back and limit our flexibility.	22	2
201501	3976	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, I support President Mester’s proposal for recalibrating our statement, and, as others have noted, would welcome further discussion of that.	22	2
201501	3977	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	22	2
201501	3978	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	22	2
201501	3979	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	3980	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I’m just going to give some thoughts regarding the questions that were asked.	22	2
201501	3981	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I would say, generally, the Board memo on the timing and pace of policy firming demonstrates that it’s possible to build a plausible case for unusual accommodation in current circumstances along the lines of the Tealbook baseline policy rate path.	22	2
201501	3982	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	But “plausible” isn’t the same thing as “convincing.”	22	2
201501	3983	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	You remember during the previous meeting I referred to the religious agnostic that wasn’t sure he believe in D-O-G, and I’m similarly agnostic or I’m not convinced for several reasons that I’d like to lay out here.	22	2
201501	3984	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	The first is that it’s possible that the Tealbook baseline inflation forecast is too pessimistic.	22	2
201501	3985	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	It builds in 1.8 percent longer-run inflation expectations.	22	2
201501	3986	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Of great concern to me and my staff is that it doesn’t include a speed effect, whereby inflation responds to the change in the unemployment rate as well as its level.	22	2
201501	3987	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	With the higher inflation path, the optimal control and Taylor rule policy prescriptions shift upward.	22	2
201501	3988	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	The Tealbook policy prescriptions ignore what I think are very serious recession risks attached to any appreciable overshoot of full employment, and, as I’ve said, almost ad nauseam, they ignore the nonlinearity or convexity of the Phillips curve.	22	2
201501	3989	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Sooner or later, to ensure that inflation converges to target, you’ll have to correct any employment overshoot, and that’s just not something the FOMC has ever been able to pull off without triggering a recession.	22	2
201501	3990	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I’d like to see the staff convince you—because I won’t be here—that these fears are overblown, and I think they should develop for you and show you in stochastic stimulations using a realistic policy rule what the risks are of this occurring.	22	2
201501	3991	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I’m not a big fan of ad hoc inertia in policy rules, such as that built into the Tealbook baseline policy prescription.	22	2
201501	3992	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Post-liftoff, the baseline path is from the Taylor (1999) rule with inertia.	22	2
201501	3993	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Ad hoc inertia perpetuates past policy errors.	22	2
201501	3994	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	If you’ll forgive me for saying so, it’s a very crude way of trying to capture effects that are more fundamental effects than genuine inertia effects—especially the potential disruption to financial markets from too-large unexpected movements in rates or possibly policymakers’ desires to offset past inflation target misses.	22	2
201501	3995	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Policy may respond to a weighted average of expected future, current, and past inflation rates, not just current inflation.	22	2
201501	3996	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	The burden of proof needs to be especially high when the course of action being advocated happens to be an easy or expedient road.	22	2
201501	3997	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	It’s tempting to say that we can clean up after ourselves later if policy turns out to be too accommodative.	22	2
201501	3998	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	It’s tempting to leave that hard work to a future Federal Open Market Committee.	22	2
201501	3999	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	We save ourselves a lot of criticism and political grief in the short run if we downplay the risks attached to keeping policy exceptionally accommodative longer.	22	2
201501	4000	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	My only advice—this is highly didactic and will probably be ignored—is we need to resist these temptations at this table.	22	2
201501	4001	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	We need to be what Ken Rogoff calls conservative central bankers or at least lean in that direction.	22	2
201501	4002	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	As regards memo number seven on the stochastic implications of alternative strategies for the beginning of policy normalization, I’m very much concerned about the credibility problems attached to the later and steep policy strategy.	22	2
201501	4003	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	It’s possible—indeed, I would say it’s even likely, on the basis of my background as a market operator—that the public will interpret a decision to defer a liftoff as a signal that the Committee is generally dovish and disinclined to raise rates quickly.	22	2
201501	4004	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	In other words, I think there’s a risk that the public and the markets might see the choice as between “earlier and gradual” and “later and gradual” rather than between “earlier and gradual” and “later and steep.”	22	2
201501	4005	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	If we lift off in March 2015, as I had suggested, or April 2015, which is apparently not going to happen, people would be able to see as early as June 2015 that you’re serious about “gradual” and “earlier and gradual.”	22	2
201501	4006	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	On the other hand, my gut tells me that if you are going to say you are going to defer liftoff, say, to September or January of the following year, but then plan to raise rates quickly thereafter, people will have to wait until January 2016 or March 2016 to know whether you’re serious.	22	2
201501	4007	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Early and gradual is quickly verified.	22	2
201501	4008	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Later and steep requires a great deal of trust.	22	2
201501	4009	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	In the context of the Taylor (1999) rule with inertia, the public might interpret delayed liftoff as signaling an especially large amount of interest rate inertia stemming from concerns about having to reverse course should the economic outlook deteriorate, as President Evans articulated very well earlier.	22	2
201501	4010	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Alternatively, they might interpret delayed liftoff as signaling that the Committee believes that the equilibrium real short-term interest rate is unusually low and likely to remain so well beyond the end of 2015.	22	2
201501	4011	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Alternatively, they might believe that due to concerns about stability of longer-term inflation expectations or about the unreliability of standard measurements of slack, the Committee has decided to downweight the output gap in its deliberations relative to the inflation gap, or they might believe that the FOMC cares not just about the current inflation shortfall, but also shortfalls in previous years.	22	2
201501	4012	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Every one of these arguments for patience, Madam Chair, has been cited by one or another FOMC participant in public communications or around the FOMC table, as I remember it.	22	2
201501	4013	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	So it’s no stretch to think that the public will not completely buy into later and steep.	22	2
201501	4014	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I would suggest the staff provide some simulation showing what happens to the economy if the public should misinterpret the Committee’s decision to delay liftoff.	22	2
201501	4015	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	What about the incentive to renege?	22	2
201501	4016	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Say that September 2015 or even January 2016 arrives.	22	2
201501	4017	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I wonder if we can be sure that the Committee will follow through on the steep half of the later and steep.	22	2
201501	4018	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Consider, especially, the possibility that the public may have misinterpreted the reasons for the late liftoff and made financial bets and commitments accordingly.	22	2
201501	4019	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Might not future Committee members be tempted to then depart from the Taylor rule prescriptions?	22	2
201501	4020	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	With regard to the question as to what you would pay attention to in terms of information, personally, I would pay close to zero attention to realized headline inflation, and I’d give a very strong nod to the trimmed-mean indexes.	22	2
201501	4021	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	We’ve heard a lot about that around the table.	22	2
201501	4022	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I would encourage, even though it’s hard work, the staff to incorporate that and give more fulsome explanations of what they see as indicators.	22	2
201501	4023	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I would also pay nearly as little attention to TIPS spreads.	22	2
201501	4024	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	What I would want to see is evidence that households and professional forecasters expect inflation to rise toward target fairly promptly over time.	22	2
201501	4025	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I’d like to see their 5-year inflation expectations reasonably consistent with the 2 percent inflation rate, and their 10-year expectations and 5-year, 5-year-forward expectations very much consistent with the 2 percent inflation rate.	22	2
201501	4026	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I would want to see evidence the economy is likely to continue to expand at a rate that implies further declines in the unemployment rate.	22	2
201501	4027	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I’m taking into account not only the momentum we see in the economy, but also the anecdotal evidence we pick up from our contacts.	22	2
201501	4028	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I would be very mindful of the nonlinearity or convexity of the Phillips curve, and I would be mindful that, as President George reminded us just now, monetary policy acts with a lag.	22	2
201501	4029	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I’ve used the analogy of duck hunting.	22	2
201501	4030	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	You aim ahead of the mallard in order to capture it.	22	2
201501	4031	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I notice that Larry Summers said: “I want to see the whites of the eyes before I act.”	22	2
201501	4032	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	If you wait until seeing the whites of the eyes, you’re going to shoot someone in the back of the head, and I don’t think that’s a prudent way to conduct monetary policy.	22	2
201501	4033	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	There’s been a lot of discussion, and I think of Governor Brainard’s remarks yesterday and your very good comments, Madam Chair, about this issue of low nominal interest rates.	22	2
201501	4034	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I would bear in mind that there are many factors to consider.	22	2
201501	4035	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I was grateful that Governor Fischer recalled the memory of Wassily Leontief, from whom I took a course in 1969.	22	2
201501	4036	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	By the way, he was a charming teacher.	22	2
201501	4037	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	He was wrong, but he was a charming, charming teacher.	22	2
201501	4038	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	But he did have one rule, which is, “Keep things simple.”	22	2
201501	4039	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Low interest rates mean that the price of fixed-income instruments are high.	22	2
201501	4040	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	And one factor that I think we need to consider is that it just may be that there’s too much liquidity chasing too few fixed-income options, and to me that’s the simplest, most common-sense explanation.	22	2
201501	4041	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I think we need to bear that in mind.	22	2
201501	4042	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	We’re not the only source of liquidity.	22	2
201501	4043	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I have talked about this before, and I would assign a multiple of, say, 5 to the amount of liquidity floating around the system.	22	2
201501	4044	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	That may be one explanation for these very low nominal rates, in addition to the money that comes here because of low nominal rates elsewhere.	22	2
201501	4045	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	With regard to the suggestions on the statement language, the statement language progression proposed in this memo is good, but I think less than ideal in that it provides minimal meaningful guidance on how liftoff plans will respond to economic developments.	22	2
201501	4046	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	At this point, though, the Committee’s time is probably better spent exploring and debating the post-liftoff conduct of policy than in trying to fine-tune its guidance on liftoff itself.	22	2
201501	4047	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Again, I want to repeat what I said yesterday.	22	2
201501	4048	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I would like very much always to see a decision-tree analysis.	22	2
201501	4049	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I referred to it yesterday with regard to the Desk, but I think it’s important that we keep that kind of mentality and, in particular, think through what our steps will be as we go forward post-liftoff, not just liftoff itself.	22	2
201501	4050	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I hope the Committee won’t slip into the bad habit of locking itself into rolling, multimeeting time paths for the funds rate.	22	2
201501	4051	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	We insist that our actions are data dependent, but in practice, Madam Chair, I’ve noticed while I’ve sat around this table that we seem to be very resistant to changes in calendar guidance.	22	2
201501	4052	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	That said, the basic progression proposed in the memo is acceptable.	22	2
201501	4053	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I’d make two qualifications.	22	2
201501	4054	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	First, I like the admirably clear and precise organization language proposed by President Mester.	22	2
201501	4055	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I think it’s an improvement on the draft language of this memo.	22	2
201501	4056	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	You may recall, Madam Chair, that Evan Koenig and I have provided language to Chairman Bernanke during the transition as to how we might accomplish what President Mester has proposed, and President Williams just said this is a good time to clean things up.	22	2
201501	4057	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I endorse that, and I would suggest that we look carefully at what she suggested.	22	2
201501	4058	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	As to President Evans’s memo, building on the suggestion of Presidents Bullard, Williams, and Plosser, I do especially appreciate the reference to the trimmed-mean index.	22	2
201501	4059	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	That’s one more advocate for including that as an indicator.	22	2
201501	4060	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Second, I wonder with regard to specific language in alternative C whether the phrase “economic conditions [may/could potentially] warrant an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate in a couple of meetings” will be appropriate in the meeting that precedes liftoff.	22	2
201501	4061	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Actually, given my biases, I like President Lockhart’s “couple of,” even though I lost the argument.	22	2
201501	4062	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	You’re indicating in two meetings, literally.	22	2
201501	4063	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	But as we get to the meeting before, it’s likely we would want to change that language to perhaps say “increase in the target range for the federal funds within the next couple of meetings.”	22	2
201501	4064	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	That gives you a little bit of leeway.	22	2
201501	4065	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	4066	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	22	2
201501	4067	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	22	2
201501	4068	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	4069	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I have three remarks.	22	2
201501	4070	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	First, I’ll talk about premature normalization versus waiting too long, and I just want to say at the outset that I agree with President George’s comments that we’ve already waited a long time.	22	2
201501	4071	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think we’re past the stage of just discussing strategy on this.	22	2
201501	4072	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	We’re already in the phase of having waited a long time, at least according to ordinary characterizations of policy rules that the staff has outlined.	22	2
201501	4073	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Second, I’ll talk about what developments will give me pause, and here I’m going to talk about expected inflation and respond to some remarks by Governor Fischer and Presidents Kocherlakota, Evans, and Rosengren.	22	2
201501	4074	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Third, I’ll talk about language issues, and generally why I think the proposed language is okay.	22	2
201501	4075	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	The spirit may be wrong, and here I’ll echo some of the comments that President Fisher just made, and in that part of my remarks I have an exciting “lions and zebras” analogy that you can look forward to.	22	2
201501	4076	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	[Laughter]	22	2
201501	4077	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	With that excitement in train here, let me talk about premature normalization or waiting too long, or “early and gradual” versus “later and steeper.”	22	2
201501	4078	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I may be having a different take on this from some people around the table.	22	2
201501	4079	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with the staff memo that there are many different funds rate paths that can deliver the same net reduction in accommodation.	22	2
201501	4080	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	In that sense, I don’t really think there is any issue to be discussed here.	22	2
201501	4081	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	In some sense, it’s a poorly posed question for the Committee.	22	2
201501	4082	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	What the memo said, or the way I understood it, was that, despite the fact that two different paths are actually getting to the same point, might there be some regret taking one path versus the other path.	22	2
201501	4083	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think the main idea to keep in mind here is that we are tasked with developing a good monetary policy, and the path of that good policy will depend on the shocks that arrive during the normalization process.	22	2
201501	4084	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	If the shocks drive you back to the zero interest rate policy, so be it.	22	2
201501	4085	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	If the shocks lead you to raise rates somewhat faster than what would have been contemplated ex ante, well, so be it.	22	2
201501	4086	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Those are the shocks that arrived, and you have to run the good monetary policy in response to the shock.	22	2
201501	4087	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t think we should deviate from the good policy based on what that policy may or may not call for in the future based on the arrival of information.	22	2
201501	4088	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	In fact, doing so would be a deviation from what was otherwise judged to be good policy in the first place.	22	2
201501	4089	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Again, I think this is in some ways a poorly posed question.	22	2
201501	4090	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Let me make just a few further remarks on this.	22	2
201501	4091	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	If we lift off, there would always be some probability that we’d be forced to return to the zero interest rate policy.	22	2
201501	4092	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t think that that probability is any higher today than it will ever be.	22	2
201501	4093	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	No matter when you lift off, you’re going to face that as a probability.	22	2
201501	4094	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t see much evidence that it is particularly high right now.	22	2
201501	4095	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	It’s probably low.	22	2
201501	4096	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	In fact, it might be at a minimum right about now.	22	2
201501	4097	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	The probability that we would be forced to raise rates quickly in the future is also not particularly high today.	22	2
201501	4098	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Of course, that’s always a possibility that’s out there.	22	2
201501	4099	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	President Williams outlined some past data that would probably lead us to go in that direction.	22	2
201501	4100	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	But, again, the chances that would happen require a certain arrival of information, and we would have to respond to that information.	22	2
201501	4101	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Now, if we communicate poorly, or if we have low credibility with regard to raising rates abruptly, then that would surprise markets and lead to a lot of market volatility.	22	2
201501	4102	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Here I align myself with President Fisher’s comments just now that maybe we don’t have that much credibility on that particular dimension.	22	2
201501	4103	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Arguably, we already have this problem today as markets evidently do not believe our SEP forecasts.	22	2
201501	4104	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	But this is a problem of market expectations on policy being somewhat misaligned with the intentions of the Committee as outlined in the SEP.	22	2
201501	4105	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	What we should do, if we think that’s a problem, is bolster the credibility of our SEP paths, either by reinforcing that this really is what the Committee thinks or, if it’s not what the Committee thinks, then we should change what our SEP numbers are.	22	2
201501	4106	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	If we do not have a credibility problem where people don’t believe we’re going to raise rates, then, should shocks force us to raise rates abruptly, this would be well understood by markets and would not cause unnaturally high levels of volatility.	22	2
201501	4107	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	So we wouldn’t have any special problem associated with that, as long as we didn’t have any credibility problem.	22	2
201501	4108	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	The bottom line is good policy has to be shaped by shocks as they arrive.	22	2
201501	4109	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	There is always the possibility that these will lead us back to the zero interest rate policy or that they would lead us to abruptly raise rates in the future, but these branches of the tree do not have especially high probability right now.	22	2
201501	4110	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	And I don’t think they should necessarily be an argument figuring into current monetary policy decisionmaking.	22	2
201501	4111	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	The main issue for the Committee, I think, and really the elephant in the room is that regardless of how we approach normalization within current thinking, we have essentially already committed to a policy path that will be exceptionally easy over the next several years.	22	2
201501	4112	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Whether this is good or wise is a great question.	22	2
201501	4113	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Unemployment will now likely fall substantially below our estimates of the natural rate over the next two years.	22	2
201501	4114	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	The past two times this happened in the US economy, in the late 1990s and the mid-2000s, large, tangible, noticeable asset price bubbles developed.	22	2
201501	4115	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Both of those were hotly debated around this table.	22	2
201501	4116	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Both ultimately ended in recession.	22	2
201501	4117	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	The second one ended in global macroeconomic disaster.	22	2
201501	4118	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Does the Committee wish to risk a replay of these bubble episodes?	22	2
201501	4119	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	What developments give me pause in the wisdom of normalization?	22	2
201501	4120	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Here I want to address a simmering argument around the table as to whether it is even a good idea to be thinking about normalization at this point.	22	2
201501	4121	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Governor Fischer said yesterday that he was uncomfortable with the zero interest rate policy.	22	2
201501	4122	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I’m very much aligned with that.	22	2
201501	4123	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I’m uncomfortable with the zero interest rate policy.	22	2
201501	4124	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	If we can normalize, I think we should.	22	2
201501	4125	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Presidents Kocherlakota, Rosengren, and Evans eloquently argued that low inflation and low inflation expectations have to get more attention, or even a decisive level of attention, on this decision.	22	2
201501	4126	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I have, over the past five years, placed heavier emphasis than most on the Committee on inflation and inflation expectations as a key determinant of the direction of policy.	22	2
201501	4127	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	In this sense, I am concerned and I have some sympathy, maybe some substantial sympathy, for the arguments of Presidents Kocherlakota, Rosengren, and Evans.	22	2
201501	4128	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I take the ECB as a case in point.	22	2
201501	4129	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Some of you know that in the summer of 2013 I went to Frankfurt, and I gave a speech that QE was their best option.	22	2
201501	4130	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	At that point, inflation was only somewhat below target and falling.	22	2
201501	4131	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I talked with policymakers, ECB staff, and financial market people about this.	22	2
201501	4132	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I got a cold reception.	22	2
201501	4133	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	But 18 months later, the ECB has come to a decision and has adopted QE.	22	2
201501	4134	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think it’s probably late.	22	2
201501	4135	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	They let inflation and inflation expectations drift a long way from their objectives.	22	2
201501	4136	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Now it’s going to take quite a few years probably to get inflation back to target in Europe.	22	2
201501	4137	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	That’s a cautionary tale for us.	22	2
201501	4138	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	We don’t want to ignore this problem too long.	22	2
201501	4139	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	We don’t want to make excuses for too long of a time.	22	2
201501	4140	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I am sympathetic to the arguments on this.	22	2
201501	4141	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I want to make two points.	22	2
201501	4142	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	First, low inflation as it exists today cannot rationalize the zero interest rate policy.	22	2
201501	4143	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	A gap in inflation of something on the order of ½ percentage point is simply not large enough to rationalize a policy rate of zero.	22	2
201501	4144	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	It can rationalize a lower-than- normal policy rate, but not a zero policy rate.	22	2
201501	4145	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I understand that the natural rate of interest could also be low, but, in my mind, that also is not low enough to rationalize the zero interest rate policy.	22	2
201501	4146	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	The bottom line is that the zero interest rate policy is an emergency measure that no longer fits the given data that we have.	22	2
201501	4147	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Even if we raise rates, it will be to a very low level, about 50 basis points or 75 basis points, and by conventional metrics we will still be putting upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations.	22	2
201501	4148	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	That’s one point.	22	2
201501	4149	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t think that we can rationalize the current policy based on inflation alone.	22	2
201501	4150	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Inflation expectations have declined precipitously in recent quarters.	22	2
201501	4151	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I am very concerned about this.	22	2
201501	4152	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I do not place much signal value on surveys, and I agree with President Rosengren’s characterization of some of the drawbacks of looking at surveys.	22	2
201501	4153	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	They are not, in my view, sufficiently sensitive to incoming information to give us real-time information on policy judgments.	22	2
201501	4154	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I would also, as others have, remind you of the Japanese experience, in which surveys continually said expectations were for normal levels of inflation, even though actual inflation continued to come in at low levels.	22	2
201501	4155	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	They actually didn’t have a target during that point.	22	2
201501	4156	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	However, despite all of these comments about how concerned I am about the decline in inflation expectations, I think that the oil shock is having special influence on the TIPS-based measures at this time.	22	2
201501	4157	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	The oil dislocation is substantial.	22	2
201501	4158	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	This is no ordinary oil price shock.	22	2
201501	4159	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	This is a 50, 60 percent reduction, and it’s causing a lot of volatility and a lot of repricing in markets; some of it that does not seem totally rational in the context of TIPS markets.	22	2
201501	4160	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	The bottom line is, I want to wait and see for now.	22	2
201501	4161	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think when the oil markets shake out and settle down, probably at a lower price than what was previously considered normal, then we’ll see if the TIPS-based inflation measures move up.	22	2
201501	4162	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	If they do, then that will give me confidence.	22	2
201501	4163	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	If they don’t, I’d be worried that the Committee’s credibility really is eroding.	22	2
201501	4164	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I am anxious to see how that is going to develop in the coming months and quarters.	22	2
201501	4165	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	My final point is about language suggestions.	22	2
201501	4166	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with others that the language is generally okay, but I would pose the following question to the Committee.	22	2
201501	4167	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Do we really want to telegraph as directly as we are sometimes suggesting here?	22	2
201501	4168	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with President Lockhart’s characterization at the beginning of this discussion that once we signal that we are on the road, we are turning a machine on and it’s a fait accompli.	22	2
201501	4169	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Do we really want to be doing that?	22	2
201501	4170	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	If you’re on the Serengeti, and you’re a lion, and you’re hunting the zebra, you may not want to telegraph your intentions quite as precisely as we are talking about here.	22	2
201501	4171	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	My alternative vision for how to do this really involves a change in attitude, I think, around the table about how to do the tightening process.	22	2
201501	4172	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with President Williams, who made comments in this direction.	22	2
201501	4173	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	You want to eliminate the telegraphing during the normalization process.	22	2
201501	4174	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Sure, it has been valuable at the zero bound.	22	2
201501	4175	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	There has been a lot of talk about forward guidance.	22	2
201501	4176	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	But this is may not be the right way to approach the normalization process.	22	2
201501	4177	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	What I want to do is just three things:  one, keep options open; two, be able to move at any juncture—and, for this reason, I keep harping on the issue of the press conference, which I think remains critical in this regard; and, three, seize favorable data and move at that point.	22	2
201501	4178	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	You don’t want to have to move when the data are going in the wrong direction.	22	2
201501	4179	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think it will send very mixed signals, especially at the beginning of the normalization process.	22	2
201501	4180	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Keep options open.	22	2
201501	4181	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Be able to move at any juncture.	22	2
201501	4182	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Seize favorable data.	22	2
201501	4183	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	That’s how we want to do this normalization process.	22	2
201501	4184	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Further moves after that, I think, should also seize on relatively good data coming in, both on the real economy and on inflation and inflation expectations.	22	2
201501	4185	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think if we do that, we’ll get a smooth ride.	22	2
201501	4186	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	If we try to do it on what looks like more of a calendar basis, there is a risk that we will be moving at times when the data are not in synch with us, and then people will say, “Well, I don’t understand what the FOMC’s reaction function really is.”	22	2
201501	4187	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Those are my comments.	22	2
201501	4188	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	4189	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	22	2
201501	4190	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	22	2
201501	4191	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	4192	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I have expressed, my thinking about policy is at a somewhat different place than the basic view that underlies the staff’s questions.	22	2
201501	4193	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m increasingly concerned about substantial downside risks to the credibility of our inflation target.	22	2
201501	4194	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Others have expressed concerns about upside risks to the credibility of our inflation target and about the risks to the financial stability.	22	2
201501	4195	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I want to emphasize that the downside risks to the credibility of our inflation target are actually mirrored already in our FOMC statement, in the sense that for a long period of time running up until July of last year, we made reference to inflation expectations being well anchored.	22	2
201501	4196	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That reference has now disappeared from the opening paragraph of the FOMC statement because the data no longer are in a position to support that as definitively as before.	22	2
201501	4197	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think my concerns are, as I say, reflected in the evolution of the statement itself.	22	2
201501	4198	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Given my concerns, I see our biggest policy problem as not how to tighten further, but, rather, how to bolster the credibility of our inflation target.	22	2
201501	4199	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My answers to the staff’s questions will reflect that perspective.	22	2
201501	4200	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On the first question, there are risks associated both with tightening prematurely and with tightening too late.	22	2
201501	4201	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On the tightening too late, I think that others have covered this ground well.	22	2
201501	4202	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We have a tool that we can use.	22	2
201501	4203	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It takes will, as President Plosser has emphasized in his comments, and President Williams emphasized in his, but I look around the table and I don’t have any concerns on that dimension.	22	2
201501	4204	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I see that will around the table.	22	2
201501	4205	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On the other hand, I think the risks associated with a premature liftoff seem considerably more challenging.	22	2
201501	4206	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think the staff memo works through the simulations associated with this.	22	2
201501	4207	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But the risk that I am mainly concerned about is one that was not well addressed in the simulation, and it is one that we don’t really understand that much about, as Governor Tarullo talked about, something that is so critical in our formulation of our policy and our thinking about policy: inflation expectations.	22	2
201501	4208	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s not really that well modeled.	22	2
201501	4209	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The main risk that I’m concerned about, the downside risk to the credibility of our 2 percent target, is not well captured in those simulations.	22	2
201501	4210	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we were to lift off against a backdrop of low and/or falling inflation and inflation compensation—I’m afraid I actually heard a number of people basically expressing a willingness to do that around the table—I think we would be failing to show resolve to bring inflation back up to our target.	22	2
201501	4211	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	However we think inflation issues are shaped, the messaging that we are willing to tighten policy, even though inflation is low or falling and inflation compensation measures also look like that, would surely worsen any existing credibility risk.	22	2
201501	4212	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think the reason to be concerned about this unanchoring to the downside is that it just seems extremely challenging for central banks to address this situation.	22	2
201501	4213	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The recent experiences in Sweden, Japan, and the euro zone just show how difficult it can be for central banks to recover if inflation falls following premature tightening.	22	2
201501	4214	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That talks through some of my thinking about the first question.	22	2
201501	4215	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of the second question, what data would we need to see at liftoff, I see two necessary conditions for liftoff.	22	2
201501	4216	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I might want to see more than those.	22	2
201501	4217	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But the data need to be consistent with the economy meeting the 2 percent inflation objective over a one-to-two-year horizon.	22	2
201501	4218	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One key sign of that outlook would be a Board staff forecast that inflation will be greater than or equal to 2 percent within two years.	22	2
201501	4219	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It would be good for the Committee to be able to say in its statement, “We expect inflation to be greater than or equal to 2 percent within two years.”	22	2
201501	4220	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we felt comfortable doing that, I think that would be consistent with the kind of data flow that I’m looking for.	22	2
201501	4221	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, there is skepticism about point forecasts.	22	2
201501	4222	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	For me, a point forecast is just a way to summarize a probability distribution.	22	2
201501	4223	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What I’m trying to say here is that actually the risk of inflation being above 2 percent is at least as large as the risk of inflation being below 2 percent.	22	2
201501	4224	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m just using that number as a summary of a mass of probabilities.	22	2
201501	4225	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The second piece of information I would need to see is that longer-term market-based inflation expectations have to have risen back to their historically normal ranges, and that would give me confidence that longer-term inflation expectations are indeed well anchored on our 2 percent goal.	22	2
201501	4226	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I haven’t specifically mentioned wage pressures.	22	2
201501	4227	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that would feed into my inflation outlook.	22	2
201501	4228	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There are reasons to think that wage pressures are going to lag as opposed to lead inflation, and there are reasons to think changes in productivity growth could influence the relationship between wages and inflation.	22	2
201501	4229	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But my two necessary conditions are confidence in the inflation outlook and that the longer-term market-based measures are again well anchored.	22	2
201501	4230	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of language, I echo President Williams and President Mester.	22	2
201501	4231	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think any time is a good time to go back to the statement and try to reorganize or restructure it.	22	2
201501	4232	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My staff would be glad to be of help on that.	22	2
201501	4233	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My research director, Sam Schulhofer-Wohl, is a former journalist.	22	2
201501	4234	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that perspective would be helpful to the Committee in thinking about this issue.	22	2
201501	4235	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	For myself, one thing I would emphasize is that there is a lot of backward-looking language in the statement—where we have been, how has it influenced policy decisionmaking.	22	2
201501	4236	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Monetary policy operates with a lag, as others have noted.	22	2
201501	4237	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think our decisionmaking should be relentlessly forward looking, and our language should be relentlessly forward looking in the statement.	22	2
201501	4238	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	4239	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	22	2
201501	4240	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	22	2
201501	4241	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	4242	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I view the first question—how the Committee should weigh the risks of lifting off prematurely versus the risks of waiting too long—as an instance of the universal risk of monetary conditions being too accommodative or too restrictive.	22	2
201501	4243	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	The former keeps the real rate below what the evolving needs of the economy would require and would generate excessively accommodative monetary conditions, and the opposite, too-restrictive policy, generates too little inflation and real activity.	22	2
201501	4244	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	My sense is that a substantial increase in real economic growth is occurring now, and together with the continued tightening of labor markets suggests rising nominal interest rates are warranted.	22	2
201501	4245	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	The public generally expects us to wait until June or so, and inflation expectations remain stable—they aren’t elevating.	22	2
201501	4246	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Those two facts suggest to me, although they don’t guarantee this, that lifting off in June would not be too late or too early.	22	2
201501	4247	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Regarding the second question, given the data we have on hand now, I am already reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over time.	22	2
201501	4248	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I’m not certain, but I’m reasonably confident.	22	2
201501	4249	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I base that on the stability of virtually every indicator of inflation expectations we have and the fact that the decline in oil prices that seems to have been the major recent threat to the stability of inflation expectations appears to have bottomed out.	22	2
201501	4250	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	If they resume falling, they could pose a threat to our credibility, but until then I think we should remain on track for a June liftoff.	22	2
201501	4251	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	When we lift off I would need to see continued stability in a broad range of measures of inflation expectations, as opposed to breakevens, in order to remain reasonably confident that inflation would move back to 2 percent.	22	2
201501	4252	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I’d also like to see core inflation stable and then rising at that point.	22	2
201501	4253	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Regarding the statement language, I like the idea of dropping the word “patient” in March.	22	2
201501	4254	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	President Rosengren argued that we wait until one meeting before liftoff to drop the word “patient.”	22	2
201501	4255	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I actually advocated that approach in December when I said that the word “patient” should mean just the next meeting.	22	2
201501	4256	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	You took that off the table.	22	2
201501	4257	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Waiting until one meeting before and then moving—I don’t way to say it would make you a liar—would undermine our communications—let’s put it that way.	22	2
201501	4258	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Now a corollary to making “patient” mean the next two meetings is that we have to decide in March about June, but I think we need to be very clear about what we’re deciding in March.	22	2
201501	4259	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I don’t think we’re deciding to raise rates if we take “patient” out in March.	22	2
201501	4260	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	What we’re deciding in March if we take “patient” out is to leave June on the table.	22	2
201501	4261	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	In terms of crafting language, that’s important to me.	22	2
201501	4262	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	The way I feel about policy and raising rates, I’m attracted to President Mester’s language, which says “Based on its current assessment, the Committee anticipates that an increase in the target range will be appropriate in a couple of meetings.”	22	2
201501	4263	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Now, I understand that’s strong relative to the proposal that’s on the table here, which is “could potentially warrant” or “may warrant” or “could cause us to think about,” or whatever.	22	2
201501	4264	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I mean, it kind of strikes me as on the wishy-washy side.	22	2
201501	4265	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	But, I don’t think it’s a choice in March.	22	2
201501	4266	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Let me emphasize this.	22	2
201501	4267	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	We’re not choosing between starting a countdown and not starting a countdown because that raises the bar too high.	22	2
201501	4268	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I think we should be finding language that’s suitably contingent and suitably open-ended, if that’s important to getting the Committee on board for dropping “patient” in March.	22	2
201501	4269	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I’m flexible enough to be able to endorse such more elastic language.	22	2
201501	4270	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	But I’ll tell you that if the data evolve the way it looks like it will evolve, my sentiments would be more closely aligned with President Mester’s language.	22	2
201501	4271	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I like other suggestions President Mester made.	22	2
201501	4272	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I like moving “reinvestments” to the beginning of the policy passage, because it’s a key component of our policy stance.	22	2
201501	4273	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I like “realized and expected progress” better than “deviations,” because the latter, as President Plosser points out, connotes excessive precision about our estimate of the maximum employment objective.	22	2
201501	4274	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I also prefer her version of conditionality.	22	2
201501	4275	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	It strikes me as more direct and straightforward.	22	2
201501	4276	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I think the choice in these simulations, “early and gradual” versus “late and steep,” is really not a realistic set of options available to us.	22	2
201501	4277	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	If we delayed an expected liftoff at a time when people were expecting us to lift off, I’m trying to think of what statement we would write that would preserve the average expected path of the funds rate.	22	2
201501	4278	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	In the case in which we delay liftoff, it’s hard for me to think of something that doesn’t at the same time cause market participants to lower their expected path of the funds rate.	22	2
201501	4279	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I just don’t see how we can do that.	22	2
201501	4280	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I don’t think it’s a real choice available to us.	22	2
201501	4281	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I agree, in that regard, with Presidents Bullard and Fisher that counting on being able to make up for delay with a faster pace of tightening is really unrealistic.	22	2
201501	4282	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I’d also say I’m not favorably disposed to a laundry list of economic indicators in our statement along the lines President Evans suggests.	22	2
201501	4283	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	There’s something inevitably clunky and inevitably distracting about that, and I think we should keep our statement at a high level.	22	2
201501	4284	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Those are my remarks, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	4285	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	22	2
201501	4286	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	22	2
201501	4287	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	4288	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m going to take each of the questions in turn.	22	2
201501	4289	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the risks are asymmetric in terms of the timing, and the cost of lifting off too early and having to reverse course are higher than the cost of lifting off later and having to catch up.	22	2
201501	4290	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	There are two reasons why I reached that conclusion.	22	2
201501	4291	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	First, if you lift off too early, you increase the risk that you’ll have to reverse course and then you end up back at the zero lower bound.	22	2
201501	4292	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s bad because the zero lower bound is not a good place to be, as our tools are limited, and because reversal back to the zero lower bound could prove damaging to our credibility.	22	2
201501	4293	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, it strikes me in terms of risk diversification later and faster is preferable to early-and-slower because, in the former case, any regret about being late should at least be somewhat mitigated by the fact that the economy is stronger than expected and you are making more rapid progress back toward your objectives.	22	2
201501	4294	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think of the outcome as a lose-win type of situation.	22	2
201501	4295	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	In the case where you lift off too early, not only are you stuck with your policy mistake, but you also have an economy that is further away from your objectives.	22	2
201501	4296	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think of that outcome as more of a lose–lose case.	22	2
201501	4297	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, that all being said, I think this debate doesn’t really get you that far because I have no idea about whether, when we lift off, we’re early and gradual or we’re late and fast.	22	2
201501	4298	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Because we don’t have any certainty about that, I just don’t think it gets us very far.	22	2
201501	4299	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	This question doesn’t really speak to me that much.	22	2
201501	4300	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of developments, I would need to be confident about inflation heading back toward our 2 percent objective.	22	2
201501	4301	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think, just like everybody else, it’s hard to characterize all the necessary conditions that you would have to see.	22	2
201501	4302	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Obviously, where you are, what you expect in the future, and the degree of confidence you have in that forecast are all very important.	22	2
201501	4303	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, I think there are several things that are important for me.	22	2
201501	4304	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	First, what happens to labor compensation?	22	2
201501	4305	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this is important in several respects.	22	2
201501	4306	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I consider two alternative scenarios in terms of nominal wage growth over the next few months.	22	2
201501	4307	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	First, trends in nominal wage growth stay flat or firm.	22	2
201501	4308	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	In that case, there’s two inferences from that.	22	2
201501	4309	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	One is that real income trends will be quite solid because inflation will be falling relative to growth in compensation.	22	2
201501	4310	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	That will support continued growth in the economy.	22	2
201501	4311	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The second is that the decline in actual inflation and market-based measures of inflation compensation will not be exerting significant restraint on the wage-setting process.	22	2
201501	4312	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	That will suggest there’s not feedback arising from that.	22	2
201501	4313	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The second scenario, of course, would be if both wage compensation trends and inflation weaken.	22	2
201501	4314	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	That would be a negative development because it would mean not only less real income growth, which would have implications for the economic growth outlook, but it would also imply that there were knock-on effects due to lower inflation and lower inflation compensation into wages.	22	2
201501	4315	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If nominal wage growth were to decline in the period ahead, that really would reduce my confidence about inflation trending higher in the future.	22	2
201501	4316	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	The second thing that’s important, obviously, is how far away we appear to be from our objectives.	22	2
201501	4317	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	This includes what happens to the unemployment rate and other indicators of labor market slack.	22	2
201501	4318	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Less slack, broadly defined, means I’d be more inclined to lift off.	22	2
201501	4319	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	It also includes what’s happening in terms of inflation.	22	2
201501	4320	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Here I’d look through the transitory factors pushing inflation down and focus more on aspects of inflation, such as services price inflation, that are less likely to be influenced by oil prices and the exchange value of the dollar.	22	2
201501	4321	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	A third factor that’s important is how fast are we likely to close those gaps?	22	2
201501	4322	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	On the economic growth side, this would include financial market variables, such as exchange rate value of the dollar and developments abroad.	22	2
201501	4323	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, is the foreign growth outlook improving or not?	22	2
201501	4324	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	On the inflation side, as I said before, what’s happening to wages and inflation expectations?	22	2
201501	4325	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, what are the risks associated with the outlook?	22	2
201501	4326	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Right now there is considerable concern about the outlook for foreign economic growth.	22	2
201501	4327	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	If that subsided, then I’d be more inclined to lift off.	22	2
201501	4328	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the statement language, I think that what’s been proposed is pretty good, but one problem with it is it doesn’t really fit all the circumstances that we might find ourselves in in March.	22	2
201501	4329	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I can imagine a situation in March in which we think that the probability of moving in June is quite low, and if we thought the probability of moving in June was quite low, then we probably would want to stick with the “patient” language.	22	2
201501	4330	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I can imagine the second possibility, under which the probability of moving in June was moderate.	22	2
201501	4331	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	We weren’t really sure whether we wanted to move in June, and we wanted to keep our options open.	22	2
201501	4332	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think in that case you’d instead want to have the kind of language that President Williams suggested, that is more open ended—putting it on the table without committing ourselves.	22	2
201501	4333	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	But we could find ourselves in March in a situation in which the economy is doing really well and we’re really sure, highly confident that we want to move in June.	22	2
201501	4334	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	In that case, the language that was suggested might be appropriate, that is, “a couple of meetings.”	22	2
201501	4335	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I would actually prefer to have language that was crafted for the degree of confidence that we have in March, frankly, because I don’t want to get into a situation in which we’re saying, “Oh, well, we can’t move to this language, because that’s going to pre-commit us to June too strongly.”	22	2
201501	4336	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me we need to craft language that gives us the degree of optionality that we actually want to have.	22	2
201501	4337	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I would actually suggest that the staff develop a couple of alternatives that map into highly likely we want to move in June, not so likely—I don’t know, perhaps two or three alternatives.	22	2
201501	4338	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Then, I think that will be easier to get the Committee to a consensus if the language actually matches the probability of when we think we will actually move.	22	2
201501	4339	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	This also should be a way of making sure we communicate more clearly to the market.	22	2
201501	4340	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	4341	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	22	2
201501	4342	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	22	2
201501	4343	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	4344	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I would like to congratulate the staff on the quality of the memos we received, including some circulated in September that were also relevant to the discussions we’re having today.	22	2
201501	4345	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	They’re very useful.	22	2
201501	4346	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	In the language we’re using now, as Vice Chairman Dudley has just said, March would be our last opportunity to send a message that we might move in June.	22	2
201501	4347	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	So if we don’t send that message, I think we’re saying we’re going to not move before September, and I’ll come back to that.	22	2
201501	4348	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	What would we want to see?	22	2
201501	4349	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Well, we’d obviously like to see continuing increases in employment and declines in unemployment.	22	2
201501	4350	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We’d like to see some signs of a return of either inflation or nominal wage growth or both, and the question is, what inflation?	22	2
201501	4351	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Well, we tend to say “core,” because core leaves things out.	22	2
201501	4352	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	But what core inflation doesn’t leave out are the secondary effects of oil that operate through the prices of other goods.	22	2
201501	4353	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We also have commodity price declines affecting inflation.	22	2
201501	4354	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think that looking through the effect of oil and looking at core inflation are the same thing.	22	2
201501	4355	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We are likely to see a decline in core inflation, a decline that is likely to go away as the oil price stabilizes, wherever it stabilizes, and which could turn around rather quickly if, as some people think, we might see the oil price back in the range of $70 per barrel or so later in the year.	22	2
201501	4356	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	The question that I’d like to ask is if we relate to core inflation, when do we think we’ll move?	22	2
201501	4357	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	It’s very unlikely we’re going to see very much by September, unless the price of oil turns around, which seems to mean that we’d move in December if we’re waiting to see core inflation, say, getting up to 1½ percent.	22	2
201501	4358	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We need to think about whether that’s what we’d like to do or whether we want to craft language that will give us some possibility of changing our mind on having to have core inflation, let’s say, above 1.4 percent.	22	2
201501	4359	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Now, there’s a range of views about whether 1.5 percent is enough.	22	2
201501	4360	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I, deep down, believe that the Phillips curve exists and has a negative slope.	22	2
201501	4361	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I’m not certain that I believe that it’s vertical in the long run, but I believe that it’s a lot more vertical than it has been at rates of unemployment that, until recently, were high and inflation very low.	22	2
201501	4362	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I think we’ll need to weigh what happens to our credibility if we have to wait longer than we now think, and you can say a lot of things about that, but we have to remember that there are two sides to that issue.	22	2
201501	4363	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	You remember that, in 1994, the FOMC waited.	22	2
201501	4364	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	It added to its credibility because it turned out to be right, or at least the former Chairman turned out to be right.	22	2
201501	4365	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	It’s a question of whether we’re going to be confident that what we do is correct, and I think there will be some questions about that.	22	2
201501	4366	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I’d like to add a few comments on two issues about the question of early and gradual versus late and steep.	22	2
201501	4367	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	The staff’s stochastic simulations show outcomes are very similar.	22	2
201501	4368	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I’m not absolutely sure of the reasons, but if we are looking at a fully rational set of expectations, the similarity must come from the fact that they’re looking to future interest rates and future interest rate paths because, within two years, the two paths of interest rates converge.	22	2
201501	4369	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Future interest rate paths will look very alike.	22	2
201501	4370	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I suppose that’s one factor.	22	2
201501	4371	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	The other factor, which is very important, I think relates to something President Lacker said or somebody down there said.	22	2
201501	4372	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I’ll take credit if it’s a good thing.	22	2
201501	4373	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	22	2
201501	4374	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Somebody implied that the shocks are different in the two cases.	22	2
201501	4375	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	But the shocks are the same.	22	2
201501	4376	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	They run it in such a way that the two policies face the same set of shocks, and so that, as well as the fact that the expectations are the same, gives a certain similarity to the policies.	22	2
201501	4377	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t know which is more important.	22	2
201501	4378	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I suspect that the role of the shocks is, and what that means, and it’s something that I think we need to bear in mind, is that we really can’t confidently say “gradual.”	22	2
201501	4379	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We are going to be driven by future shocks, as much as anything.	22	2
201501	4380	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	The shocks in the stochastic simulations are not chosen to be particularly large; they’re drawn from the history of past shocks.	22	2
201501	4381	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	And I think—and I’ve heard it said by several people, and I think I’ve heard the Chair say it on some occasions—the argument that we need to try and get a bit away from forward guidance during this period, which was just made by somebody up there [laughter]—by President Williams—is particularly valid because we are going into a stochastic world and that means that forward guidance is going to be a problem, and we should forget about it.	22	2
201501	4382	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Now, just building on that, with regard to the statements, I particularly value in the statement that it goes in the direction of making it clear that we will react to events as they happen and that we might—and there’s an explicit statement to this effect—change direction at times if the data come in that way.	22	2
201501	4383	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I think that’s very important because it is striking that, looking at the sequences of interest rate paths since 1994, there really is a tendency to keep going for a long time in one direction and there are very few reversals.	22	2
201501	4384	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Maybe that reflects how deeply the business cycle is the driving force in this economy and that it’s obvious to everybody.	22	2
201501	4385	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I suspect that we have a very high weight on not wanting to change direction, and we need to think about that as we move ahead from the decision that we make.	22	2
201501	4386	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I’m sure that my recommendation will be—I’m not allowed to talk about that, right?	22	2
201501	4387	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	You can.	22	2
201501	4388	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	You look discouraged.	22	2
201501	4389	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I am discouraged.	22	2
201501	4390	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I’ll tell you what my recommendation will be later.	22	2
201501	4391	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	22	2
201501	4392	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	4393	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Let me begin by joining President Williams and Vice Chairman Dudley and, I think, Governor Fischer in suggesting that the question before us is not whether we want to wait too long or we want to go too early.	22	2
201501	4394	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	The question is trying to select the best moment to go, and I, at least, read the staff memo not as posing that question to us, but instead trying to make us think about what the costs of going too early or too late would be if, ex post, we figured out that we had erred a bit.	22	2
201501	4395	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	In that spirit, I guess I would say that an important going-in position for me is that in the current circumstances, with inflation running as persistently below target as it has been, I actually see us having an opportunity to fulfill more the mandate of maximum employment by not prematurely removing accommodation, allowing what I believe to be continued substantial slack in the labor market to further dissipate, but as the dual mandate instructs us to do, making sure that we are doing that in that famous Federal Reserve phrase, “in the context of price stability.”	22	2
201501	4396	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	As I suggested yesterday, I think there is a good argument to be made for the proposition that the natural rate of unemployment is actually lower and perhaps significantly lower than the current rates that many of us have been specifying.	22	2
201501	4397	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I forgot to mention yesterday that some of the staff in the pre-FOMC briefings had made the very good point that the part time for economic reasons statistic not only suggests that there are people who would like to be working full time and aren’t, but if you push behind those numbers you’ll see that the number of multiple job holders is lower than it has been historically, suggesting that there is yet another dimension of slack there.	22	2
201501	4398	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	But even with that predisposition, I have had to ask myself and the Kiley-Nelson- Reifschneider memo pushed me to ask myself, “Okay, what’s the limiting principle here?”	22	2
201501	4399	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	That is, what are the conditions under which we should be lifting off as opposed to why I should be inclined to delay to allow the further improvement in the labor market to take place?	22	2
201501	4400	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think it’s easy.	22	2
201501	4401	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I haven’t really heard anything today that makes it any easier, although I think, as he often does, President Lockhart gave a very balanced and fair-minded set of conditions that we might look to, which I thought were helpfully supplemented by a number of you, most recently Bill and Stan.	22	2
201501	4402	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	But, again, being honest with myself, I don’t think there are going to be particular triggers that are going to be particularly convincing to me and probably to many of you, except for those of you who have wanted to raise rates for some time now, and so you’re not going to need any additional trigger to think that it ought to go up.	22	2
201501	4403	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Under those circumstances, yes, I’ll be looking for some of the things that many of you have indicated.	22	2
201501	4404	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	However, I’m not sure how much guidance I’m giving myself or we’re giving one another in talking about these things because I suspect, in the end, as with many of the decisions that we reach, they will be data dependent, but because the data are not all that predictable and the mix of data and the conditions are not that predictable, it will end up being a kind of gestalt-like judgment.	22	2
201501	4405	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Here I have been skeptical about a lot of predictions about where wages and other things were going to go based on past patterns just because so much has been different.	22	2
201501	4406	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	When President Williams was alluding to the 1965 experience today what immediately leapt into my head was, “Oh, but this was the classic period of the Johnson Administration wanting guns and butter.”	22	2
201501	4407	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	It was a period of enormous increases in federal government expenditures, which, of course, did lead to a bunch of inflation and eventually led to the demise of the Bretton Woods system.	22	2
201501	4408	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	There was an awful lot going on in the background.	22	2
201501	4409	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think the risks of big fiscal stimulus are all that great right now.	22	2
201501	4410	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	All of that leads me, actually, to what is, in many respects, is the most important point for me, and this, again, is one that President Williams, Vice Chairman Dudley, and Governor Fischer, have all addressed, and that is the language.	22	2
201501	4411	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	The reason, for me at least, that the language is important is that I had perhaps mistakenly understood the insertion and contemplated removal of the “patient” language not as flipping the kitchen timer and saying, “Okay, the egg is going to be done in three minutes,” but instead as meaning that we would collectively have seen enough improvement in the economy that we were now close to the more normal circumstance in which federal funds rate actions are potentially on the table at any FOMC meeting, not that we are in some strongly presumptive mode of saying two meetings from now it goes up.	22	2
201501	4412	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I fear that President Lockhart is right and that markets actually do believe that right now “patient” comes out and the clock starts and, two meetings later, rates go up.	22	2
201501	4413	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	If that is, indeed, the case, then my threshold for agreeing to the removal of that language is essentially going to be, am I ready to raise rates—which obviously is a higher threshold.	22	2
201501	4414	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	How do we avoid getting to that point?	22	2
201501	4415	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I think there are two complementary ways of doing it.	22	2
201501	4416	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	The first is through the Chair’s statements—and Vice Chairman Dudley and Governor Fischer, perhaps, complementing the Chair’s statements—that give more of a sense that I’ve just given of what “patient” would mean.	22	2
201501	4417	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I know there are already planned opportunities for the Chair in the month of February to do that and perhaps derivable opportunities for Vice Chairman Dudley and Governor Fischer to do the same thing in that period.	22	2
201501	4418	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	It will be a lot of work because I think we’re running against expectations that this is now going to be something like an automatic move, but I think we have to do that.	22	2
201501	4419	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	The second way, as a number of you have suggested, is to make changes in the language from what the staff suggested.	22	2
201501	4420	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t have language, but from my point of view, the desideratum would be basically language that said, “In light of improvements in the economy, the Committee anticipates that increases in the federal funds rate may be considered beginning in the relatively near future.”	22	2
201501	4421	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	But then there’s no preset course, and there’s data dependency and all the other things that we start to say, but basically we’re trying to support this notion that we’re now moving into a normal analytic mode, as opposed to the “considerable time” mode or the in- between “patient” mode.	22	2
201501	4422	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I think that has a beneficial side effect for financial stability, and here’s why.	22	2
201501	4423	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	As I said, I think, at the previous meeting, or maybe it was the one before, my guess is that when I’m actually motivated to think it’s time to begin liftoff, I’m as likely, and perhaps more likely, to be motivated by financial stability considerations than fears of price inflation getting substantially and persistently above target.	22	2
201501	4424	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	On financial stability, I have now a very precise metric for thinking about financial stability considerations and when we should be worried about them.	22	2
201501	4425	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	It basically builds on the observations of many market participants that—and these are their terms—there’s going to be turbulence when you guys move.	22	2
201501	4426	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	That’s what they say.	22	2
201501	4427	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	My very precise metric is that it’s definitely okay to have landing-in-Logan-type winds, and, as President Rosengren will tell you, there’s always wind when you land at Logan.	22	2
201501	4428	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	It may be okay to have a landing at O’Hare after a line of storms has passed through, which is a little bit more bracing, but it’s still sort of okay.	22	2
201501	4429	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	What we really don’t want is, when you’re over the North Atlantic and the pilot comes on and tells the flight attendants to take their seats because—and some of you, I’m sure, have been through that—that’s when things can, in fact, get out of hand a bit.	22	2
201501	4430	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I believe that if we change the language in a way that I suggested, it’s basically saying to the world, it’s now on the table:  The possibility of federal funds rate increases is going to be actively debated at probably each succeeding meeting now that rates are in play—we may not do it, but it’s going to be a real discussion at each succeeding meeting.	22	2
201501	4431	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	If so, I think you’re going to get a fair amount of movement in financial markets because people who have thought that things are more or less a one-way bet, which they had to turn around during the “taper tantrum” and slipped back there, are going to once again be rethinking.	22	2
201501	4432	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	People are going to be making different calculations.	22	2
201501	4433	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Everybody is going to be a little bit more sensitive to “Gee, what do you think?	22	2
201501	4434	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Are they at the point of doing it now?”	22	2
201501	4435	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	That will entail some measure of de facto tightening and a little less accommodation in financial markets.	22	2
201501	4436	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	But I think that’s a reasonable price to pay in order for us to be able, in a macroeconomic sense, to lift off at the right time as opposed to at a time when we still may have some uncertainty about the strength of the labor market, when, as Governor Brainard was alluding to yesterday, we may still be worried that further strengthening of the dollar will have a further disinflationary effect, or the like.	22	2
201501	4437	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I realize that most of the early part is not as precise as it may be, but I really hope that we can come up with, not just different language, but a very clear and agreed-upon understanding of what that different language means so that people like myself are not placed in a position of opposing the removal of “patient” on the grounds that it’s a liftoff, but instead we can support the removal of “patient” on the grounds that it just gets things into play and actually will cause market participants, as us, to make different kinds of bets and have different kinds of expectations.	22	2
201501	4438	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	4439	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	22	2
201501	4440	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	22	2
201501	4441	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	4442	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	On “too soon” versus “too late,”	22	2
201501	4443	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I continue to think that the risks of going a meeting too soon are greater than the risks of going a meeting too late.	22	2
201501	4444	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I think as we get closer to the event—and we are really talking, for the most part, about differences of a meeting or two—that consideration weighs less and less for me.	22	2
201501	4445	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	My simple model of this situation is as follows.	22	2
201501	4446	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	First, the real economy is eliminating slack at a gallop, and on that path some slack remains, but essentially all of it will be gone by the end of this year, roughly speaking.	22	2
201501	4447	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Inflation and inflation expectations and interest rates, at a minimum, haven’t gotten the memo on that—and it may in fact be that they are sending signals of possibilities of bad outcomes.	22	2
201501	4448	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Policy is in a position to be patient, to see whether these bad outcomes materialize, to see whether we start to see a shrinking deviation from our inflation goal rather than a growing one.	22	2
201501	4449	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	But policy can’t be indefinitely patient in this situation, in which slack is being eliminated so quickly.	22	2
201501	4450	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	For me, what that means, ultimately, is that it will be appropriate to lift off in June or September.	22	2
201501	4451	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Now, as others have remarked, putting June on the table would mean taking the “patient” language out of the statement at the March meeting, which is seven weeks away.	22	2
201501	4452	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	It is, I would say, not more than 50 percent likely, and probably significantly less than 50 percent likely, that we will get incoming data that would provide confidence to do that in seven weeks.	22	2
201501	4453	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	In fact, it is probably equally likely that we will get data that suggests we are still moving further away on some measures, either in inflation expectations or in core inflation.	22	2
201501	4454	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	The other problem here is that making that language change in March could potentially trigger liftoff, because the opposite of “unlikely to lift off for at least two meetings” is “likely to lift off in the next two meetings”—specifically, two meetings out.	22	2
201501	4455	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I’ll come back to that language change in a second.	22	2
201501	4456	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I actually think, if the January and February employment reports are really strong and global conditions settle down and that kind of thing, I could well be standing at the June meeting thinking it would be good to lift off now.	22	2
201501	4457	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I think it’s a lot less likely that I would be in a position of feeling so confident as to do that at the time of the March meeting.	22	2
201501	4458	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	As I said, fortunately, conditions are such that the Committee can be patient, and I would add to those, frankly, at least domestically and importantly, financial conditions.	22	2
201501	4459	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I have been concerned that there would be bubble conditions and things like that, which would suggest that we should move faster rather than sooner.	22	2
201501	4460	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I don’t see that at all.	22	2
201501	4461	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Again, I come down on June or September.	22	2
201501	4462	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Now, let me talk for a minute about what I would need to see on inflation.	22	2
201501	4463	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	For me, the strength of economic growth and employment is an important indicator, potentially, in giving confidence that inflation will indeed trend back toward our goal.	22	2
201501	4464	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I can’t really answer the question about inflation in the abstract.	22	2
201501	4465	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I would say, as a general matter, I’m concerned about low inflation, but perhaps less so than some, for two reasons.	22	2
201501	4466	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	First, we’ve got transitory shocks in oil and with regard to the dollar that I don’t see as a threat to the longer-term anchoring of expectations.	22	2
201501	4467	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I wouldn’t personally be alarmed by small fluctuations in the Michigan survey during this unusual period.	22	2
201501	4468	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Of course, those things may or may not be transient, if the dollar and oil keep moving.	22	2
201501	4469	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Second, it would be one thing if these readings were coming in at a time when the economy were weakening, instead of at a time when slack is disappearing very quickly.	22	2
201501	4470	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I feel differently about them because of that factor.	22	2
201501	4471	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	On wages, I would not make that a requirement.	22	2
201501	4472	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I don’t think we know enough about the relationship between wages and price inflation to effectively make that a threshold.	22	2
201501	4473	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	On core inflation, I would distinguish between what I’d like to see and what I would need to see.	22	2
201501	4474	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Of course, I’d like to see real evidence of it moving back up.	22	2
201501	4475	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Honestly, I think I’d need to see that the transitory lows that we’ve seen in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year are in fact transitory.	22	2
201501	4476	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	We need to have good reasons to think that those are transitory, and you certainly would need not to see it moving further away from the goal.	22	2
201501	4477	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	In September, I would say that as time passes, the bar gets lower for what I would want to see, or need to see, on inflation.	22	2
201501	4478	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	In other words, as slack disappears, that has to be increasing my confidence that inflation will, in fact, come up.	22	2
201501	4479	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Turning quickly to the statement language:  I think that folks have now put their finger on the issue, which is it would be great to have a technology for changing “patient” in a way that gives us a range of meetings—four or five meetings, a few meetings—rather than just the next couple of meetings.	22	2
201501	4480	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	If we’re lifting off in June, the time to do that would be at the March meeting.	22	2
201501	4481	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Unfortunately, that makes it even more difficult to lift off in June.	22	2
201501	4482	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	If we don’t lift off in June, I think we can work on language that would make it easier to do that in September.	22	2
201501	4483	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I’ll save any other comments on the statement.	22	2
201501	4484	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I think the statement language that we have is quite good, and I think that this point is more important than the other small points I’ll make later.	22	2
201501	4485	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	4486	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	22	2
201501	4487	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I just have a quick question.	22	2
201501	4488	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	You said you may not feel confident enough in March to remove “patient,” but maybe you would, say, in June.	22	2
201501	4489	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	What would be wrong with, for instance, removing “patient” in April and signaling action in August?	22	2
201501	4490	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	We’re back to the quarterly press conference question, are we?	22	2
201501	4491	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	That’s why we have meetings.	22	2
201501	4492	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	No, I realize that.	22	2
201501	4493	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	You’re right.	22	2
201501	4494	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I am taking it as a given, for purposes of this comment, that we have four press conferences a year and that this is going to be a June event or a September event, President Bullard.	22	2
201501	4495	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	If we had chosen some time ago to have press conferences at a bunch of these meetings, it would be a different situation, but we didn’t make that choice.	22	2
201501	4496	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think it’s just thwarting decisionmaking around the Committee.	22	2
201501	4497	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Why are we doing this?	22	2
201501	4498	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	We say it’s data dependent.	22	2
201501	4499	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I am very willing to reconsider the issue of timing of press conferences.	22	2
201501	4500	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think we need to take a serious look at it.	22	2
201501	4501	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	There are not only pros, there are also some cons in terms of how that could affect the operation of the Committee and Committee dynamics.	22	2
201501	4502	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I would like to be careful and thoughtful, but I am open to doing it.	22	2
201501	4503	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think it is something that we need to seriously discuss.	22	2
201501	4504	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Madam Chair, before I do give up the floor, I would just add that, in my view, it is unlikely that seven weeks is going to make a big difference in terms of the right time to lift off or whether, in hindsight, we would look back and say, “Wow, I really wish we had lifted off seven weeks earlier or later.”	22	2
201501	4505	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I don’t think there is that much in question.	22	2
201501	4506	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	22	2
201501	4507	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	4508	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	There is actually, in a sense, six months at stake, because in March, if you take June off the table by leaving “patient” in, it means—unless we have a press conference in August—waiting six months until September.	22	2
201501	4509	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Sorry, Jeff, but liftoff would either be in June or September.	22	2
201501	4510	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	It’s three months.	22	2
201501	4511	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Right, right.	22	2
201501	4512	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	But if you decide in March you’re not comfortable and you want to leave “patient” in, you take June off the table, and it means you’re confident that you won’t want to move before September.	22	2
201501	4513	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I think we are overlooking expectations in all this.	22	2
201501	4514	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	When we send a sharp signal that we’re going to do something, rates are going to move.	22	2
201501	4515	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We’ll be seeing the effect of our decision spread over several months.	22	2
201501	4516	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	It’s not quite six months; it’s spread out a bit more over the period.	22	2
201501	4517	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	22	2
201501	4518	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	4519	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I thought I’d say something now that I planned to say in the policy round, because it has been brought up by President Bullard, and then you responded.	22	2
201501	4520	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I just was going to suggest that you and the Committee consider a temporary policy of press conferences spanning a period conceivably starting March or April through September, with the statement that at that time we would review the need for that frequency of press conferences.	22	2
201501	4521	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	But I continue to think that something has to be done about, effectively, the problem that Governor Powell has put on the table.	22	2
201501	4522	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I think, in this period, we want every combination of one or two meetings to be possible.	22	2
201501	4523	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	That’s what I was going to say in the policy round, so I’ll say it now.	22	2
201501	4524	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	4525	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I agree.	22	2
201501	4526	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	We will think about that very carefully.	22	2
201501	4527	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	22	2
201501	4528	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	4529	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	My own thinking about the timing of liftoff and the pace of tightening thereafter hinges on four considerations: the underlying momentum in the real economy, and its likely ability to sustain that strength as monetary policy support is withdrawn; confidence that inflation will move back to our target in the next couple of years; recognition of the asymmetry in our ability to respond to the need for a policy correction; and vigilance about financial stability risks.	22	2
201501	4530	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	On the domestic activity front, at the time of liftoff I expect to see continued evidence that the underlying momentum is sufficiently robust to withstand a tightening of monetary policy on top of likely ongoing financial tightening associated with a strong dollar.	22	2
201501	4531	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The Tealbook forecast of household demand and business investment through the first half of this year, with employment continuing to grow at or above 200,000 per month; consumption increasing by around 4 percent, supported by the gain in real disposable income from lower prices at the pump; and business fixed investment continuing to advance despite a temporary drag from falling drilling and mining investment would meet those requirements.	22	2
201501	4532	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	We are much less likely to see convincing evidence by the time of liftoff to provide full confidence of the return of inflation to its 2 percent target.	22	2
201501	4533	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Because of the large influence of the recent decline in energy prices on inflation, it is highly unlikely we are going to see signs in the next few quarters of actual headline inflation moving back to 2 percent.	22	2
201501	4534	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	So we are probably going to need to rely on a pattern of improvement across a variety of related indicators for some assurance that we are on track.	22	2
201501	4535	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Ideally, I think we would want to see monthly increases in core inflation moving up from the very low levels that have been reached, or, at minimum, to have some confidence that an inflection point has been reached.	22	2
201501	4536	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	It is also critical to be sure that inflation expectations remain well anchored.	22	2
201501	4537	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	In that regard, I think it will be, at least, necessary that survey measures remain stable, but I think it would also be encouraging to see some correction in longer-run inflation compensation from current very low levels.	22	2
201501	4538	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I would also take reassurance from some stabilization or even a correction in the value of the dollar that the drag on inflation from declining import prices will begin to wane.	22	2
201501	4539	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	It would, of course, be reassuring to see signs of increasing wage pressures, but for reasons that I think have already been discussed, I would not necessarily expect that to be in train at the time of liftoff.	22	2
201501	4540	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Realistically, I think it’s very unlikely we are going to have strong confidence in rising inflation by June, or possibly even by September of this year.	22	2
201501	4541	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	We should, I think, anticipate that we are going to have to make a decision in a highly uncertain environment, and, therefore, to maintain some scope to adjust course as we learn about how the market is responding.	22	2
201501	4542	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	This highlights the asymmetry in our toolkit.	22	2
201501	4543	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	In this area, I would say my risk assessment is more animated by the episode of Japan in 2000 than it is by the United States in 2004.	22	2
201501	4544	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I would be very concerned to avoid a risk of returning to the zero lower bound shortly after liftoff, when the options for monetary policy will be limited.	22	2
201501	4545	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, in the current economic environment in which fiscal support is extremely unlikely and the global economy is exerting very deflationary pressures, I think it will make it even more difficult for monetary policy to correct for adverse shocks.	22	2
201501	4546	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think the same risk-management considerations point toward a relatively gradual path of policy initially, in order to leave room for adjustment as we learn more about the underlying strength of activity and inflation, and about the reaction of markets to policy adjustments.	22	2
201501	4547	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	We will also want to be attentive to the possible effects on risks to financial stability of both the timing of liftoff and the pace of our adjustment thereafter.	22	2
201501	4548	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think this is, to a large degree, a countervailing risk that requires a high degree of vigilance, especially in light of the puzzles that we talked about surrounding the decline in longer-term nominal Treasury yields.	22	2
201501	4549	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	It is extremely useful to have the opportunity at this meeting to deliberate now on the likely future path not just of monetary policy but also of communications surrounding the policy path.	22	2
201501	4550	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s very clear from the memo that communications matter, in many respects, very consequentially, at moments of large inflections in the policy path.	22	2
201501	4551	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think we have heard from several people around the table, and I strongly agree, that to the extent we want to keep both June and September on the table for possible liftoff, which I would want to do, providing too much precision in our forward guidance in March paradoxically might actually take June off the table.	22	2
201501	4552	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, I would want to have the option to decide in June, based on data that are available at that time.	22	2
201501	4553	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	But if we have to pre-commit in March to a couple of meetings in specific, I am guessing that the data we have available in March will preclude at least my comfort with making a commitment about June.	22	2
201501	4554	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I had in mind language that was quite similar to what President Williams put on the table, but I’d leave it to the staff to try to figure out how to introduce enough constructive ambiguity in the language while also putting June and September on the table.	22	2
201501	4555	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Finally, I also resonated with a comment made by President Plosser.	22	2
201501	4556	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	The description of the path of possible future policy I think is very difficult to capture in the statement at the timing of liftoff.	22	2
201501	4557	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Unfortunately, I don’t think the proposed language achieves what you are setting out to do.	22	2
201501	4558	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s not clear, as was stated earlier, whether we’re talking about some plateau, whether we’re talking about a lower neutral rate.	22	2
201501	4559	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	In fact, I don’t think we’re actually giving much information about what will affect the path of policy.	22	2
201501	4560	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think it’s also an area in which I would recommend having the staff perhaps provide some additional options.	22	2
201501	4561	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	4562	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Well, I’d like to thank everyone for a very thoughtful discussion and very useful suggestions pertaining to statement language.	22	2
201501	4563	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	We do have difficult choices ahead of us, and I think today’s exchange of views will facilitate our decisionmaking in the coming months and serve to improve our communications.	22	2
201501	4564	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I know we are running late, but if you don’t mind, I’d like to add just a few thoughts of my own to this discussion.	22	2
201501	4565	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to start with conditions that, in my view, would warrant the start of normalization, mention some factors I think should influence the subsequent pace of adjustments, and say a bit about communications.	22	2
201501	4566	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	In my view, conditions in the labor market have improved sufficiently over the past year that taking the first step toward normalization could be warranted in the not-too-distant future.	22	2
201501	4567	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	But I think we need to be careful not to jump the gun.	22	2
201501	4568	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	First of all, while it’s true that most of the policy benchmarks reported in the Tealbook prescribed lifting off today, the case for an immediate tightening becomes much less clear if one varies the assumptions used to calculate those benchmarks.	22	2
201501	4569	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	For example, if the equilibrium real interest rate is currently near zero, as the Laubach-Williams model suggests, and if the natural rate of unemployment is 5 percent, which is my own personal point estimate, then the Taylor (1999) rule currently prescribes a zero federal funds rate.	22	2
201501	4570	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	In a similar vein, an interesting exercise, reported in Tealbook B, shows that optimal-control policy under a nearly pure inflation targeting approach, one that places essentially full weight in the loss function on deviations of inflation from 2 percent, and almost none on the unemployment gap, calls for a much more gradual path to the federal funds rate than the Tealbook baseline.	22	2
201501	4571	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I’m also wary of the prescriptions of the various policy rules, because these benchmarks don’t take adequate account of the many special factors at work in today’s unusual economic environment, including the risks posed by the zero lower bound, the highly uncertain state of conditions abroad, and the many uncertainties pertaining to the likely path of inflation, particularly the continued decline in inflation compensation and the still-weak incoming wage data.	22	2
201501	4572	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think, on balance, these various considerations call for proceeding cautiously.	22	2
201501	4573	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	That said, monetary policy operates with a substantial lag, and we have to act on where we judge the economy is headed, not where it has been.	22	2
201501	4574	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	For that reason, I continue to anticipate that if events develop about in line with the Tealbook projection, with real GDP expanding at a moderate pace, labor conditions strengthening further, and incoming data that allows us to achieve a reasonable degree of confidence that inflation will move up to 2 percent over the next two or three years, then it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate later this year.	22	2
201501	4575	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	As I see it, liftoff could come as soon as the June meeting, even if backward-looking measures of core inflation are still running in the neighborhood of 1½ percent at that time, and headline inflation is running much lower.	22	2
201501	4576	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	But I intend to be particularly alert for any incoming evidence that serves to cast doubt on our projection that inflation will return to 2 percent, in addition, of course, to evidence that might suggest that economic growth at home is faltering or that foreign or financial conditions are evolving in a manner that could cause growth to slow or stall.	22	2
201501	4577	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Such developments, in my view, would suggest the need to delay liftoff.	22	2
201501	4578	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	We have said that we intend to be data dependent, and a failure to alter our plans in response to adverse incoming data pertaining to inflation or the labor market would call that promise into question and reduce our credibility.	22	2
201501	4579	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think we all agree that our actions after the first rate increase should also remain data dependent.	22	2
201501	4580	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Because there is such huge uncertainty about how real activity and inflation will evolve, I also recognize that the trajectory we end up following could easily be steeper or flatter than our SEP paths and could even entail a reversal of direction if conditions turn out to be sufficiently weak.	22	2
201501	4581	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The staff papers document that several other countries that lifted off the zero lower bound had to reverse course, and that could happen to us, too.	22	2
201501	4582	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	All that being said, based on our December SEP submissions, it looks like most of us anticipate a fairly gradual pace of normalization along our modal paths.	22	2
201501	4583	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The median funds rate projection in the SEP increases only 1¼ percentage points per year, on average, through 2017.	22	2
201501	4584	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think it’s worth reflecting on the reasons most of us have written down paths that largely entail only a gradual pace of tightening if economic conditions evolve in line with our forecasts.	22	2
201501	4585	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	As far as my own submission is concerned, I would mention four factors I took into account.	22	2
201501	4586	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	First, I continue to believe that the headwinds that have restrained the expansion for so long have not yet fully abated.	22	2
201501	4587	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Although I’m optimistic they will continue to fade, I anticipate they will do so only gradually.	22	2
201501	4588	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	In other words, I think r* is currently well below its longer-run normal level and rising only gradually.	22	2
201501	4589	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Second, on account of my uncertainty about the response of the economy to tighter monetary policy, I see a rationale for proceeding cautiously, so as not to disrupt the expansion.	22	2
201501	4590	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Third, I recognize that the probability of returning to the zero lower bound after liftoff is quite significant.	22	2
201501	4591	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	As the staff’s analysis suggests, one way of mitigating this risk is to adjust policy gradually in response to changes in slack and inflation, and initially to tighten slowly.	22	2
201501	4592	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, I see a modest transitory undershoot of the natural rate as entailing potential benefits.	22	2
201501	4593	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	As the Tealbook simulation shows, it will permit a somewhat faster return of inflation to 2 percent, and there is also a chance that a strong labor market might draw discouraged workers back into the labor force, boosting potential output.	22	2
201501	4594	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Obviously, proceeding too slowly for too long could eventually have undesirable effects on inflation or financial stability, but I believe careful monitoring of the relevant indicators and a quick and forceful response to credible early warning signs can contain these risks.	22	2
201501	4595	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, a couple of words on communications.	22	2
201501	4596	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The staff suggested in one of the background memos that it would be useful for us to highlight several aspects of our strategy in public communications: First, that we are not on a predetermined course of raising the funds rate 25 basis points per meeting; rather, all adjustments we make will be data dependent.	22	2
201501	4597	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Second, the data-dependent nature of our strategy, coupled with the uncertain outlook for real activity and inflation and other factors, means that the actual trajectory for the funds rate may turn out to be quite different than we or the market currently expect.	22	2
201501	4598	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Conceivably, we may have to reverse course and begin easing again.	22	2
201501	4599	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Such data driven adjustments to policy are not a policy error, but are instead a natural consequence of decisionmaking in real time.	22	2
201501	4600	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, that there are special factors in the current unusual economic environment that argue for proceeding cautiously in normalizing policy, especially in the early stages.	22	2
201501	4601	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I’ve mentioned some that are important to me, and to the extent we can reach some consensus on what factors are important, I think it would be useful to explain those to the public.	22	2
201501	4602	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there, and I thank everyone for a very useful discussion.	22	2
201501	4603	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I am aware of the fact that we have a lunch for President Plosser.	22	2
201501	4604	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let me turn things over to Thomas Laubach, who is going to brief us on our monetary policy alternatives.	22	2
201501	4605	2015-01-28	meeting	LAUBACH	.1  Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	4606	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	22	2
201501	4607	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	For my maiden policy briefing, I wanted to be sure to choose a topic that would be of interest to you.	22	2
201501	4608	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I’m glad to report that I have been successful, because most of what I had wanted to say has already been discussed by several of you.	22	2
201501	4609	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	So I shall be very brief.	22	2
201501	4610	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	My choice of topic, of course, is the declines over the past year in longer-term government bond yields and especially long-horizon forward rates in the United States and a number of foreign economies.	22	2
201501	4611	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	As noted in the upper-left of your first exhibit, a key policy question is whether a lower path for longer-term Treasury yields going forward would call for a higher or a lower future path of short-term rates to achieve the Committee’s objectives.	22	2
201501	4612	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	A box in Tealbook A, discussed several alternative factors that might have contributed to the decline in longer-term yields, and I briefly want to ponder the potential implications of two of these explanations for the appropriate stance of monetary policy.	22	2
201501	4613	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Longer-term yields across several major economies, illustrated in the upper-right, stand now at or near record lows.	22	2
201501	4614	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The Committee’s recent statements noted the decline in far-forward inflation compensation, shown by the black line in the middle- left, which is embedded in longer-term nominal yields.	22	2
201501	4615	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	However, more than half of the decline in longer-horizon nominal forward rates over the past year is due to reductions in longer-horizon real forward rates, shown to the right, which also stand at historically low levels.	22	2
201501	4616	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Their decline could point to a sustained reduction in expectations for global equilibrium real rates—call it “global secular stagnation.”	22	2
201501	4617	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Alternatively, or in addition, real risk premiums may have declined, perhaps because investors increasingly view episodes of low real interest rates as associated with poor economic performance.	22	2
201501	4618	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Information from surveys and financial market prices related to inflation suggest that inflation risk premiums may also have declined, even to negative levels.	22	2
201501	4619	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Longer- horizon survey expectations, including the probability distribution of 5-to-10-year- forward CPI inflation from the Desk’s survey of primary dealers (not shown), have remained stable over the past year.	22	2
201501	4620	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	In contrast, risk-neutral probability distributions derived from inflation caps and floors, shown in the lower-left panel, have shifted down, pointing to an increased desire of investors to insure against low, rather than high, inflation outcomes.	22	2
201501	4621	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	It is conceivable that investors increasingly view episodes of low inflation or deflation as associated with the risk of protracted economic weakness, perhaps reflecting the experience of recent years at the zero lower bound.	22	2
201501	4622	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	As Governor Brainard pointed out yesterday, longer-term Treasury securities with payouts in nominal terms are excellent hedges against such risks, and hence their term premiums would decline.	22	2
201501	4623	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	To the extent that policymakers share the view that such episodes are costlier or more likely than previously thought, they may want to be especially cautious in removing policy accommodation to mitigate those risks.	22	2
201501	4624	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	An alternative explanation could be that a weaker outlook for economic growth abroad or additional policy accommodation by foreign central banks are being transmitted to US long-term yields via a “global portfolio balance channel.”	22	2
201501	4625	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	A piece of evidence in support of this possibility is the similarity in the responses of Treasuries and euro-area sovereign yields to the ECB’s announcement of its expanded asset purchase program last Thursday, shown in the lower-right.	22	2
201501	4626	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Over the 60-minute window following the start of President Draghi’s press conference, 10-year Treasury yields fell by almost the same amount as 10-year bund yields and by more than 10-year Italian government bond yields.	22	2
201501	4627	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Although the similar-size decline in rates on 2017 and 2018 Eurodollar futures contracts might suggest a reduction in policy rate path expectations as far as the United States is concerned, as Simon discussed yesterday, the decline in yields probably reflected mostly a compression of term premiums on Treasuries.	22	2
201501	4628	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Reductions in term premiums resulting from a global search for yield associated with additional policy accommodation abroad, if passed through to private yields in the United States, might call for future short-term rates to be higher, all else being equal, to achieve the appropriate financial conditions; of course, less so, to the extent that is accompanied by a stronger dollar.	22	2
201501	4629	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Turning to the policy alternatives for this meeting, you may view the US economy as more or less on the track you expected at the time of your December meeting.	22	2
201501	4630	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	If so, you may prefer alternative B on page 6, which makes no change to the current stance of monetary policy or the Committee’s forward guidance.	22	2
201501	4631	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	In updating your assessment of economic conditions, paragraph 1 upgrades the description of the recent pace of the economic expansion from “moderate” to “solid” and adds the positive note that “recent declines in energy prices have boosted household purchasing power.”	22	2
201501	4632	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Paragraph 1 notes the recent “strong” job gains and again reports that underutilization of labor resources continues to diminish.	22	2
201501	4633	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Paragraph 2 indicates little change in the Committee’s assessment of the outlook for growth of economic activity or its expectation that labor market indicators will continue to move toward mandate-consistent levels.	22	2
201501	4634	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	With regard to the risks to the outlook for economic activity, alternative B offers an option to point to increased uncertainty regarding the foreign economic outlook in recent months, but, in any case, states that the risks are nearly balanced.	22	2
201501	4635	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	On inflation, paragraph 1 of alternative B indicates that inflation has fallen further over the intermeeting period and attributes the larger shortfall from the Committee’s 2 percent objective “largely” to the drop in energy prices.	22	2
201501	4636	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	It characterizes the decline in market-based measures of inflation compensation in recent months as “substantial” while continuing to report that survey-based measures of inflation expectations have remained stable.	22	2
201501	4637	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Paragraph 2 provides a clearer statement of your expectations for inflation, first recognizing the likelihood that inflation will fall further in the near term, but then stating that you still anticipate that inflation will gradually rise toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves and the transitory effects of the drop in energy prices and other factors dissipate.	22	2
201501	4638	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The remainder of the statement is the same as in December, with the exception of dropping the sentence that you used last month to emphasize that your revised forward-guidance language did not mark a change in the stance of policy.	22	2
201501	4639	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	The retention of the “patient” language would probably be interpreted as signaling that the Committee is unlikely to begin removing accommodation at the March or April meetings.	22	2
201501	4640	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Overall, alternative B appears in line with market expectations.	22	2
201501	4641	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Respondents to the Desk’s surveys generally anticipated no significant change to the Committee’s forward guidance.	22	2
201501	4642	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Most of the updates to paragraphs 1 and 2 would not surprise market participants, although the reference to uncertainty about the global outlook, if included, would garner some attention, particularly given the ECB’s recent announcement.	22	2
201501	4643	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Alternative C, on page 8, may appeal to those of you who believe that the economic expansion has gained momentum and is likely to absorb any remaining economic slack fairly quickly.	22	2
201501	4644	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Paragraph 1 of alternative C takes a more upbeat tone, indicating that the “expansion has gained momentum” and suggesting less concern about further declines in market-based measures of inflation compensation over the intermeeting period.	22	2
201501	4645	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Paragraph 2 indicates that inflation will rise gradually “to”— rather than only “toward”	22	2
201501	4646	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	—2 percent over the medium term; it also drops the cautionary note that “the Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.”	22	2
201501	4647	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Paragraph 2 of alternative C omits any reference to the foreign economic outlook.	22	2
201501	4648	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Reflecting this more positive assessment of the current situation and the outlook for achieving your objectives, paragraph 3 incorporates the suggestion that you discussed earlier for modifying the forward guidance in a way that would provide an interim step between “patience” and guidance that would indicate how the Committee anticipates conducting policy after liftoff.	22	2
201501	4649	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	As Simon indicated yesterday, market participants generally expect liftoff to come around midyear or later.	22	2
201501	4650	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thus, a statement like alternative C would come as a surprise.	22	2
201501	4651	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Medium- and longer-term interest rates would likely rise, inflation compensation and equity prices would probably fall, and the dollar would likely appreciate.	22	2
201501	4652	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, turning to alternative A, on page 4, the information received over the intermeeting period may not have increased your confidence in the durability of the economic expansion; instead, incoming information may have left you concerned that a pernicious cycle of low inflation leading to lower inflation expectations may be getting under way.	22	2
201501	4653	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Paragraph 1 of alternative A does not upgrade the Committee’s assessment of economic activity and adds the note that “wage increases remain subdued.”	22	2
201501	4654	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Alternative A includes the reference to uncertainty about the foreign outlook but, as in alternative B, indicates that the Committee sees the risks to the US outlook for economic activity and the labor market as balanced.	22	2
201501	4655	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	In contrast to alternative B, alternative A signals heightened concerns that inflation could run “substantially below”	22	2
201501	4656	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Alternative A provides two options with regard to forward guidance.	22	2
201501	4657	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Paragraph 3 states that “persistently low wage and price inflation” indicate that—possibly appreciable—“slack remains in the labor market and thus that it is appropriate to be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy.”	22	2
201501	4658	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Or, you may prefer the option in paragraph 3´ of replacing the “patient” language with an inflation floor and of indicating that the Committee would take additional actions if projected inflation remained below 2 percent once energy prices stabilized.	22	2
201501	4659	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Market participants do not anticipate an announcement like alternative A.	22	2
201501	4660	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Either version of the statement would cause investors to push out further their expectation of the date of the first increase in the target federal funds rate.	22	2
201501	4661	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Medium- and longer-term real interest rates would likely decline; inflation compensation and equity prices might rise; and the dollar could depreciate.	22	2
201501	4662	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	A draft directive for all three alternatives is shown on page 11 of your handout.	22	2
201501	4663	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, Madam Chair; that completes my prepared remarks.	22	2
201501	4664	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	22	2
201501	4665	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any questions for Thomas?	22	2
201501	4666	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I just want to highlight one issue before we have the go-round.	22	2
201501	4667	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	You’ll notice that in alternative B there is bracketed language in paragraph 2 pertaining to the foreign economic outlook.	22	2
201501	4668	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you have expressed concerns about this particular formulation, and clearly this is something that is on the table for discussion and is changeable.	22	2
201501	4669	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	22	2
201501	4670	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks, Madam Chair.	22	2
201501	4671	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	In light of the concerns that people have had about the bracketed statement in paragraph 2, which may be driven by the fact that in many senses the foreign economic outlook has become somewhat more certain, rather than uncertain, in recent months, there is an alternative which seems less likely to be objected to.	22	2
201501	4672	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Let me just say that I think we have to refer to foreign developments somewhere in here.	22	2
201501	4673	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We did talk about them a great deal yesterday, and so it’s just a fact that that’s what we’ve been looking at.	22	2
201501	4674	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	The suggestion is to insert “financial and international developments” in paragraph 3, line 8, which starts, “and readings on financial developments,” and to erase the bracketed material about the foreign economic outlook in paragraph 2.	22	2
201501	4675	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	It’s after “financial” on line 8 of paragraph 3 to add the words “and international.”	22	2
201501	4676	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	22	2
201501	4677	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Can I ask a clarifying question?	22	2
201501	4678	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Would you continue to have the modifier “domestic economic activity” in paragraph 2 or not?	22	2
201501	4679	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I personally think that could go.	22	2
201501	4680	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, putting it in is saying something, because it’s not in now.	22	2
201501	4681	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Stan, do you view taking “domestic” out as part of the package?	22	2
201501	4682	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I didn’t view it as a package.	22	2
201501	4683	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	But now that you’ve raised the question, I think it could just as well leave it out.	22	2
201501	4684	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Okay.	22	2
201501	4685	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Did everybody understand what the alternative proposal is?	22	2
201501	4686	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	22	2
201501	4687	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Then, let’s begin our go-round with President Williams.	23	2
201501	4688	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	4689	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	I support alternative B, and I am going to comment briefly on the language regarding international developments in a moment.	23	2
201501	4690	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	The expansion is on a solid track, job growth has been especially rapid, and I now expect the unemployment rate to reach my estimate of the natural rate of 5.2 percent shortly after the middle of this year.	23	2
201501	4691	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, in view of the momentum in the economy, and the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, I see a very real possibility, or probability, that we will significantly overshoot full employment next year, even beyond what is already built into the Tealbook baseline.	23	2
201501	4692	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Overall, I view the risk to the outlook as balanced, and so in that regard I am one of the people who is concerned about the introduction of the new language in the FOMC statement saying that the foreign economic outlook has become somewhat more uncertain.	23	2
201501	4693	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Since that draft was initially circulated, the ECB has announced a very aggressive asset purchase program that, if anything, reduces uncertainty about the European growth outlook.	23	2
201501	4694	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	To my mind, it was a worry that the ECB would not take such a dramatic action that was one of the greatest risks to the foreign outlook.	23	2
201501	4695	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	To me, it would be ill-timed for us to introduce new language highlighting uncertainty about foreign developments on the heels of the ECB’s announcement.	23	2
201501	4696	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Some might misconstrue this statement as implicitly criticizing the ECB’s actions.	23	2
201501	4697	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Therefore, I do favor deleting the bracketed terms, both “domestic” and the “although” phrase, and I’m fully in support of Governor Fischer’s suggestion to put in “and international” between “financial” and “developments” in paragraph 3.	23	2
201501	4698	2015-01-28	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23	2
201501	4699	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201501	4700	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	23	2
201501	4701	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	4702	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	With your indulgence and despite the pressure of time, I’m not going to be as brief as some of you would like, in view of what I think is the importance of the issue before us.	23	2
201501	4703	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There is a building desire within the FOMC to lift the federal funds rate off the effective lower bound within the next few meetings, and in some sense this desire is quite understandable.	23	2
201501	4704	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Liftoff would be a clear signal to the world that the FOMC has, at long last, been successful in restoring the country to normal economic times.	23	2
201501	4705	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What better indicator of that normality than the strong, improving labor markets of 2014?	23	2
201501	4706	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We have a compelling narrative before us.	23	2
201501	4707	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Labor markets improve a lot, economic activity looks strong, and the FOMC is finally able to lift the federal funds rate off the effective lower bound.	23	2
201501	4708	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But there is a big hole in this narrative that focuses exclusively on real activity and ignores inflation and the developing significant risks to the credibility of our nominal anchor.	23	2
201501	4709	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As you will recall, Madam Chair, I dissented from the FOMC’s decisions at the past two meetings because of my concerns about the downside risk to inflation expectations, and the evolution of the data in the intermeeting period, especially the decline in market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation, have served to increase my concerns.	23	2
201501	4710	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	All told, the evidence points to financial market participants putting significant weight on a scenario in which inflation runs persistently below 2 percent for the next decade.	23	2
201501	4711	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And the charts that Thomas showed us, I think, are consistent with this description.	23	2
201501	4712	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This implicitly means that they believe that the FOMC is unwilling or unable to keep inflation at the 2 percent target over the coming decade.	23	2
201501	4713	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This slide in inflation expectations is not an accident that has happened in a vacuum.	23	2
201501	4714	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Since May 2013, through our actions and communications, we have gradually but systematically reduced the level of monetary accommodation.	23	2
201501	4715	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This firming of policy has taken place against a backdrop of persistently low inflation and a subdued outlook for inflation.	23	2
201501	4716	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Our actions have sent a clear, however inadvertent, message about our lack of willingness to defend our inflation target from below, and I believe that the recent behavior of financial market prices show that market participants have, indeed, received this message.	23	2
201501	4717	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, what is to be done?	23	2
201501	4718	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One possibility is to continue on our current path toward a June or September liftoff unless we have even more evidence that inflation expectations have currently shifted downwards.	23	2
201501	4719	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Again, this desire to wait, to continue on our path and wait for more evidence is entirely understandable.	23	2
201501	4720	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It allows us to continue with a very comforting back- to-normal narrative that I described earlier.	23	2
201501	4721	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Unfortunately, history tells us we do not have that luxury of waiting for more information.	23	2
201501	4722	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The experiences of Japan, Europe, and Sweden all suggest that if we wait for clear evidence, incontrovertible evidence, we will have waited too long.	23	2
201501	4723	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The whole point is that we need to avoid a trap of low inflation, low inflation expectations, and low interest rates that other countries have not been able to escape.	23	2
201501	4724	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We can’t wait to make sure that we’re actually stuck in this low inflation trap before deciding to act to try to escape it.	23	2
201501	4725	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We have to be proactive with this risk.	23	2
201501	4726	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We cannot be reactive.	23	2
201501	4727	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In my assessment, the next three or four meetings are likely to be critical ones.	23	2
201501	4728	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We need to send strong signals through actions and communications that we are determined to move inflation back to 2 percent in a timely fashion.	23	2
201501	4729	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of particulars, at a minimum I recommend that we commit to keeping the federal funds rate in its current range until the one-to-two-year-ahead outlook for inflation has returned to 2 percent and market-based measures of inflation compensation have normalized.	23	2
201501	4730	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The problem with this minimalist approach is that it may well be too passive.	23	2
201501	4731	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We should immediately begin exploring additional actions that we could take to deal with the risks that I’ve described.	23	2
201501	4732	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, putting the language in paragraph 3ʹ of alternative A into the FOMC statement would be a good starting point for the aggressive, proactive approach that I see as necessary.	23	2
201501	4733	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ve been emphasizing the benefits of a proactive approach.	23	2
201501	4734	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What are the costs of a proactive approach?	23	2
201501	4735	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There are two that I see.	23	2
201501	4736	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	First, we could create too many jobs relative to what is actually sustainable over the longer run so that U falls below U* and stays below U* for possibly a long time.	23	2
201501	4737	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We have debated whether such an outcome is actually costly, but I would like to think that whatever our view is about the size of these costs, we can agree that they are ones that we should be willing to bear if we’re to fulfill job one of a central bank, which is to keep inflation expectations well anchored.	23	2
201501	4738	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Second, there is the possibility that such accommodative policy could create macroeconomic risks through financial instability.	23	2
201501	4739	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The good news is that the QS report suggests there are few signs of such risk at this time.	23	2
201501	4740	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The one thing I don’t think we emphasize enough during our discussions is—that I think deserves attention—a permanently low inflation rate will create a permanently low level of nominal interest rates.	23	2
201501	4741	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we get stuck at 1.2 percent, that will translate into lower nominal interest rates forever.	23	2
201501	4742	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That is not good for financial stability.	23	2
201501	4743	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Madam Chair, I spent my Christmas vacation in a way I thought I should, reading FOMC transcripts.	23	2
201501	4744	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	23	2
201501	4745	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I went back to the late 1960s and actually read some of what President Williams was making reference to earlier.	23	2
201501	4746	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The transcripts are in some ways quite poignant.	23	2
201501	4747	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Chairman at the time was William McChesney Martin, one of the great figures in the history of this institution.	23	2
201501	4748	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But as he reached the end of his time as Chairman, he was painfully aware that future Committees would have to deal with, and I quote him, “an inflationary psychology that has resulted from the cumulative heritage of past failures of public policy.”	23	2
201501	4749	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As we look around the world in 2015, we see Martin’s accumulated heritage in country after country, but of course, it’s a low inflation psychology rather than the high inflation psychology to which he referred.	23	2
201501	4750	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We need to do all that we can to avoid creating that same kind of legacy for our own successors.	23	2
201501	4751	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	4752	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201501	4753	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	23	2
201501	4754	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you very much, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	4755	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B.	23	2
201501	4756	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	The real policy discussion of this meeting is whether we should drop the “patient” language in March in preparation for a June liftoff.	23	2
201501	4757	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Though I cannot rule out that wage and price data could support such a move in March, it seems rather unlikely from this vantage point.	23	2
201501	4758	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	We certainly have not seen the data to date that would make me comfortable with that decision.	23	2
201501	4759	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I am not at all confident that data on wages and prices are yet moving in a way that is consistent with attaining our 2 percent goal within two years.	23	2
201501	4760	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Just related to some previous conversation, I would also say that I am not confident that what we say is what the markets hear, and I do expect that when we drop the word “patient,” markets will be impatient and the tightening will have occurred.	23	2
201501	4761	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I don’t think we should fool ourselves that by changing the language we’re going to avoid a financial tightening at the time when the word “patient” is taken away.	23	2
201501	4762	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	In terms of the language related to the foreign economic outlook, I think we have to keep in mind why the ECB felt like they had to engage in quantitative easing.	23	2
201501	4763	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	They didn’t do it early.	23	2
201501	4764	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	They didn’t do it with alacrity.	23	2
201501	4765	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	They did it late, and they did it because conditions forced them to do so.	23	2
201501	4766	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think we should keep that in mind, as well as that we’ve had a Greek election.	23	2
201501	4767	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	That Greek election is likely to create a lot of instability over the next month and a half.	23	2
201501	4768	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think it’s going to come to the fore exactly when this meeting’s minutes come out.	23	2
201501	4769	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	In the context of oil prices low, inflation low, and a possible Greek exit, I think it is actually appropriate to say that there’s a great deal of foreign uncertainty at this time.	23	2
201501	4770	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would leave the language as written.	23	2
201501	4771	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	4772	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren, could you support the alternative if others prefer that?	23	2
201501	4773	2015-01-28	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would actually prefer what we have here.	23	2
201501	4774	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23	2
201501	4775	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	4776	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I support the policy decision in alternative B.	23	2
201501	4777	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	I also support removing the bracketed language in paragraph 2 and inserting “international” per Governor Fischer’s suggestion in paragraph 3.	23	2
201501	4778	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Otherwise I support the statement as written.	23	2
201501	4779	2015-01-28	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you.	23	2
201501	4780	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201501	4781	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23	2
201501	4782	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	4783	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I support alternative B today.	23	2
201501	4784	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	If the economy evolves as I anticipate, I believe it will be appropriate for us to life off relatively soon.	23	2
201501	4785	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	The language in alternative B is fine for today.	23	2
201501	4786	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I appreciate the changes that were made to the first draft.	23	2
201501	4787	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I, personally, would prefer not to make reference to the foreign economic outlook in paragraph 2 as it may be read as a comment on recent foreign central bank policy actions.	23	2
201501	4788	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I’m not actually sure how adding “international” to paragraph 3 will be read.	23	2
201501	4789	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	That gives me some pause, too.	23	2
201501	4790	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Will it be read as a response to criticism of how US policy affects emerging market economies?	23	2
201501	4791	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I don’t know.	23	2
201501	4792	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	My preference would have been to add something about foreign economic developments to paragraph 1 as a statement of fact, but that’s just my personal preference.	23	2
201501	4793	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	The staff memo provided a workable approach for how a statement could evolve as we approach and reach liftoff.	23	2
201501	4794	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	The memo I circulated tried to simplify the statement organization within the context of the staff’s suggested approach.	23	2
201501	4795	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	It did not presuppose when that language might be appropriate.	23	2
201501	4796	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	I do think the Committee is going to face a communications challenge whenever it decides it’s appropriate to leave the zero lower bound in the current environment of strong output growth and labor market momentum, but near-term measured inflation below goal.	23	2
201501	4797	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	But once we determine liftoff is appropriate, the challenge should not deter us.	23	2
201501	4798	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	As many have said, policy must be forward looking.	23	2
201501	4799	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	We will need to point to the forecast, explain why the forecast is reasonable, and explain why, conditional on the forecast, it’s appropriate to begin to reduce the extraordinary level of policy accommodation.	23	2
201501	4800	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	That said, that gives another reason that you may want to do this in a meeting for which you have SEPs, which is a press conference meeting as opposed to another meeting.	23	2
201501	4801	2015-01-28	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	4802	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201501	4803	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	23	2
201501	4804	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	4805	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Before I give my remarks on policy, I just want to indicate what a tremendous privilege it has been to be a part of this group and to serve on this Committee.	23	2
201501	4806	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	The seriousness and openness and high degree of professionalism exhibited by everyone that I’ve served with over the past eight and a half years has been both rewarding and enlightening.	23	2
201501	4807	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I view this service as the highlight of my professional career, and I will forever value both the experience and the friendships that I’ve made in the process.	23	2
201501	4808	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you.	23	2
201501	4809	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Let me turn now to my policy observations.	23	2
201501	4810	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I’d like to reiterate my belief that in view of the strength of economic activity, policy is overly accommodative at present and likely to remain so going forward.	23	2
201501	4811	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I think that accommodation will probably require a fairly aggressive policy rate path in the future, although I draw some comfort from the staff’s memo indicating the results of that kind of tightening are not expected to be severe.	23	2
201501	4812	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	But, as I indicated in my earlier comments, such a policy is not without some significant risks, and I weigh those risks as being somewhat more significant than some do.	23	2
201501	4813	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Although I remain concerned about the stance of policy, I find the apparent misinterpretation of our statement language by markets that some people referred to a couple of times today as very highly problematic and fraught with potential risks of heightened volatility, and perhaps destructive consequences.	23	2
201501	4814	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Communications problems seemed especially true in our previous statement.	23	2
201501	4815	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Our own interpretation and the market’s interpretation of that statement appear to be different.	23	2
201501	4816	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	On the basis of comments in our go-round at previous meetings, I interpreted various members as viewing the change in language of our December statement as inconsequential or status quo, and even some who thought it might be a bit more hawkish stressed the fact that there was no change in the message.	23	2
201501	4817	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Market participants, as reflected in the futures path, moved out their expectations of liftoff from June toward September.	23	2
201501	4818	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	That is, the forward curve flattened.	23	2
201501	4819	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	In light of the way language has evolved in our statement, the market’s interpretation appears to have been a reasonable one, but inconsistent with our SEP.	23	2
201501	4820	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	President Mester has pointed out that the statement has taken on the attributes of Hotel California, where words check in, but they have a very hard time checking out.	23	2
201501	4821	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	And I think that’s a very accurate description.	23	2
201501	4822	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	As market participants read our December statement as ruling out a first-quarter move and, in effect, ruling out any action before June, this, in effect, increased the probability that liftoff could easily be delayed even further to September or beyond.	23	2
201501	4823	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	To have our intentions misread in this way, I think, should concern us all, and we should think more critically and carefully about rewriting our statement in a more systematic and data-dependent way.	23	2
201501	4824	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I’ve argued this for some time.	23	2
201501	4825	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	President Williams, President Kocherlakota, and I, back in 2012, went through an exercise in which we proposed a different way of structuring and writing our statements, and we went so far as over a period of three meetings, I think, to actually rewrite the statement ex post to try to convey that.	23	2
201501	4826	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Our timing and circumstances turned out not to be very conducive to that exercise, but I think—with liftoff approaching—we have an opportunity to start afresh, and I would urge the Committee to seize that occasion to revamp the statement.	23	2
201501	4827	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	That is, it’s time to check out of Hotel California.	23	2
201501	4828	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Now, given the continued consistent strength in labor markets as well as broad-based growth of the economy, alternative C aligns better with my assessment of appropriate policy.	23	2
201501	4829	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Alternative B appears to indicate that June is the earliest possible date at which normalization would start, but I see it highly likely that the shift in the forward curve after our statement will be to push liftoff even further out.	23	2
201501	4830	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	More weight on September and less weight on June is likely to be the outcome of this statement.	23	2
201501	4831	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Finally, in the spirit of Hotel California, and in agreement with President Mester, I would caution us about adding the words “international concerns.”	23	2
201501	4832	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I actually agree with her that if you put something about international activity, putting it in in paragraph 1, in which we’re just stating facts about the state of the economy, rather than in paragraphs that refer to policy developments would be more appropriate.	23	2
201501	4833	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	After all, international developments are not always uniform, and once we put “international” in, we’re going to have a hard time getting it out.	23	2
201501	4834	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	I would caution us in that regard.	23	2
201501	4835	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Those are my comments.	23	2
201501	4836	2015-01-28	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	4837	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201501	4838	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23	2
201501	4839	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	4840	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I can support the alternative B for today.	23	2
201501	4841	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think we should be prepared to remove “patient” in March if necessary or in April if not in March.	23	2
201501	4842	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t think right now we have much of a strategy for the April case.	23	2
201501	4843	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think this quarterly system that we’re on is putting heavy pressure on, say, the March meeting, the June meeting.	23	2
201501	4844	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think all “factions” on the Committee want to get something done at that meeting.	23	2
201501	4845	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	They feel like if they can’t get it done they can’t trade it off against the next meeting.	23	2
201501	4846	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think that inhibits normal decisionmaking on the part of the Committee.	23	2
201501	4847	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	What we normally would do is trade off and say, “Well, we’re not going to do it today, but we’ll consider it more significantly next time when we have more data.”	23	2
201501	4848	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	So I think that’s distorting decisionmaking, and I’d be a champion of any efforts to get out of that dynamic.	23	2
201501	4849	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I do not think we should include the bracketed phrases referring to overseas conditions in the wake of a largely successful launch of ECB quantitative easing and sovereign debt.	23	2
201501	4850	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I think this is generally good news for the international economy.	23	2
201501	4851	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I do not wish the Committee to cast doubt on that.	23	2
201501	4852	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I also do not think that we should put in this “international developments” in paragraph 3.	23	2
201501	4853	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Because that’s the policy paragraph, I think it might be interpreted as a reference to the dollar.	23	2
201501	4854	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Historically, we have not wanted to do that.	23	2
201501	4855	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I know we’re operating on the fly here, but I would just recommend that for today we probably shouldn’t do that.	23	2
201501	4856	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with Presidents Plosser and Mester.	23	2
201501	4857	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I’m happy in future statements to put something in paragraph 1 that’s of a factual nature.	23	2
201501	4858	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	The thing about the dollar is we wanted to defer to Treasury policy, and it gets very sticky.	23	2
201501	4859	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I’m just not sure about that.	23	2
201501	4860	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	I would recommend against it for this meeting.	23	2
201501	4861	2015-01-28	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	4862	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23	2
201501	4863	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	4864	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	I can support alternative B today.	23	2
201501	4865	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	I agree with those that would like to drop the language in paragraph 2 around the foreign economic outlook, and I am indifferent, at this point, about the consequence of adding “international.”	23	2
201501	4866	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	I’ll leave that to others to decide.	23	2
201501	4867	2015-01-28	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	23	2
201501	4868	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201501	4869	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23	2
201501	4870	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	4871	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	As I discussed earlier, I believe that continued patience is called for.	23	2
201501	4872	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	We should continue to monitor developments, inflation developments, core inflation, wages, and market measures of inflation compensation.	23	2
201501	4873	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I share President Kocherlakota’s concerns about financial market prices regarding inflation compensation.	23	2
201501	4874	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Because alternative B continues the level of monetary accommodation while we monitor developments like these, I can support alternative B.	23	2
201501	4875	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I’m quite sympathetic to the suggested change in the bracketed language that Governor Fischer suggested.	23	2
201501	4876	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I kind of think the sentence in paragraph 3 in which we’ve chosen to place it is a “holding pattern” sentence.	23	2
201501	4877	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I take the point that it’s hard to get those things out, but that sentence is going to change radically once we finally start to move.	23	2
201501	4878	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	That one doesn’t worry me as much as President Bullard’s comment about the dollar.	23	2
201501	4879	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	It does seem that, in this context, it’s talking about inflation pressures and financial developments, and then we insert “international developments.”	23	2
201501	4880	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Gosh, that does sound like it might be inferred as meaning the dollar.	23	2
201501	4881	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I just raise that as a cautionary note in line with President Bullard.	23	2
201501	4882	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	4883	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201501	4884	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23	2
201501	4885	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	4886	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	My views on the most likely path of appropriate policy over coming meetings have not changed much since 11:00 am  I had December in there in my original draft.	23	2
201501	4887	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I think April might not be too soon for liftoff in the sense that if I had to put a probability on appropriate liftoff, it wouldn’t be zero for April, but I understand the argument of many that the difference between April and June isn’t as important as the path after liftoff.	23	2
201501	4888	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	As much as I’d enjoy seeing you conduct an additional press conference, Madam Chair, and I do support President Bullard’s suggestion, I don’t see one meeting as a reason to dissent.	23	2
201501	4889	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I can support removing “patient” from the statement right now.	23	2
201501	4890	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	But, absent convincing evidence that inflation expectations have become dislodged or that the real growth outlook is at heightened risk of deteriorating, I doubt very much that in March I’ll see any reason for assigning a zero probability to an appropriate liftoff in June.	23	2
201501	4891	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I doubt I’ll find it appropriate not to drop “patient” in March.	23	2
201501	4892	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Data could come in differently, but that’s how I feel.	23	2
201501	4893	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	It would constitute essentially pushing everything back until September, and I wouldn’t see a rationale for that unless data are very surprising.	23	2
201501	4894	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Regarding foreign economic outlook, I agree with Presidents Williams, Mester, Plosser, and Bullard, and I don’t support adding it to paragraph 2.	23	2
201501	4895	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	Paragraph 3 is the wrong place for it for reasons that others have said.	23	2
201501	4896	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	It’s about our policy assessment.	23	2
201501	4897	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I’d support adding it somehow in paragraph 1, but given the hour, I’d suggest we defer it.	23	2
201501	4898	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201501	4899	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23	2
201501	4900	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	4901	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I support the statement as written, except for moving the reference to international developments to paragraph 3.	23	2
201501	4902	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I’ve given a lecture on what we do about foreign developments, and I’ve told everybody we actually follow them closely and take them into account as they affect the domestic economy—always emphasized—and as relevant to our mandate.	23	2
201501	4903	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I think it’s kind of ridiculous not to put it in on the grounds that the Treasury makes decisions on the exchange rate.	23	2
201501	4904	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Well, good for them, but we look at what they do, and that’s all that this says.	23	2
201501	4905	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t see what the problem is in putting it in here.	23	2
201501	4906	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	The problem with putting it in paragraph 1, which is where I also tried, is we make a judgment on everything in paragraph 1.	23	2
201501	4907	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We say it’s either good or bad, it’s developing this way, it’s developing that way, and what would we have said on Europe?	23	2
201501	4908	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Taking note of recent decisions in Europe, we take heart from the situation.	23	2
201501	4909	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Well, we don’t comment on what other central banks do, and so that was what the problem was with putting it in paragraph 1.	23	2
201501	4910	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We can’t make a purely factual statement in paragraph 1.	23	2
201501	4911	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	At least I couldn’t find one, and I’m sure a lot of other people tried.	23	2
201501	4912	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We couldn’t find one that would be purely factual and didn’t seem to be making a judgment—it would be a favorable judgment, but once you start making judgments, you’re going to end up making judgments in the future.	23	2
201501	4913	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I didn’t find a way of doing it, and I think it’s very difficult to do it.	23	2
201501	4914	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	With this change, I support alternative B.	23	2
201501	4915	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I will not fall on my sword if we lose, but I think it belongs in there and I think it’s relevant.	23	2
201501	4916	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	As I listen to the morning news, the dollar and its effect on the United States is getting a lot of attention.	23	2
201501	4917	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I opened a newspaper that I happened to read, and it’s all over the front page.	23	2
201501	4918	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	We were the people, apparently, who didn’t notice any of this, because we don’t comment on these things.	23	2
201501	4919	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I don’t think that makes a lot of sense.	23	2
201501	4920	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I think we’ve got to put it in somewhere.	23	2
201501	4921	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Let me make one point of interest.	23	2
201501	4922	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	I find it ironic that the dual-mandate central bank finds the most useful description of its current behavior, which many people appear to want, to be that of an inflation targeter.	23	2
201501	4923	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	If you look at those simulations that people like, they’re ones which put all the weight on inflation in the utility function.	23	2
201501	4924	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	It’s interesting that it turns out to be that way today just because we always thought of inflation targeting as coming from the top and not from the bottom.	23	2
201501	4925	2015-01-28	meeting	FISCHER	Anyway, I support alternative B, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	4926	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201501	4927	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23	2
201501	4928	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	4929	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I support alternative B as well.	23	2
201501	4930	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to the language, I supported putting in something on foreign economic conditions a couple of meetings ago.	23	2
201501	4931	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I think it would have been a good idea then.	23	2
201501	4932	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think it’s a good idea now, for the reasons that John and Loretta have identified.	23	2
201501	4933	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	There’s too high a risk that it’s going to be read as a commentary on what the ECB did.	23	2
201501	4934	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I think they also make a good point about the insertion of “international” in paragraph 3.	23	2
201501	4935	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t feel nearly as strongly about that as the paragraph 2 language.	23	2
201501	4936	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I affirmatively support removing the paragraph 2 language.	23	2
201501	4937	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I’m indifferent as to whether “international” should be inserted into paragraph 3.	23	2
201501	4938	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	23	2
201501	4939	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23	2
201501	4940	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	4941	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I support alternative B.	23	2
201501	4942	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	On the international language, I would just point out that this sentence in paragraph 3 says that we “will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions,” which are real economy, and therefore, I think international developments fits in there without being obvious to me that there’s a link to the dollar there at all.	23	2
201501	4943	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I do think it kind of fits there and doesn’t do any harm, and it does add something.	23	2
201501	4944	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I would be happy to support it.	23	2
201501	4945	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	In terms of March, there is some probability, for me, that we will choose to go ahead in March and withdraw “patient.”	23	2
201501	4946	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	If we don’t, then I think there are two things worth doing.	23	2
201501	4947	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	The first is we should consider this idea of having regular press conferences—temporarily and on a nondiscretionary basis.	23	2
201501	4948	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I think the idea of calling a discretionary press conference at the last minute just doesn’t work, so I think that’s worth talking about.	23	2
201501	4949	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	I think there’s less in that for me than for others because I do think it would be ideal to link it to an SEP publication.	23	2
201501	4950	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	And it’s unlikely that the difference in timing is going to make much difference in the end.	23	2
201501	4951	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	The second thing I would say is, if we don’t lift off in March, in the next couple of meetings we ought to be thinking of ways to change, in the market’s mind, to something that gives the Committee more optionality over a period of time and, therefore, converts a certainty of liftoff in June into something far less than a certainty.	23	2
201501	4952	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	That would be a great contribution to our path, again assuming we don’t lift off in March.	23	2
201501	4953	2015-01-28	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	4954	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201501	4955	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23	2
201501	4956	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	4957	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I support alternative B.	23	2
201501	4958	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think it is appropriate to acknowledge that the recent data on real activity have been favorable, and so I think it’s appropriate to see the stronger description of the labor market and real activity.	23	2
201501	4959	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think the language on inflation compensation is very important, so I’m glad to see that it’s in there.	23	2
201501	4960	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	On this question of how to capture developments in the global economy, I think we have been following a very puzzling pattern of not talking about it in the statement and having the minutes do all the work.	23	2
201501	4961	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think that’s the wrong approach to be taking.	23	2
201501	4962	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	If you look at the forecasts, the amount of dollar appreciation and weakening of foreign economic growth that we have already seen have materially influenced our forecasts, both through core import prices and through net export channels.	23	2
201501	4963	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s substantial, it’s material, it’s persistent, and that’s even after this adjustment was made to reduce the multiplier.	23	2
201501	4964	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think, as Governor Fischer said, it does affect our assessment of conditions in the US economy.	23	2
201501	4965	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think we should try to capture it from that perspective.	23	2
201501	4966	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I also agree that we don’t want to suggest that uncertainty has increased somehow.	23	2
201501	4967	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think we could find a way of doing it in paragraph 2.	23	2
201501	4968	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Let me make a suggestion.	23	2
201501	4969	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	We could say, “While recognizing continued headwinds from the global economy.”	23	2
201501	4970	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	That doesn’t say anything about the ECB’s action.	23	2
201501	4971	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	It just recognizes the reality that we are facing continued headwinds from the global economy.	23	2
201501	4972	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I also think the Governor Fischer’s suggestion of a modification to the subsequent paragraph is appropriate.	23	2
201501	4973	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Again, I think it does affect our monetary policy deliberations, and I think I have as high sensitivities as anyone in this room as to how we work on international diplomacy surrounding exchange rates.	23	2
201501	4974	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	I think both modifications are very appropriately cautious and do not directly address the exchange rate, as I think we should not do.	23	2
201501	4975	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	23	2
201501	4976	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201501	4977	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	23	2
201501	4978	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	4979	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	People know where I stand on policy, and I’m not going to comment very much except for say that I, probably longer than anybody at this table, have been advocating that we take into account the effects of globalization on monetary policy.	23	2
201501	4980	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	In fact, we established, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, the Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute.	23	2
201501	4981	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Ben Bernanke announced it at a speech at Stanford University.	23	2
201501	4982	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Unfortunately, he got the wording wrong.	23	2
201501	4983	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Called it Globalization Institute on Monetary Policy, which gives us the acronym GIMPY, which I really don’t like.	23	2
201501	4984	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I’m quite sympathetic to Governor Fischer’s point.	23	2
201501	4985	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I would not have the bracketed language in paragraph 2.	23	2
201501	4986	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I would consider, or ask you to consider, his recommendation for paragraph 3, if it’s qualified by global circumstances as they affect the domestic economy.	23	2
201501	4987	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Yet, having said that, I think injecting it now might lead to some of the concerns that were raised by President Williams and others.	23	2
201501	4988	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I would just suggest you consider it.	23	2
201501	4989	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I don’t think it fits into paragraph 1.	23	2
201501	4990	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	The only place in which to put it is paragraph 3, if you put it there at all.	23	2
201501	4991	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	That’s my comment on alternative B.	23	2
201501	4992	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I want to say that I got here early today.	23	2
201501	4993	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I sat in this room by myself.	23	2
201501	4994	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	This is my last meeting.	23	2
201501	4995	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I took a selfie.	23	2
201501	4996	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	[Laughter]	23	2
201501	4997	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	On a Fed BlackBerry?	23	2
201501	4998	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Yes, on a Fed—well, these are the carrier pigeons of the modern age.	23	2
201501	4999	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	But they can take pictures, so I took a selfie.	23	2
201501	5000	2015-01-28	meeting	BRAINARD	Can we find it on Twitter?	23	2
201501	5001	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	No.	23	2
201501	5002	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I did share it with my children, however.	23	2
201501	5003	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I sent it to my children just simply to say what a great privilege it has been for a decade to sit at this table in this room with some of the most brilliant, earnest, devoted, articulate people I have had the pleasure of serving with in Washington.	23	2
201501	5004	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I have served in two Administrations before this.	23	2
201501	5005	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	This is the most civil and dignified forum in this city.	23	2
201501	5006	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	I just wanted to thank you all.	23	2
201501	5007	2015-01-28	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	5008	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23	2
201501	5009	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201501	5010	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B.	23	2
201501	5011	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	With inflation running well below our objective and the outlook abroad still very uncertain, it’s not time to signal that liftoff is likely at one of the next two meetings.	23	2
201501	5012	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of timing, I’m still inclined toward June rather than later, but my probabilities attached to June have slipped a bit, as the declines in both actual inflation and market-based measures of inflation compensation have become more significant.	23	2
201501	5013	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	In our public comments, though, I still would very much like to keep June on the table, because the gap between our own views and what is priced into markets is already quite large, and I don’t want that gap to grow any larger.	23	2
201501	5014	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m worried, basically, that there’s this very large gap and we’ll say, “Oh, we can’t move because the markets will react very, very violently.”	23	2
201501	5015	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s not a good situation to be in—one in which monetary policy is constrained because of our fears that financial market conditions will react too violently to what we do.	23	2
201501	5016	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we very much want to keep June on the table in terms of market expectations.	23	2
201501	5017	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the language, I’m happy to accept the suggested changes to paragraphs 2 and 3 on the international side.	23	2
201501	5018	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, let me just, as the Vice Chairman, say a few things about Richard Fisher and Charlie Plosser’s contributions to this Committee.	23	2
201501	5019	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it’s fair to say, speaking for myself, we didn’t always agree on everything.	23	2
201501	5020	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	But when we agreed, you were very worthy allies.	23	2
201501	5021	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	When we disagreed, you were very worthy opponents.	23	2
201501	5022	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I very much appreciate your contributions, as everyone else around this table does, to the Federal Reserve and your commitment to public service.	23	2
201501	5023	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that your willingness to test and challenge the conventional wisdom was very valuable, and I think it shows the value—this is something that Chairman Bernanke used to talk about a lot—of having a monetary policy set by a Committee, with individuals of diverse backgrounds and views.	23	2
201501	5024	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	I know that even when I didn’t agree with you at times, what you had to say made me think much harder, and very much contributed greatly to the quality and debate of this Committee.	23	2
201501	5025	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you both for your service.	23	2
201501	5026	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201501	5027	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think the issue we need to decide is how to deal with “international,” and we have two suggestions on the table.	23	2
201501	5028	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I’ll start with Governor Brainard’s; she suggests replacing the bracketed “although” with “while recognizing continued headwinds from the global economy.”	23	2
201501	5029	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let me ask if there is any support for that change as opposed to adding “international.”	23	2
201501	5030	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201501	5031	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I’m not seeing a broad range of support.	23	2
201501	5032	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I know it’s late in the day to be doing this.	23	2
201501	5033	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201501	5034	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Then, I think I’ve heard widespread support to get rid of the bracketed language in paragraph 2—so I propose doing that—and a diversity of views on whether to add “international” in paragraph 3.	23	2
201501	5035	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I think my own view on this is that foreign developments are playing a major role in our assessment of the economy.	23	2
201501	5036	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	It will be noticed.	23	2
201501	5037	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I’m not quite sure how it will be interpreted, but adding that word doesn’t involve taking a view on whether things are more or less uncertain.	23	2
201501	5038	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	There are a range of things we’re taking account of—oil prices, the dollar, the global economic outlook in different parts of the world, geopolitical developments.	23	2
201501	5039	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	It’s in a sentence that says our assessment of our progress takes into account a lot of different things.	23	2
201501	5040	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	To me, it’s relatively innocent and could stay there for a long time.	23	2
201501	5041	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	It’s not the kind of addition that puts us in a position of asking, “What do we do next time we have to modify it in some way?”	23	2
201501	5042	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	At least to my own mind, Governor Fischer’s suggestion is well within the acceptable range, but I certainly did hear concerns about adding anything at this point that would focus on international developments or be a change that we would be forced to live with.	23	2
201501	5043	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I guess what I’m going to do is ask for a show of hands.	23	2
201501	5044	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Who would be in favor of adding “international”?	23	2
201501	5045	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Madam Chair, you are in favor of it?	23	2
201501	5046	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I certainly would be supportive.	23	2
201501	5047	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Okay.	23	2
201501	5048	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Then, I will.	23	2
201501	5049	2015-01-28	meeting	EVANS	I’m willing to follow your advice.	23	2
201501	5050	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	Yes.	23	2
201501	5051	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	I feel the same way.	23	2
201501	5052	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201501	5053	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Can I see who would be opposed?	23	2
201501	5054	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	I wouldn’t dissent on it.	23	2
201501	5055	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	In case you’re wondering.	23	2
201501	5056	2015-01-28	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	23	2
201501	5057	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you for that.	23	2
201501	5058	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks for clarifying.	23	2
201501	5059	2015-01-28	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	23	2
201501	5060	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Let me propose, then, that we vote on alternative B with the bracketed language in paragraph 2 removed, and in 3, the words “and international” inserted before “developments.”	23	2
201501	5061	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	It would be “and readings on financial and international developments.”	23	2
201501	5062	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Matt?	23	2
201501	5063	2015-01-28	meeting	LUECKE	All right.	23	2
201501	5064	2015-01-28	meeting	LUECKE	This vote will be on alternative B, which is on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas’s handout, with the changes indicated by the Chair:  the addition in paragraph 3, and without the language in brackets in paragraph 2.	23	2
201501	5065	2015-01-28	meeting	LUECKE	It would also be on the directive for alternative B, as depicted on page 11 of Thomas’s briefing.	23	2
201501	5066	2015-01-28	meeting	LUECKE	Chair Yellen Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Brainard Yes President Evans Yes Governor Fischer Yes President Lacker Yes President Lockhart Yes Governor Powell Yes Governor Tarullo Yes President Williams Yes. 	23	2
201501	5067	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	1	1
201501	5068	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I guess all I need to tell you at this point is that we will meet next on Tuesday and Wednesday, March 17 and 18.	1	1
201501	5069	2015-01-28	meeting	TARULLO	St Patrick’s Day.	1	1
201501	5070	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I did know that.	1	1
201501	5071	2015-01-28	meeting	DUDLEY	Wear green.	1	1
201501	5072	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	1	1
201501	5073	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	I’ll do that.	1	1
201501	5074	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	We’re going to have a farewell luncheon for President Plosser in Dining Room E of the Martin Building.	1	1
201501	5075	2015-01-28	meeting	YELLEN	Everybody is invited, so we look forward to seeing you across the street.	1	1
